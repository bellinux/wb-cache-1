40|$|Objective: The {{relationship}} {{of nursing home}} (NH) discharges due to death to NH <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> and hospital <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> was examined. Method: Data on discharges came from the 1999 National Nursing Home Survey (N = 6, 335). County-level <b>bed</b> <b>supply,</b> controls for hospice agency supply, and a nursing facility’s percentage of area NH beds came from the Area Resource File. Multinomial logistic regression {{was used to compare}} deaths with live dis-charges. Marginal effects were calculated. Results: Discharges due to death increased with increasing NH <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> and decreased in areas with greater hospital <b>bed</b> <b>supply,</b> areas where hospitalizations were more likely. Hospice supply and a facility’s share of area NH beds also affected the probability of discharges due to death. Discussion: Supply factors appear related to dis-charge decisions in a manner affecting the probability of discharges due to death, although the magnitude of the relationship may be less than expected...|$|R

40|$|A model {{relating}} <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> {{and utilization}} {{is presented in}} the context of the match between need and service, which is controlled by the screening process that allows or denies access to beds. The conventional cost-minimization approach to certification of need, that of seeking to reduce inappropriate use, is contrasted with a service-delivery approach that seeks to promote appropriate use of facilities. The model expresses the quality of the screening process and the sensitivity and specificity of utilization in terms of <b>bed</b> <b>supply,</b> utilization, and need for service, which allows it to be used for needs assessment. The model is applied to data on supply and use of beds in Massachusetts skilled nursing facilities, with screening quality estimated by Monte Carlo methods; the results suggest that need and <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> are positively associated and that the regional variation in skilled-nursing beds in Massachusetts may reflect real variations in need...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{hypothesis}} that myocardial contrast echocardiography {{could be used}} to simultaneously assess coronary blood flow reserve {{and the size of the}} perfusion <b>bed</b> <b>supplied</b> by a coronary artery was examined in nine patients and six dogs. All patients were undergoing cardiac catheterization and had single vessel coronary artery disease (≥ 85 % stenosis of either the proximal left anterior descending or the left circumflex coronary artery); the six dogs had a critical stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery. Three milliliters of sonicated Renografin- 76 (mean microbubble size 6 μm) was injected into the left main coronary artery before and after intracoronary administration of papavarine, 6 to 9 mg. The <b>beds</b> <b>supplied</b> by the normal and stenotic vessels could not be differentiated during contrast echocardiography before injection of papavarine. However, after papavarine, the normal vascular bed showed significantly more contrast enhancement than did the <b>bed</b> <b>supplied</b> by the stenotic artery. This disparity in contrast enhancement made it possible to delineate the size of the bed perfused by the stenotic vessels. When quantitative analysis of the time-intensity curves obtained from the echocardiograms was performed in the dogs, the absolute values for the area under the curve, peak contrast intensity and curve width did not correlate with absolute blood flows measured with radiolabeled microspheres. However, the ratios of the areas under the curves derived from the two vascular beds before and after papavarine correlated well with the ratios of blood flows between the two beds during the same stages (r 2 = 0. 73 by linear regression and r 2 = 0. 85 by an exponential function). In comparison, the ratios of peak amplitudes and curve widths before and after papavarine had poor correlations with ratios of flows from the two beds (r 2 = 0. 18 and 0. 02, respectively). In conclusion, myochardial contrast echocardiograpgy can be used to simultaneously assess coronary blood flow reserve and the size of the perfusion <b>bed</b> <b>supplied</b> by a stenotic vessel...|$|R

40|$|In Europe, the {{reduction}} of acute care hospital beds {{has been one of}} the measures implemented to restrict hospital expenditure. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the effect bed reductions have on the use of the remaining beds within different healthcare systems. We concentrated on two healthcare system elements: hospital financing system (per diem and global budget systems) and physician remuneration system (fee-for-service and salary systems). We also controlled for technological development and demand for healthcare. We used data from the OECD health data files of 10 North-Western European countries on hospital <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> and use. The hospital bed indicators used were occupancy rate, average length of stay and admission rate. The data were analysed with multilevel analysis.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} variations in Medicare expenditures across states.

RESULTS: Variation in Medicare expenditures across states is driven more by average number of service users per 1000 enrollees and average service units per user than by average payment per service unit. Medicare expenditures per enrollee by state are primarily a function of Medicare HMO penetration rate (P =. 000), urban area (P =. 001), hospital <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> (P =. 005), elderly mortality rate (P =. 012), Medicare physician assignment rate (P =. 026), percentage of primary care practitioners (P =. 042), and interactions between urban elderly and percentage of primary care physicians (P =. 005) and Black elderly and nursing home <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> (P =. 012).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of hospital service areas (HSAs) using small area analysis has been useful in examining variation in medical and surgical care; however, {{the techniques of}} small area analysis are underdeveloped in understanding psychiatric admission rates. We sought to develop these techniques {{in order to understand}} the relationship between psychiatric <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> and admission rates in Northern New England. Our primary hypotheses were that there would be substantial variation in psychiatric admission across geographic settings and that bed availability would be positively correlated with admission rates, reflecting a supplier-induced demand phenomenon. Our secondary hypothesis was that the construction of psychiatric HSAs (PHSAs) would yield more meaningful results than the use of existing general medical hospital service areas. Methods To address our hypotheses, we followed a four-step analytic process: 1) we used small area analytic techniques to define our PHSAs, 2) we calculated the localization index for PHSAs and compared that to the localization index for general medical HSAs, 3) we used the number of psychiatric hospital beds, the number of psychiatric admissions, and census data to calculate population-based bed-supply and psychiatric admission rates for each PHSA, and 4) we correlated population-based admission rates to population-based psychiatric <b>bed</b> <b>supply.</b> Results The admission rate for psychiatric diagnosis varied considerably among the PHSAs, with rates varying from 2. 4 per 100, 000 in Portsmouth, NH to 13. 4 per 100, 000 in Augusta, ME. There was a positive correlation of 0. 71 between a PHSA's <b>supply</b> of <b>beds</b> and admission rate. Using our PSHAs produced a substantially higher localization index than using general medical hospital services areas (0. 69 vs. 0. 23), meaning that our model correctly predicted geographic utilization at three times the rate of the existing model. Conclusions The positive correlation between admission and <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> suggests that psychiatric bed availability may partially explain the variation in admission rates. Development of PHSAs, rather than relying on the use of established general medical HSAs, improves the relevance and accuracy of small area analysis in understanding mental health services utilization. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is a {{so-called}} ambulatory care sensitive condition. It {{is assumed that}} by appropriate and timely primary care, hospital admissions for complications of such conditions can be avoided. This study examines whether differences between countries in diabetes-related hospitalization rates {{can be attributed to}} differences in the organization of primary care in these countries. DESIGN: Data on characteristics of primary care systems were obtained from the QUALICOPC study that includes surveys held among general practitioners and their patients in 34 countries. Data on avoidable hospitalizations were obtained from the OECD Health Care Quality Indicator project. Negative binomial regressions were carried out to investigate the association between characteristics of primary care and diabetes-related hospitalizations. SETTING: A total of 23 countries. SUBJECTS: General practitioners and patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diabetes-related avoidable hospitalizations. RESULTS: Continuity of care was associated with lower rates of diabetes-related hospitalization. Broader task profiles for general practitioners and more medical equipment in general practice were associated with higher rates of admissions for uncontrolled diabetes. Countries where patients perceive better access to care had higher rates of hospital admissions for long-term diabetes complications. There was no association between disease management programmes and rates of diabetes-related hospitalization. Hospital <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> was strongly associated with admission rates for uncontrolled diabetes and long-term complications. CONCLUSIONS: Countries with elements of strong primary care do not necessarily have lower rates of diabetes-related hospitalizations. Hospital <b>bed</b> <b>supply</b> appeared to be a very important factor in this relationship. Apparently, it takes more than strong primary care to avoid hospitalizations.
