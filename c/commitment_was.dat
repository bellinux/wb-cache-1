The agreement required that the facility seat a minimum of 17,000 people, and established the term of the lease at 30 years for a minimal $1 per year. The agreement also contained a clause governing land: If the cost of land acquisition rose above $150 million, D.C. United was required to reimburse the city 50 percent of the excess (although the club's <b>commitment</b> <b>was</b> capped at $10 million). The club was also barred from playing more than an occasional home game away from the Buzzard Point stadium, prohibiting the team from relocating during the term of the lease. Mayor Bowser then submitted the agreement, as well as land purchase agreements and a revised developer agreement, to the City Council for approval; the council approved the land purchase agreements on June 30, 2015.|$|E

This workshop assumes that the supply management professional will be faced with this problem at times.

Lack of top management <b>commitment</b> <b>is</b> one of the most often cited causes of failure in improvement programs (Brown, Hitchcock, and Willard, 1994). <b>Commitment</b> <b>is</b> also usually prescribed for supplier relations success. However, the supply management professional will often be confronted with less <b>commitment</b> than <b>is</b> desired, whether the missing <b>commitment</b> <b>is</b> {{on the part of the}} buyer’s organization, the supplier’s, or both.

5|$|During late 1990 {{and early}} 1991 the Australian {{government}} considered deploying F-111Cs {{to expand the}} Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, which mainly comprised a Royal Australian Navy task group. The Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (DFAT) preferred option if the government decided to expand Australia's <b>commitment</b> <b>was</b> to deploy at least two RF-111s, though these aircraft would need to have their electronic warfare equipment upgraded to operate in this war zone. Due to {{the small size of}} the RF-111 force, the loss of any of these aircraft in combat would have inflicted a heavy blow on Australia's reconnaissance capability. The second preference in the advice put to the government was to deploy a squadron of four to eight F-111Cs, though Defence did not support this. In the event, the government decided to not expand the Australian force. As a result, the F-111Cs' contribution to the war was limited to conducting intensive exercises with the Naval ships as they sailed through Australian waters en route to the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|In April 1950, the British {{government}} requested Australia's {{assistance to}} combat communist insurgents during the Malayan Emergency. In response, the Australian Defence Committee {{determined that it}} was possible to commit a squadron of eight Douglas C-47 Dakota transports and a flight of four to six Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. The Federal government formally announced the decision to send the Dakotas soon afterwards; in late June, it confirmed the allocation of six Lincolns. No.1 (Bomber) Squadron, operating the Lincolns, would be detached from the control of No.82 Wing at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, and be based at Tengah airfield in the west of Singapore. No.38 (Transport) Squadron, operating Dakotas, would be detached from No.86 Wing at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and be based at Changi, in Singapore's east. The transport <b>commitment</b> <b>was</b> rendered possible by the recent return of ten Australian Dakota crews from service during the Berlin Airlift.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{relocated}} from Kuala Lumpur to {{its former}} base at Changi in February 1952. As the year progressed, RAAF transport priorities altered owing to the increasing demands of the Korean War, and the Malayan <b>commitment</b> <b>was</b> no longer considered sustainable. Having airlifted more than 17,000 passengers and almost 1,900 tonnes of cargo, dropped some 750 tonnes of supplies and evacuated over 300 injured troops, No.38 Squadron departed for Australia on 8December and rejoined No.86 Wing at Richmond three days later. Following this withdrawal, No.90 Wing was disbanded at Changi, and No.1 Squadron became the only Australian flying unit in Malaya. It continued the bombing campaign against the communists until it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, having flown almost 4,000 sorties in its eight years of operation and dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs—85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency. No.1 Squadron was relieved by No.2 Squadron, operating English Electric Canberra jet bombers out of Butterworth in north-west Malaya.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{organisational}} <b>commitment</b> <b>is</b> {{also one of}} the crucial dimensions in the success of any organisation. Mathieu and Zajac (1990) observed that <b>commitment</b> <b>is</b> an attitude reflecting the nature and quality of the linkage between an employee and the organisation. Organisational <b>commitment</b> <b>is</b> the psychological attachment that individuals develop toward an organisation (Fiorito et al., 2007; Wright & Kehoe, 2007). Raza and Nawaz (2011) highlighted that organisational <b>commitment</b> <b>is</b> stated as the attachment or bonding that individuals form to their employing organisations. In an another scholarly article, Eslami and Gharakhani (2012) opined commitment as a format that seeks to explain consistencies involving attitudes, values, behaviour and involves behavioural choices and implies a negative response of possible alternative courses of action.|$|R

5|$|In 1953, Howard Thurman {{became the}} Dean of the Boston University School of Theology and, {{after ten years}} in California, the couple moved to Boston. The move was {{prompted}} {{by the desire to}} share their ideas of outreach and inclusion in a university setting, though they were aware that the arrival of the first black pastor in a white university would lead to difficulties. From the beginning, Thurman tried to create an inclusive environment, organizing monthly dinners for the Marsh Chapel Choir members and their friends. Shortly after they arrived, a Japanese student committed suicide leaving a note that she had no friends. Not only was she not known well at the university, finding her family to notify them was difficult. In response, Thurman organized the International Student Hostess Committee to keep international students from feeling isolated. By 1965, the committee was serving 500 international students at Boston University. The Thurmans were at times criticized by those who felt they should be visibly active in the Civil Rights Movement, but they believed their <b>commitment</b> <b>was</b> to addressing the spiritual needs of those who were visible, rather than participating in marches, protests and demonstrations. Among the papers of MLK were many letters from people such as Homer A. Jack, who co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality; Lillian Smith, author of the novel Strange Fruit; Glenn E. Smiley, national field secretary of Fellowship of Reconciliation, as well as King's own acknowledgement, which credited their spiritual guidance.|$|E

The quality of the service process has an indirect effect on affective <b>commitment,</b> as it <b>is</b> related to satisfaction.
