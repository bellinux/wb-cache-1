40|$|The {{repeated}} administration of various drugs of abuse {{may lead to}} a gradually increased behavioural response to these substances, particularly an increase in locomotion and stereotypies may occur. This phenomenon is well known and described as behavioural sensitisation. An increased response to the drug tested, elicited by previous {{repeated administration}} of another drug is recognised as <b>cross-sensitisation.</b> Based on our earlier experiences with studies on mice, which confirmed sensitisation to methamphetamine and described <b>cross-sensitisation</b> to methamphetamine after pre-treatment with cannabinoid CB 1 receptor agonist, we focused the present study on the use of another typical laboratory animal- the rat. A biological validity of the sensitisation phenomenon was expected to be enhanced if the results of both mouse and rat studies were conformable. Similar investigation in rats brought very similar results to those described earlier in mice. However, at least some interspecies differences were noted in the rat susceptibility to the development of sensitisation to methamphetamine effects. Comparing to mice, it was more demanding to titrate a dose of methamphetamine producing behavioural sensitisation.

40|$|The {{recreational}} use of 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy') {{is increasing}} in New Zealand. MDMA is a ring-substituted derivative of AMPH and, similar to AMPH, produces hyperactivity upon administration. However, the behavioural profile of hyperlocomotion produced by MDMA {{differs from that}} produced by AMPH, suggesting that different neural mechanisms underlie the behavioural response. The repeated administration of both MDMA and AMPH induces sensitised hyperactive responses that have recently {{been found to be}} different. In the present study, MDMA- and AMPH-induced centre and periphery hyperactivity were compared to investigate the neuroadaptations produced by repeated exposure to the two drugs. Rats were pre-treated with saline, MDMA, or AMPH and the acute response to MDMA, AMPH, or the D 1 agonist, SKF- 81297 was measured to determine whether <b>cross-sensitisation</b> was produced. Repeated administration of MDMA and AMPH produced similar behavioural profiles. However, <b>cross-sensitisation</b> between the two drugs was uni-directional, suggesting that the two produce different neuroadaptations.

40|$|Atomoxetine (ATX) is a {{commonly}} used non-stimulant treatment for Attention {{deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD). It primarily acts to increase noradrenalin levels; however, at higher doses it can increase dopamine levels. To date {{there has been no}} investigations into the effects of orally-administered ATX in the most commonly used model of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the effects of doses thought to be selective (0. 15 mg/kg) and non-selective (0. 3 mg/kg) for noradrenalin on behavioural measures in the SHR. Firstly, we examined the effects of acute and chronic ATX on locomotor activity including sensitisation and <b>cross-sensitisation</b> to amphetamine. Secondly, we measured drug effects on impulsivity using a T-maze delay discounting paradigm. We found no effect of ATX on locomotor activity and no evidence for sensitisation or <b>cross-sensitisation.</b> Furthermore, there were no differences in T-maze performance, indicating no effects on impulsivity at these doses. The absence of behavioural sensitisation supports previous claims of superior safety relative to psychostimulants for the doses administered. There was also no effect on impulsivity; however, we suggest that was confounded by stress specific to SHRs. Implications for future studies, behavioural assessment of SHRs and their use as a model of ADHD are discussed. ...|$|E

Materials and methods [...] 3. Results [...] 4. Discussion. The ease in accessibility to sugar-rich products {{has contributed to}} {{a dramatic increase in}} the consumption of sugar among the adolescent population. Likewise, due to its reinforcing properties, methamphetamine (METH) abuse and its associated mental health problems are another global burden. Both sugar and METH elicit their effects on similar neuronal systems, primarily the mesolimbic dopaminergic system which regulates the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the brain. This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic sugar consumption during adolescence on METH-induced locomotor activity in adulthood and associated changes to protein levels in the NAc of rats. Following 4 weeks of chronic sugar or water exposure, and a 6 week treatment-free period, rats were challenged with METH or vehicle and their locomotor behaviour measured. Following 24 hours, changes in protein levels in the NAc were identified using a proteomic approach. In comparison to the controls treated with water and challenged with saline (Water/Saline), the Water/METH group demonstrated significantly greater locomotor activation (p < 0. 05). Providing support for behavioural <b>cross-sensitisation,</b> the Sugar/METH condition significantly demonstrated greater locomotor activity compared to the Water/METH condition (p < 0. 05). Proteomic analyses revealed that a total of 93 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the NAc of the Water/METH rats compared to controls. These proteins were mainly involved in coordinating mitochondrial functioning and neuronal morphology. In comparison to the Water/METH animals, the Sugar/METH animals demonstrated significant changes to a total of 102 proteins that were mainly involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic plasticity. Proteomic analyses identified a total of 74 differentially expressed proteins in the Sugar/METH condition compared to controls which were mainly critical in regulating cellular processes and molecular transport.

40|$|Allergic {{cross-reactivity}} is an important epidemiological {{issue in}} all age groups. It is caused by a non-specific binding of both primary allergen as well as allergens causing secondary cross-reactivity {{by the same}} IgE antibodies. This phenomenon results from the similarity of the molecular structure of allergen epitopes and leads to a number of allergic cross-reactivity syndromes, such as pollen-food syndromes, pork-cat syndrome or latex-fruit syndrome. They are characterized by rich symptomatology and the possible occurrence of symptoms related to various systems, including life-threatening systemic reactions. In many cases, specific allergen groups responsible for certain cross-reactions, such as plant profilins, fish parvalbumins or invertebrate tropomyosins, have been identified. Also, some of the factors affecting the spatial conformation of allergens, and thus modifying their allergenic potential, have been identified. Despite all these achievements, the diagnostics of cross reactivity syndromes still remains difficult due to the limited available methods and the possible occurrence of overlapping phenomena such as co-sensitisation, asymptomatic <b>cross-sensitisation</b> or IgE-independent or nonimmunological adverse drug reactions. Therefore, careful management based on medical history as well as avoidance of unjustified treatment methods, e. g. diet therapy or immunotherapy, are necessary. This is of great importance as the incidence of food allergies is expected to increase mainly due to the progressive rise in the prevalence of inhalant allergies to pollens...|$|E
40|$|The {{few cases}} of food allergy to fig {{reported}} to date, whose main manifestations were anaphylactic reactions, have {{been related to}} a <b>cross-sensitisation</b> to weeping fig (Ficus benjamina) or to the 'latex-fruit syndrome'. Here we report on two cases of the oral allergy syndrome (OAS) to fig in patients whose main allergic manifestations were related to sensitisation to grass and birch pollens. The patients were characterised by clinical history, skin prick tests (SPT) with commercial and in-house extracts, prick-by-prick test, specific IgE measurements and challenge tests. PBS-soluble and insoluble extracts of both fig skin and pulp were examined {{for the presence of}} potential allergens by IgE immunoblotting. Both patients showed OAS followed by respiratory symptoms when challenged with fig. They were negative in both specific IgE detection and SPT with commercial extracts of fig and many other plant materials, including F. benjamina and Hevea Brasiliensis, while grass and birch pollens gave positive results. Prick-by-prick tests and SPT with in-house extracts indicated that the fig skin had a much higher allergenicity than the pulp. Despite negative IgE detection by the CAP assay, immunoblotting experiments showed that potential fig allergens were PBS-soluble and present only in the skin of the fruit. OAS to fig followed by respiratory symptoms can be present in patients not sensitised to weeping fig or having the latex-fruit syndrome. Different parts of the fig can have different allergenicities, the most important allergens being proteins related to the skin of the fruit.

40|$|Study of the {{function}} of epitopes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens contributed significantly toward {{better understanding of the}} immunopathogenesis and to efforts for improving infection and disease control. Characterization of genetically permissively presented immunodominant epitopes has implications for the evolution of the host-parasite relationship, development of immunodiagnostic tests and subunit prophylactic vaccines. Knowledge of the determinants of <b>cross-sensitisation,</b> relevant to other pathogenic or environmental mycobacteria and to host constituents has advanced. Epitope defined IFNγ assay kits became established for the specific detection of infection with tubercle bacilli both in humans and cattle. The CD 4 T cell epitope repertoire was found to be more narrow in patients with active disease than in latently infected subjects. However, differential diagnosis of active TB could not be made reliably merely on the basis of epitope recognition. The mechanisms by which HLA polymorphism can influence the development of multibacillary tuberculosis need further analysis of epitopes, recognised by Th 2 helper cells for B cell responses. Future vaccine development would benefit from better definition of protective epitopes and from improved construction and formulation of subunits with enhanced immunogenicity. Epitope defined serology, due to its operational advantages is suitable for active case finding in selected high disease incidence populations, aiming for an early detection of infectious cases and hence for reducing the transmission of infection. The existing knowledge of HLA class I binding epitopes could be the basis for the construction of T cell receptor like ligands for immunotherapeutic application.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of chronic exposure to D 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on heroin-induced locomotor sensitisation and Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR). Adult male albino Wistar rats (nZ 60) were injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) 21 times with vehicle, 0. 05, 0. 5, or 5. 0 mg/kg THC (once every 48 h for 41 days). Locomotor activity was assessed for 180 min on pre-exposure days 1, 21, and 41. Following a 2 -week washout period, rats were divided into five equal groups (nZ 12) and injected subcutaneously (s. c.) with vehicle or heroin (0. 5 mg/kg). Locomotor activity was recorded for 240 min. In drug-naı̈ve rats, heroin significantly increased locomotor activity. THC pre-exposure further increased heroin-induced locomotion. After an interval of 2 weeks, rats pre-exposed to vehicle and 5. 0 mg/kg THC {{in the first part}} of the experiment were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (nZ 6) and injected s. c. with vehicle or 0. 5 mg/kg heroin and perfused 2 h later. Fos-IR was examined in several brain regions. Acute heroin increased Fos-IR in drug-naı̈ve rats in the caudate-putamen (CPu; central, medial and dorsomedial regions), nucleus accumbens (NAC; core and shell regions), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), lateral septum, central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), periaqueductal grey (PAG; dorsolateral, dorsomedial, and lateral), and the EdingereWestphal nucleus. Pre-exposure to THC significantly increased heroin-induced Fos-IR in the dorsomedial CPu and the NAC (core). Conversely, THC pre-exposure reduced heroin-induced Fos-IR in the BNST, CEA, and the PAG (dorsolateral and lateral). The present study demonstrates that THC pre-exposure increases the locomotor stimulating effects of heroin and provides new evidence for the neural correlates that may underlie cannabinoid and opioid <b>cross-sensitisation...</b>|$|E

We performed a prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study of the effects of nonselective ??-blockade with timolol on ??-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptor mediated responses in normal subjects. We also wished to study the time course of ?? 1 - and ?? 2 -adrenergic responses after withdrawal of timolol. Methods Six healthy males received timolol 10 mg twice daily or placebo for 14 days. On day 11 of treatment, vascular ?? 1 -, ?? 2 - and angiotensin II receptor responses were assessed by measuring the blood pressure increases in response to intravenous phenylephrine, ??-methylnoradrenaline and angiotensin amide respectively, following one dose of timolol 10 mg (to block the ??-adrenergic effects of phenylephrine and ??-methylnoradrenaline). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased in response to each of these drugs, but these increases were not different on timolol treatment or placebo. Following cessation of treatment with timolol or placebo, ?? 1 - and ?? 2 -adrenoceptor mediated responses were assessed by measuring the heart rate responses to treadmill exercise and intravenous salbutamol infusion respectively. Half each of the subjects underwent this 2 days and 3 days respectively, after the end of treatment. Results Both exercise-induced and salbutamol-induced tachycardia were not different following placebo or 3 days following the end of timolol treatment. However, 2 days following timolol treatment, both were attenuated; the reduction in salbutamol-induced tachycardia was significant, whilst the reduction in exercise tachycardia did not reach statistical significance. We also measured metabolic responses to exercise and to salbutamol infusion. Exercise induced a rise in plasma potassium and noradrenaline. Salbutamol produced a fall in plasma potassium, a rise in plasma glucose and insulin and also a rise in plasma noradrenaline. All of these changes were not different following placebo or 3 days after the end of timolol treatment; by contrast, 2 days following timolol treatment, all were significantly attenuated, {{with the exception of the}} rise in plasma glucose. In addition, the rise in both plasma glucose and insulin in response to an oral load of 75 g glucose were not different post-placebo, 2 or 3 days post-timolol. Conclusions These results show that, following 14 days of nonselective ??-adrenoceptor blockade with timolol, there is evidence of residual ??-adrenoceptor blockade 2 days after drug withdrawal; this finding is in contrast with the known plasma profile of timolol (half-life 3 ??? 6 hours), but is consistent with our previous observations of the slow speeds of association and dissociation of timolol with ??-adrenoceptors in vitro. There is no evidence, in this study, of ??-adrenergic sensitisation following timolol withdrawal, nor of cross-regulation of vascular ?? 1 -, ?? 2 - or angiotensin II receptors in response to nonselective ??-adrenoceptor blockade...|$|E
40|$|Under certain regimens of {{repeated}} pre-exposure, psychostimulant drugs show {{an increase in}} locomotor activity across days of testing and, after abstinence from the drug, a greater responsiveness to a subsequent challenge dose of the drug. This phenomenon, termed behavioural sensitisation, is thought to underlie certain aspects of drug addiction such as drug seeking and relapse. Repeated administration of +/- 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) produced sensitised hyperactivity in rats suggesting a lasting neurological change. The present studies sought to evaluate some of the parameters around both the induction and expression of behavioural sensitisation to MDMA and to evaluate if {{the sensitivity of the}} dopamine (DA) D 1 and D 2 receptors had altered under the current pre-exposure regimen of MDMA. Further, following MDMA pre-exposure that results n behavioural sensitisation, changes in potency to the reinforcing effects of MDMA were investigated through the self administration paradigm. Finally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to evaluate changes in brain amine levels following sensitisation to MDMA locomotor activating effects. Rats received a pre-treatment regimen consisting of 5 daily injections of MDMA (0. 0, 5. 0 or 10 mg/kg i. p). MDMA-produced locomotor activity was measured after 2, 9 or 28 days of withdrawal. In other groups, hyperactivity following administration the DA D 1 agonist SKF 81297 (0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0 or 8. 0 mg/kg), or the D 2 -like DA agonist apomorphine (0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 or 4. 0 mg/kg) was measured in groups that received pre-exposure to MDMA (10. 0 4 mg/kg) or vehicle. The effects of the D 1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0. 0, 0. 01, 0. 02, or 0. 04 mg/kg), the D 2 antagonist eticlopride (0. 03, 0. 01, 0. 003, 0. 05, 0. 1, or 0. 2 mg/kg) or the 5 -HT 2 C antagonist RS 102221 (0. 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, or 1. 0 mg/kg) on MDMA-produced hyperactivity in MDMA or vehicle pre-treated rats was also measured. In Experiment 3, effects of MDMA or vehicle pre-treatment on latency to acquisition of MDMA (0. 5 or 1. 0 mg/kg/infusion) selfadministration was measured. In Experiment 4 effects of pre-treatment on brain tissue levels of DA, its metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA), serotonin (5 -HT) and its metabolite, 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) were determined. The regimen of 5 daily treatments of 10. 0 mg/kg produced persistent behavioural sensitisation and <b>cross-sensitisation</b> to hyperactivity produced by DA receptor agonists. These effects were not, however, reflected in sensitised responses to the ability of the antagonists to attenuate MDMA-produced hyperactivity. Pre-treatment with MDMA did not decrease latency to acquisition of self-administration. Rather, there was an increased latency to acquisition of self-administration in the MDMA pre-treated rats. MDMA pretreatment decreased levels of the serotonin metabolite 5 -HIAA in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Following the current pre-treatment regimen, MDMA produced behavioural sensitisation is mediated by neuroadaptations in central dopaminergic substrates. The persistent locomotor sensitisation is similar to that produced by other amphetamine-like stimulants and might underlie use and abuse of this compound...|$|E
40|$|ADHD {{pharmacotherapy}} uses methylphenidate (MPH), D-amphetamine (D- amph), two psychostimulants targeting dopamine transporters, or atomoxetine (ATX), specifically targeting norepinephrine transporters. We have {{assessed the}} pharmacological mechanisms {{of these three}} drugs on the in vitro efflux of neurotransmitters in rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatal slices {{as well as on}} the in vivo electrical activities of PFC pyramidal neurons, striatal medium spiny neurons, ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons or dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neurons, using single cell extracellular electrophysiological recording techniques. We have also tested whether chronic methylphenidate treatment, during either adolescence or adulthood, could have long-lasting consequences on body growth, depression and neuronal functions. Release experiments showed that all ADHD drugs induce dose-dependent dopamine efflux in both the PFC and striatum, with different efficacies, while only D- amph induced cortical norepinephrine efflux. Atomoxetine induced an unexpected massive dopamine outflow in striatal regions, by mechanisms that depend on physiological parameters. Our electrophysiological studies indicate that all three drugs equally stimulate the excitability of PFC pyramidal neurons, in basal and NMDA-evoked conditions, when administered acutely (3 mg/kg). While the electrophysiological effects elicited by psychostimulants may be dependent on D 1 receptor activation, those induced by atomoxetine relied on different mechanisms. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), methylphenidate (2 mg/kg), but not atomoxetine, induced firing and burst activity reductions, through dopamine D 2 autoreceptor activation. Reversal of such effects (eticlopride 0. 2 mg/kg) revealed an excitatory effect of methylphenidate on midbrain dopamine neurons that appear to be dependent on glutamate pathways and the combination of D 1 and alpha- 1 receptors. Finally, acute intraperitoneal psychostimulant injections increased vertical locomotor activity as well as NMDA 2 B protein expression in the striatum. Some animals chronically treated with intraperitoneal administrations (methylphenidate 4 mg/kg/day or saline 1. 2 ml/kg/day) showed decreased body weight gain. Voluntary oral methylphenidate intake induces desensitisation to subsequent intravenous methylphenidate challenges, without altering dopamine D 2 receptor plasticity. Significant decreases in striatal NMDA 2 B protein expression were observed in animals chronically treated. After adolescent MPH treatment, midbrain dopaminergic neurons do not display either desensitisation or sensitisation to intravenous methylphenidate re-challenges. However, partial dopamine D 2 receptor desensitisation was observed in midbrain dopamine neurons. Using behavioural experiments, <b>cross-sensitisation</b> between adolescent methylphenidate exposure and later-life D-amphetamine challenge was observed. Significant decreases in striatal NMDA 2 B protein expression were observed in animals chronically treated, while striatal medium spiny neurons showed decreased sensitivities to locally applied NMDA and dopamine. While caffeine is devoid of action on baseline spike generation and burst activity of dopamine neurons, nicotine induces either firing rate enhancement, firing rate reduction, or has no consequences. Adolescent methylphenidate treatment leads to decreased neuronal sensitivities to the combination of nicotine, MPH and eticlopride, compared to controls. Finally, nicotine partially prevented D-amphetamine-induced increase of rearing activities. Our results show that increases in the excitability of PFC neurons in basal conditions and via NMDA receptor activation may be involved in the therapeutic response to ADHD drugs. Long-term consequences were observed after psychostimulant exposure. Such novel findings strengthen the mixed hypothesis in ADHD, whereby both dopamine and glutamate neurotransmissions are dysregulated. Therefore, ADHD therapy may now focus on adequate balancing between glutamate and dopamine...|$|E
