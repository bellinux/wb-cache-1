The health <b>care</b> <b>assistant</b> education (Heilsuhjálpari) takes fifteen months. Following graduation, pupils can choose to leave the school and work in home care and retirement homes. Alternatively they can continue with another 22 months and become an assistant nurse (heilsurøktari). The assistant nurse can work in various places, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals. The graduates from the Health School are mainly women. In 2012 almost 90% of the School's graduates were women.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} question of how the documentation work impacts the work of <b>care</b> <b>assistants,</b> and their conduct of everyday life, using Klaus Holzkamp’s notion of “the conduct of everyday life”. The theory of “the conduct of everyday life” with a subject standpoint, will be used as an analytical basis for understanding the contradictions, requirements and conditions the <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> are confronted with in their work with documentation and {{in the context of their}} work with residents in the nursing home. Furthermore, the dissertation explores the possibilities and boundaries the <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> face during their work with documentation and analyses how the documentation work affects their professionalism by using Katrin Hjort’s notion of “professionalism”. Moreover the project discusses how the work conditions can be seen as healthy or unhealthy for the <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b>   Finally the project concludes that the documentation work has a great significance for the <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> in their arrangement of the everyday life in the nursing home and that the documentation work contains several opportunities for the <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> to improve their own and the resident’s life conditions. However, the project also concludes that the <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> work with documentation at the same time contains boundaries and adversely affects the care of the residents...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} views {{and attitudes of}} aged care staff {{providing}} direct care towards palliative care and to identify their learning needs. Design: Survey design using purposive sampling methods. Findings: Nurses and <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> (n= 222) employed within nine residential aged care facilities in regional Australia completed the survey. The majority had received `on the job training 2 ̆ 7 and were committed to providing end-of-life care. Differences {{in the level of}} confidence to deal with patient/family interactions and manage complex palliative care scenarios were evident between nurses and <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Both nurses and <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> perceived a need for further education in symptom management and communication, yet their content need differed significantly between groups. Conclusions: Nurses and <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> in residential aged care facilities demonstrate commitment to the delivery of palliative care and express a need for increased palliative care competencies. The heterogeneity of roles and educational preparation within the aged care workforce indicate that tailored palliative care education initiatives are required to meet the learning needs of aged care nurses and <b>care</b> <b>assistants,</b> particularly in relation to end-of-life care. These data have implications for skill-mix and model of care development...|$|R

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about how newly {{qualified}} nurses delegate to health <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> when delivering bedside care. Aim: To explore newly qualified nurses' experiences of delegating to, and supervising, health <b>care</b> <b>assistants.</b> Design: Ethnographic case studies. Settings: In-patient wards in three English National Health Service (NHS) acute hospitals. Participants: 33 newly qualified nurses were observed, 10 health <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> and 12 ward managers. Methods: Participant observation and in-depth interviews. Findings: We suggest that newly qualified nurses learn to delegate to, and supervise, health <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> through re-working (`recontextualising') knowledge; and that this process occurs within a transitional (`liminal') space. Conclusions: Conceptualising learning in this way allows {{an understanding of the}} shift from student to newly qualified nurse and the associated interaction of people, space and experience. Using ethnographic case studies allows the experiences of those undergoing these transitions to be vocalised by the key people involved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the public {{acceptance}} of policies that {{pave the way for}} a more active role of family <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> in long-term <b>care</b> provision. Family <b>care</b> <b>assistants,</b> i. e. non-relatives providing homecare services in the own private home of the care recipient, provide valuable help for adult children organizing long-term care for their parents. However, their support comes at the price of transferring more family-owned wealth to non-relatives. Based on a survey among German citizens, we provide empirical evidence on the factors that drive the support for a more active role of family <b>care</b> <b>assistants.</b> We find support to be higher among subjects who gave long-term care personally. Monetary self-interest is found to matter. In addition, we find evidence of a clear line of conflict: Citizens with alive parents are more likely to support a more active role of family <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> than citizens whose parents are dead...|$|R

40|$|In Sweden {{the need}} to recruit <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> is {{increasing}} because of a growing older population together with their demands {{to stay in their}} own homes as long as possible. Swedish municipalities are responsible for organizing the social care and services for elderly with a coordination of some private provider companies. Moreover, to improve the care work a range of information and communication technologies (ICTs) e. g. safety alarm and electronic health record system are used to support care assistants’ daily activities and communication with elderly. Thus qualitative research aims to explore the care assistants’ use and experiences of existing ICTs. Furthermore, it examines the impact of the ICTs on their daily activities. The thesis pay attention also to <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> demands, ideas and visions about future ICTs. The research found that <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> were satisfied with the ICTs, they use today. However, the research also identified some problems related to ICT, which the <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> are confronted with during their everyday work e. g. alarm buttons loosen and falsely triggered sensors. <b>Care</b> <b>assistants</b> expressed their ideas and visions about the ICT’s degree of involvement in their care activities and elderly’s lives. They had contradictions in their point of views related to the use of monitoring technologies for elder’s care. They also had negative feelings about these technologies. In short, the thesis explored two things; firstly, it reflected ICTs and care assistants’ demands and ideas related to the ICTs. Secondly, the daily activities of <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> were examined. Therefore this research brings forward care assistants’ activities and makes their work more noticeable in order {{to be used in the}} development of new IT systems in the social care work...|$|R

2500|$|Regulatory {{frameworks}} {{vary from}} province to province, and include direct government regulation (such as Ontario's method of credentialing its practitioners {{with the title}} of A-EMCA, or Advanced Emergency Medical <b>Care</b> <b>Assistant)</b> to professional self-regulating bodies, such as the Alberta College of Paramedics. Though the title of Paramedic is a generic description of a category of practitioners, provincial variability in regulatory methods accounts for ongoing differences in actual titles that are ascribed to different levels of practitioners. For example, the province of Alberta has legally adopted the title [...] "Emergency Medical Technician", or 'EMT', for the Primary Care Paramedic; and 'Paramedic' only for those qualified as Advanced Care Paramedics Advanced Life Support (ALS) providers. Only someone registered in Alberta can call themselves an EMT or Paramedic in Alberta, the title is legally protected. Almost all other provinces are gradually moving to adopting the new titles, or have at least recognized the NOCP document as a benchmarking document to permit inter-provincial labour mobility of practitioners, regardless of how titles are specifically regulated within their own provincial systems. In this manner, the confusing myriad of titles and occupational descriptions can at least be discussed using a common language for comparison sake.|$|E

40|$|A person-centred {{approach}} to care in residential aged care facilities should uphold residents’ rights to independence, choice, decision-making, participation, {{and control over}} their lifestyle. Little is known about how nurses and personal <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> working in these facilities uphold these ideals when assisting residents maintain continence and manage incontinence. The overall aim {{of the study was}} to develop a grounded theory to describe and explain how Australian residents of aged care facilities have their continence care needs determined, delivered and communicated. This paper presents and discusses a subset of the findings about the ethical challenges nurses and personal <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> encountered whilst providing continence care. Grounded theory methodology was used for in-depth interviews with 18 nurses and personal <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> who had experience of providing, supervising or assessing continence care in any Australian residential aged care facility, and to analyse 88 hours of field observations in two facilities. Data generation and analysis occurred simultaneously using open coding, theoretical coding, and selective coding, until data were saturated. While addressing the day-to-day needs of residents who needed help to maintain continence and/or manage incontinence, nurses and personal <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> struggled to enable residents to exercise choice and autonomy. The main factor that contributed to this problem was that the fact that nurses and personal <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> had to respond to multiple, competing, and conflicting expectations about residents’ care needs. This situation was compounded by workforce constraints, inadequate information about residents’ care needs, and an unpredictable work environment. Providing continence care accentuated the ethical tensions associated with caregiving. Nurses’ and personal care assistants’ responses were mainly characterised by highly protective behaviours towards residents. Underlying structural factors that hinder high quality continence care to residents of aged care facilities should be urgently addressed...|$|R
