50|$|Just {{as china}} {{is a common}} name for porcelain, japanning is an old name to {{describe}} the European technique to imitate Asian lacquerware. As Asian lacquer work became popular in England, France, the Netherlands, and Spain in the 17th century the Europeans developed imitations that were effectively a different technique of lacquering. The European technique, which is used on furniture and other objects, uses finishes that have a resin base similar to shellac. The technique, which became known as japanning, involves applying several coats of varnish which are each heat-dried and polished. In the 18th century, this type of lacquering gained a large popular following. Although traditionally a pottery and wood coating, japanning was the popular (mostly black) coating of the accelerating metalware industry. By the twentieth century, the term was freely applied to coatings based on various <b>varnishes</b> <b>and</b> <b>lacquers</b> besides the traditional shellac.|$|R

It affects every moment of our lives, strongly influencing the clothes we wear, the furnishings in our homes. In the past, painters had used natural dyes extracted from plants, insects, molluscs and minerals for their paintings. The unique character of their works were the result of using different mixtures of dyes <b>and</b> mordants, as <b>varnishes</b> <b>and</b> <b>lacquers</b> responsible for cohesion of the pigments and protection of the layers destroyed by environmental effects. Natural dyes were also used in clothings, as well as in cosmetic industry (Henna, Catechu), pharmaceutical industry (Saffron, Rhubarb) and in food industry (Annatto, Curcumin and Cochineal) [1, 2]. As now public’s awareness for eco-preservation, eco-safety and health concerns, environmentally benign and non-toxic sustainability in bioresourced colorants, have created a revolution in textile research and development [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Also, environmental and aquatic preservation aspects forced Western countries to exploit their high technical skills in the advancements of textile materials for high quality, technical performances, and side by side development of cleaner production strategies for cost-effective value added textile products [8].|$|R

Although there are studies on the acute toxicological effects of isocyanates, such as investigations on MIC after the Bhopal disaster, most toxicological studies are nowadays focused on occupational risks after chronic, low-dose exposure. Several studies report a good correlation between isocyanate exposure and measurements of amine derivatives of isocyanates in urine. However, further research on the toxicokinetics and metabolism of isocyanates is needed in order to select the most suitable biomarkers as well as establish a definitive correlation between exposure concentration and biomarker concentration.|$|R
