Vidare undersöktes om Modellen för sambandet mellan motivationsklimat, individuella skillnader, och känsla och motivation kunde appliceras inom CrossFit. I studien deltog sammanlagt 95 deltagare, både CrossFitutövare (N= 45) och deltagare inom konditionsbaserad gruppträning (N= 50) från sydvästra Sverige. I studien användes Perceived Motivational Climate in Sports Questionnaire- 2 (PMCSQ- 2), Achievement Goals Questionnaire for Sports (AGQ-S) samt Physical Self Perception Profile-R (PSPP-R). Resultatet visade en signifikant skillnad i uppgiftsorienterat klimat och självkänsla mellan CrossFitutövare och deltagare i konditionsbaserad gruppträning. Vidare påvisades samband mellan motivationsklimat, målinriktning och självkänsla inom CrossFit vilket delvis stödjer modellen. Framtida forskning bör vidare granska motivationsklimat, målinriktning, självkänsla och motivation inom CrossFit jämfört med konditionsbaserad gruppträning i en population bestående av fysiskt inaktiva nybörjare. The {{purpose of}} the study was to investigate the interrelationship between motivational <b>climate,</b> <b>goal</b> orientations, and self-esteem in CrossFit compared to aerobic based training. Furthermore the study investigated if the model of interrelationships between motivational <b>climate,</b> <b>goal</b> orientation and, self-esteem could be applied within CrossFit. There were 95 participants in the study, both CrossFit athletes (N= 45) and participants i aerobic based training from the south west of Sweden. Percieved Motivational Climate in Sports Questionnaire- 2 (PMCSQ- 2), Achievement Goals Questionnaire for Sports (AGQ-S) and Physical Self Perception Profile-R (PSPP-R) were used in the study. The results showed a statistically significant difference in percieved mastery-oriented motivational climate and self-esteem among CrossFit athletes and participants in aerobic based training. Furthermore there was a correlation between motivational <b>climate,</b> <b>goal</b> orientations, and self-esteem in CrossFit which partially supports the model.  Based on this result future research should examine motivational <b>climate,</b> <b>goal</b> orientations, self-esteem and motivation in CrossFit compared to aerobic based training in a population of physically inactive novices...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} based on a {{comprehensive}} and structured literature review of key issues associated with long-term <b>goals</b> for <b>climate</b> policy, and to the framework for implementing climate policy. The study provides a basis for working with global climate policy after 2012, whether the Kyoto Protocol enters into force or not. The main challenges are to achieve broader participation in future climate agreements than has been the case with the Kyoto Protocol, especially with respect to the USA and developing countries, and to achieve deep emissions reductions to prevent human-induced climate change from getting out of control. The discussion of <b>climate</b> <b>goals</b> is divided into advantages and challenges presented by long-term <b>climate</b> <b>goals,</b> goals connected to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, goals connected to the impacts of climate change, and the issue of setting short-term emissions targets as a step in meeting long-term goals.

30|$|The Paris Agreement {{confirmed}} the global aim {{to achieve a}} long-term <b>climate</b> <b>goal,</b> in which the global increase in mean temperature is kept below 2  °C compared to the preindustrial level. We investigated {{the implications of the}} near-term emissions targets (for around the year 2030) {{in the context of the}} long-term climate mitigation goal using the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model framework. To achieve the 2  °C goal, a large greenhouse gas emissions reduction is required, either in the early or latter half of this century. In the mid-term (from 2030 to 2050), it may be necessary to consider rapid changes to the existing energy or socioeconomic systems, while long-term measures (after 2050) will rely on the substantial use of biomass combined with carbon capture and storage technology or afforestation, which will eventually realize so-called negative CO 2 emissions. With respect to the policy context, two suggestions are provided here. The first is the review and revision of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in 2020, with an additional reduction target to the current NDCs being one workable alternative. The second suggestion is a concrete and numerical mid-term emissions reduction target, for example to be met by 2040 or 2050, which could also help to achieve the long-term <b>climate</b> <b>goal.</b>|$|E
30|$|For an industrialised nation, {{this system}} {{runs the risk}} that more {{emission}} rights would be assigned than emission reductions are created through forest activities. This would have different consequences for the two instruments. For the offset regulation (1 : 1 exchange), fewer emissions would be avoided than originally planned. The domestic goal would be violated. With the emission allowances programme, on the other hand, nothing would change for the emitters as a group. The domestic emission limit would be adhered to. However, the supplementary <b>climate</b> <b>goal</b> would not be met.|$|E

This was the first meeting of the CWG since February, 2011. Given the uncertainty and ever-changing landscape in NOAA’s Climate portfolio, the Climate Program Office chose not to have a CWG meeting in the intervening 18 months. As a result, this meeting served as more of a reset in terms of considering NOAA’s climate activities, rather than an in depth look at any one particular area. The main topics for this meeting were the execution of the <b>Climate</b> <b>Goal</b> strategy across line organizations, an overview of observations and monitoring, regional climate modeling, the five societal challenges of coastal inundation, weather and climate extremes, drought/water resources, marine ecosystems, and mitigation/atmospheric chemistry, how to message NOAA’s <b>climate</b> <b>goal,</b> and changes to the CWG Terms of Reference and membership.

40|$|This study investigates how {{the aim of}} the {{municipality}} of Copenhagen regarding CO 2 -neutrality affects the achievement of the national <b>climate</b> <b>goals.</b> The investigation will be based on an examination of the climate plan of the Copenhagen Municipality called ‘CPH 2025 climate plan’. The project is empirical based, making use of interviews and relevant literature. By aiming for CO 2 -neutrality {{the municipality}} engages to reduce their CO 2 -emissions, but this aim is also problematic. The municipality is offsetting their CO 2 -emissions by erecting windmills in order to achieve CO 2 -neutrality, which will not solve the issue regarding its CO 2 -emissions. To make an actual CO 2 -reduction one has to live up to certain requirements. We do not think that the municipality meets these requirements, and as a result, it is doubtful whether they actually can call themselves CO 2 -neutral. However, by offsetting the municipality is contributing to achieving the national goal for a developed energy system, which contains 49. 5 % wind power in 2020. Contributing to the national goal, by developing the renewable energy system, is rather difficult for the municipality within certain areas. These areas {{have to be dealt with}} if Denmark is to achieve the national goal of becoming 100 % independent of fossil fuels in 2050. The study concludes that the CPH 2025 climate plan has beneficial effects, and that the aim of CO 2 -neutrality in many ways contributes to the achievement of the national <b>climate</b> <b>goals.</b> An improved cooperation between the national and municipal level is required in order to assist the Municipality of Copenhagen in solving the problematic areas, however this will also assist in achieving the national <b>climate</b> <b>goals...</b>|$|R

30|$|Companies {{participating}} in the system {{would be allowed to}} offset a portion of their CO 2 emissions by investing in activities outside the defined system (e.g. carbon capture and sequestration). They would receive credits allowing them to undertake the same amount of emissions within the system area. The recognition of REDD projects in developing countries would be new and, since the expected costs of these projects would be comparatively low, the national economy could be relieved considerably. Offset credits could be purchased both by emitters and third parties. For emitters, they could replace preventive measures at home; other purchasers could sell them in emissions trading. Because prices for allowances are decreasing, all emitters in the system would benefit from the lower costs. In case, the additional domestic emissions are equal to the reduced rainforest emissions, a constant level of total global emissions and an appropriately defined national <b>climate</b> <b>goal</b> would be maintained. In return for the agreed omission of deforestation, the rainforest country would receive a share of the returns, which would not only cover the costs but also provide a surplus.|$|E
