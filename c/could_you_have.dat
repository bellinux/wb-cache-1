500|$|Honeychile Rider is one {{of three}} women in the Bond canon who have been scarred by rape. This follows a pattern where the women Bond comes across are somehow {{different}} to the norm, although Black points out that this gives Bond an opportunity to help and save both Rider and the others. Other female characters in the Bond series have flaws, and Rider has a broken nose—the result of the rape she suffered. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett, in their analysis of the roles of women in the Bond novels, consider that Rider is [...] "not archetypically feminine", but is [...] "constructed according to the formula 'equal but yet subordinate'." [...] Rider is described in the book as having buttocks like a boy, which brought a response from Fleming's friend Noël Coward that [...] "I was also slightly shocked by the lascivious announcement that Honeychile's bottom was like a boy's. I know that we are all becoming more broadminded nowadays, but really old chap what <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been thinking of?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is what <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1977 Fleetwood and Nicks began {{having an}} affair. It would {{continue}} sporadically {{for the next}} two years during the fallout from the end of Fleetwood's relationship with Boyd, until the pair mutually decided to end the affair. [...] "Never in a million years <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told me that [...] would happen," [...] Nicks later stated. [...] "Everybody was angry, because Mick was married to a wonderful girl and had two wonderful children. I was horrified. I loved these people. I loved his family. So it couldn't possibly work out. And it didn't. I just couldn't." [...] Boyd and Fleetwood had in fact begun living together once more in 1976, and would remarry temporarily to assist their children with emigration to the United States. However they quickly divorced for the second time some months later. In November 1978 Fleetwood moved into a Bel Air home with Sara Recor, mutual friend of Fleetwood and Nicks who was at the time married to another music producer. Meanwhile, Fleetwood began working on a charity project to get Fleetwood Mac to tour the Soviet Union, however the Soviet War in Afghanistan later made the tour untenable.|$|E
