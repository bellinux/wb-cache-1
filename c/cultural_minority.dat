The plan was to facilitate <b>cultural</b> <b>minority</b> groups, most notably in education and health. Part of the plan comprised recommendations made by former New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord in a report on the state of official languages in Canada. The government also announced the support program for official languages which replaced an older judiciary program. The programme was followed by the Roadmap for Canada's Official Languages 2013-2018: Education, Immigration, Communities.|$|E
500|$|Article 30 confers {{upon all}} {{religious}} and linguistic minorities {{the right to}} set up and administer educational institutions of their choice in order to preserve and develop their own culture, and prohibits the State, while granting aid, from discriminating against any institution {{on the basis of the}} fact that it is administered by a religious or <b>cultural</b> <b>minority.</b> The term [...] "minority", while not defined in the Constitution, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean any community which numerically forms less than 50% of the population of the state in which it seeks to avail the right under Article 30. In order to claim the right, it is essential that the educational institution must have been established as well as administered by a religious or linguistic minority. Further, the right under Article 30 can be availed of even if the educational institution established does not confine itself to the teaching of the religion or language of the minority concerned, or a majority of students in that institution do not belong to such minority. This right is subject to the power of the State to impose reasonable regulations regarding educational standards, conditions of service of employees, fee structure, and the utilisation of any aid granted by it.|$|E
500|$|The Eskaya, less {{commonly}} known as the Visayan-Eskaya, is the collective name for the members of a <b>cultural</b> <b>minority</b> found in Bohol, Philippines, which is distinguished by its cultural heritage, particularly its literature, language, dress and religious observances. After the Eskaya first came to public attention in 1980, these cultural practices were the subject of intense speculation on the part of local journalists and amateur historians who made diverse claims about the ethnolinguistic status of the Eskaya people. The unique Eskayan language and writing system in particular {{has been a source of}} fascination and controversy. Some journalists argued that the Eskaya were historically displaced from the Middle East, while others suggested that the community was a cult speaking an invented language. According to Eskaya mythology, the language and script was created through divine inspiration by the ancestor Pinay who based it on the human body. Suppressed by the Spanish colonists, Pinay's language was said to have resurfaced under the leadership of Mariano Datahan (ca. 1875–1949), a veteran of Bohol's republican army. Although the historical existence of Pinay cannot be confirmed, more recent studies that combined linguistic analysis with oral history and genealogical research provide evidence that the Eskaya language was most likely created and disseminated within a generation by a charismatic individual. [...] Today, the Eskaya are officially classified as an Indigenous Cultural Community under The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997 (Republic Act No. 8371). A number of reports have suggested that Eskaya linguistic and cultural education has been in steady decline since the mid-1980s, although promising revitalisation efforts have also been documented.|$|E

40|$|Arbitration {{can serve}} as a {{necessary}} safe harbor from procedural and substantive cultural bias in the general public courts. Arbitration also {{can serve as}} a laboratory for process reforms as <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> attempt to craft rules that better govern their lives than do the purportedly “one size fits all” rules that the majority has crafted. In so allowing <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> to structure their lives and legal disputes in ways that reflect their particular needs, minority-culture arbitration also has great potential for habituating the general public to the realities of the lives of <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> and to the notion that custom-made responses to these realities are both possible and appropriate. These two habituations would be likely to lead to easier acceptance of necessary process reforms that would better serve <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> in the public courts. Each time <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> use arbitration to contract around a hostile or dysfunctional rule of general application and to replace this rule with a better-serving custom-made rule, they have an opportunity to demonstrate to the general public that the process shortcomings that drove the <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> from the general public courts are not intractable. They also have the opportunity to demonstrate to the general public the utility of custom-made solutions to minority-culture concerns and that these solutions to process shortcomings can be implemented with little cost to the general public. If minority- culture arbitration were to become routine, {{it is possible that the}} general public would habituate to the idea that process-customization is both practical and useful. Such habituation would lessen resistance to adoption of process reforms tailored to <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities.</b> Arbitration also can facilitate habituation in a larger social context. This second tier of habituation arises from the consequence that arbitration allows the minority culture to survive and even to flourish. Biased procedural and substantive law undermines the minority culture at the same time that it disadvantages the minority-culture litigant. Arbitration allows <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> to protect themselves from these majoritarian procedural and substantive biases that deny the validity of their values and relationships and consequently undermine those values and relationships. The end product of this protective maneuver is a larger public space for the minority culture. As the minority culture flourishes, the general public more frequently comes into contact with that culture and habituates to its realties. Again, this habituation is likely to pave the way for process reforms in the majoritarian legal system...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Purpose In this study, we investigated {{the commitment of}} <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> and majorities in organizations. We examined how contextual factors, such as pressure to conform and leadership styles, affect the commitment of minority and majority members. Design/Methodology/Approach A field study was conducted on 107 employees in a large multinational corporation. Findings We hypothesize and found that <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> felt more committed to the organization than majority members, thereby challenging the existing theoretical view that <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> will feel less committed. We also found that organizational pressure to conform and effective leadership increased the commitment of minorities. Implications Our findings indicate that organizational leaders and researchers should not only focus on increasing and maintaining the commitment of minority members, but should also consider how majority members react to cultural socialization and integration processes. The commitment of minority members can be further enhanced by effective leadership. Originality/Value In this study, we challenge the existing theoretical view based on similarity attraction theory and relational demography theory, that <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> Received and reviewed by former editor, George Neuman...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{multiculturalism}} {{in the context of}} present-day societies and the need to incorporate minorities within a reframed social order. In his critical theory, Axel Honneth rightly draws attention to the idea of the moral grammar of struggles for recognition.   Analyzing his theory in depth, the article shows that Honneth underestimates the violent power of ideological discourse in marginalizing and excluding society’s others, e. g. <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities.</b> It then puts forward an alternative approach based on Ricœur’s creative and original reflections on ideology and utopia. For the incorporation of <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> to occur, the symbolic order of society needs to be critiqued, transformed and expanded. From this perspective, the author highlights the subversive and transformative strength of utopian counter-narratives. The latter form a vital resource for <b>cultural</b> <b>minorities</b> in their struggle for recognition. </div...|$|R
