30|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} <b>cyproconazole</b> determination without solid phase extraction using a GC/MS system. We also discuss the matrix effect observed in <b>cyproconazole</b> determination with wood extracts.|$|E
30|$|Quantitative {{determination}} of <b>cyproconazole</b> has been also developed because {{the retention of}} fungicides strongly affects the service life of treated wood. Retention of <b>cyproconazole</b> is usually determined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [6, 7]. However, the detector used in the HPLC analysis of <b>cyproconazole,</b> namely a UV monitor, is less selective and wood extracts often hamper <b>cyproconazole</b> determination. To eliminate the influence of wood extracts, a method of cleanup before HPLC analysis was developed using an SCX solid-extraction cartridge [8]. The cleanup method is now adopted in the newest Japanese agricultural standard for sown timber [9].|$|E
30|$|The {{reason why}} <b>cyproconazole</b> with wood {{extracts}} of Japanese larch showed a lower peak area appeared that hydrophilic compounds such as arabinogalactan {{extracted from the}} Japanese larch aggregated with <b>cyproconazole</b> when <b>cyproconazole</b> and larch extracts were dried and re-dissolved in 50 : 50 (v/v) acetone/hexane. To confirm the above hypothesis, dried <b>cyproconazole</b> and hydrophobic wood extracts of larch were extracted by liquid–liquid extraction with water and ethyl acetate by preventing aggregation. The analyte and the matrix extracted in the ethyl acetate fraction were initially dried and subjected to GC/MS analysis with a methanol solution containing sorbitol and hexaconazole. Liquid–liquid extraction gave the same peak area {{as that of the}} reference sample (Fig.  7 b), which suggests that hydrophilic extracts could interfere with the <b>cyproconazole</b> determination as in Fig.  7 a.|$|E

40|$|Medical drugs {{known to}} {{modulate}} {{the activity of}} human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins (modulators) were {{tested for the ability}} to potentiate the activity of the azole fungicide <b>cyproconazole</b> against in vitro growth of Mycosphaerella graminicola and to control disease development due to this pathogen on wheat seedlings. In vitro modulation of <b>cyproconazole</b> activity could be demonstrated in paper disk bioassays. Some of the active modulators (amitriptyline, flavanone, and phenothiazines) increased the accumulation of <b>cyproconazole</b> in M. graminicola, suggesting that they reversed <b>cyproconazole</b> efflux. However, synergism between <b>cyproconazole</b> and modulators against M. graminicola on wheat seedlings could not be shown. Despite their low in vitro toxicity to M. graminicola, some modulators (amitriptyline, loperamide, and promazine) did show significant intrinsic disease control activity in preventive and curative foliar spray tests with wheat seedlings.

30|$|These results {{indicate}} that <b>cyproconazole</b> can be precisely determined by GC/MS analysis {{in combination with the}} analyte protectant and the internal standard. Our next goal is optimization of the extraction procedure of <b>cyproconazole</b> from wood flour, because the conventional extraction solvent, methanol, is so hydrophilic that the extracts contain various compounds unsuitable for GC/MS analysis. It is necessary to remove these compounds prior to GC/MS analysis as long as methanol is used as the extraction solvent. If hydrophobic solvents become available for extraction, <b>cyproconazole</b> determination by GC/MS analysis will be simplified furthermore.|$|E
30|$|Quantitative {{determination}} of <b>cyproconazole</b> by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was investigated. The {{results suggest that}} <b>cyproconazole</b> determination is significantly affected by wood extracts. In the presence of methanol extracts of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) heartwood, <b>cyproconazole</b> showed 50  % larger peak area than that without the extracts. This phenomenon whereby contaminants in the sample solution affect {{the intensity of the}} peak signal is known as the matrix effect. An investigation for eliminating the matrix effect revealed that adding sorbitol as an analyte protectant drastically increased the analyte peak intensity and successfully mitigated the matrix effect of the wood extracts. Adding hexaconazole as an internal standard was also useful in reducing the deviation of the data. The efficacy of a novel sample preparation method consisting of adding sorbitol and hexaconazole as analyte protectants and the internal standard, respectively, were applied to the GC/MS analysis of <b>cyproconazole</b> in the presence of wood extracts of the other nine species. It is revealed that <b>cyproconazole</b> can be precisely determined by GC/MS analysis in combination with the analyte protectant and the internal standard.|$|E

Cross-resistance could have implications on the fungicides available to treat the disease locally, as seen in Europe over the past decade. 178 isolates were harvested from leaves collected from two locations in the Willamette Valley.

40|$|International audienceThe {{feasibility}} of coupling photocatalysis and a biological treatment (Pseudomonas fluorescens) {{to remove a}} fungicide, <b>cyproconazole,</b> in pure water was examined. Photocatalytic elimination of 85 10 − 3 g L − 1 <b>cyproconazole</b> was almost complete after 500 minutes irradiation.

COD on TOC ratio decreased during photocatalysis indicating a favourable trend, which however was not confirmed by a decrease of the toxicity, since the EC 50 values were 61 % and 64 % initially and after 255 minutes irradiation. In addition, the presence of by-products from photocatalysis after P. fluorescens culture, showing their non-biodegradability, was also in disfavour of a coupling of the two operations.

The isolates were cross-sensitive to other azoles tested, such as <b>cyproconazole</b> and ketoconazole, but not to unrelated chemicals like cycloheximide, kresoxim-methyl or rhodamine 6 G. Progenies from a genetic cross between an isolate with an intermediate and a high sensitivity to azoles displayed a continuous range of phenotypes with respect to <b>cyproconazole</b> sensitivity, indicating that variation in azole sensitivity in this haploid organism is polygenic. The basal level of expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter genes MgAtr 1 -MgAtr 5 from M graminicola significantly varied amongst the isolates tested, but no clear increase in the transcript level of a particular MgAtr gene was found in the less sensitive isolates. <b>Cyproconazole</b> strongly induced expression of MgAtr 4, but no correlation between expression levels of this gene and azole sensitivity was observed.

Among the four strobilurin fungicides tested trifloxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl were the most effective with control efficiency values higher than 94 % compared to the control treatment even when applied at lower application dose of 100 mg a. i. ha– 1. Azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin showed a poor to modest activity against the disease even when applied at the highest application dose of 200 μg a. i. ha– 1.
