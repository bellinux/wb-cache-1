5|$|Speaking at a Chautauqua {{conference in}} Jūrmala, Latvia in June 1986, Matlock told the <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> the United States did not {{recognize}} the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union. His remarks are credited by Dainis Īvāns, leader of the Popular Front of Latvia, with galvanizing the independence movement in Latvia.|$|E

5|$|On June 6, the {{two major}} party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock, Ontario. Speaking in the afternoon, St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200. To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} an hour late, with announcements made to the excited <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> he was slowed by voters who wanted only to see him or shake his hand.|$|E
5|$|President James Monroe and Congress invited Lafayette {{to visit}} the United States in 1824, in part to {{celebrate}} the nation's upcoming 50thanniversary. Monroe intended to have Lafayette travel on an American warship, but the general felt having such a vessel as transport was undemocratic, and booked passage on a merchantman. LouisXVIII did not approve of the trip, and his officers had troops disperse the <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> gathered at Le Havre to see Lafayette off.|$|E
5|$|The day {{started with}} a speech from Lord Rowe-Beddoe, {{chairman}} of Wales Millennium Centre, who declared to the <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> the proceedings were under way. This {{was followed by a}} speech from Rhodri Morgan, the First Minister, who stressed that the new arts centre belonged to the whole nation, that it was for all of the people of Wales and not just for the elite.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} debates on the actual taking of the Bastille in 1789 has been {{the nature of the}} crowds that stormed the building. Hippolyte Taine argued in the late 19th century that the crowd {{consisted}} of unemployed vagrants, who acted without real thought; by contrast, the post-war left-wing intellectual George Rudé argued that the crowd was dominated by relatively prosperous artisan workers. The matter was reexamined by Jacques Godechot in the post-war years; Godechot showing convincingly that, in addition to some local artisans and traders, at least half the <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> gathered that day were, like the inhabitants of the surrounding faubourg, recent immigrants to Paris from the provinces. Godechot used this to characterise the taking of the Bastille as a genuinely national event of wider importance to French society.|$|E
5|$|Stuart Lake {{described}} {{in his book}} how Earp single-handedly stood down a large <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> wanted to lynch gambler Michael O'Rourke (Johnny Behind the Deuce). O'Rourke had killed Henry Schneider, chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company—he said in self defense. Henry was well-liked, and a mob of miners quickly gathered, threatening to lynch O'Rourke on the spot. In fact, the Epitaph gave primary credit to Ben Sippy for standing down the crowd, assisted by Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Johnny Behan. This incident as described by Lake added to Earp's modern legend as a lawman.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} of night, most of the <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> had {{accompanied}} the storming of the palace earlier that day departed, intending to resume looting the next day. In the meantime, Alexios III, who resided in the Blachernae Palace in the city's northwestern corner, rallied for a counter-strike. A small force was dispatched with boats around the city's peninsula to the Hodegetria Monastery north of the Great Palace. It was led by the emperor's son-in-law Alexios Palaiologos, who at that point was likely regarded as his heir-apparent, and quickly made contact with the Varangians who had held out in the palace's northern parts.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the races were watched by <b>crowds</b> <b>that</b> were 6000 strong. In 2013 the races have crowds of around 3,000 spectators recorded.|$|R

5|$|As {{the people}} inside the church scattered, the Mouzalon {{brothers}} tried to hide: George hid under the altar, Andronikos behind a door, and Theodore in a corner by the emperor's tomb. The mob, however, proceeded to search the church for them, and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named Karoulos ("Charles"). Mouzalon was dragged from under the altar and, despite pleading to ransom his life, was executed. So great was the frenzy of the <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces, so that the parts had to be gathered in a sack for burial afterwards. Andronikos and an unnamed brother-in-law too were slain, while Theodore's fate is uncertain: some scholars believe he survived and is {{to be identified with}} Theodore Mouzalon, a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). The Mouzalon family's houses were then ransacked by the mob; and when George Mouzalon's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband's life, she was brusquely told to be quiet or she would share his fate. Palaiologos's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalones' murderers were ever prosecuted. Indeed, the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos's confidant.|$|E
5|$|Croatian President Franjo Tuđman {{called on}} the public to bring the siege to an end, and the plea {{resulted}} in a large-scale protest against the JNA in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard on 6 May 1991. On 7 May, 80 tanks and tracked vehicles and 23 wheeled vehicles of the JNA 10th Motorised Brigade left barracks in Mostar, only to be stopped by civilians ahead of Široki Brijeg, west of Mostar. The convoy remained in place for three days as the crowd demanded that the JNA lift the siege of Kijevo. The protest ended after Alija Izetbegović, the President of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited and addressed the protesters, assuring the <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> the convoy was heading to Kupres rather than Kijevo. Tuđman and Cardinal Franjo Kuharić sent telegrams to the protesters supporting Izetbegović. The siege of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations a few days later, {{two weeks after the}} blockade had been imposed.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} a <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> {{included}} members of the Webfoots' 1919 conference championship team, which had won the title over California, Oregon took a one-point halftime lead on a late 30-foot shot by Johansen. The team switched its defense from zone to man-to-man {{for the second half}} and went on an early second half run to open up a 14-point lead with 12 minutes left. The Golden Bears made multiple comeback bids as the half progressed, but the Webfoots held on to win 54–49 and move ahead in the series. More than half of Oregon's points were scored by Gale and Wintermute, who had 18 and 11 respectively. The second game of the series was closely contested in the first half, but Oregon opened a 25–23 lead at halftime and extended their advantage to eight points before a run of three baskets by California. A stretch featuring three scores by Dick helped the Webfoots rebuild their lead later in the second half, and they clinched a two-game sweep with a 53–47 victory. Dick and Wintermute contributed 16 points apiece. It was Oregon's first PCC championship in 20 seasons.|$|E

5|$|They also {{performed}} in Ireland on June 8 and the Netherlands on June 9. Zack de la Rocha had {{stated that it}} was a definite possibility that the band would record a new album, the first time since 2000's Renegades. Morter confirmed this, stating the discussions he and the band had backstage before the Finsbury Park gig saying the band did write new material, but they had no motivation to release them until now. de la Rocha mentioned the very strong reaction from the Download Festival 2010 audience as an incentive for releasing new material. In addition, the band returned to Los Angeles on July 23, 2010 for their first U.S. show in two years and their first hometown show in 10 years. The concert benefited Arizona organizations that are fighting the SB1070 immigration law. On the night of the show, a spokesperson announced to the <b>crowd</b> <b>that</b> ticket sales—all of which are non-profit to the bands—had raised $300,000. The band has been confirmed to do a short South American tour in October, performing at venues such as the SWU Festival in Brazil, the Maquinaria Festival in Chile, and Pepsi Music Festival in Argentina. It {{was the first time the}} band played in those countries.|$|E
