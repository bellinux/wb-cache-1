It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruins of}} the city {{remained}} undocumented for around 3,700 years until R. D. Banerji, {{an officer of the}} Archaeological Survey of India, visited the site in 1919–20, identifying the Buddhist stupa (150–500 CE) known to be there and finding a flint scraper which convinced him of the site's antiquity. This led to large-scale excavations of Mohenjo-daro led by Kashinath Narayan Dikshit in 1924–25, and John Marshall in 1925–26. In the 1930s, major excavations were conducted at the site under the leadership of Marshall, D. K. Dikshitar and Ernest Mackay. Further excavations were carried out in 1945 by Ahmad Hasan Dani and Mortimer Wheeler. The last major series of excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1965 by Dr. George F. Dales. After 1965 excavations were banned due to weathering damage to the exposed structures, and the only projects allowed at the site since have been salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects. However, in the 1980s, German and Italian survey groups led by Dr. Michael Jansen and Dr. Maurizio Tosi used less invasive archeological techniques, such as architectural documentation, surface surveys, and localized probing, to gather further information about Mohenjo-daro. A dry <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> conducted in 2015 by Pakistan's National Fund for Mohenjo-daro revealed that the site is larger than the unearthed area.|$|E
500|$|The {{logistics}} of any coring project are complex because the locations are usually difficult to reach, {{and may be}} at high altitude. [...] The largest projects require years of planning and years to execute, and are usually run as international consortiums. [...] The EastGRIP project, for example, which as of 2017 is drilling in eastern Greenland, {{is run by the}} Centre for Ice and Climate, in Denmark, and includes representatives from 12 countries on its steering committee. [...] Over the course of a drilling season, scores of people work at the camp, and logistics support includes airlift capabilities provided by the US Air National Guard, using Hercules transport planes owned by the National Science Foundation. [...] In 2015 the EastGRIP team moved the camp facilities from NEEM, a previous Greenland ice <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> site, to the EastGRIP site. [...] Drilling is expected to continue until at least 2020.|$|E
50|$|HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from High Speed Steel material. These are most popular <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> or annular cutters in market. HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper for smaller {{diameter}} i.e 40 mm. The biggest advantage of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{is its ability to}} re-sharpen. Unlike TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills,</b> HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> re-sharpened and used with good efficiency until the desirable length is remaining. HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> have longer service life, high heat resistance: the charecteristics of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> is that <b>drilling</b> with these <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> can be done without the use of excessive force.|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are {{categorized}} by the material used to manufacture them: Primarily a metal <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{is made from}} High Speed Steel and Tungsten Carbide Tips.

50|$|The HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with Hard Coating are <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with a coating on it, {{generally}} TiN Coating. This {{make the}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{more resistant to}} heat, longer tool life and even removal of chips. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are gaining lot of popularity over the Standard HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> these days.

500|$|The International Geophysical Year (1957–1958) saw {{increased}} glaciology research {{around the}} world, {{with one of}} the high priority research targets being deep cores in polar regions. [...] SIPRE conducted pilot drilling trials in 1956 (to 305 m) and 1957 (to 411 m) at Site 2 in Greenland; the second core, with the benefit of the previous year's drilling experience, was retrieved in much better condition, with fewer gaps. [...] In Antarctica, a 307m core was drilled at Byrd Station in 1957–1958, and a 264m core at Little America V, on the Ross Ice Shelf, the following year. [...] The success of the IGY <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> led to increased interest in improving ice coring capabilities, and was followed by a CRREL project at Camp Century, where in the early 1960s three holes were drilled, the deepest reaching the base of the ice sheet at 1387m in July 1966. [...] The drill used at Camp Century then went to Byrd Station, where a 2164m hole was drilled to bedrock before the drill was frozen into the borehole by sub-ice meltwater and had to be abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|The Dye 3 1979 core is not {{completely}} intact and is not undamaged. “Below 600 m, the ice became brittle with increasing depth and badly fractured between 800 and 1,200 m. The physical property of the core progressively improved and below ~1,400 m was of excellent quality.” “The deep ice <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> terminated in August 1981. The ice core is 2035 m long and has a diameter of 10 cm. It was drilled with less than 6° deviation from vertical, and less than 2 m is missing. The deepest 22 m consists of silty ice with an increasing concentration of pebbles downward. In the depth interval 800 to 1400 m the ice was extremely brittle, and even careful handling unavoidably damaged {{this part of the}} core, {{but the rest of the}} core is in good to excellent condition.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{uncertain}} as {{the exact}} dating {{of the lower}} jaw of Mauer was until recently, so is the assignment of other fossils to its layer. Such contextual fossils are the only direct evidence for an accurate reconstruction of the habitat of a find. Not until 1991 two sets of <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> were conducted in the defunct sand mine of Grafenrain [...] and - beginning in 1995, several dozen cubic meters of sand were screened in search of fossil fragments that could shed light on accompanying species. However, mice teeth that were found proved to be not suitable for a more precise dating of the layer, since these mice lived anatomically virtually unchanged over too long a period. At least palynological findings of similar vegetation areas of the Cromer interglacial period can help {{with a description of}} the habitat.: [...] "across alluvial forests in the river valleys, forests on the slopes and open forests on the heights; these were rather dry locations, regarding the hydro-geology of the crevasses (...) of the Buntsandstein - and Muschelkalk mountains, bare of any Loess sediments." ...|$|E
50|$|TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from Tungsten Carbide {{material}} on their tips. Tungsten carbide is a very hard material and supposed {{to be one of}} the hardest materials made by man. TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are more expensive then HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> but are faster and easy to make bigger holes. There are also different types in TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b> TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper for bigger diameter i.e. above 41 mm. They are very efficient for cutting hard material. The chances of tip breakage in TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is more compared to HSS <b>Core</b> <b>drills.</b> TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> has a disadvantage that it can not be reground. Once the TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is damaged it has to be thrown away, it can not be re used like the HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b> It is always recommended by manufacturers to use TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> only for larger diameter and for very hard material, while giving priority to HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> because of its price and re-sharpening advantages.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> used {{in metal}} are called annular cutters. <b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> used for {{concrete}} are generally called Diamond <b>Core</b> <b>Drills</b> and are water cooled. [...] For <b>drilling</b> masonry, carbide <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> can be used.|$|R
50|$|The TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with Hard Coating are <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with a coating on it, {{generally}} TiN Coating. This {{make the}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{more resistant to}} heat, longer tool life and even removal of chips just like the advantage of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drill.</b> The biggest advantage of hard coated <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> is that these cutters are very good for cutting larger diameters on hard material.

50|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} of <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> or annular cutter {{is that it}} can not drill blind holes. A <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> due to its hollow geometry can only make through holes. Another disadvantage is in drilling a pile of many plates. There are some <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with a different geometry which can be used for drilling piles of plates, but still it is not 100% successful. The cost of a <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is high compared to twist drill, but the cost per hole made with <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is less as compared to twist drills, this is because a single <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> makes 5 to 10 times more holes than a twist drill.|$|R
