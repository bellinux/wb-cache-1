40|$|Insulin stimulates glucose uptake into {{skeletal}} muscle tissue mainly through the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) to the plasma membrane. The precise mechanism {{involved in this}} process is presently unknown. In the cascade of events leading to insulin-induced glucose transport, insulin activates specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. In this study we investigated the roles of PKCζ in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT 4 translocation in primary cultures of rat {{skeletal muscle}}. We found that insulin initially caused PKCζ to associate specifically with the GLUT <b>4</b> <b>compartments</b> and that PKCζ together with the GLUT <b>4</b> <b>compartments</b> were then translocated to the plasma membrane as a complex. PKCζ and GLUT 4 recycled independently of one another. To further establish the importance of PKCζ in glucose transport, we used adenovirus constructs containing wild-type or kinase-inactive, dominant-negative PKCζ (DNPKCζ) cDNA to overexpress this isoform in skeletal muscle myotube cultures. We found that overexpression of PKCζ {{was associated with a}} marked increase in the activity of this isoform. The overexpressed, active PKCζ coprecipitated with the GLUT <b>4</b> <b>compartments.</b> Moreover, overexpression of PKCζ caused GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane and increased glucose uptake in the absence of insulin. Finally, either insulin or overexpression of PKCζ induced serine phosphorylation of the GLUT 4 -compartment-associated vesicle-associated membrane protein 2. Furthermore, DNPKCζ disrupted the GLUT <b>4</b> <b>compartment</b> integrity and abrogated insulin-induced GLUT 4 translocation and glucose uptake. These results demonstrate that PKCζ regulates insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation and glucose transport through the unique colocalization of this isoform with the GLUT <b>4</b> <b>compartments...</b>|$|R

40|$|A new chlorarachniophyte, Norrisiella sphaerica S. Ota et K. Ishida gen. et sp. nov., {{from the}} coast of Baja California, Mexico is described. We {{examined}} its morphology, ultrastructure, and life cycle in detail, using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and time-lapse videomicroscopy. We found that this chlorarachniophyte possessed the following characteristics: (1) vegetative cells were coccoid and possessed a cell wall, (2) a pyrenoid was slightly invaded by plate-like periplastidial compartment {{from the tip of}} the pyrenoid, (3) a nucleomorph was located near the pyrenoid base in the periplastidial <b>compartment,</b> (<b>4)</b> cells reproduced vegetatively via autospores, and (5) a flagellate stage was present in the life cycle. This combination of characteristics differs from any of the described chlorarachniophyte genera, and therefore a new genus is established. Fluorescent microscopic observations suggested that the alga formed multinucleate cells prior to forming autospores. Time-lapse observations during autospore formation showed that cytokinesis occurred simultaneously in the multinucleate cells. Zoospores were also produced, and video sequences captured the release of zoospores from coccoid cells. © 2007 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo develop {{standardized}} musculoskeletal ultrasound (MUS) {{procedures and}} scoring for detecting knee osteoarthritis (OA) {{and test the}} MUS score's ability to discern various degrees of knee OA, in comparison with plain radiography and the ‘Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score’ (KOOS) domains as comparators. MethodA cross-sectional study of MUS examinations in 45 patients with knee OA. Validity, reliability, and reproducibility were evaluated. ResultsMUS examination for knee OA consists of five separate domains assessing (1) predominantly morphological changes in the medial compartment, (2) predominantly inflammation in the medial compartment, (3) predominantly morphological changes in the lateral <b>compartment,</b> (<b>4)</b> predominantly inflammation in the lateral compartment, and (5) effusion. MUS scores displayed substantial reliability and reproducibility, with interclass correlations coefficients ranging from 0. 75 to 0. 97 for the five domains. Construct validity was confirmed with statistically significant correlation coefficients (0. 47 – 0. 81, P <  0. 01). ConclusionThe MUS score suggested {{in this study was}} reliable and valid in detecting knee OA. In comparison with standing radiographs of the knees, the score detected all aspects of knee OA with relevant precision...|$|R
40|$|We used microautoradiography {{in order}} to {{evaluate}} cell replication of the remaining colorectal mucosa in 20 patients previously operated on for cancer of the large bowel. The results were compared to those of 24 controls without neoplasms or other relevant colorectal disease. Samples of colorectal mucosa were taken during endoscopy. At histological examination each labeled intestinal hemicrypt was divided into 5 longitudinal compartments, from the base to the surface, and S-phase cells in each compartment were counted. Total labeling index (LI, ratio of labeled to total cells x 100) and labeling index per crypt compartment were similar in surgical patients and in controls. In contrast, both total LI and labeling index in the upper portions of the crypt (<b>compartments</b> 3, <b>4,</b> and 5) were significantly higher in the 9 patients who showed recurrence of polyps than in those (n = 11) without recurrence. The LI in <b>compartments</b> <b>4</b> and 5 (the "high crypt region") was 4. 37 +/- 0. 95 (SEM) in patients with recurrence versus 0. 88 +/- 0. 21 (P less than 0. 001) in patients with negative endoscopy finding and 1. 47 +/- 0. 22 in controls. Moreover, the fifth compartment was labeled in 8 of 9 individuals in whom polyps recurred but in only 2 of 11 patients without recurrence and 3 of 24 controls. In conclusion, after resection for large bowel cancer colonic epithelial cell proliferation tends to become more quiescent and {{similar to that of}} controls. However, in the subgroup of patients in whom polyps reappear, the colorectal mucosa maintains a hyperproliferative state with an expansion of the replicative zone to the most superficial portions of the crypt. These findings support the sequence adenoma-carcinoma and suggest that the evaluation of cell proliferation might be useful in the identification of subjects at increased risk for multiple tumors of the large bowel...|$|R
40|$|Physiological {{doses of}} insulin in rats {{resulted}} in a rapid redistri-bution of key signaling proteins between subcellular compartments in rat liver. In plasma membranes (PM) and microsomes, insulin in-duced a rapid decrease in insulin receptor substrate- 1 / 2 (IRS 1 / 2) within 30 sec {{and an increase in}} these proteins in endosomes (EN) and cytosol. The level of p 85 in PM increased 2. 3 -fold at 30 sec after insulin stimulation followed by a decrease at 2 min. In this interval, 60 – 85 % and 10 – 20 % of p 85 in PM was associated with IRS 1 and IRS 2, re-spectively. Thus, in PM, IRS 1 / 2 accounts for almost all of the protein involved in phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase activation. In ENs insulin induced a maximal increase of 40 % in p 85 recruitment. As in PM, almost all p 85 was associated with IRS 1 / 2. The greater level of p 85 recruitment to PM was associated with a higher level of insulin-induced recruitment of Akt 1 to this <b>compartment</b> (<b>4.</b> 0 -fold in PM vs...|$|R
40|$|Alveolar macrophages degrade {{surfactant}} protein (SP) A and saturated phosphatidycholine [dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) ]. To clarify this process, using rabbit alveolar macrophages, {{we analyzed}} {{the effect of}} drugs known to affect phagocytosis, pinocytosis, clathrin-mediated uptake, caveolae, the cytoskeleton, lysosomal pH, protein kinase C, and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) {{on the degradation of}} SP-A and DPPC. We found the following: 1) SP-A binds to the plasma membrane, is rapidly internalized, and then moves toward degradative compartments. Uptake could be clathrin mediated, whereas phagocytosis, pinocytosis, or the use of caveolae are less likely. An intact cytoskeleton and an acidic milieu are necessary for the degradation of SP-A. 2) Stimulation of protein kinase C increases the degradation of SP-A. 3) PI 3 K influences the degradation of SP-A by regulating both the speed of internalization and subsequent intracellular steps, but its inhibition does not prevent SP-A from reaching the lysosomal <b>compartment.</b> <b>4)</b> The degradation of DPPC is unaffected by most of the treatments able to influence the degradation of SP-A. Thus it appears that DPPC is degraded by alveolar macrophages through mechanisms very different from those utilized for the degradation of SP-A...|$|R
