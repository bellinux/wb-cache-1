50|$|Construction on {{the stadium}} began in 1936 {{as a project}} of the Works Progress Administration under President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. The stadium was built to the {{immediate}} east of the baseball park Tinker Field, which opened in 1914. The stadium opened later in 1936 with a capacity of 8,900 as Orlando Stadium. The first college football bowl game was played on January 1, 1947. Catawba defeated Maryville 31-6 in the inaugural Tangerine Bowl. 2,000 seats were added in 1952. During this period, the stadium {{was known as the}} Tangerine Bowl. 5,000 more seats were added in 1968, along with the first press box. From 1974-76 the capacity was raised to 52,000. A capacity of 65,438 was established in 1989, after a $30 million renovation that added the upper decks. In 1983, the Florida Department of Citrus was added as a title sponsor for the facility, at a price of $250,000. From 1999 to 2002, key stadium improvements included the addition of <b>contour</b> <b>seating,</b> two escalators, and a new 107 ft wide scoreboard/video screen. A new sound system, along with two full-color ribbon displays along the upper decks, were also added. The expansion resulted in the upper deck overhanging Tinker Field's right field area, albeit at a significant height.|$|E

40|$|Adaptive seating {{devices are}} often placed within wheelchairs of {{children}} with neurological disorders who cannot walk independently. They are used {{in an attempt to}} (a) improve children's postural alignment or symmetry and thereby reduce the development of fixed deformity, (b) improve children's seated stability in order to increase function, and (c) improve children's comfort. These devices can be difficult for families to use and costly to provide and maintain. Although limited evidence exists that breathing may be improved with upright sitting compared with lying, no scientific evidence exists on the efficacy of these devices in relation to postural management and control, enhancement of function, or comfort. In order to provide an evidence base for this clinical work, we have prioritised four domains of seated behaviour to investigate : function, comfort, stability and postural alignment. For each of these domains we have identified potential outcome measurement tools, such as manual and electric goniometry, modified pain scales, seated functional activities accelerometry, actigraphy and pressure mapping. We are using these tools to compare a ramped <b>contoured</b> <b>seat</b> cushion with a flat seat cushion to explore the differences in seated behaviour in the domains of seated stability, comfort in a seated position, seated function and postural alignment. Theoretically, in a ramped, <b>contoured</b> <b>seat</b> cushion, we would expect an improvement in stability, functional movement, postural alignment and comfort than a standard flat seat cushion. This paper presentation reports the results of a controlled research trial comparing the two seated surfaces for 31 children with complex difficulties, illustrating and quantifying the differences between flat and ramped contoured cushions...|$|R

40|$|This review {{considers}} {{the following areas}} of seating research: anthropometrics (the use of body measure-ments to determine chair dimensions); anatomy (sitting posture and spinal curvature); muscle activity (the effect of different sitting positions on {{the muscles of the}} back); comfort; weight-bearing (prevention of pressure sores); ease of rising; and seating for the disabled (including <b>contoured</b> <b>seating</b> and armchairs). The major contributions in each area will be outlined in turn. If the total requirements for a chair are to be met, aspects of all of these factors may need to be considered in chair design.

40|$|AbstractThis project {{focused on}} {{identifying}} {{the influence of}} subject characteristics and foam properties on <b>seat</b> <b>contours</b> in order to explain the load transfer between the buttocks and cushion. <b>Seat</b> <b>contours</b> were recorded for 17 people (11 spinal cord injured and six able-bodied individuals). Contour characteristics were represented by maximum contour depth, surface area, and displaced volume. Subject characteristics were represented as intertrochanteric distance, body weight, and lower extremity muscle tone. Two foams with different degrees of stiff-ness (45 - and 55 -pound indentation load deflection [ILD]) were studied. Multiple regression equations were calculated {{for each of the}} three contour characteristics by entering in all three sub-ject attributes. While the equations differ, all six exhibited a significant Multiple R (range: 0. 79 to 0. 92). Each subject characteristic was a significant predictor of at least one contour trait (p< 0. 05). The major difference between the two cushions was the predictive ability of muscle tone. For the stiffer HR 55 foam, muscle tone was the strongest predictor of all contour characteristics. Therefore, some conclusions can be drawn con-cerning the relationship between foam stiffness, tone, and resulting <b>seat</b> <b>contours.</b> These relationships help define the dif-ferences in load transfer as subject and cushion characteristics vary and are important in the design of contoured foam for use as wheelchair cushions.

40|$|During the postambulatory period, {{patients}} with pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy depend entirely on their wheelchairs for comfort and spinal support. Without the comfort {{they are unable}} to enjoy and participate in every waking activity; without the spinal support they are destined to accept a bedbound life, not so much by the actual weakness as by the progression of spinal deformity. Present-day wheelchairs are not comfortable and they do not provide adequate spinal support. A novel spinal support system (brace) has been prescribed for 50 patients during the last 24 months. It consists of a <b>contoured</b> <b>seat,</b> mounted on a modified wheelchair frame, with integral armrests, footrests and headrest. All patients are clearly more comfortable and spend between 9 and 14 hours a day in their special wheelchairs, compared with 2 to 3 hours at a time in standard wheelchairs. Parents, teachers and therapists have reported a definite improvement in the attitudes of these patients. Although we have measured no progression in spinal deformity and have recorded regression in a few patients, we cannot yet assess the final value of this promising method of support in preventing spinal collapse...|$|R

40|$|Pressure sores are a {{major problem}} {{frequently}} encountered by persons who use wheelchairs. Custom <b>seat</b> design, including <b>contoured</b> <b>seating</b> and various modular seating devices, has become an important option for pressure relief, especially when the market size is small and the variations of individual needs and requirements are large. An alternative approach in custom seating design for pressure relief is proposed in this paper. Holes were drilled in foam cushions to lower their supporting properties, particularly at the high pressure areas. This technique is evaluated systematically in this article. The scope of this study included: 1) {{a comparison of the}} foam material properties before and after such modifications, and 2) an evaluation of the static and dynamic degradation behaviors of the foams before and after modifications. It was found that the compression load (C-L) of the foam could be reduced by up to 46 % using this simple drilling technique, while the material removed was only up to 28 % by volume. It was also found that this approach would not significantly compromise the static and dynamic degradation behaviors of the foam; that is, such modification apparently did not dramatically shorten the lifespan of the foam material. Simple hole-drilling seems to be an effective approach to altering the supportive properties of foam cushions for pressure relief. Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of a <b>contoured</b> foam <b>seat</b> (CFS) on {{postural}} alignment and on a functional upper extremity activity of engagement with toys in infants with neuromotor impairments. Parental perceptions regarding the use and effects of the CFS at home were also assessed. The participants were four infants, ages 9 to 18 months, with diagnoses including cerebral palsy and Down syndrome who were unable to sit independently. An individualized, <b>contoured</b> foam <b>seat</b> was fabricated for each participant. A randomized, alternating treatments design was employed which included the following three interventions: (1) Treatment A was a commercial highchair; (2) Treatment B was the commercial highchair with a thin foam liner on the seat; and (3) Treatment C was the CFS used as an insert in the commercial highchair. Infants were videotaped for 5 -minute observation periods, alternating Treatment A during the baseline phase and alternating Treatments B and C during the intervention phase. Using momentary time sampling, postural alignment was rated from videotapes by blinded raters using anatomical markers and visual guides placed on the highchair back. Engagement with toys was rated by recording the number of hands in contact with a toy and the number of hands or forearms in contact with the highchair tray. A semi-structured interview was conducted with mothers of the participants following three weeks of CFS use at home. Results indicated a clear, sustained effect of the CFS on improving postural alignment for all participants. The data did not support an effect of the CFS on increasing bimanual play for any participants. For two participants, increased ability to play with toys while arms were free from support of the tray was observed when using the CFS. All four mothers reported that they liked using the CFS, and that they believed the CFS had beneficial effects for themselves and their infants. These findings supported the efficacy of a low-cost seating intervention for infants with a variety of neuromotor impairments. Suggestions for other dependent measures reflective of functional skills for infants and ideas for future efficacy studies of adaptive seating devices were described...|$|R
