Unlike the massive corporate farms that have become commonplace in much of the United States, farms in North Central New Mexico tend to be small and diverse, with a political focus on community-building. In this study, thirty in-depth interviews of ten producers/owners and twenty farmworkers on organic farms in the region were conducted {{over the course of the}} 2014 growing season. I use the interview data to examine how small-scale farm work and ties to the land translate into a community-oriented political identity. In tapping into the lived experiences of farmers, I explore the principles of <b>civic</b> <b>agriculture</b> directly and demonstrate how these concepts translate for individuals embedded in the practice. Building on the definition of agrarian identity and drawing on theories of <b>civic</b> <b>agriculture</b> and social capital, I argue the farming practices in this region embody principles of social integration and cohesion despite the fact that individual farmers are not necessarily organizing into a singular “movement. ” I also take into account the orientation of local organizations toward not only promoting sustainable, localized agriculture, but also toward generating community participation in farming is central to North Central New Mexico’s narrative of <b>civic</b> <b>agriculture.</b> The results of the research imply that fusing a place-based, political identity with civic agricultural practices yields benefits for both the individual and the community.

40|$|Situated at an {{intersection}} between place studies and political theory, this thesis presents a yearlong exploration of le Champ des Possibles, a peculiar urban {{site in the}} Mile End neighbourhood, of Montréal, Québec. As a rail yard left to grow wild over several decades, {{it has become a}} site of revelry, urban <b>agriculture,</b> <b>civic</b> engagement, and artistic intervention: it is a vibrant and coveted urban wild place in the city. Place studies theorists such as Lucy Lippard, E. V. Walter, Henri Lefebvre, and Doreen Massey present place as a complex object of study; one that requires a heterodox methodology capable of incorporating the complexity of human experience, which is suggested to be central to the formation place. Similarly, the literary and artistic works of Italo Calvino, Becky Cooper, and Rebecca Solnit demonstrate a range of ways in which place can be told through narrative objects: stories, images, and maps. This thesis intervenes in contemporary place studies by moving away from subject-centred modes of analyses and toward an understanding of place itself as possessing agentic capacities. The central claim of this work suggests that cultivating an attentive, curious, and materialist approach to place forms a kind of praxis that holds the potential to interrupt our human-centred attention to place and place-based politics. From such praxis, we might learn how to pay attention and, ideally, care about the agency of non-human bodies, rhythms, and patterns. Such attention is an important component of what political theorist Jane Bennett frames as an urgent ethical project – one that might reframe the way we communicate, analyze, and act in a material world that is, always-already, a combination of human and non-human...|$|R

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of Sociology, Anthropology, and Social WorkSpencer D. WoodIt is the {{intention}} of this thesis {{to come to a}} better understanding of the factors that lead to food insecurity, a concept for understanding if people have enough food to eat. The tool for household measurement was developed by the United States Department of Agriculture, and is the backbone of the Food Security Supplement, which is conducted annually as part of the Current Population Survey. Three literature are reviewed: concentration of markets, <b>civic</b> <b>agriculture</b> and localism, and food security and nutrition. Each approaches understanding food security from a different angle offering insights along with its shortcomings. Most US studies consider food insecurity as a contributing component of poor health. In this study, I ask instead, "What are the major predictors of household food insecurity?" Using data from the Food Security Supplement of the Current Population Survey from 2000 to 2007, I use descriptive statistics and logistic regression to investigate the causes of food insecurity. I show that as currently measured food insecurity is largely a function of economic inequalities.

40|$|AbstractThe {{past decades}} {{have seen an}} accumulating body of studies {{assessing}} the benefits of smaller-scale enterprises {{on the level of}} civic and community welfare in the United States and elsewhere. In the context of producing subsistence, agriculture practice is now under a transition from large scale commodity enterprises to small scale self-sustaining civic activities. In practice, recent urban development projects emphasized the production of local food within the urban development site to promote a healthy, ecologically and economically sustainable lifestyle. This is of particular importance to the United States where more than 20 per cent of petroleum consumption goes to food processing and transportation due to the contemporary industrialized agriculture practice. This paper uses a housing development project in the United States to exemplify that <b>civic</b> <b>agriculture</b> can be integrated into urban development in the forms of community supported agriculture (CSA), kitchen gardens, farmer's market, and so on, to create a local food web, which will provide a working farm as a civic amenity on the site, allowing community members the opportunity to interact {{with each other and with}} nature, and become actively engaged with the new sustainable ways of living. The study suggests that neighborhoods that embrace a community-based environmental capitalism model of housing development can enhance the level of civic engagement among their residents, contribute to rising levels of civic welfare and socioeconomic well-being, maintain the landscape authenticity, enhance local and regional ecosystem services, reduce carbon footprint, and ultimately, promote long-term sustainability by reconnecting farm, food, and community...|$|E
40|$|The Australian food {{system is}} often {{assumed to be}} largely secure {{in the face of}} global {{environmental}} challenges such as climate change. In 2010 / 2011, serious flooding in Queensland left towns isolated, major roads and highways cut and incurred significant loss of life and property. In terms of food security, large areas of agricultural land were inundated, and food supply chains, including both long and short chains, were affected in significant ways. The impacts included increases in food prices; deterioration in food quality; reduced consumer access to food; and disruption to the sourcing, transportation and distribution of food, grocery and other items. Examining the discourses and policies surrounding food supply during and after the floods, this paper asks, what lessons for building a more resilient food system have emerged from the 2011 floods? To explore this question, we consider policy documents, media reports, interviews and fieldwork with key stakeholders. We find evidence of strong collaboration of state government and long supply chain operators, but to the general exclusion of civil society-based food chains. Long chains provide the vast bulk of food to Queensland consumers but are vulnerable when roads are cut; <b>civic</b> <b>agriculture</b> showed resilience but remained marginal to the food needs of most Queensland consumers. Both resilience and vulnerability were present within both long and short food supply chains. Yet, there is limited evidence that food security issues, beyond productivity enhancement, are being considered in discussions and policies for climate change and natural disasters. We suggest that a broader view of climate change, beyond disasters and food production, has yet to be fully integrated into food security policy—and supply chain governance and practice—in Australia...|$|E

In order to comprehend LOHAS deeply, {{the purpose of this}} research has twofold. The first one is to construct a Taiwanese LOHAS measurement scale, and the second is to apply this scale to consumers for validation. Since food-related lifestyle is most familiar to us, this study cross-validated consumers separately from food-related consumption modes of commodity and <b>civic</b> <b>agriculture.</b> By comparing their differences of LOHAS measures, the researcher can go further in validating LOHAS measurement scale. Delphi method in this research contained 2 steps, and it was used to develop and design dimensions of LOHAS lifestyle measurement scale. Those dimensions established at the first step consequently contributed to scale building. After constructing the scale, an expert analysis and survey was performed to confirm {{the reliability and validity of}} the scale. A combination of systematic and quota-sampling was executed to pick out and recruit consumers for data collection. Several statistical methods were employed to validate the reliability and validation of LOHAS scale, such as factor analysis, cluster analysis, ANOVA, and cross-tabulation analysis. Factor analysis was performed to extract LOHAS items into 16 factors, and then these factors were used by cluster analysis to classify consumers into 5 groups. According to the results, the reliability and validity of LOHAS scale were proven to be acceptable. 近十年來，樂活的概念在媒體與企業的推波助瀾下已在台灣蔚為風潮。然而至今台灣多數與樂活相關的研究仍著重於商機評估和消費者人數預測，對於樂活的定義仍不明確，學術研究也付之闕如。為深入探究台灣樂活生活型態，本研究嘗試建構台灣本土的樂活生活型態量表，為了確立量表的適切性，同時蒐集實際樣本檢證之。本研究假設商品型農業和市民農業消費者存在樂活程度上的差異，因此欲運用量表來衡量此兩型態消費者的樂活程度以確立量表效度。簡言之，本研究目的有二，一為建構台灣本土樂活生活型態量表；二則為實際運用此量表以探究其適切性。 量表構面的建構先是透過兩回合的德菲法匯集專家意見而成，隨後根據各構面蒐集相關題項以完成量表建構。量表題項共計 59 題，透過攔截式的訪問共蒐集 453 筆觀察值。 資料分析則先以探索性因素分析將樂活變項簡化為 16 個因素，接續又進行集群分析將研究對象區分成 5 個集群，依其樂活特質分別命名為：充實生活族、自律儉樸族、平淡生活族、務實求是族和寄情工作族；後續則再透過交叉檢證來確立因素分析與集群分析的準確性。在效度的部分則以農產品消費型態與樂活集群的關聯性分析和農產品消費型態之因素分析結果比較來檢證效標關聯效度之同時效度。結果顯示，樂活生活型態量表的信、效度皆在可接受的範圍內。第一章	緒論 	 1 第一節	研究緣起	 1 第二節	研究目的和重要性	 3 第二章	樂活之定義與衡量	 4 第一節	生活型態的定義	 4 第二節	健康生活型態之緣由與定義	 6 第三節	永續生活型態之緣起與定義	 7 第四節	樂活生活型態衡量工具比較	 11 第五節	樂活生活型態衡量參考構面與題項	 17 第六節	農產品消費型態與樂活生活型態之關聯	 26 第三章	研究方法	 31 第一節	研究流程圖	 31 第二節	研究對象與抽樣	 32 第三節	樂活量表的建構	 34 第四節	量表的應用與資料蒐集	 45 第五節	資料分析方法	 49 第四章	資料分析	 51 第一節	樣本分析	 51 第二節	樂活生活型態構面描述性分析	 54 第三節	樂活生活型態各構面之因素分析	 60 第四節	樂活生活型態之集群分析	 68 第五節	樂活生活型態之交叉檢證	 79 第六節	效標關聯效度	 86 第五章	結論 	 95 第一節	研究發現與討論	 95 第二節	研究限制	 98 第三節	未來研究建議	 99 參考文獻 10...|$|E

KulcsárIn the United States, {{many are}} {{critical}} of agricultural policies and economic incentives that support large-scale food production and the dominant actors in the mainstream agrifood system. Critics point out {{that at the same}} time agribusinesses and very large-scale farmers receive support, there are those in poverty who struggle to meet their food needs. Critics question what that relationship should be between civil society and the agrifood system. A variety of activities are addressing concerns of social injustices in the system. For example, participation is increasing in civic and urban agriculture. <b>Civic</b> <b>agriculture</b> is the interrelated activities of small-scale, socially and environmentally sound practices of food production and consumption that aim to increase community sustainability. Urban agriculture is food production in and near cities. By focusing on Kansas and the Kansas City metropolitan area, this dissertation addresses the following questions: How do the relations between civil society and the U. S. agrifood system impact the level of fairness in the system? To what extent are urban agricultural activities fostering fairness in the agrifood system, including access to fresh foods, civic engagement, and fulfilling careers, while also benefiting the environmental health of the city? Survey and interview data collected by a research team on agriculture in Kansas sets the context for my examination of urban agriculture in Kansas City’s urban core. In addition to participant observations and primary and secondary data analysis, I conducted 38 semi-structured interviews with growers (27), food advocates (4), community organizers (4), and governmental employees (3). In Kansas City, many of the activities and programs in place are building community, strengthening civil society, and promoting food justice for the poor and for people of color, for example, in food deserts, which are locales where people particularly face challenges in meeting their food needs. While some participants are more focused on their immediate communities and less so on overt widespread change, others feel a part of a social movement aiming to change the agrifood system. Diverse people from various social classes and races are increasingly becoming involved in growing food and food advocacy to expand fairness in the system...|$|E
