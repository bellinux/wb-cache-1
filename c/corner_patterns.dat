40|$|The {{effects of}} five {{experimental}} parameters in pulsed laser vaporization (PLV) synthesis of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were examined. Parameters investigated include the laser beam raster pattern, reactor chamber temperature, graphite particle {{size in the}} target, reactor chamber configuration, and incident laser beam power density. The type and quality of resultant SWNTs synthesized were strongly influenced by altering these experimental conditions. This information can then be utilized to allow the experimentalist to exhibit a considerable degree {{of control over the}} physical and chemical properties of the as-produced SWNT materials. Characterization of the SWNT products was achieved using a combination of Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. SWNTs synthesized using the corner to corner type laser beam raster pattern have pronounced differences in contrast to those synthesized using a linear type raster pattern. Smaller SWNT diameters result from use of a corner to <b>corner</b> raster <b>pattern.</b> Production rate of SWNT material is doubled using a one shot corner to <b>corner</b> raster <b>pattern</b> versus a one shot move linear raster pattern. These results indicate that there is a diminution of metal enrichment at the target surface was observed using the corner to <b>corner</b> raster <b>pattern</b> due to a reduction of induced localized heating of the target. Increasing reactor chamber temperature produces SWNTs with larger diameters. SWNT yields within the as-produced material increase with increasing temperature up to 1100 °C. Defect densities are decreased with increasing temperature. Smaller graphite particle sizes give higher SWNT yields. An increase in reactor chamber volume increases SWNT yield. Increasing power densities result in a decrease in SWNT diameters. By carefully controlling the power density in combination with raster pattern the amount of graphite in the final product can be minimized...|$|R

30|$|Compared to {{conductive}} {{straight line}} patterns, curves pattern with acute angle {{was known to}} have a higher electric field singularity [13]. In the conductive pattern with the acute angle, the electric field singularity increases gradually from the peripheral to the intersection of the angled pattern. On the other hand, as the angle increases to an obtuse angle, the electric field becomes higher at the edge of peripheral than the intersection point. Therefore, {{in the case of an}} acute-angle conductive pattern, the electric field at the <b>corner</b> <b>pattern</b> is high, but the obtuse angle shows the low electric field at the corner. The effect of electric field on curved patterns was verified by observing the stacks of electrospun fibers on the patterns that were acute, right and obtuse angle-edge. Figure  3 b, c, and d show the images of the electrospun fibers stacked on the conductive pattern with acute, right and obtuse angles. As expected, the fibers in the acute angle pattern could be perfectly stacked along the pattern due to the high field intensity by the field singularity (Fig.  3 b). The fibers on the right angle pattern could be stacked along the pattern, but they did not perfectly follow the conductive pattern like on the acute pattern. They stacked toward the slightly inner side of the pattern edge due to the smaller electric field compared to the acute angle pattern (Fig.  3 c). The fibers formed on the obtuse pattern did not follow up the pattern due to the weaker electric field than the surrounding area (Fig.  3 d).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} anistropic etching {{characteristics}} and convex corner undercut mechanism of (1 10) -ori-ented silicon in aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions. First, the crystal planes governing the etch {{front of the}} undercut are determined, and their etch rates are measured.

Conventionally, direction beams are used to compensate for the undercut on convex corners. This method is found to produce good results for acute convex corners, but results in the emergence of large residue structures with (111) crystal planes on the obtuse convex corners. To alleviate this problem, new corner compensation methods that use triangular and rhombic patterns are developed based on the measured etch front planes.
