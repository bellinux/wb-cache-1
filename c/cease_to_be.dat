He was released two days later. The following month, {{he was forced to}} formally <b>cease</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a monk after several monasteries refused him membership, which he said was due to their fear of government reprisals if they were to allow him to enter. He then returned to his birth name of Nyi Nyi Lwin.|$|E

5|$|In late antiquity, {{historic}} accounts {{become much}} more diffuse, and the Iazyges generally <b>cease</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mentioned as a tribe. In the late 4thcentury, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned, the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, who lived {{on opposite sides of}} the Tisza river. One theory is that these two tribes were formed when the Iazyges were conquered by the Roxolani, with the Iazyges becoming the Limigantes, and the Roxolani becoming the Argaragantes. Another theory is that a group of Slavic tribesmen gradually migrated into the area, subservient to the Iazyges, and the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes, and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Regardless of which is true, in the 5th century both of them were conquered by the Goths, and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.|$|E
5|$|In {{many cases}} {{constant}} supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may <b>cease</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may {{be replaced by}} one containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would <b>cease</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E

5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious <b>cease</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of rapid globalisation, skilled South African {{employees}} and professionals are often attracted overseas to take up new work opportunities in foreign countries. This may cause these individuals no longer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> “ordinarily resident” in South Africa. At the same time, changes in modes of travel, information and communication channels could result in companies and trusts no longer being considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tax resident in South Africa, if the place of effective management for these entities <b>is</b> moved <b>to</b> a foreign country and a double taxation agreement between South Africa and that foreign country deems these entities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exclusively resident in the foreign country. The objective of this thesis <b>was</b> <b>to</b> analyse the tax implications that could arise when a resident natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a resident or when a Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a CFC. A {{detailed analysis of the}} “exit charge” in section 9 H of the Income Tax Act <b>was</b> undertaken <b>to</b> understand its normal tax implications when a natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a resident or a CFC <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a CFC. This included an analysis of how a natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident or how a CFC <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a CFC. It was found that certain normal tax principles consistently apply to when a natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident or a CFC <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a CFC. At the same time, certain unique normal tax implications arise for trusts and CFCs since they are impacted by the special tax rules that apply to these entities. Furthermore {{in the case of a}} trust, a judicial precedent has established that the “exit charge” remains and is taxable in the trust. For CFCs, there <b>is</b> uncertainty as <b>to</b> whether the “exit charge” could arise when a shareholder <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident, which results in residents no longer holding more than 50 % of the total participation or voting rights in that foreign company...|$|R
