50|$|Motor {{and engine}} later {{came to be}} used largely interchangeably in casual discourse. However, technically, the two words have {{different}} meanings. An engine is a device that burns or otherwise <b>consumes</b> <b>fuel,</b> changing its chemical composition, whereas a motor is a device driven by electricity, air, or hydraulic pressure, which {{does not change the}} chemical composition of its energy source.

40|$|This {{research}} was aimed {{to study the}} effect of the type of fuel delivery system (petrol, dedicated or bifuel), the type of <b>consumed</b> <b>fuel</b> (petrol or gas), the portion of <b>consumed</b> <b>fuel</b> and also the duration of dual-fuelling in producing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and unburned hydrocarbons from Pride and Samand. According to research objectives, data gathering from 2000 vehicles has been done by visiting Hafiz Vehicle Inspection Center every day for 2 months. The results of this survey indicated that although there is no significant difference between various fuel delivery systems in terms of producing the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and unburned hydrocarbons by Samand, considering the emission amount of carbon dioxide, the engine performance of Pride in bifuel and dedicated state in GTXI and 132 types is more unsatisfactory than that of petrol state by 0. 3 and 0. 4 %, respectively. On the other hand, consuming natural gas increases the amount of carbon monoxide emission in dual- fuel Pride by 0. 18 % and decreases that in dual-fuel Samand by 1. 2 %, which signifies the better design of Samand in terms of fuel pumps, used kit type and other engine parts to use this alternative fuel compared to Pride. Since the portion of <b>consumed</b> <b>fuel</b> and also duration of dual-fuelling does not {{have a significant effect on}} the amount of output pollutants from the studied vehicles, it can be claimed that the output substances from the vehicle exhaust are more related to the vehicle’s condition than the fuel type...|$|R
