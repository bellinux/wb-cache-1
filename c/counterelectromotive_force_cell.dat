40|$|This paper proposes an {{enhanced}} sliding mode controller (SMC) for piezoelectric actuator based flexural mechanism (PABFM) to track desired motion trajectories. First, {{based on the}} variable structural control approach, the proposed controller is established to accommodate parameter uncertainties, nonlinearity, and unmodelled disturbances. Because the traditional sliding-mode control cannot deal with mismatched disturbances effectively, a hysteresis <b>counterelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> (CEMF) model is proposed to describe nonlinear hysteresis effect and electric-mechanical coupling of PABFM. as Similar to the CEMF voltage for a motor caused by a changing electromagnetic field due to a rotating armature, the CEMF voltage appears to PA due to polarization and molecule friction of piezomaterial. The CEMF model is identified using a charge system search (CSS). Then, the proposed SMC with CEMF compensation is studied {{to deal with the}} mismatched nonlinear disturbances. To check the consistency of the proposed SMC controller with CEMF compensation, the simulation results were compared with the experimental results. The real-time implementation validated the tracking error better than the traditional SMC...|$|R
40|$|We conduct {{comprehensive}} {{investigation of}} a semiactive vibration suppression method using piezoelectric transducers attached to structures. In our system, piezoelectric transducers are connected to an electric circuit composed of the diodes, an inductance, and a selective switch. Our method (SSDI) makes better use of <b>counterelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> to suppress the vibration, instead of simple dissipation of vibration energy. We use an actual artificial satellite to verify their high performance compared to conventional semi-active methods. As a consequence, we demonstrate that our semi-active switching method can suppress the vibration of the real artificial satellite {{to as much as}} 50 % amplitude reduction. In our experiment, we reveal that the suppression performance depends on how multiple piezoelectric transducers are connected, namely, their series or parallel connection. We draw two major conclusions from theoretical analysis and experiment, for constructing effective semi-active controller using piezoelectric transducers. This paper clearly proves that the performance of the method is the connection (series or parallel) of multiple piezoelectric transducers and the their resistances dependent on frequency...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} {{characteristics of the}} ball bearing electric motor are studied for applied steady currents ranging from 43. 5 to 70. 15 A. It is found that the ball bearing behaves like a motor when it starts self-rotating meaning that the shaft and inner race of the pair of the ball bearing system start rotating by themselves {{without the help of}} any external agent, but with a small efficiency at high currents. During self-rotation, the motor's <b>counterelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> depends on the angular velocity of the shaft and inner race. The ball bearing's behavior at low currents is also explained when it is not self-rotating, (i. e., rotating {{with the help of a}} conventional motor). In the latter case, the motor does not behave like a generator. A theory, based on the electromagnetic interactions developed within each ball, is proposed to explain the action of the ball bearing as a motor. These interactions are caused by the ball's primary currents and magnetic fields and the effects of the induced magnetic field from the current of the motor's shaft...|$|R
