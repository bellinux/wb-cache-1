40|$|Mechanical cues such as {{extracellular}} matrix stiffness and movement {{have a major}} impact on cell differentiation and function. To replicate these biological features in vitro, soft substrata with tunable elasticity and the possibility for controlled surface translocation are desirable. Here we report on the use of ultra-soft (Young’s modulus < 100 kPa) PDMS-based magnetoactive elastomers (MAE) as suitable cell culture substrata. Soft non-viscous PDMS (< 18 kPa) is produced using a modified extended crosslinker. MAEs are generated by embedding magnetic microparticles into a soft PDMS matrix. Both substrata yield an elasticity-dependent (14 vs. 100 kPa) modulation of ?-smooth muscle actin expression in primary human fibroblasts. To allow for static or dynamic <b>control</b> <b>of</b> MAE material properties, we devise low magnetic field (? 40 mT) stimulation systems compatible with cell-culture environments. Magnetic field-instigated stiffening (14 to 200 kPa) of soft MAE enhances the spreading of primary human fibroblasts and decreases PAX- 7 transcription in human mesenchymal stem cells. Pulsatile MAE movements are generated using oscillating magnetic fields and are well tolerated by adherent human fibroblasts. This MAE system provides spatial and temporal <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>substratum</b> material characteristics and permits novel designs when used as dynamic cell culture substrata or cell culture-coated actuator in tissue engineering applications or biomedical devices...|$|R

About 80 % of the resulting avalanche deposit is composed <b>of</b> <b>substrata</b> formerly residing under the volcano and in the anticlines. The collapse scar can be traced up to 5 km from the edi®ce, truncating two spreading-related anticlines, which collapsed in the event. Outcrops near the volcano preserve evidence of edi®ce material being carried along on top <b>of</b> mobilised <b>substrata.</b> On {{the north side of the}} scar, the avalanche motion was initially at right angles to the failure edge. Structural relations indicate that immediately prior to collapse the substrata disintegrated, became effec-tively liquidised, and were ejected from beneath the edi®ce.

It may have occurred through progressive rock fracture by high shear strain during spreading. Material ejected from under Socompa formed a layer on which volcanic edi®ce debris was transported.
