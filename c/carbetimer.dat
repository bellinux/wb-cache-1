40|$|<b>Carbetimer</b> {{is a new}} antineoplastic agent {{whose main}} side effects consist of {{neurotoxicity}} and long-term dose-dependent hypercalcemia. We previously showed that <b>Carbetimer</b> is a potent calcium chelator responsible for an acute decrease in ionized Ca levels observed in vivo. However, the mechanism of the progressive increase in serum Ca remains unknown. We have evaluated the bone-resorbing effects of <b>Carbetimer</b> on 45 Ca-prelabelled neonatal mouse calvariae. <b>Carbetimer</b> induced a dose-dependent increase in 45 Ca release which started at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and reached a mean of 3. 3 times the control values at 10 mg/ml. This marked increase in 45 Ca release was similar on previously killed bones {{and could not be}} inhibited by calcitonin. Such concentrations are probably therapeutically relevant given the known affinity of <b>Carbetimer</b> for bone and the large daily doses administered to cancer patients (10 - 15 g). Since <b>Carbetimer</b> could exert its antineoplastic action through immunomodulation, we also studied its effects on the production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma which are also known to affect bone metabolism. <b>Carbetimer</b> did not stimulate TNF-alpha release from isolated normal human monocytes or lymphocytes, but it markedly inhibited T-lymphocyte production of IFN-gamma, which became undetectable at a concentration of 1 mg of Carbetimer/ml. In summary, Carbetimer-induced hypercalcemia appears to be due to a direct stimulation of osteolysis, but possibly also to an inhibition of IFN-gamma production.

40|$|<b>Carbetimer</b> {{is a new}} antineoplastic agent whose {{limiting}} toxicity {{consists of}} dose- and treatment duration-dependent hypercalcemia. We examined the short-term effects of <b>Carbetimer</b> on calcium metabolism on days, 1, 3 and 5 during 11 5 -day courses (6. 5 - 8. 2 g/m 2 /day given over daily 2 -h infusions, q 3 - 4 weeks). Blood parameters were measured before and after <b>Carbetimer,</b> whereas urinary parameters were studied in three consecutive 2 -h collections before, during and after <b>Carbetimer</b> infusions. <b>Carbetimer</b> effects were similar regardless of the infusion day. We found a consistent decrease of plasma ionized Ca (Ca 2 +) levels from 4. 56 ± 0. 05 mg/dl before infusion to 42. 8 ± 0. 06 mg/dl after infusion (P < 0. 001) whereas total serum Ca (corrected for protein levels) did not change. The fall of Ca 2 + stimulated parathyroid function, {{as suggested by the}} increased plasma PTH levels, the decreased serum phosphorus and TmP/GFR index, or the increased urinary phosphate and cyclic AMP excretion. <b>Carbetimer</b> infusions also induced a marked increase in urinary Ca excretion (expressed as mg Ca/mg creatinine) from 0. 093 ± 0. 011 before to 0. 359 ± 0. 042 during and 0. 177 ± 0. 031 after infusion (P < 0. 001). These changes were best explained by Carbetimer-induced Ca chelation that we confirmed in vitro by incubating <b>Carbetimer</b> at various concentrations in whole blood for 2 h at 37 °C, e. g. 2 mg of Carbetimer/ml lowered Ca 2 + from 4. 82 to 3. 20 mg/dl without changing total Ca levels. On the other hand, a direct effect of <b>Carbetimer</b> on bone cannot be excluded since we observed an increase of serum osteocalcin levels from 2. 0 ± 0. 3 to 2. 5 ± 0. 4 ng/ml after infusion (P < 0. 001). In summary, the short-term effects of <b>Carbetimer</b> on calcium metabolism markedly differ from the long-term effects. They mainly consist of a dose-related calcium chelation leading to a decrease in Ca 2 + levels, an increase in urinary Ca excretion and a stimulation of parathyroid function.
