The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm, the SRI/MobileRobots CentiBots project and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviors. Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail.

500|$|Thomas Aquinas (c.1225–1274), {{following}} Avicenna, interpreted Aristotle to {{mean that}} there were two immaterial substances responsible for the motion of each celestial sphere, a soul that {{was an integral part of}} its sphere, and an intelligence that was separate from its sphere. [...] The soul shares the motion of its sphere and causes the sphere to move through its love and desire for the unmoved separate intelligence. [...] Avicenna, al-Ghazali, Moses Maimonides, and most Christian scholastic philosophers identified Aristotle's intelligences with the angels of revelation, thereby associating an angel with each of the spheres. [...] Moreover, Aquinas rejected the idea that celestial bodies are moved by an internal nature, similar to the heaviness and lightness that moves terrestrial bodies. [...] Attributing souls to the spheres was theologically controversial, as that <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> animals. [...] After the Condemnations of 1277, most philosophers came to [...] reject the idea that the celestial spheres had souls.|$|E

2500|$|There are MacAulays on the Uists {{that may}} descend from the Macaulays of Lewis. There are, however, others that claim no kinship with their namesakes on Lewis.

It has been claimed that these MacAulays may have ultimately originated in the Lennox area, around Loch Lomond; and that their name {{is derived from the}} Gaelic [...] Amhalgaigh, rather than a Gaelicised Norse name. If there is truth to the claim, this <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> related to the MacAulays of Ardincaple. Matheson, however, proposed that the Uist MacAulays originated on the Inner Hebridean island of Coll. Within the centre of the island are the remains of a stone fort—Dùn Anlaimh—and loch—Loch Anlaimh—named after Amhlaidh Mór. According to Coll tradition, Amhlaidh Mór was a Norse chieftain who was ultimately defeated by an ancestor of the Macleans of Coll. Matheson considered that it was possible that Amhlaidh Mór was the progenitor of the Uist MacAulays.|$|E

The progressive online magazine known as the Salon reported that the drug war violence in Mexico [...] "seldom makes the front page in the U.S" [...] newspapers. Nonetheless, they stated that many American officials are [...] "worried that the cartels are taking on aspects of an 'insurgency,' which <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> a threat to the Mexican government". The Salon noted that Grillo's book [...] "lays out the history of drug smuggling in the region over the past 100 years or so, and then homes in on the rise of the Northern Mexican cartels during the 2000s". Sylvia Longmire, a drug war analyst {{and author of the book}} Cartel: The Coming Invasion of Mexico's Drug Wars, said that one rarely comes across a writer like Grillo [...] "who really gets it". She said that Grillo also did an incredible job navigating Mexican politics and explaining the role of how the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) [...] " [...] and [...] along with the cartels, and how the transition to real democracy in 2000 dramatically altered that delicate balance". She also mentioned that Grillo proposes that the start of the Mexican Drug War did not start in 2006—a convenient historical marker because that's when Calderón took office, but rather in 2004 in Nuevo Laredo, where the Sinaloa cartel made incursions to fight off Los Zetas. Malcolm Beith, author of The Last Narco: Inside the Hunt for El Chapo, the World's Most Wanted Drug Lord, said that Grillo is the [...] "most intrepid and knowledgeable foreign journalist covering the drug war in Mexico today", and in El Narco, the author provides us with more than just a glimpse of Mexico's criminal underworld and its history. According to Beith, Grillo grants the readers [...] "access to the soul and mind of El Narco, as well as deftly explaining and providing new insight into this hemispheric war on drugs". Howard Campbell, professor in Anthropology at the University of Texas at El Paso and author of the book Drug War Zone: Frontline Dispatches from the Streets of El Paso and Juarez, said that Grillo [...] "puts a human face on the violent tragedy caused by U.S. drug demand and Mexican cartel criminality", and strongly recommends El Narco, a [...] "timely and troubling book".|$|E
