5|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer {{pertains}} to division algebras, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating {{that if a}} finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their Hauptsatz ("main theorem"): every finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field F splits over a cyclic <b>cyclotomic</b> extension. These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{factorization}} of Euclidean domains {{is useful}} in many applications. For example, the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all Pythagorean triples and in proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. Unique factorization was also {{a key element in}} an attempted proof of Fermat's Last Theorem published in 1847 by Gabriel Lamé, the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid's algorithm, based on a suggestion of Joseph Liouville. + Bn + Cn = 0 | journal = J. Math. Pures Appl. | volume = 12 | pages = 172–184}} Lamé's approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form x + ωy, where x and y are integers, and ω = e2iπ/n is an nth root of 1, that is, ωn = 1. Although this approach succeeds for some values of n (such as n=3, the Eisenstein integers), in general such numbers do not factor uniquely. This failure of unique factorization in some <b>cyclotomic</b> fields led Ernst Kummer to the concept of ideal numbers and, later, Richard Dedekind to ideals.|$|E
5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the <b>cyclotomic</b> number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E

25|$|The early proofs of {{quadratic}} reciprocity {{are relatively}} unilluminating. The situation changed when Gauss used Gauss sums {{to show that}} quadratic fields are subfields of <b>cyclotomic</b> fields, and implicitly deduced quadratic reciprocity from a reciprocity theorem for <b>cyclotomic</b> fields. His proof was cast in modern form by later algebraic number theorists. This proof served as a template for class field theory, which {{can be viewed as}} a vast generalization of quadratic reciprocity.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, every abelian {{extension}} of the rationals is such a subfield of a <b>cyclotomic</b> field – this is the content of a theorem of Kronecker, usually called the Kronecker–Weber theorem {{on the grounds that}} Weber completed the proof.|$|E
25|$|For {{an angle}} which, {{measured}} in degrees, is a rational number, the sine and the cosine are algebraic numbers, {{which may be}} {{expressed in terms of}} th roots. This results {{from the fact that the}} Galois groups of the <b>cyclotomic</b> polynomials are cyclic.|$|E
25|$|The torsion {{subgroups of}} K2i+1(Z), and {{the orders of}} the finite groups K4k+2(Z) have {{recently}} been determined, but whether the latter groups are cyclic, and whether the groups K4k(Z) vanish depends upon Vandiver's conjecture about the class groups of <b>cyclotomic</b> integers. See Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture for more details.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclotomic</b> polynomials are {{solvable}} in radicals, as {{roots of}} unity are themselves radicals. Moreover, there exist more informative radical expressions for th roots of unity {{with the additional}} property that every value of the expression obtained by choosing values of the radicals (for example, signs of square roots) is a primitive th root of unity. This was already shown by Gauss in 1797. Efficient algorithms exist for calculating such expressions.|$|E
25|$|Generally in {{abstract}} algebra, field extensions F / E can {{be studied}} by examining the Galois group Gal(F / E), consisting of field automorphisms of F leaving E elementwise fixed. As an example, the Galois group Gal (Q(ζn) / Q) of the <b>cyclotomic</b> field extension of degree n (see above) is given by (Z/nZ)×, the group of invertible elements in Z/nZ. This is the first stepstone into Iwasawa theory.|$|E
25|$|Another {{polynomial}} viewpoint is {{exploited by}} the Winograd FFT algorithm, which factorizes z'N−1 into <b>cyclotomic</b> polynomials—these often have coefficients of 1,0,or−1, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd {{can be used}} to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(N) irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern processors with hardware multipliers. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of prime sizes.|$|E
