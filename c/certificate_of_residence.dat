5000|$|The chief {{enforcement}} mechanism for this change was [...] "certificates of residence". Chinese {{already in the}} United States were required to possess [...] "certificates of residence" [...] that served as proof that they had entered the United States legally and {{had the right to}} remain in the country.

5000|$|The third {{petitioner}} {{had applied}} for a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> but had not been granted one, because all the witnesses {{he was able to}} secure were Chinese, and the Geary Act required white witnesses.

In both cases, the {{decisions were made}} based on the goal that, unless unavoidably, the acts or amendments in question should not apply retroactively.

50|$|People who {{are granted}} {{permanent}} residency {{in a country}} are usually issued some sort of documentary evidence as legal proof of this status. In the past, many countries merely stamped the person's passport indicating that the holder was admitted as a permanent resident or that he/she was exempt from immigration control and permitted to work without restriction. Other countries would issue a photo ID card, place a visa sticker or <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in the person's passport, or issue a letter to confirm their permanent resident status.|$|E
5000|$|The Geary Act, besides {{renewing}} {{the exclusion of}} Chinese laborers for another 10 years, also outlined provisions that required Chinese already in the U.S. to possess “certificates of residence” (as well as “certificates of identity” after the McCreary amendment was added) that served as proof that they entered the U.S. legally and {{had the right to}} remain in the country. The certificates of residence were to cost no more than $1($17.58 in today's money) and contained the name, age, local residence, occupation, and photograph of the applicant. The act placed the burden of proof of their right to be in the U.S. on the Chinese themselves, denied bail to Chinese in habeas corpus proceedings, made it the duty of all Chinese laborers in the U.S. to apply within one year for a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> with a duplicate kept {{in the office of the}} Collector of Internal Revenue, and suitable penalties were prescribed for any falsification of certificates. Another of the Act’s provisions required two white witnesses to testify to a Chinese person’s immigration status. If any Chinese laborer within the United States without this <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> was “deemed and adjudged to be unlawfully in the United States”, they could be arrested and forced to do hard labor, and be deported after a year. This was the first time ever illegal immigration to the U.S. was made punishable by such a harsh degree.|$|E

5000|$|Amendments made in 1884 {{tightened}} the provisions that allowed previous immigrants {{to leave and}} return, and clarified that the law applied to ethnic Chinese regardless of their country of origin. The Scott Act (1888) expanded upon the Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting reentry after leaving the U.S. Constitutionality of the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Scott Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in Chae Chan Ping v. United States (1889); the Supreme Court declared that [...] "the power of exclusion of foreigners is an incident of sovereignty belonging {{to the government of}} the United States as a part of those sovereign powers delegated by the constitution." [...] The Act was renewed for ten years by the 1892 Geary Act, and again with no terminal date in 1902. When the act was extended in 1902, it required [...] "each Chinese resident to register and obtain a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> Without a certificate, he or she faced deportation." ...|$|E
5000|$|Several Chinese {{that refused}} to {{register}} for their <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> brought suit that, upon appeal, was brought before the Supreme Court in Fong Yue Ting v. United States. Among {{some of the questions}} brought before the Court was whether the Act violated the 1868 Burlingame Treaty with China, whether hard labor and deportation constituted cruel and unusual punishment and thus violated the Eighth Amendment, whether the Act violated Fifth and Sixth Amendments protections by permitting imprisonment with hard labor without prior indictment or jury trial, whether the act violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s prohibition against the taking of property or liberty without due process, among other issues. The Court’s 5 to 3 decision, delivered by Justice Horace Gray, ruled that the if the U.S. as a sovereign nation had the power to exclude any person or any race it wished, it also must be able to deport any person or race it wished, and thus upheld the Geary Act.|$|E

5|$|The low {{turnout was}} {{attributed}} {{in part to}} poor voter registry maintenance.

This allegation {{was supported by the}} 2011 census. The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal turnout, which would otherwise have exceeded 50%.

50|$|California {{has several}} post-conviction {{remedies}} that are sometimes called expungement. For misdemeanor and felony crimes (not involving a sentence in state prison), a petition for expungement is {{filed in the}} court of conviction, seeking to have the conviction dismissed pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.4. For crimes involving a prison sentence, a petition for a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Rehabilitation (CR) is issued by the courts and filed with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Unlike an expungement, which is filed {{in the court of}} conviction, a petition for a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Rehabilitation is filed in the current county <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> If the <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Rehabilitation is granted, it automatically becomes an application for a pardon by the California Governor.|$|R
