2500|$|According to an Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet: ...After {{returning}} from a chigger-infested area, launder the field clothes in soapy, hot water (125°F.) ....As soon as possible, take a good hot bath or shower and soap repeatedly. The chiggers may be dislodged, but you will still have the stylostomes, causing the severe itch. Scratching deep to remove stylostomes can cause secondary infections. For temporary relief of itching, apply ointments of benzocaine, hydrocortisone, calamine lotion, New Skin, After Bite, or others recommended by your pharmacist or medical doctor. Some use Vaseline, <b>cold</b> <b>cream,</b> baby oil, or fingernail polish. (The sooner the treatment, the better the results.)....|$|E

5000|$|Before the 20th century, skincare {{was often}} limited to unguents, ointments, {{dermatological}} salves and <b>cold</b> <b>creams.</b> The latter is especially popular, {{and is often}} made from beeswax or lipids from the sperm whale (spermaceti). Such unstable concoctions would turn rancid very quickly, and could only be prepared by the pharmacists in small quantities as they would not keep. <b>Cold</b> <b>creams</b> made during that era were also unhygienic and very greasy. Having had some success with his multipurpose cream, Joseph Simon formulated a hygienic and more stable formulation from natural plants and flower extracts known as Crème Simon. This marked {{the creation of a}} new skin preparation, simply termed as [...] "Crème" [...] which would later signal the birth of modern cosmetology of the 20th century.|$|R

40|$|A {{new model}} for {{producing}} <b>cold</b> filled <b>cream</b> cheese was developed. Fresh milk was fermented to pH 4. 8 {{and allowed to}} drain in a cotton bag over night. The obtained cream cheese base was processed by heating, homogenization, and filling into beakers (hot filled) or alternatively by cooling to 40 °C after homogenization and subsequently filled in beakers (cold filled). The rheological properties of hot and <b>cold</b> filled <b>cream</b> cheese were characterized, after two days storage at 4 °C, using a penetration test as well as flow curves. Results showed that the peak force of <b>cold</b> filled <b>cream</b> cheese was only ~ 25 % of the hot filled cream cheese, as was the area to peak. The hot filled cream cheese exhibited higher Young’s Modulus compared to the <b>cold</b> filled <b>cream</b> cheese as well whereas the latter had a higher initial shear stress and apparent viscosity. Cooling using a scraped surface heat exchanger (SSHE) prior to packaging thus reduced the firmness and modified the texture profile of cream cheese...|$|R

It is also used in Indian sweets and other food preparations (particularly gulab jamun). Rose water is often sprinkled in Indian weddings to welcome guests.|$|R

60|$|In bed, {{he could}} not sleep because of his pain, and hour by hour she worked over him, {{renewing}} the hot compresses over his bruises, soothing the lacerations with witch hazel and <b>cold</b> <b>cream</b> and the tenderest of finger tips.

Her face, guiltless of powder or <b>cold</b> <b>cream,</b> was still shining with the healthy perspiration of her last labors as she promptly took the vacant chair beside Mainwaring.|$|E
50|$|While the {{advantages}} of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks. Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil-based substances as lubricants, such as petroleum jelly, cooking oil, baby oil, mineral oil, skin lotions, suntan lotions, <b>cold</b> <b>creams,</b> butter or margarine. Contact with oil makes latex condoms more likely to break or slip off due to loss of elasticity caused by the oils. Additionally, latex allergy precludes use of latex condoms {{and is one of}} the principal reasons for the use of other materials. In May 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the production of condoms composed of Vytex, latex that has been treated to remove 90% of the proteins responsible for allergic reactions. An allergen-free condom made of synthetic latex (polyisoprene) is also available.|$|R

Words could hardly express his gratitude, and nothing but the hope of meeting Sid with this glorious news would have torn him from the reposeful Paradise where he longed to linger. Pluck and perseverance, with <b>cold</b> <b>cream</b> on the blistered heels, got him into his shoes again, and he rode away in a horse-car, as in a triumphal chariot, to find his brother.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{were these}} the only tokens of dispersal.

Largess, {{in the form of}} odds and ends of <b>cold</b> <b>cream</b> and pomatum, and also of hairpins, was freely distributed among the attendants. On charges of inviolable secrecy, confidences were interchanged respecting golden youth of England expected to call, ‘at home,’ on the first opportunity. Miss Giggles (deficient in sentiment) did indeed profess that she, for her part, acknowledged such homage by making faces at the golden youth; but this young lady was outvoted by an immense majority.|$|E
60|$|When the sun peeped {{into the}} girls' room early {{next morning to}} promise them a fine day, he saw a comical sight.

Meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with <b>cold</b> <b>cream,</b> Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature. It {{was one of the}} kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} types of ice cream in Thailand. First, ice cream in the palace was made of coconut juice with roasted {{tamarind}} on top. Second, ice cream for the public was coconut ice cream {{with the scent of}} the Nommaeo flower with a slight sweet taste. The ice cream [...] "tube" [...] was born during the reign of Rama VII. Its ingredients were contained inside a zinc tube which was shaken until it solidified, then skewered stick to serve as a handle. It was sold by mobile vendors using dry ice and salt to keep the ice <b>cream</b> <b>cold.</b> Eventually, ice <b>cream</b> was manufactured and sold in small cups.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ladies?" [...] said Pogue, with Western chivalry. [...] "Well, not to {{any great}} extent.

But if he drops a penny in one of the {{machines}} run by the Madam Eve's Daughters' Amalgamated Association and the pineapple chewing gum don't fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks away. Man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against. He's the low-grade one, and she has to work overtime to make him pay. Two times out of five she's salted. She can't put in crushers and costly machinery. He'd notice 'em and be onto the game. They have to pan out what they get, and it hurts their tender hands. Some of 'em are natural sluice troughs and can carry out $1,000 to the ton. The dry-eyed ones have to depend on signed letters, false hair, sympathy, the kangaroo walk, cowhide whips, ability to cook, sentimental juries, conversational powers, silk underskirts, ancestry, rouge, anonymous letters, violet sachet powders, witnesses, revolvers, pneumatic forms, carbolic acid, moonlight, <b>cold</b> <b>cream</b> and the evening newspapers." ...|$|E
60|$|Katy {{would meet}} {{him at the door}} with a kiss flavored with <b>cold</b> <b>cream</b> and butter-scotch. He would remove his coat, sit upon a macadamized lounge and read, in the evening paper, of Russians and Japs {{slaughtered}} by the deadly linotype. For dinner there would be pot roast, a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather, stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label. After dinner Katy would show him the new patch in her crazy quilt that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his four-in-hand. At half-past seven they would spread newspapers over the furniture to catch the pieces of plastering that fell when the fat man in the flat overhead began to take his physical culture exercises. Exactly at eight Hickey & Mooney, of the vaudeville team (unbooked) in the flat across the hall, would yield to the gentle influence of delirium tremens and begin to overturn chairs under the delusion that Hammerstein was pursuing them with a five-hundred-dollar-a-week contract. Then the gent at the window across the air-shaft would get out his flute; the nightly gas leak would steal forth to frolic in the highways; the dumbwaiter would slip off its trolley; the janitor would drive Mrs. Zanowitski's five children once more across the Yalu, the lady with the champagne shoes and the Skye terrier would trip downstairs and paste her Thursday name over her bell and letter-box--and the evening routine of the Frogmore flats would be under way.|$|E

I say us; but I mean me. Everybody for four nations, two oceans, one bay and isthmus, and five archipelagoes around had heard of Judson Tate. Gentleman adventurer, they called me.

If the beauty of Fergus McMahan gained any part of our reception in Oratama, I'll eat the price-tag in my Panama. It was me that they hung out paper flowers and palm branches for. I am not a jealous man; I am stating facts. The people were Nebuchadnezzars; they bit the grass before me; there was no dust in the town for them to bite. They bowed down to Judson Tate.
