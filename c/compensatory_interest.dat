40|$|The {{full text}} of this article will not be {{available}} until the embargo expires on the 10 / 02 / 2020 The literature on proactivity has focused primarily on its positive performance outcomes. However, the effects of proactive behavior on employees 2 ̆ 7 well-being are relatively unknown. We theorize that when an individuals 2 ̆ 7 motivation at work is characterized by pressure and coercion (high controlled motivation), with no <b>compensatory</b> intrinsic <b>interest</b> in or identification with the work (low autonomous motivation), proactive behavior is likely to deplete employees 2 ̆ 7 resources, resulting in job strain. We tested this proposition in a lagged study of 127 employee-supervisor dyads {{across a variety of}} sectors. As expected, supervisor-rated proactive work behavior was positively associated with job strain when controlled motivation was high and when autonomous motivation was also low. Under all other conditions, there was no effect of proactive behavior on job strain. For example, when individuals experienced high controlled motivation yet also experienced autonomous motivation, there was no effect of proactive behavior on job strain. In sum, proactive behavior has costs in terms of job strain only when employees experience a sense of pressure and obligation in their work {{in the absence of any}} compensating autonomous motivation.

40|$|Service {{providers}} (aka executives) to {{partnerships and}} to corporations confront {{a number of}} choices as to how their compensatory arrangement may be structured and the tax consequences thereof. In the simplest case, an individual may render services to an enterprise in return for cash payments over the period of service. In this non-equity setting, the issue is straightforward and non-controversial. The service provider is treated as receiving ordinary income for services rendered. The return {{on his or her}} expenditure of human capital is taxed at progressive rates. Once the relationship between the service provider and the enterprise becomes more complicated through the service provider 2 ̆ 7 s receipt of an equity interest in the enterprise, the tax treatment of the return becomes more complex. If the service provider receives an equity interest in return for services, the issue of whether the receipt of, and return on, the equity interest is attributable to human capital or invested capital is confronted. A tension arises between conceptualizing the receipt of and return on an equity interest and the economic enhancement which it generates as a return on human capital, generating ordinary income, or as a return on invested capital, which in certain settings may be taxed preferentially as capital gain. In the corporate context, stock in the corporation may be issued in return for the rendition of future services. It may be transferred outright, i. e., free and clear, or be restricted, i. e., conditioned upon the rendition of services for a fixed period of time. Various tax issues are confronted—when is the income taken into account, what amount is taken into account, what is the character of the income from such receipt, and whether and to what extent its compensatory origin must be segregated from any subsequent appreciation in the equity interest. Subchapter K raises similar issues in the services-for-equity context regarding partnerships, but the tax consequences arise under a single tax, rather than double tax, regime for the enterprise. However, in the partnership context, three types of equity interests may be utilized for compensatory purposes, i. e., a capital interest with an attendant right to profits, a restricted capital with profits interest, and a pure profits interest. Critics have recently advocated a change in the tax treatment of the return from a <b>compensatory</b> profits <b>interest</b> in a partnership. They conclude that the current tax treatment of the receipt of and return on such an interest is seriously flawed, violating fundamental principles of tax policy. Unfortunately, such advocacy is limited to a narrow analysis of the results generated by a compensatory receipt of a profits interest and lacks a thorough comparison with, and analysis of, the treatment of the traditional compensatory equity transfers in the two dominant business contexts employed in the United States economy, i. e., partnerships and corporations. This Article provides a broader discussion of compensatory equity transfers (capital interests as well as profits interests) in the partnership context and discusses the similarities and dissimilarities between these compensatory arrangements and those arising in the corporate setting. By doing so, this Article illustrates the erroneous assumption that profits interests derive unique and unfair tax treatment. The recent assault on the status quo treatment of a profits interest in a partnership has gathered momentum, in large part due to the inflammatory rhetoric which attends the academic commentary and the focus by the media on the economic success of private equity ventures. Bills have been introduced in Congress to mandate that such receipts generate ordinary income, rather than preferential capital gain, to the recipient. To date, none has been enacted. However, with the economic freefall and the Congressional need to generate additional tax revenues, the issue of the proper taxation of a compensatory transfer of a profits interest in a partnership will likely be revisited in the next legislative session. By focusing on but one of the five traditional types of available equity transfers (a profits interest), most of the academic commentary has confused, rather than clarified, the need for reform. The treatment of the return on human capital and on invested capital has never been as clear or as singular as commentators suggest. The Code, for sound policy reasons, refrains from disentangling the return on human capital from the return on invested capital when the service provider 2 ̆ 2 re-invests 2 ̆ 2 his or her return on human capital in the enterprise by foregoing annual compensation. With regard to profits interests, the role of § 702 (b), which requires that all partners in a partnership, regardless of how they acquired ownership of their interest, characterize the nature of their share of the income at the partnership, not the partner, level, is overlooked. Additionally, <b>compensatory</b> profits <b>interests</b> possess implicit, if not explicit, restrictions on transfer and thus require treatment akin to that accorded restricted capital interests in a partnership and restricted corporate stock. Finally, some of the treatment accorded profits interests is attributable to the fundamental differences between the tax treatment of partnerships (single level of tax) and corporations (double level of tax), which some critics either minimize or ignore. Accordingly, this Article critiques proposals for change with regard to the suggested modification of the tax treatment of profits interests, in large measure by illustrating the misperception of the current operation of Subchapter K of the Code and enterprise equity compensation as a whole. The entire field of compensatory transfers of equity interests and the allocation of the return therefrom to human capital and/or invested capital is surveyed from a tax policy standpoint. In this broader context, the status quo (subject to an elective defect) from a normative standpoint is equal, or superior, to any of the proposals recently advanced. Finally, with the misdirected emphasis on the tax treatment of profits interests, the real opportunity for reform of the area is overlooked. The ability to recognize income in the year of receipt of a restricted <b>compensatory</b> equity <b>interest</b> under § 83 (b) permits recipients to minimize the impact of the progressive rates. This treatment is far more inconsistent with the taxation of human capital than is the current tax treatment of <b>compensatory</b> profits <b>interests.</b> As a modest proposal for reform, this Article advances the repeal of § 83 (b) which, if enacted, would constitute significantly broader reform than recent proposals and would result in an overall improvement of the current tax law from a policy standpoint...|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} increasingly held by academics is {{that the}} current tax treatment of such receipts is improper and should be obvious to all. 6 Apparently, the small but determined group which defends the status quo 7 not only fails to appreciate {{the clarity of the}} situation, 8 but their analysis is derisively dismissed as sophistry and their motives impugned for acting as tools of the establishment. As the lowly representative of the Gang of Three, and the only one apparently not smart enough to be paid for his advocacy, 2 ̆ 70 notwithstanding the intensity and inventiveness of the presenters 2 ̆ 7 advocacy, I remain unconvinced. My support for the status quo appears elsewhere and is most detailed and recommended for those with further interest. 2 ̆ 2 Herein, I will limit my response to the larger themes of equity compensation in the business enterprise context, with cross references to my prior work for those who wish to pursue the matter further. The overriding criticism by the presenters of the status quo for recipients of <b>compensatory</b> profits <b>interests</b> is the lack of parity among similarly-situated recipients. Both make their case for changing the current tax treatment of carried interests because of this defect. The virtues of horizontal equity are extolled by the presenters. 12 However, the difficulty in the application of the tax policy guideline emphasizing horizontal equity is in ensuring that one is comparing the relevant parties, i. e., apples to apples, in making the assessment. Many advance the employee as the center point for comparison because the return on their services is taxed at progressive rates. 13 I instead offer the corporate or partnership executive as the appropriate focal point, whose return from his expenditure and investment of services under the current tax law is frequently entitled to preferential treatment...|$|R
