5|$|All seven PCI Express x16 {{slots in}} the Asus P6T7 {{motherboard}} {{were used in}} the building of the Fastra II computer. However, the video cards in the Fastra II are wide enough to require two such slots each. To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables, and Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> suspend over the motherboard.|$|E

5|$|In June 2009, a {{group of}} {{consumers}} filed the class action suits Owens v. Apple, Inc. and Johnson v. Apple Inc. against Apple on behalf of American individuals who purchased iTunes gift cards and who were then unable to use the <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> purchase iTunes music at the price advertised on the card because Apple raised {{the price of the}} music after it sold the <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> consumers. The Johnson case absorbed the Owens case and was settled on February 10, 2012, with payments to be made to consumers by Apple. The Owens complaint alleged that Apple wrongfully marketed, distributed, and sold iTunes gift cards and songs through its online iTunes store, while representing that consumers could use the gift <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> purchase songs for US$.99 a song and then, after such gift cards were purchased, raised the price on certain songs to $1.29 on April 7, 2009. The lawsuit's allegations included that Apple's conduct constituted breach of contract, violated the state consumer fraud statute, and violated consumer protection statutes of other states. The plaintiffs sought a $.30 refund remedy for each song that class members purchased using a $.99 iTunes card for which they were charged $1.29, plus their attorneys' fees and costs. Apple mounted a vigorous defense and sought to dismiss the suit but lost its motion in December 2009. Individuals are part of the class of plaintiffs if they are U.S. residents who purchased or received an iTunes Gift Card on which the card itself or its packaging contained language to the effect that songs were priced at $0.99 and who used the card to purchase one or more $1.29 songs from the iTunes Store on or before May 10, 2010. The settlement provides class members with an iTunes Store credit of $3.25 if an online claim form was submitted on or before September 24, 2012.|$|E

5|$|The episode's {{title is}} derived from the 1965 Milton Bradley board game for teenage girls, Mystery Date, wherein several female players draw <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> advance to opening a door, hoping to find one of a variety of {{desirable}} male dates on the other side, while simultaneously hoping to avoid the lone undesirable one. A vintage television commercial for the game is viewed by Don's daughter Sally during the episode.|$|E
50|$|Each {{defending}} {{player who}} was trapped, {{has to pay}} {{a tribute to the}} offense team. A tribute is the highest card in his hand.

5|$|Expansion {{sets are}} {{currently}} released in a two-set block, {{starting with a}} large set and ending with a smaller one three months later. Prior to 2016, expansion sets were released in a three-set block (again, beginning with a larger set followed by two smaller sets). These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards. Contrasting with the wide-ranging Core Set, each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> a handful of particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use cannabis but only when prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and help those who needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 {{session of}} the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, {{successfully}} enacted a voter registration law that required voters to show a government issued photo ID before they could be permitted to vote. The law {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, like the ACLU, opposed the bill saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly voters who may be unable to afford an ID or may be physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially address those concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to offer free state photo ID <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.|$|E

5|$|Parrish, {{upset with}} the {{ineffectiveness}} of the association, proposed forming a players' union, that would be independent of the NFLPA, {{with the assistance of}} the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union. In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player Jim Brown, began distributing union <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes. The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in Hollywood, Florida, during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an independent union. Although Parrish's proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union. He was later replaced by two Chicago labor lawyers, Dan Schulman and Bernie Baum.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{were held}} {{six days a}} week at the Pushkin Theatre, usually from 10am to 1pm. They were {{frequently}} interrupted by air-raid sirens, and some musicians were required to undertake anti-aircraft or firefighting duties. To enable them to attend rehearsals, performers were granted orchestral ID <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> show at checkpoints. Members of the military orchestra (and some ordinary troops) were dispatched to the rehearsals to supplement the performers. Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June, and in late July were increased to 5–6 hours a day. Instruments were in poor condition and few repairmen were available; one oboist was asked for a cat in exchange for a repair, as the starving repairman had already eaten several.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{set of rules}} prescribed that all games were to be played for ante. Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted folks {{to play with the}} cards rather than collect them. For Magic, each player removed a card at random from the deck they wished to play with and the two cards would be set aside as the ante. At the end of the match, the winner would take and keep both cards. Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> the ante, or even permanently trading cards in play.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of academic, peer-reviewed research concerning {{different aspects of}} Magic: The Gathering.

Another example used online auctions for Magic <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> test revenue outcomes for various auction types. A final example uses probability to examine Magic card-collecting strategies. Using {{a specific set of}} cards in a specialized manner has shown Magic: The Gathering to be Turing complete.|$|E

After recovering three of the lost artifacts, the player fails to recover the last one, the Ark of the Covenant, which {{takes the form of a}} nuclear warhead. The player is able to choose one of three endings, depending on whether they decide to enter a final doorway in the chambers of one of the two opposing factions represented by Kether and Malchut, or enter a new central chamber via the Bequest Globe.|$|E

5|$|Chain of Memories was {{announced}} along with Kingdom Hearts II at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2003. Initial details included {{the switch to}} 2D graphics, the use of <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> perform attacks, and that compressed movies would be utilized in some cut scenes. The cut scene animations were rendered using the graphical engine of the PlayStation 2 iteration and then encoded for the Game Boy Advance by using a technology developed by Japanese company, AM3. To help market the game, Disney and Square Enix launched official Japanese websites. A playable demo was first {{made available to the}} public at the 2003 Jump Festa in Japan; this demo and subsequent demos highlighted the card-based combat system. Aside from information gathered from the opening sequences, most details regarding the story were kept secret until the release.|$|E
