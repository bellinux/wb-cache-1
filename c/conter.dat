2500|$|It must {{be noted}} that {{anglicism}} is a political term and does not necessarily indicate the etymology or history of the word itself. Rather, it indicates the common attitudes and perceptions about the (theoretically English) history of the word. For example, because English itself borrowed a great amount of French vocabulary after the Norman Conquest, some anglicisms are actually Old French words that dropped from usage in French over the centuries but were preserved in English and have now come full circle back into French. For instance, one attested origin of the verb [...] "to flirt" [...] cites influence from the Old French expression <b>conter</b> fleurette, which means [...] "to (try to) seduce". (Other possible origins for the word include flit, E. Frisian flirt (a flick or light stroke) and E. Frisian flirtje (a giddy girl)). This expression is no longer used in French, but the English Gallicism [...] "to flirt" [...] has now returned to French and is considered an anglicism, despite its likely French origins.|$|E
2500|$|The 104th Brigade battalions {{moved forward}} to tapes {{laid out in}} no man's land at [...] to evade the dawn {{bombardment}} by the German artillery of the British front line. The advance began at [...] behind a creeping barrage moving at [...] in eight minutes. The 23rd Manchester on the right flank lost touch with the 16th Royal Scots of the 34th Division because it had drawn back to avoid bombardment from both artilleries. The advance continued for about [...] to the first objective, where machine-gun fire from huts on both flanks was received, all but fifty men of the leading waves becoming casualties. The survivors made a slow withdrawal to the start line. The 20th Lancashire Fusiliers were ordered forward and the 17th Royal Scots moved up to a line from Koekuit to Namur Crossing. On the left, the 17th Lancashire Fusiliers followed the barrage along a road from Colombo House to Maréchal Farm, with the 16th Battalion Cheshire Regiment on the left. The 17th Lancashire reached Colombo House and by [...] had reached the final objective. A company of the 18th Lancashire which was {{to fill the gap}} created by the diverging advance of the attacking troops strayed to the left flank, which caused a delay as they moved across to the right. The company advanced into Houthulst Forest but was fired on by machine-guns on the right flank, which was unsupported and forced to retreat to the fringe of the woods. Other troops had reached their objective along <b>Conter</b> Drive, which ran through Houthulst Forest past Maréchal Farm to Vijfwegen, in touch with the 17th Lancashire. To cover the right flank, two companies of the 20th Lancashire went forward and at about [...] took over from [...] beyond angle Point to [...] in advance of Aden House on the right of the 17th Lancashire but no troops of the 34th Division could be found except for five wounded men. By noon, the brigade held a line from Maréchal Farm, a short stretch of <b>Conter</b> Drive and back to huts [...] to the north-east of Angle Point thence to Aden House.|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, the 35th Division {{historian}} H. M. Davson, {{wrote that}} the loss of contact with the 34th Division on the right had allowed German troops to retreat and then fire on the 35th Division troops from the flanks and behind. The German pillboxes near huts beyond Aden House had a commanding view and caused many casualties. Despite the care taken planning the creeping barrage, some units which had to advance through undergrowth found it too fast and others moving in the open thought it was too slow. The troops moving through undergrowth had either lost the barrage or plunged forward so vigorously that they reached the objective in an exhausted state. Once the advance had reached its limit, German aircraft strafed the British troops from low altitude and German troops used the trees in Houthulst Forest beyond the British objective for cover and sniped at the British despite a shrapnel barrage, until the 35th Division was relieved. Potte Drief, a road running parallel to <b>Conter</b> Drive about [...] away, had been camouflaged and the Germans could move along it unseen.|$|E

40|$|Any {{attempt in}} the area of {{substance}} abuse treatment without paying especial attention to client motivation has often been regarded as failure. It is now widely acknowledged that Motivation is a crucial component of behavior change, especially so {{in the area}} of addictive behavior. It is commonly believed that addicts show specific internal and enduring personality charasteristics such as lack of motivation to change, and the use of defense mechanisms such as denial, projection and rationalization wich is often believed to prevent addicts from recognizing their Problem. Miller and Rollnick (1991) by reffering to this as “ ambivalence about change “, argue that (MI) is an approach to help chlients resolve this ambivalence. (MI) views motivation as a fluctuating state of readiness to consider changing a behavior. They define (MI) as a directive, client – <b>contered</b> couselling style for helping addicts explore and resolve the ambivalence about changing addictive behaviour. Prochaska and DiClemente (1984) have offered a comprehensive cognitive – behavioural outpatient counseling approach for substance abusers. This program includes six components: 1 -precontemplation, 2 -contemplation, 3 - preparation, 4 - action, 5 - maintenance, and 6 -relapse. The goals of present article are three – fold: In the first step, it introduces a brief form of motivational Interviewing for addictive behaviors. Its primary basis is the idea that most substance abusers seek medical treatment without being ready to change addictive behaviors. As a result, attempts the addicts to change often lead to their resistance. Therefore, the use of motivational interviewing (MI) in which clients are directed towards realizing their own reasons and arguments for changing their behavior, seems to be most oppropriate to motivate and prepare them for change. In the second step, the article tries to discuss advantages of motivational interviewing approach to often opproaches (e. g, skills training approach, Indirect approach and confrontational – denial approach) and suggests that (MI) is the most appropriate strategy for the substance abusers, according to their degree of readiness for change. Finally in the third step, the article attempts to indicate the current dominant strategies of addiction treatment in Iran and concludes that due to dominance and commonality of medicine – based treatment strategies of addictive behaviors, (MI) could be introduced as an alternative and appropriate treatment strategy for drug addicts in Iran...|$|R
