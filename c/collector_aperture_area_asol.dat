Due to system complexity, extensive engineering, design and equipment costs; the installation costs of solar thermal cooling systems are prohibitively high. In efforts to overcome these limitations, a novel sorption heat pump module has been developed and directly integrated into a solar thermal collector. The module comprises a fully encapsulated sorption tube containing hygroscopic salt sorbent and water as a refrigerant, sealed under vacuum with no moving parts. A 5. 6 m 2 <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> outdoor laboratory-scale system of sorption module integrated solar collectors was installed in Stockholm, Sweden and evaluated under constant re-cooling and chilled fluid return temperatures {{in order to assess}} collector performance.

By developing an integrated, multi-purpose solar energy system, that can operate all twelve months of the year, a high utilisation factor can be achieved which translates to more economical systems. However, there are still some techno-economic barriers to the general commercialisation and market penetration of such technologies. These are associated with high system and installation costs, significant system complexity, and lack of knowledge of system implementation and expected performance. A sorption heat pump module that can be integrated directly into a solar thermal collector has thus been developed in order to tackle the aforementioned market barriers. This has been designed for the development of cost-effective pre-engineered solar energy system kits that can provide both heating and cooling. This thesis summarises the characterisation studies of the operation of individual sorption modules, sorption module integrated solar collectors and a full solar heating and cooling system employing sorption module integrated collectors. Key performance indicators for the individual sorption modules showed cooling delivery for 6 hours at an average power of 40 W and a temperature lift of 21 °C. Upon integration of the sorption modules into a solar collector, measured solar radiation energy to cooling energy conversion efficiencies (solar cooling COP) were between 0. 10 and 0. 25 with average cooling powers between 90 and 200 W/m 2 <b>collector</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>area.</b> Further investigations of the sorption module integrated collectors implementation in a full solar heating and cooling system yielded electrical cooling COP ranging from 1. 7 to 12. 6 with an average of 10. 6 for the test period.

40|$|Since {{the gains}} {{associated}} with {{solar thermal energy}} technologies are comparatively small {{in relation to the}} required capital investment, it is vital to maximize conversion efficiency. While providing the necessary function of freeze protection, the heat exchanger commonly included in solar domestic water heating systems represents a system inefficiency. This thesis explores two alternate methods of providing freeze protection without resorting to a heat exchanger. Commonly, collectors are made of rigid copper tubes separated by copper or aluminum fins. Cracking damage can occur when water is allowed to freeze and expand inside the non compliant tubes. The possibility of making collectors out of an elastic material was investigated and shown to be effective. Since unlike copper, elastomers typically have low thermal conductivities, the standard collector performance prediction equations do not apply. Modified thermal performance prediction equations were developed which can be used for both low and high thermal conductivity materials to provide accurate predictions within a limited range of plate geometries. An elastomeric collector plate was then designed and shown to have comparable performance to a copper plate <b>collector</b> whose <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> is approximately 33 % smaller. Another options for providing freeze protection to an SDHW system is to turn it off during the winter. Choosing a three-season operating period means two things. First, the system will have different optimums such as slope and collector area. Second, the wintertime solar energy incident on the collector is unavailable for meeting a heating load. However, the system`s heat exchanger becomes unnecessary and removing it increases the amount of energy that arrives at the storage tank during those periods in which the system is operating...|$|R

Three types of solar collector consisting of flat plate, evacuated tube, and compound parabolic solar collectors are compared to investigate their performances. The performances consist {{of the behavior of}} heat which can be absorbed by the collectors, heat loss from the collectors and outlet temperature of working fluid at several slopes of the solar collectors. The new accurate analysis method of heat transfer is conducted to predict the performance of the solar collectors. The analysis is based on several assumptions, i. e. sky condition at Bandung is clear and not raining from 08. 00 until 17. 00 and thermal resistance at cover and absorber plate is negligible. The numerical calculation results confirm that performance of the evacuated tubes solar collector at the same operating conditions is higher than the others. For the case of an evacuated-tubes solar <b>collector</b> system with <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> of 3. 5 m 2, the maximum heat which can be absorbed is 3992 W for the highest solar intensity of 970 W/m 2 at 12. 00 with horizontal position of the solar collector.

[...] It describes the percentage of the physical <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> which actually captures radio frequency (RF) energy. Thus, the effective <b>area</b> of an <b>aperture</b> antenna is the surface area of a theoretically perfect aperture that would collect the same energy as the actual aperture with associated antenna efficiency.|$|R
40|$|A useful {{measure of}} sensor {{performance}} is the transceiver system efficiency n (sub sys). Which {{consists of the}} antenna efficiency n (sub a) and optical and electronic losses. Typically, the lidar equation and the antenna efficiency are {{defined in terms of}} the telescope <b>aperture</b> <b>area.</b> However, during the assembly of a coherent transceiver, it is important to measure the system efficiency before the installation of the beamexpanding telescope (i. e., the untruncated-beam system efficiency). Therefore, to accommodate both truncated and untruncated beam efficiency measurements, we define the lidar equation and the antenna efficiency in terms of the beam area rather than the commonly used <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> referenced definition. With a well-designed Gaussian-beam lidar, <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> referenced system efficiencies of 15 to 20 % (23 - 31 % relative to the beam area) are readily achievable. In this paper we compare the differences between these efficiency definitions. We then describe techniques by which high efficiency can be achieved, followed by a discussion several novel auto alignment techniques developed to maintain high efficiency...|$|R
