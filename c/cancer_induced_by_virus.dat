40|$|International audienceToll-like {{receptor}} 9 (TLR 9) plays a {{major role}} in the fight against DNA viruses infections. Despite its antitumor properties, inappropriate activation of TLR 9 during chronic inflammation may cause the activation of transcription factors inducing pro-cancerous activities. Thus, the relationship between TLR 9 and cancer remains highly confrontational especially in gynecological cancers and cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>viruses.</b> In this review, we focus on the beneficial and detrimental role of TLR 9 in gynecological carcinogenesis. TLR 9 contributes to tumor regression <b>by</b> <b>inducing</b> cytotoxic T cell response (CTL), reducing the numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the regulatory T cells (T regs). It can however, also promote tumor progression and invasiveness of cervical tissue. Therefore, the dichotomous role of TLR 9 needs to be carefully investigated in the setting of neoplastic disease...|$|R
40|$|During interphase, {{each cell}} {{contains}} a single centrosome {{that acts as}} a microtubule organizing center for cellular functions in interphase and in mitosis. Centrosome amplification during the S phase of the cell cycle is a tightly regulated process to ensure that each daughter cell receives the proper complement of the genome. The controls that ensure that centrosomes are duplicated exactly once in the cell cycle are not well understood. In solid tumors and hematological malignancies, centrosome abnormalities resulting in aneuploidy is observed in the majority of cancers. These phenotypes are also observed in <b>cancers</b> <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>viruses,</b> including adult T cell lymphoma which is caused by the human T cell lymphotrophic virus Type 1 (HTLV- 1). Several reports have indicated that the HTLV- 1 transactivator, Tax, is directly responsible for the centrosomal abnormalities observed in ATL cells. A recent paper in Nature Cell Biology by Ching et al. has shed some new light into how Tax may be inducing centrosome abnormalities. The authors demonstrated that 30 % of ATL cells contained more than two centrosomes and expression of Tax alone induced supernumerary centrosomes. A cellular coiled-coil protein, Tax 1 BP 2, was shown to interact with Tax and disruption of this interaction led to failure of Tax to induce centrosome amplification. Additionally, down-regulation of Tax 1 BP 2 led to centrosome amplification. These results suggest that Tax 1 BP 2 may be an important block to centrosome re-duplication that is observed in normal cells. Presently, a specific cellular protein that prevents centrosome re-duplication has not been identified. This paper has provided further insight into how Tax induces centrosome abnormalities that lead to ATL. Lastly, additional work on Tax 1 BP 2 will also provide insight into how the cell suppresses centrosome re-duplication during the cell cycle and the role that Tax 1 BP 2 plays in this important cellular pathway...|$|R
40|$|Retroviruses are RNA {{viruses that}} reverse-transcribe their RNA into proviral DNA. These viruses are {{associated}} {{with a wide variety of}} cancers in chickens, mice, cats, and monkeys. Some retroviruses cause a specific type of cancer soon after infection in a high proportion of animals, whereas others cause various cancers late after infection in a lower proportion of animals. Highly oncogenic retroviruses are recombinants of viral and host genes. The <b>cancers</b> <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> these <b>viruses</b> are determined <b>by</b> the transduced host gene. Retroviruses that cause cancer at a low incidence do not contain inserted host information. Rather, they appear to cause cancer via mutation of the expression of potentially oncogenic host genes. During their normal life cycle, retroviruses integrate proviral DNA into the chromosomal DNA of their host. Integrations occur at many dif-ferent sites. Most integrations are benign, but some result in cancer. Retroviral research has identified 12 potentially onocogenic host genes. Each is associated with a charac-teristic cancer or spectrum of cancers. Several appear to code for protein kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues.

The meeting included keynote addresses on checkpoint blockade in cancer therapy and recent advances in therapeutic vaccination against <b>cancer</b> <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> Human Papilloma <b>Virus</b> 16. Participants from 29 countries interacted through oral presentations, panel discussions, and posters on topics that included dendritic cells and cancer, targeted therapeutics and immunotherapy, innate/adaptive immune interplay in cancer, clinical trial endpoints, vaccine combinations, countering negative regulation, immune cell trafficking to tumor microenvironment, and adoptive T cell transfer. In addition to the 50 oral presentations and > 180 posters on these topics, a new SITC/iSBTc initiative to create evidence-based Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines was announced. The SITC/iSBTc Biomarkers Taskforce announced the release of recommendations on immunotherapy biomarkers and a highly successful symposium on Immuno-Oncology Biomarkers that {{took place on the}} campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) immediately prior to the Annual Meeting. At the Annual Meeting, the NIH took the opportunity to publicly announce the award of the U 01 grant that will fund the Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN).

40|$|Thanks to the {{development}} of vaccines, children are these days protected against infectious diseases like polio, diphtheria and tetanus simply by receiving a few injections. Imagine a scenario where these injections would also result in protection against cancer. Vaccines against virus-induced cancer such as liver and cervical cancer are indeed already in use. Intense research is now focused on the generation of vaccines for protection also against <b>cancer</b> not <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>viruses.</b> The overall aim of this thesis was to develop and determine the pre-clinical efficacy of a vaccine against tumours expressing the antigen Her 2 /neu. Polyomaviruses are small non-enveloped viruses that are widespread in the population, and probably harmless as long as the immune system is normal. The viral capsid is composed of three structural proteins, the major structural protein VP 1, and the two minor proteins VP 2 and VP 3. The mouse is host to two known polyomaviruses, murine polyomavirus (MPyV) and murine pneumotropic virus (MPtV), respectively. It was known from before that VP 1 of MPyV could self-assemble into viral capsids known as virus-like particles (VLPs), named so because of their morphological resemblance to natural viruses. In paper I, we showed that VP 1 of MPtV could also self-assemble into VLPs, which were rapidly internalized by all tested cell types, including dendritic cells. However, the VLPs were not very efficient as vectors for gene therapy, possibly due to poor delivery of DNA into the nucleus of target cells. The combination of efficient cellular uptake and poor nuclear delivery indicated that the VLPs could be more efficient as carriers of proteins for presentation to the immune system, since delivery into the cytoplasm would be sufficient in that case. We therefore attached Her 2 /neu to the inside of VLPs of both MPyV and MPtV and obtained so-called chimeric VLPs (cVLPs). In papers II and III, we showed that Her 2 /neu-cVLPs could protect against outgrowth of transplantable Her 2 /neu-expressing tumours in normal mice, as well as against spontaneously arising Her 2 /neu-positive carcinomas in transgenic mice. Her 2 /neu-cVLPs from MPtV also induced immunological memory and protected against tumour out-growth in a therapeutic setting. The purpose of paper IV was to determine the immune mechanisms responsible for tumour protection. We could demonstrate that Her 2 /neu-cVLPs induced Her 2 /neu-specific CD 8 + T cells, but did not induce anti-Her 2 /neu antibodies. However, we observed that mice were protected against tumour development also after depletion of either CD 8 +, or CD 4 + T cells, but not after combined depletion of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. This indicated that CD 4 + T cells could compensate for the absence of CD 8 + T cells and mediate tumour protection by a yet not fully clarified mechanism independent of both antibodies and CD 8 + T cells. In conclusion, in this thesis it is shown that Her 2 /neu-cVLPs based on both MPyV and MPtV are efficient as prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against Her 2 /neu-expressing tumours in mice, and that protection involves both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells...|$|R
