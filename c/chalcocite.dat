25|$|Minerals such as gaspeite, hellyerite, otwayite, widgiemoolthalite {{and related}} hydrous nickel carbonates are {{diagnostic}} of nickel gossans, but are exceedingly rare.

25|$|In Attappadi region gold grains {{are found}} only in native state and occur in {{different}} shapes and sizes. Visible specks of gold were noticed in the samples collected from veins, particularly where the associated sulphides {{have been subjected to}} weathering and leaching resulting in the formation of limonite. Gold grains with maximum dimension of 2mm were reported. Pyrite is the dominant sulfide phase within the quartz lodes (occurring as stringers and fracture fillings). Chalcopyrite, covellite, <b>chalcocite,</b> and galena are commonly observed in the mineral assemblage.|$|E
500|$|Copper is {{produced}} in massive stars and {{is present in the}} Earth's crust in a proportion of about 50 parts per million (ppm). It occurs as native copper, in the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and <b>chalcocite,</b> in the copper carbonates azurite and malachite, and in the copper(I) oxide mineral cuprite. [...] The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US. Native copper is a polycrystal, with the largest single crystal ever described measuring 4.4×3.2×3.2cm.|$|E
500|$|The {{concentration}} of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most commercial ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) {{and to a}} lesser extent <b>chalcocite</b> (Cu2S). These minerals are concentrated from crushed ores to the level of 10–15% copper by froth flotation or bioleaching. Heating this material with silica in flash smelting removes much of the iron as slag. The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag that floats on top of the heated mass. The resulting copper matte, consisting of Cu2S, is roasted to convert all sulfides into oxides: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{bedrock of}} the {{district}} {{is made up of}} at least five rock types, the most prevalent of which are composed of porphyritic, tridymite-bearing rhyolite. Where unoxidized the rhyolite contains abundant pyrite, chalcopyrite and <b>chalcocite.</b> Old workings and prospects are scattered throughout the outcrop area. Rhyolite formations include a wide swath across the northern section {{of the district}}, a section along the western border of the district, and almost all of Red Mountain, so named due to the color caused by the oxidation of the iron in the region's mineral deposits. The next most common bedrock is Cretaceous andesite mainly present in lava flows and tuffs in low-lying areas underlying the rhyolite and overlying the older sediments. Andesite formations include a circular area just north of Harshaw, and a belt extending northward along Patagonia Road for about [...]|$|E
5000|$|Djurleite is {{a copper}} sulfide mineral of {{secondary}} origin with formula Cu31S16 that crystallizes with monoclinic-prismatic symmetry. It is typically massive in form, but does at times develop thin tabular to prismatic crystals. It occurs with other supergene minerals such as <b>chalcocite,</b> covellite and digenite in the enriched zone of copper orebodies. It {{is a member}} of the <b>chalcocite</b> group, and very similar to <b>chalcocite,</b> Cu2S, in its composition and properties, but the two minerals can be distinguished from each other by x-ray powder diffraction. [...] Intergrowths and transformations between djurleite, digenite and <b>chalcocite</b> are common. [...] Many of the reported associations of digenite and djurleite, however, identified by powder diffraction, could be anilite and djurleite, as anilite transforms to digenite during grinding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chalcocite</b> is {{sometimes}} found {{as a primary}} vein mineral in hydrothermal veins. However, most <b>chalcocite</b> occurs in the supergene enriched environment below the oxidation zone of copper deposits {{as a result of}} the leaching of copper from the oxidized minerals. It is also often found in sedimentary rocks.|$|E

50|$|All primary sulfide ores {{of copper}} sulfides, and most {{concentrates}} of secondary copper sulfides (being <b>chalcocite),</b> {{are subjected to}} smelting. Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise <b>chalcocite</b> concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, {{but this is a}} minor part of the market.|$|E

50|$|The mineral is {{associated}} with <b>chalcocite</b> in zones of secondary enrichment (supergene) of copper sulfide deposits. Commonly found with and as coatings on <b>chalcocite,</b> chalcopyrite, bornite, enargite, pyrite, and other sulfides, it often occurs as pseudomorphic replacements after other minerals. Despite the very rare occurrence as a volcanic sublimate, the initial description was at Mount Vesuvius by Nicola Covelli (1790-1829).|$|E
50|$|Since <b>chalcocite</b> is a {{secondary}} mineral that forms from the alteration of other minerals, {{it has been}} known to form pseudomorphs of many different minerals. A pseudomorph is a mineral that has replaced another mineral atom by atom, but it leaves the original mineral's crystal shape intact. <b>Chalcocite</b> {{has been known to}} form pseudomorphs of the minerals bornite, covellite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, enargite, millerite, galena and sphalerite.|$|E

Warner, a group of prospectors {{associated}} with the McClellan party, spotted [...] "a green patch far above them in an improbable location for a grass-green meadow." [...] The green {{turned out to be}} malachite, located with <b>chalcocite</b> (aka [...] "copper glance"), and the location of the Bonanza claim.

50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1844 from the type locality of Sangerhausen, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The name {{is from the}} Greek digenus meaning of two origins in reference to its close resemblance with <b>chalcocite</b> and covellite.|$|E
50|$|Supergene ores rich in sulfides may be {{concentrated}} using froth flotation. A typical concentrate of <b>chalcocite</b> can grade between 37% and 40% copper in sulfide, making them relatively cheap to smelt compared to chalcopyrite concentrates.|$|E

5000|$|Constellation Copper's Lisbon Valley copper mine in San Juan County, {{southwest}} Utah began mining in 2005, {{and produced}} its first copper in 2006. [...] The copper deposit is in sandstones of the Dakota Sandstone and Burro Canyon Formation. The primary copper mineral is <b>chalcocite,</b> which {{is thought to}} have been deposited from solutions ascending through the Lisbon Valley Fault. Above the water table, <b>chalcocite</b> has been oxidized to malachite, azurite, tenorite, and cuprite. On November 30, 2007, Constellation announced that it would stop mining in 2008, because of unexpectedly low copper recovery. The company will continue to recover copper by heap-leaching already-mined ore as long as profitable.|$|E
50|$|The {{porphyry}} copper deposit and hypogene mineralization {{occurred in}} the Early Eocene. Supergene sulfide enrichment began in the Late Oligocene and continued until the Early Miocene. <b>Chalcocite</b> is the more common copper ore mineral as massive assemblages.|$|E
