5|$|Filming {{began on}} June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, {{primarily}} {{taking place at}} Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a {{two and a half}} years so the production <b>company</b> <b>could</b> leave the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed. The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire. Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened a rough cut of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998. Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the main unit instead of afterwards because of the high number of shots to be completed daily.|$|E

She left school after doing her mock A-levels and having gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications. In 2005, Bush stated in an {{interview}} with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 2 that she believed EMI signed her before she was ready to make an album so that no other record <b>company</b> <b>could</b> offer her a contract.

5|$|In October 1867, {{an agent}} for Swift & Co. {{negotiated}} a deal with Peru to purchase Catawba and her sister for a million dollars apiece. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that the <b>company</b> <b>could</b> repurchase the pair if it refunded the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had no authority to do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the appraised value would be accepted. The ship was appraised at $375,000 and sold for that amount, possibly after a rigged bid, on 11 April 1868.|$|E
5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not cover the cost of repaying loans.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the {{extension}} of the suburban light rail Holmenkollen Line to the city center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not agree on the location of the terminal station. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien. The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks. It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} the rail {{connections}} was a death blow to the stage road. Gold production in Independence had declined sharply after 1884, {{and many of the}} town's early settlers had moved down the valley to Aspen. With the corresponding reduction in stage traffic and tolls, the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll <b>Company</b> <b>could</b> not afford to keep the road clear over the winter of 1886. Two years later, after the railroads began service, the company folded and abandoned the road. Independence itself met the same fate a decade later when its remaining population decamped to Aspen during the severe winter of 1899, leaving its buildings standing as a ghost town (one remaining resident lingered until 1920).|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen {{to the city}} center had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between {{the city and the}} company, in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center. Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of its {{contract}} with the city, the <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not cease operations. A lawsuit was brought by a pro-union citizen of the city, A. C. Pearson, against the company to revoke its contract or to force it into receivership so a receiver could negotiate with the strikers. The first court hearing was held on November 4, but the judge put the case on hold until the strike could be resolved. The case was later annulled on November 7 when the same judge ruled that Pearson had no standing to bring such a suit before the court.|$|E

5|$|An {{operations}} plan {{suited for}} {{an attack on a}} small enemy formation was drafted by Ziegler, who was an adviser to Dam and the command staff of the 7th Infantry Division. Ziegler's plan, codenamed Operation Duc Thang I, called for the South Vietnamese to assault Ap Tan Thoi from three different directions: three rifle companies from the 11th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, to move from the north; the Dinh Tuong Civil Guards Regiment to march north from the south in separate columns; and a company of 13 M113 armored personnel carriers with an infantry company on board from the southwest. The M113 carriers and the infantry <b>company</b> <b>could</b> act as both a mobile reserve and a reaction force, so it was positioned where it could be shifted to the contact area if the Viet Cong began to retreat. In addition, Dam would also deploy two rifle companies at Tan Hiep airfield, which could be brought to the battlefield by helicopters from the US Army 93rd Transportation Company.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand—especially with phenol supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any <b>company</b> <b>could</b> use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive right to the aspirin name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control—though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters—but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle, and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{cash from}} Rothschild, the <b>company</b> <b>could</b> not raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin {{construction of the}} Oxford extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in George Street, nearer the edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that it unlikely to recoup its construction costs.|$|E

5|$|During the {{discussion}} about deregulation, Braathens SAFE considered several possibilities to strengthen itself. In particular, it had discussions with the large European airlines Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM about an alliance, but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE, stating that the agreements were all about getting traffic to the partner's hub. Minister of Transport, Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway, Jan Reinås, both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS, {{to ensure that the}} company had a 100% market share on the primary routes before the merger. This would, according to them, secure that no foreign <b>company</b> <b>could</b> compete with the merged company. The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE's management. Still, negotiations started between the companies in 1992, although they were quickly abandoned. The press reported the price of Braathens SAFE to be NOK1.2 billion, but that this had been rejected as too expensive by SAS.|$|E
5|$|In 1595, the Stationers' Company fined Barley 40 shillings for illicitly {{publishing}} {{a number of}} works. Three years later, the organisation sued him and a fellow draper, Simon Stafford, for allegedly publishing privileged books. A raid on Barley's former premises found 4,000 copies of the Accidence, a Latin grammar book protected by monopoly. Despite pleading his innocence in court, Barley, along with Stafford, Edward Venge, and Thomas Pavier (who was Barley's apprentice), was found guilty and sentenced to prison. The lawsuit affirmed the Stationers' Company's control over the Elizabethan book trade. Stafford, Pavier, and other draper-booksellers joined the company {{within a few years}} so that they could continue their trade. Curiously, Barley did not join them until 1606. The reasons for the delay are debated among scholars. Bibliographer J. A. Lavin suggests that the Stationers' Company rejected Barley because he had no experience in the printing business. Gerald D. Johnson believes that his partnership with Thomas Morley, who held a royal patent on music publishing, allowed him to circumvent any legal obstacles. The Stationers' <b>Company</b> <b>could</b> not interfere with the publication of works under royal grant.|$|E

Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Nomura Securities, concerned about corporate governance issues at the company as well as its balance sheet, all immediately downgraded their stock ratings. Goldman Sachs, who had only upgraded its rating in a report dated 12 October, suspended its coverage after Woodford was removed from office. Nomura and JPMorgan announced on 20 October that their coverage of the company was halted. It was reported that Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the Singapore sovereign wealth fund {{which was one of the}} principal shareholders, immediately disposed of its 2percent stake on the first hint of scandal.
