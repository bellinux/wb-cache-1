In this paper it is shown that the plant model identification in <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> using <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> output error identification algorithms and the direct estimation in <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> of a reduced order controller feature a duality character. Basic schemes, algorithms and properties of the algorithms can be directly obtained by interchanging the plant model and the controller. Additional schemes and algorithms allowing a full coverage of the various possible identification and reduction criteria are given. The paper also will explore the coherence aspects in using <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> plant model identification and direct estimation in <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> of reduced order controllers.

40|$|Nonoverlapping <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> {{of around}} 25 - 35 amino acids formed via nonlocal {{interactions}} at the loop ends {{have been proposed}} as an important unit of protein structure. This hypothesis is significant as such short loops can fold quickly and so would not be bound by the Leventhal paradox, giving insight into the possible nature of the funnel in protein folding. Previously, these <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> have been identified either by sequence analysis (conservation and autocorrelation) or studies of the geometry of individual proteins. Given the potential significance of the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> hypothesis, we have explored a new strategy for determining <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> from the insertions identified by the structural alignment of proteins sharing the same overall fold. We determined {{the locations of the}} <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> in 37 pairs of proteins and obtained excellent agreement with previously published <b>closed</b> <b>loops.</b> The r elevance of NMR structures to <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> determination is briefly discussed. For cytochrome c, cytochrome b 562 and triosephophate isomerase, independent folding units have been determined on the basis of hydrogen exchange experiments and misincorporation proton-alkyl exchange experiments. The correspondence between these experimentally derived foldons and the theoretically derived <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> indicates that the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> hypothesis may provide a useful framework for analyzing such experimental data. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that {{subspace}} identification methods that assume open loop data without correlations between the input and noise, may give biased estimates when applied to <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> data. The effect of the controller gain parameters {{on the quality of the}} identified model is studied when <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> data are used. Several subspace identification methods (both open <b>loop</b> and <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> methods), and different simulated data sets ranging from ideal 2 x 2 linear systems, to a fairly realistic nonlinear debutanizer process simulator, are considered. The results show that up to a point, higher controller gain during the identification experiment gives more accurate models than with lower controller gain, for both open and <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> subspace identification methods. It is observed that the sensitivity to the controller gain is very small for the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> sub-space method tested for the ideal cases when its assumptions are satisfied. An explaination for this is that in this case there will be no bias, while the open loop methods may have a bias that depends on the controller parameters. Another interesting observation is that for the debutanizer example, the nonlinearities seem to lead to biased estimates also with the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> subspace method, and the choice of controller gain appears to be just as important as the use of a <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> subspace identification method for the accuracy of the estimates...|$|R
