40|$|Abstract—A {{useful tool}} to {{construct}} wavelet decompositions is the lifting scheme. The generalized lifting {{is an extension}} of the classical lifting scheme to introduce more flexibility and to permit the creation of new nonlinear and adaptive transforms. However, the design of generalized prediction and update steps is more involved. This letter proposes a generalized prediction design that minimizes the detail signal energy and entropy at the same time. Two algorithm variants are given. The fixed prediction uses the image class statistics to derive the optimal transform. If the statistics are unknown, the adaptive prediction extracts them from the image being coded. The resulting decompositions are applied to lossless image coding, reporting good results. The adaptive algorithm has no bookkeeping or side information requirements, yet its performance is close to the fixed prediction performance.

40|$|Computer {{tomography}} (CT) -based {{finite element}} (FE) models assess vertebral strength better than dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporotic vertebrae are usually loaded via degenerated intervertebral discs (IVD) and potentially {{at higher risk}} under forward bending, but the influences of the IVD and loading conditions are generally overlooked. Accordingly, magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 14 lumbar discs to generate FE models for the healthiest and most degenerated specimens. Compression, torsion, bending, flexion and extension conducted experimentally were used to calibrate both models. They were combined with CT-based FE models of 12 lumbar vertebral bodies to evaluate the effect of disc degeneration compared to a loading via endplates embedded in a stiff resin, the usual experimental paradigm. <b>Compression</b> and <b>lifting</b> were simulated, load and damage pattern were evaluated at failure. Adding flexion to the <b>compression</b> (<b>lifting)</b> and higher disc degeneration reduces the failure load (8 – 14 %, 5 – 7 %) and increases damage in the vertebrae. Under both loading scenarios, decreasing the disc height slightly increases the failure load; embedding and degenerated IVD provides respectively the highest and lowest failure load. Embedded vertebrae are more brittle, but failure loads induced via IVDs correlate highly with vertebral strength. In conclusion, osteoporotic vertebrae with degenerated IVDs are consistently weaker—especially under lifting, but clinical assessment of their strength is possible via FE analysis without extensive disc modelling, by extrapolating measures from the embedded situation...|$|R

However, it has been observed that the separable lifting scheme structure presents some limitations be-cause of the separable processing performed along the image lines and columns. In this paper, we propose to use a 2 D non separable lifting scheme decomposition that enables progressive reconstruc-tion and exact decoding of images. More precisely, we focus on the optimization of all the involved decomposition operators. In this re-spect, we design the prediction filters by minimizing the variance of the detail signals. Concerning the update filters, we propose a new optimization criterion which aims at reducing the inherent aliasing artefacts. Simulations carried out on still and stereo images show the benefits which can be drawn from the proposed optimization of the lifting operators.

40|$|Abstract—Many {{research}} {{efforts have been}} devoted to the improvement of stereo image coding techniques for storage or transmission. In this paper, we are mainly interested in lossy-to-lossless coding schemes for stereo images allowing pro-gressive reconstruction. The most commonly used approaches for stereo compression are based on disparity compensation tech-niques. The basic principle involved in this technique first consists of estimating the disparity map. Then, one image is considered as a reference {{and the other is}} predicted in order to generate a residual image. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on vector lifting schemes (VLS), which offers the advantage of generating two compact multiresolution representations of {{the left and the right}} views. We present two versions of this new scheme. A theoretical analysis of the performance of the considered VLS is also conducted. Experimental results indicate a significant improvement using the proposed structures compared with con-ventional methods.

[...] The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, which is generally more beneficial. [...] Greater lift has some limitations. [...] Firstly, lift {{is limited by the}} increased proximity of the valve head to the piston crown and secondly, greater effort is required to move the valve springs to a higher state of <b>compression.</b> Increased <b>lift</b> can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder head casting.

40|$|Study Design. A repeated-measures in vivo experiment. Objective. To {{describe}} within-subject {{variability of}} spinal <b>compression</b> in repetitive <b>lifting.</b> Summary of Background Data. Epidemiology and failure mechanics suggest that peak loads {{may be more}} predictive of injury than average loads. Nevertheless, biomechanical studies usually focus on the latter. Methods. Ten healthy males performed 360 lifts in 1 hour of a 45 -L crate, weighted with a stable 10 -kg mass on 1 day and with an unstable mass (10 kg of water) on another day. The maximum compression force in each lift was estimated, using a simple inverse dynamics model and a single equivalent muscle model. Results. The individual distributions of maximum compression force were slightly skewed to the right (average skewness 0. 67). Median and 95 th percentile values were used to characterize the distribution. The median (50 th percentile) compression ranged from 3375 to 6125 N, and from 3632 to 6298 N in the stable and unstable load conditions, respectively. The within-subjects peak (95 th percentile) compression forces were from 405 to 1767 N and from 526 to 2216 N, respectively, higher than the median values. The peak values differed significantly between conditions, whereas the difference in medians did not reach significance. Only a limited trendwise (fatigue-related) variance could be demonstrated. Conclusion. Peak spinal compression by far exceeds median <b>compression</b> in repetitive <b>lifting</b> and can be affected by task conditions independently from the median. Therefore, the variability of spinal loads {{needs to be taken}} into consideration when analyzing and redesigning tasks that can cause spinal injuries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. En-route data {{compression}} {{is fundamental to}} reduce the power consumed for data gathering in sensor networks. Typical in-network compression schemes involve the distributed computation of some decor-relating transform on the data; the structure along which the transform is computed influences both coding performance and transmission cost of the computed coefficients, and has been widely explored in the liter-ature. However, few works have studied this interaction in the practical case when the routing configuration of the network is also built in a dis-tributed manner. In this paper we aim at expanding this understanding by specifically considering the impact of distributed routing tree initial-ization algorithms on coding and transmission costs, when a tree-based wavelet lifting transform is adopted. We propose a simple modification to the collection tree protocol (CTP) which can be tuned to account for a vast range of spatial correlations. In terms of costs and coding efficiency, our methods do not improve the performance of more sophis-ticated routing trees such as the shortest path tree, but they entail an easier manageability in case of node reconfigurations and update.

50|$|Tensile stress forms joints in rocks. A joint is a {{fracture}} that forms within a rock, whose movement {{to open the}} fracture {{is greater than the}} lateral movement that takes place. Joints are formed in the direction perpendicular to the least principal stress, meaning that they are formed perpendicular to the tensile stress. One way in particular that joints can be formed is due to fluid pressure, {{as well as at the}} crest of folds in rocks. This occurs at the peak of the fold or due to the fluid pressure because a localized tensile stress forms, eventually leading to jointing. Another way in which joints form is due to the change in the weight of the overburden. Since rocks lay under a great deal of overburden, they undergo high temperatures and high pressures. Over time, the rocks are eroded and the weight of the overburden is lifted, so the rocks cool and are under less pressure, which causes the rock to change shape, often forming breaks. As the <b>compression</b> is <b>lifted</b> from the rocks, they are able to react to the tension on them by forming these breaks, or joints.|$|R
