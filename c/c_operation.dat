50|$|The Central Mexican League was a class <b>C</b> <b>operation</b> {{which lasted}} two seasons, 1956 and 1957. The six-team circuit was very offense-friendly and ERAs over 8 were about {{as common as}} ERAs under 3.50. Both the City of Juarez and Chihuahua {{represented}} the state of Chihuahua Mexico. In 1956 the great pitcher Marte de Alejandro propelled Chihuahua to a second-place finish behind the Saltillo Saraperos by only a half game, with an astounding 129 strikeouts and 18 victories in the short season of only 100 games. Both teams had equal records {{on the last day}} of the season, yet a loss by Chihuahua and a forfeit by Saltillo's opponent gave the crown to the Saraperos. Chihuahua's manager Manuel Arroyo was furious, and promised a local paper that the Dorados would win in 1957, which they did. 1957 marked the Gold men's first crown outright, posting a 62 and 38 record behind the great pitching of Antonio Dicochea, 17 wins and 157 Strikeouts.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} the more than 300 in-vessel sensor systems for the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) has {{encountered}} several challenging fusion reactor diagnostic issues involving high temperatures and space constraints. This has resulted in unique miniature, high temperature in-vessel sensor systems mounted in small spaces behind plasma facing armor tiles, and they are prototypical of possible high power reactor first-wall applications.

The limiting correlation functions define a two-dimensional determinantal point processes with certain Gibbs properties. ...|$|R
