5|$|The song's {{alternate}} video {{features a}} similar synopsis, where Houston begins singing the song {{on a large}} stone altar {{in the middle of}} an auditorium. As she finishes her verse, Carey is seen walking up the ramp in the background, joining Houston for her verse. They continue singing the song together, standing side by side and holding hands. After completing the song, both singers exit the auditorium together as in the first video, simulating two friends enjoying time with each other. Both videos are very similar, only the alternate version does not feature an audience, choir or images, only the duo singing together atop the stone altar. In this version of the video, Houston wears a long brown strapless gown, and features a shoulder length bob haircut. Carey on the otherhand, features long cascading <b>curls</b> <b>and</b> dons an olive green gown.|$|E

500|$|The medium-weight coins often carry {{designs of}} high artistic quality, {{exceeding}} {{that of the}} contemporary Frankish currency. Coin portraits of Offa {{have been described as}} [...] "showing a delicacy of execution which is unique in the whole history of the Anglo-Saxon coinage". The depictions of Offa on the coins include a [...] "striking and elegant" [...] portrait showing him with his hair in voluminous <b>curls,</b> <b>and</b> another where he wears a fringe and tight curls. Some coins show him wearing a necklace with a pendant. The variety of these depictions implies that Offa's die-cutters were able to draw on varied artistic sources for their inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Lochner's art seems {{indebted to}} two broad sources; Netherlandish artists van Eyck and Robert Campin, and the earlier German masters Conrad von Soest and the Master of Saint Veronica. From the former Lochner drew his realism in {{depicting}} naturalistic backgrounds, objects and clothes. From the latter he adopted the somewhat antiquated manner of depicting figures, especially females, with doll-like, eloquent and sensitive features, to present [...] "iconic, almost timeless" [...] atmospheres, {{enhanced by the}} then old-fashioned gold backgrounds. Lochner's figures have idealised facial features typical of medieval portraiture. His subjects, females in particular, usually have the high foreheads, long noses, small rounded chins, tucked blond <b>curls</b> <b>and</b> prominent ears typical of the late Gothic, giving them the characteristic monumentality of 13th-century art, placing them on seemingly similar shallow backgrounds.|$|E

500|$|Run-D.M.C. rapped {{over the}} most sparse of musical backing tracks. In {{the case of}} [...] "Sucker MCs", there was a loud, Oberheim DMX drum machine, a few {{scratches}} and nothing else, while the rhymes harangued weak rappers and contrasted them to the group's success. [...] "It's like That" [...] was an aggressively delivered message rap whose social commentary has been defined variously as [...] "objective fatalism", [...] "frustrated and renunciatory", and just plain [...] "reportage". Run-D.M.C. wore street clothes, tracksuits, sneakers, one even wore glasses. Their only possible concession to an image extraneous to that of kids on the street was the stylistic flourish of black fedoras atop their heads.

500|$|The video {{takes place}} in a large cathedral-like room, with large winding {{staircases}} on each side. Throughout the video, the scenery changes several times from a cloudy and sunny day, to a glowing sunset. These time shifts are seen through a large carved window in the cathedral. The video begins with Carey's hair in long golden <b>curls,</b> <b>and</b> her wearing a skin-tight black jumper. She sits on the large ledge by the window, staring into the different colors in the sky. As the video progresses, Carey is joined by a small black cat, which accompanies her as she meditates on the large stairwell. After the song's second verse, a large microphone is seen {{in the middle of the}} room, where scenes of Carey singing and standing on the window's ledge interchange. The last scenes show Carey staring out into the meadow, smiling. According to author Chris Nickson, during the scenes of Carey by the large window, it is [...] "obvious" [...] that she is praying to God and connecting to her creator. He felt that alongside the song's lyrics of faith and prayer, the video's moments of meditation truly went [...] "hand in hand." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of low-strain deformation behavior on <b>curl</b> <b>and</b> springback in advanced high strength steels (AHSS) {{was assessed using}} a bend-under-tension test. The effect of yielding behavior on <b>curl</b> <b>and</b> springback was examined by heat-treating two dual-phase steels to induce yield point elongation, while keeping a relatively constant tensile strength and a constant sheet thickness. A dual-phase and TRIP steel with similar initial thickness and tensile strengths were also examined to investigate the effect of work-hardening on <b>curl</b> <b>and</b> springback. It is shown that while current understanding limits prediction of <b>curl</b> <b>and</b> springback in bending under tension using only the initial sheet thickness and tensile strength, both the yielding and work-hardening behavior can affect the results. Explanations for these effects are proposed {{in terms of the}} discontinuous yielding and flow stress in the materials. <br /...|$|R
30|$|<b>Curling</b> <b>and</b> warping {{occur as}} a result of {{differences}} in temperature and moisture gradients throughout the thickness of a concrete slab and can cause slabs to either curl up or curl down. The distortions resulting from temperature gradients are called <b>curling,</b> <b>and</b> the distortions due to moisture gradient are called warping. Concrete slab with higher temperature and moisture gradient will lead a higher potential damage by the effects of <b>curling</b> <b>and</b> warping. A reduction of warping <b>and</b> <b>curling</b> can be achieved by maintaining higher and more uniform relative humidity across the concrete slab (Mehta and Monteiro 2013). Also, the LWA is able to reduce <b>curling</b> <b>and</b> warping of concrete as the water drawn from the LWA pores provides better hydration and high relative humidity (Schlitter et al. 2010). Previous studies indicate that approximately 70  % reduction in warping can be perceived when the concrete has a high percentage of relative humidity (Wei and Hansen 2008).|$|R

500|$|Weinman's dime depicts Liberty with {{a wreath}} of tight <b>curls,</b> <b>and</b> wearing a {{traditional}} pileus, or Liberty cap. [...] His {{depiction of the}} pileus as a winged cap has provoked comparisons with Roman Republic denarii, which art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered superficial. [...] Weinman wrote that he considered the winged cap to symbolize [...] "liberty of thought". [...] Vermeule suggests that {{one reason for the}} use of wings was that Weinman, in common with many in the tradition of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, under whom Weinman had studied, liked the effect of feathers done in relief. [...] The reverse depicts a fasces, the object carried by lictors, who accompanied Roman magistrates; on the coin it represents war and justice. [...] It is contrasted with a large olive branch symbolizing peace. [...] According to Breen, [...] "Weinman's symbolic message in this design... was clearly an updated 'Don't tread on me'". The fasces is bound both horizontally and diagonally by a leather strap, with the loose ends at the bottom. The lettering is in Roman style, and is made as discreet as possible. [...] Weinman's monogram, AW, appears on the obverse, midway between the date and the letter Y in [...] "LIBERTY". [...] The mintmark is located on the reverse, {{to the right of the}} first E in [...] "ONE DIME".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the singer}} {{was interviewed by}} Nobel Literature Prize-winning Colombian novelist and {{journalist}} Gabriel García Márquez, who was [...] "astonished by her fantastical work-rate" [...] and said that [...] "Shakira's music has a personal stamp that doesn't look like anyone else's {{and no one can}} sing or dance like her, at whatever age, with such an innocent sensuality, one that seems to be of her own invention." [...] In the United States and the United Kingdom, Shakira drew comparisons to American pop singer Britney Spears as they looked similar in appearance and sported [...] "bleached blonde <b>curls</b> <b>and</b> butter-wouldn't-melt smiles for the kids down the front." [...] However, critics argued that the Shakira's vocal style was very different from Spears', with Ted Kessler from The Observer calling the former an [...] "operatic diva" [...] and writing that [...] "as soon as she opens her mouth, she slips into gear and motors powerfully past Britney's breathy bump'n'grind." [...] In 2009, Julia Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "Shakira makes comparable Spanish-English 'crossover' acts such as Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias seem like minnows." [...] In an interview with Latina magazine in 2011, Gloria Estefan was asked whether she felt another crossover artist like Shakira could emerge in her lifetime, to which she responded, [...] "I'm always hopeful that somebody, any Latino, is going to succeed in what they do. And of course in music, undoubtedly." [...] Shakira's crossover success also inspired other Latin artists to foray into the English language market and many compared Mexican singer Paulina Rubio's attempt to crossover with her English-language debut album Border Girl to that by Shakira.|$|E

40|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) pavement undergoes repeated environmental load-related deflection resulting from temperature and moisture variations across pavement depth.

40|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) pavement undergoes repeated environmental load-related deflection resulting from temperature and moisture variations across the pavement depth. This phenomenon, {{referred to as}} PCC pavement <b>curling</b> <b>and</b> warping, has been known and studied since the mid- 1920 s. Slab curvature can be further magnified under repeated traffic loads and may ultimately lead to fatigue failures, including top-down and bottom-up transverse, longitudinal, and corner cracking. It is therefore important to measure the “true” degree of <b>curling</b> <b>and</b> warping in PCC pavements, not only for quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) purposes, but also to achieve {{a better understanding of}} its relationship to long-term pavement performance. In order to better understand the <b>curling</b> <b>and</b> warping behavior of PCC pavements in Iowa and provide recommendations to mitigate <b>curling</b> <b>and</b> warping deflections, field investigations were performed at six existing sites during the late fall of 2015. These sites included PCC pavements with various ages, slab shapes, mix design aspects, and environmental conditions during construction. A stationary light detection and ranging (LiDAR) device was used to scan the slab surfaces. The degree of <b>curling</b> <b>and</b> warping along the longitudinal, transverse, and diagonal directions was calculated for the selected slabs based on the point clouds acquired using LiDAR. The results and findings are correlated to variations in pavement performance, mix design, pavement design, and construction details at each site. Recommendations regarding how to minimize <b>curling</b> <b>and</b> warping are provided based on a literature review and this field study. Some examples of using point cloud data to build three-dimensional (3 D) models of the overall curvature of the slab shape are presented to show the feasibility of using this 3 D analysis method for <b>curling</b> <b>and</b> warping analysis...|$|R
