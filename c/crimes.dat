The authors investigate if there is an impact of an individual’s spatial proximity to <b>crime</b> on fear of <b>crime</b> also measured at the individual level. To be more specific, the authors examine the crime–fear of <b>crime</b> link using three types of crime—violent <b>crime,</b> property <b>crime,</b> and disorder <b>crime.</b> Both the resi-dence of respondents and <b>crime</b> events are spatially located, allowing the authors to construct a buffer surrounding the respondent’s residence to obtain the number of <b>crime</b> incidents that occur within a 528 -foot (1 / 10 th of a mile) radius of the residence. In addition, the authors explore the relationship between spatial distribution of actual <b>crime</b> events and individu-al fear of <b>crime</b> at 0. 5 -mile radius and 1. 0 -mile radius of each respondent who participated in the telephone interview.

5000|$|<b>Crime</b> {{theories}} can be {{a useful}} guide for researchers and analyst, in regard to analyzing <b>crime</b> hotspots. There are many theories of <b>crime</b> that explain why <b>crime</b> occurs in certain places and why <b>crime</b> does not in others. Place theories look at <b>crime</b> at specific places, which can also be viewed as “points on a map.” (Eck, Chainey, Cameron, and Wilson, 2005: p. 10) [...] Another <b>crime</b> theory used in regard to <b>crime</b> hotspots is neighborhood theories. These theories view <b>crime</b> at a larger level, and in a larger viewing area. When viewing these types of areas, statistical information is typically used to determine hotspots. A widely used theory to explain <b>crime</b> is <b>crime</b> pattern theory. <b>Crime</b> pattern theory explains that <b>crime</b> is not random. <b>Crime</b> hotspots can help aid in determining spatial-temporal patterns. This theory allows making generalized statements about area hotspots, and hotspot areas can be predicted using <b>crime</b> pattern theory (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1999). [...] When creating hotspots, theories that can help explain their occurrence should be evaluated to determine underlying causes.|$|R
