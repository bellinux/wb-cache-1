NASA has been mandated to replace chlorinated solvents in precision cleaning, cleanliness verification, and degreasing of aerospace fluid systems hardware and ground support equipment. KSC has a CFC phase-out plan which provides for the elimination of over 90 percent of the CFC and halon use by 1995. The Materials Science Laboratory and KSC is evaluating four analytical methods for the determination of nonvolatile residues removal by water: (1) infrared analyses using an attenuated total reflectance; (2) surface tension analyses, (3) total organic content analyses, and (4) turbidity analyses. This research project examined the ultrasonic-turbidity responses for 22 hydrocarbons in an effect to determine: (1) if ultrasonics in heated water (70 C) will clean hydrocarbons (oils, greases, gels, and fluids) from aerospace hardware; (2) if the cleaning process by ultrasonics will simultaneously emulsify the removed hydrocarbons in the water; and (3) if a turbidimeter can be used successfully as an analytical instrument for quantifying the removal of hydrocarbons. Sixteen of the 22 hydrocarbons tested showed that ultrasonics would remove it at least 90 percent of the <b>contaminated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> from the hardware in 10 minutes or less giving a good ultrasonic-turbidity response.

40|$|Petroleum <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> sites, {{associated}} with the contemporary and legacy effects of human activities, remain a serious environmental problem in the Antarctic and Arctic. The management of contaminated sites in these regions is often confounded by the logistical, environmental, legislative and financial challenges {{associated with}} operating in polar environments. In response {{to the need for}} efficient and safe methods for managing contaminated sites, several technologies have been adapted for on-site or in situ application in these regions. This article reviews six technologies which are currently being adapted or developed for the remediation of petroleum <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> sites in the Antarctic and Arctic. Bioremediation, landfarming, biopiles, phytoremediation, electrokinetic remediation and permeable reactive barriers are reviewed and discussed with respect to their advantages, limitations and potential for the long-term management of soil and groundwater <b>contaminated</b> with petroleum <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the Antarctic and Arctic. Although these technologies demonstrate potential for application in the Antarctic and Arctic, their effectiveness is dependent on site-specific factors including terrain, soil moisture and temperature, freeze–thaw processes and the indigenous microbial population. The importance of detailed site assessment prior to on-site or in situ implementation is emphasized, and it is argued that coupling of technologies represents one strategy for effective, long-term management of petroleum <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> sites in the Antarctic and Arctic...|$|R

40|$|Across the UK {{there are}} many {{hundreds}} of sites that have been contaminated by previous industrial use. The wastes and residues left in the soil present a hazard to the general environment and, therefore, can prohibit the redevelopment of the land. Conventional technologies all have significant disadvantages. High temperature based technologies such as thermal desorption are highly energy intensive. Soil vapour extraction requires the soil to be sufficiently permeable to permit the transfer of vapour. Microwave heating methods {{have the advantage of}} volumetric and rapid heating as well in situ steam generation from water within the soil. However, previous research on the microwave processing of soils has mainly focused on bench scale tests on artificial soils using a microwave susceptor to overcome issues with heating efficiency, rather than utilising soils from real industrial sites. There is also a significant lack of fundamental understanding in terms of the microwave heating mechanisms of soils, a lack of energy balances and consideration of scale up towards industrial implementation. The microwave heating mechanisms of soils were elucidated and the removal mechanisms of hydrocarbon contaminants have been discussed. According to the differences in the hydrocarbon contaminants, five soils were classified into two groups: light <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils and heavy <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils. All five soils could be heated with microwaves without using susceptor, and were stable at 100 °C as the energy dissipated was used to overcome the latent heat of vaporisation of water. The major heating mechanism was polarisation due to the inherent water within the soils, and the major remediation mechanisms were found to be steam stripping or distillation. Above 100 °C bound or interlayer I I water may be present in some soils, which contributed to low but non-zero values of dielectric loss factor. The maximum bulk temperatures obtained with light <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils were in excess of 100 °C, and is attributed to the equilibrium between microwave energy absorbed and heat loss. In this case the remediation mechanism could be governed by thermal desorption. Heavy <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils behave very differently during microwave processing, with much higher temperatures obtained than with light <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils. The major heating mechanism in this case was conduction due to the carbonisation of heavy hydrocarbons within the soil, and remediation resulted from desorption, decomposition and carbonisation. The potential for continuous microwave treatment was ascertained through a series of pilot scale studies at 150 - 300 kg/h. More than 75 % hydrocarbon removal from light <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils was achieved using a conveyor system, but this technique was not suitable for heavy <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils due to the high temperatures that were attained. Preliminary studies were carried out using a batch scale microwave rotary kiln system for processing at higher temperatures. iiEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{subsurface}} soil around Baruwa {{community was}} reportedly <b>contaminated</b> by <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{not because the}} area falls within oil-producing community but it suffers from inceasant leakage from petroleum pipeline that supply petroleum products to hydrocarbon terminar located within the area. Thus, to ascretain the extent of contamination of the subsurface soil around the area, an integrated geophysical methods involving vertical electrical sounding (VES) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) supported with induced polarization (IP) and spontaneous potential (SP) methods were carried out. The <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>contaminated</b> layers were marked out beneath each VES point by high resistivity ranging between 943 &Omegam and 4749 &Omegam {{at a depth of}} 1 to 35. 44 m below the surface. Similarly, ERT result shows that the subsurface soil around the investigated area has been contaminated at a shallow depth of about 2 m downward with resistivity value above 1000 &Omegam. IP and SP data were Integrated to identify the sandy contaminated layers from clayey layer. IP value of 0 to 10 mV/V and SP values of &saquo 10 mV were obtained over the sandy formation. The work shows that hydrocarbon leaking from the pipeline laid a few meters beneath the earth surface actually flow both upwardly (possibly due to seasonal variation in the water table which is usually close to the surface during rainy season) to the surface and downwardly at greater depth into the subsurface, through a porous medium - sandy layer.
