5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and {{a short while later}} it passed the only banana {{plantation}} along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the <b>Ceiba.</b>|$|E

5|$|Due to a weak mid-level {{anticyclone}} {{over the}} Gulf of Mexico {{that was not}} observed operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated the movement {{to be part of}} a small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La <b>Ceiba,</b> with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to predict a turn to the north, which would allow for restrengthening.|$|E

The United States then directed its undivided military resources to Puerto Rico. Two {{leaders of the}} Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, Dr. Julio J. Henna and Roberto H. Todd, had written to U.S. President McKinley asking that Puerto Rico be included in whatever intervention was planned for Cuba as early as March 10.

Just to the northeast, in San Juancito, a large landslide took the lives {{of at least three}} people. Overall, the hurricane inflicted about $12 million in damage across Honduras (including the agricultural impacts), resulted in about 150 deaths, and destroyed the homes of thousands of residents. The floods were considered to be among the worst in the country's history. Almost immediately after the passage of the storm, a wide area of Honduras experienced strong earthquake activity.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Mitch {{formed on}} October22 {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea, and it {{eventually}} intensified into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale by October26. By that time, the hurricane was {{just north of the}} coast of Honduras, and was expected by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models to turn to the north. When the track was more westward than expected, the NHC recommended early on October26 for a hurricane warning to be issued for the northeastern Honduran coast, although difficulties in communications prevented their immediate implementation. Within a few hours, a hurricane warning was in place between Limón to the Honduras and Nicaragua border, including the offshore Swan Island. When Mitch still failed to turn to the north, the government of Honduras issued a hurricane warning for the remainder of their coastline. The hurricane weakened while turning to the south, and made landfall in Honduras 134km (83mi) east of La <b>Ceiba,</b> with estimated winds of 130km/h (80mph). Mitch continued to weaken while moving slowly westward across the country.|$|E
5|$|On June8, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa, moving quickly westward without development. During the evening hours of June15, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a large area of disturbed weather in association with {{a tropical}} wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. That day, a low pressure area developed just north of Panama. Drifting west-northwest, environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for organization, but the system moved over eastern Nicaragua on June16. Despite moving over land, the circulation and convection became better organized, and after it emerged over open waters, the system developed into Tropical Depression Two at 1200UTC on June17 about 25mi (45km) north-northwest of La <b>Ceiba,</b> Honduras. Located about 60mi (95km) east of Monkey River Town, Belize, the depression was not expected to undergo significant strengthening. Failing to intensify, the depression made landfall in southern Belize near Big Creek late on June17 with winds estimated at 35mph (55km/h). Despite a waning structure, the NHC noted that if the system emerged into the Bay of Campeche, re-development and intensification was plausible.|$|E
