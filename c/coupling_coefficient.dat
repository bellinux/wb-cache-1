25|$|The source area of this {{earthquake}} has {{a relatively}} high <b>coupling</b> <b>coefficient</b> surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north, and south. From the averaged <b>coupling</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0.5–0.8 in the source area and the seismic moment, {{it was estimated that}} the slip deficit of this earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260–880 years, which is consistent with the recurrence interval of such great earthquakes estimated from the tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about 93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence, earthquakes with magnitudes about 7 since 1926 in this area only had released part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the <b>coupling</b> <b>coefficient</b> is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami.|$|E
