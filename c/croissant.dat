25|$|The {{government}} hastily approved several special {{laws for}} {{use during the}} Stammheim trial. Lawyers were excluded from trial {{for the first time}} since 1945, after being accused of various inappropriate actions, such as helping to form criminal organisations (Section 129, Criminal Law). The authorities invaded and checked the lawyers' offices for possible incriminating material. Minister of Justice Hans-Jochen Vogel stated proudly that no other Western state had such an extensive regulation to exclude defense attorneys from the trial. Klaus <b>Croissant,</b> Hans-Christian Ströbele, Kurt Groenewold, who had been working preparing for the trial for three years were expelled the second day of the trial. On 23 June (1975), <b>Croissant,</b> Ströbele (who had already been expelled) and Mary Becker were arrested, and in the meantime police invaded several defense attorneys' offices and homes, seizing several documents and files. Ströbele and <b>Croissant</b> were remanded and held for 4 weeks and 8 weeks accordingly. <b>Croissant</b> had to pay 80,000 Deutschmarks, to report weekly to police station as well as having his transport and identity papers seized.|$|E

25|$|Foucault {{remained}} a political activist, focusing on protesting government abuses {{of human rights}} around the world. He was {{a key player in}} the 1975 protests against the Spanish government to execute 11 militants sentenced to death without fair trial. It was his idea to travel to Madrid with 6 others to give their press conference there; they were subsequently arrested and deported back to Paris. In 1977, he protested the extradition of Klaus <b>Croissant</b> to West Germany, and his rib was fractured during clashes with riot police. In July that year, he organised an assembly of Eastern Bloc dissidents to mark the visit of Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev to Paris. In 1979, he campaigned for Vietnamese political dissidents to be granted asylum in France.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 1914, {{the news}} reached Paris of the {{assassination}} of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Serbian nationalists in Sarajevo. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July, and following the terms of their alliances, Germany joined Austria-Hungary, while Russia, Britain and France went to war against Austria-Hungary and Germany. France declared a general mobilization on 1 August 1914. On the day before the mobilization, the leader of the French socialists, Jean Jaurès, was assassinated by a mentally-disturbed man in the Café du <b>Croissant</b> near the headquarters of the socialist newspaper L'Humanité in Montmartre. The new war was supported by both French nationalists, who saw an opportunity to gain back Alsace and Lorraine from Germany, and by most on the left, who saw an opportunity to overthrow the monarchies in Germany and Austria-Hungary. Parisian men of military age were ordered to report to mobilization points in the city; only one percent did not appear.|$|E

His nighttime reveries had St. Martin entering the city on a white horse that lost its golden horseshoe. The very next morning, the baker whipped up horseshoe-shaped <b>croissants</b> filled with almonds, white poppy seeds and nuts, and gave them to the poor. In recent years, competition amongst local bakeries has become fierce for producing the best [...] "Rogale," [...] and very often bakeries proudly display a certificate of compliance with authentic, traditional recipes. Poznanians celebrate with a feast, specially organised by the city. There are different concerts, a St. Martin's parade and a fireworks show.|$|R

Eight songs were written or co-written by Sia; also featured is a cover version of Ray Davies' song [...] "I Go to Sleep", a studio recording of which later appeared on Sia's studio album Some People Have Real Problems (2008). The album was produced by Dan Carey, mixed by Jon Lemon and Taz Mattar at Sarm Studios in London, and mastered by Emily Lazar and Sarah Register at The Lodge in New York City. Lady <b>Croissant</b> received a mixed critical reception and spawned one single, [...] "Pictures", which was released exclusively via American Eagle Outfitters on 27 November 2006.|$|E

The aim of disarming the Armenian volunteer groups was never achieved. Despite the presence of helicopter gunships and armored vehicles, the militiamen managed to elude and evade capture. Ring, however, managed to reinforce the ethnic divide between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, [...] "virtually precluding," [...] according to Michael <b>Croissant</b> [...] "the possibility of further coexistence between the peoples within" [...] Azerbaijan's borders. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials maintained that Ring was necessary to prevent the region from further deteriorating into chaos and as the militias' presence contravened the July 1990 presidential decree.

500|$|Ter-Petrosyan {{announced}} his resignation on 3 February 1998. According to Michael P. <b>Croissant,</b> it was Vazgen Sargsyan who [...] "played ultimately the principal role in inducting the president's resignation." [...] In his resignation statement, Ter-Petrosyan referred to Vazgen Sargsyan, Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan as [...] "the well known body of power." [...] He cited {{the threat of}} destabilization {{of the country as}} the reason of his resignation. Ter-Petrosyan's resignation was followed by the resignation of National Assembly speaker Babken Ararktsyan, his two deputies, Mayor of Yerevan Vano Siradeghyan, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Arzoumanian and others. A significant change occurred in the National Assembly. Dozens of members of the parliamentary faction called the Republican Bloc (mostly made up of Ter-Petrosyan's Pan-Armenian National Movement) joined Vazgen Sargsyan's Yerkrapah bloc, making it the largest parliamentary bloc, with 69 members compared to only 56 for the Republic.|$|E
500|$|Roque Strew of Pitchfork Media found Sia's Adelaide accent to be a [...] "liability", {{specifically}} noting {{difference in}} pronunciation between the studio versions of [...] "Destiny" [...] and [...] "Distractions" [...] and the live performances. Strew complimented [...] "Pictures" [...] and [...] "Lentil", {{the latter of}} which shined through the [...] "fog of elongated syllables and cut consonants". Popmatters' Mike Schiller felt the instrumentation was [...] "robotic" [...] and found Sia's vocal manipulation and bending of vowels [...] "infuriating", even unintelligible at times. Schiller did, however, favor her vocal tone and found the power of her voice [...] "occasionally transcendent". Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY appreciated [...] "Pictures" [...] but also criticized Sia's performance for lacking diversity and for [...] "incomprehensible" [...] vocals due to her slurring of words. McCaighy concluded that, like other live albums, Lady <b>Croissant</b> was redundant but would be appreciated by fans. The Australian publication DNA published a mixed review of the album in 2010 following the release of We Are Born, complimenting Sia's vocals but suggesting that [...] "Pictures" [...] sounded like a B-side and that the album's release smells like a [...] "cash-in" [...] on her [...] "recent success".|$|E
500|$|Just {{over forty}} minutes in length, Lady <b>Croissant</b> {{contains}} nine [...] "slow-to-mid-tempo" [...] compositions. The album includes one previously unreleased studio recording called [...] "Pictures", co-written by Dan Carey, along with eight live tracks recorded during her 17 April 2006 {{performance at the}} Bowery Ballroom in New York City. [...] "Destiny" [...] and [...] "Distractions" [...] each appeared on Zero 7's 2001 album Simple Things, which featured vocals by Sia. Both songs were co-written by Sia and members of Zero 7; [...] "Destiny" [...] was also co-written by Sophie Barker, another vocal contributor to Simple Things. [...] "Blow It All Away" [...] originally appeared on Sia's 2002 studio album Healing Is Difficult, and [...] "Don't Bring Me Down", [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Breathe Me" [...] were each released on her 2004 album Colour the Small One. [...] "Lentil" [...] and the cover version of Ray Davies' song [...] "I Go to Sleep", made popular by both Cher and the Pretenders, would later appear on Some People Have Real Problems (2008).

50|$|<b>Croissants</b> {{have long}} been a staple of Austrian and French {{bakeries}} and pâtisseries. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food which can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissanterie was explicitly a French response to American-style fast food, and today 30-40% of the <b>croissants</b> sold in French bakeries and patisseries are baked from frozen dough.|$|R

500|$|Lady <b>Croissant</b> {{received}} a mixed critical reception. AllMusic's Marisa Brown called Sia's vocal performance [...] "rich and passionate" [...] and {{compared it to}} Nelly Furtado and Morley. Brown stated the band was [...] "tight and lush" [...] and that the music was [...] "very modern, warm and melodic and cleanly intricate". In his review for BBC Music, Paul Sullivan wrote that the album successfully displayed Sia's vocal capabilities and versatility. However, he noted the minimal audience participation and felt that this prevented the album from capturing a [...] "live" [...] experience. For Sullivan, highlights included [...] "Don't Bring Me Down", [...] "Destiny", and [...] "Lentil", which he believed were [...] "executed with an appealing mixture of frankness and fluidity". Mark Perlaki of Gigwise.com awarded the album {{four out of five}} stars and opined that the album [...] "portrays an artist who's star is in the ascendant, whose voice is unrivaled in style and expression, an artist on the brink of deserved and assured greater recognition". The Selby Times review called the collection [...] "mesmerising" [...] and a good indicator of Sia's future work. One reviewer for WERS called the album [...] "breathtaking" [...] and wrote positively of Sia's vocals and the instrumentation. Like Sullivan, the reviewer warned that listeners expecting a traditional live album with [...] "raw cuts and heavy improvisation" [...] might be disappointed.|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, John, having just chewed {{his way out of}} a dog carrier, meets Apu, who exclaims [...] "Elton John!", to which John replies [...] "That's my name! Well, not really." [...] The {{exchange}} references John's name change, as his birth name was Reginald Dwight. At the end of the episode, John performs for Apu and Manjula {{on the roof of the}} Kwik-E-Mart. The scene is a callback to the season 7 episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", in which Paul McCartney performed on the roof. The scene in which Homer is seen jamming Valentine's Day cards into their holders were based on an observation by the writers. Simpsons writer George Meyer said of the scene: [...] "You just see cards get really man-handled, and the envelopes get switched with the wrong sizes." [...] In another scene, Marge and Manjula are seen playing badminton. While the scene was conceived in order to provide exposition, the sport was included because badminton is [...] "very popular" [...] in India, according to Simpsons writer Ian Maxtone-Graham. The episode also mentions the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. In a scene, Apu, carrying a shopping bag, exits the jewellery and silverware store Tiffany & Co. Meanwhile, Homer, along with Chief Wiggum, Moe, Flanders and Dr Hibbert are watching Apu, assuming he bought jewellery for Manjula. It is soon revealed that Apu bought a <b>croissant</b> in the store, to which Wiggum says [...] "Oh, that's right, they have breakfast at Tiffany's now." [...] The heart-shaped fade out at the end of the episode is a reference to the series Love, American Style.|$|E
500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. She remembered that a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a <b>croissant</b> shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work for anyone else again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me {{her father was}} dead. The only thing that was true was she nicked stuff from the shop", which Guy said was worth £20,000. She admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped, and when Guy reported the theft, she was put on probation.|$|E
