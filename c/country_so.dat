5|$|This list {{includes}} {{areas that are}} internationally recognized, {{as well as some}} that are generally unrecognized. The definition of an autonomous area varies from country to <b>country,</b> <b>so</b> the native term as defined by the respective country's government is listed, and the English translation of the term is included.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Zersenay {{returned}} to Eritrea and trained {{for one month}} {{to prepare for the}} 2008 World Half Marathon Championships in Rio de Janeiro. He won his third consecutive title over the half marathon distance with ease, taking the lead early on and beating the second-placed Patrick Makau Musyoki by almost two minutes. His success caused much celebration in his home <b>country,</b> <b>so</b> much so that the President of Eritrea greeted him at the airport upon his return. With a strong history in the half marathon, Zersenay announced he would try the full marathon distance the following season.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, {{in many areas}} of the city, due in part to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is one of the very few in the <b>country</b> <b>so</b> pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E
5000|$|This {{village had}} {{visitors}} from 20 different <b>countries</b> <b>so</b> far.|$|R
50|$|Fitness First {{operates}} {{in many different}} <b>countries</b> <b>so</b> it has many different membership options around the world.|$|R

5|$|On 13 December 10 battleships, {{including}} Nevada, and 28 destroyers escorted {{the ocean}} liner , with president Woodrow Wilson embarked, into Brest, France, {{during the last}} day of Wilson's journey to the <b>country</b> <b>so</b> he could attend the Paris Peace Conference. The flotilla met George Washington and her escorts (Pennsylvania and four destroyers) just off Brest and escorted them into the port. The 10 battleships sailed for home at 14:00 on the next day, 14 December. They took less than two weeks to cross the Atlantic, and arrived in New York on 26 December to parades and celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Paraguay is a {{landlocked}} country and {{for much of}} its history it was difficult of access, except by sailing from the Atlantic up the River Paraná and hence the River Paraguay (see map) as the early Spanish explorers had done. There were other means of ingress, but they would have required an invading force to be resupplied through difficult and hostile <b>country.</b> <b>So</b> the command of the river was key {{to the security of}} Paraguay, who feared and distrusted its two much larger neighbours Brazil and Argentina.|$|E
25|$|Becoming an Associate {{would mean}} higher funding and, importantly, more {{exposure}} for the passionate and cricket-starved players from Afghanistan, a war-torn <b>country.</b> <b>So</b> far, the ICC was paying $700,000 in annual funding to Afghanistan, {{which is now}} likely to rise to $850,000 based on the Associate status.|$|E
5000|$|Income {{elasticity}} of demand equals unity in both <b>countries,</b> <b>so</b> economic growth {{results in a}} proportionate growth in demand.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} Gregorian {{calendar}} was not adopted simultaneously in all <b>countries,</b> <b>so</b> for many centuries, different regions used different dates {{for the same}} day.|$|R
50|$|Nitromethane {{is often}} {{difficult}} to obtain in many <b>countries,</b> <b>so</b> in these <b>countries</b> glow fuel typically has no nitromethane at all, which is generally not detrimental to engine longevity.|$|R
25|$|Hoping {{to form a}} {{successful}} national side {{in time for the}} tournament in Kenya, the ECB attracted several players with first-class experience in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka to take up employment in the <b>country</b> <b>so</b> that they could satisfy the residential requirements to represent the UAE in the tournament.|$|E
25|$|The inexistence of {{nationwide}} gendarmerie, {{meant that}} the Army would partially be employed in that role, mainly {{in the rural areas}} of the <b>country.</b> <b>So,</b> most of the Army units were frequently requested by the local administrative authorities to maintain public order and to perform other police duties, employing in these services an important part of their personnel.|$|E
25|$|In The Dogs of War (1974) a British mining {{executive}} hires a {{group of}} mercenaries {{to overthrow the government}} of an African <b>country</b> <b>so</b> that he can install a puppet regime that will allow him cheap access to a colossal platinum-ore reserve. This book was also adapted into the 1980 film starring Christopher Walken and Tom Berenger.|$|E
50|$|Viasat {{does not}} have a {{platform}} of their own outside the Nordic and Baltic <b>countries,</b> <b>so</b> they have to rely on third party distributors in Eastern and Central Europe.|$|R
50|$|The {{remainder}} is simply-connected {{and has a}} {{value of}} at least (n &minus; 1)/n to the remaining n &minus; 1 <b>countries,</b> <b>so</b> the division can proceed recursively in step 1.|$|R
5|$|Thailand's {{habitats}} are contiguous {{with those}} of neighbouring <b>countries,</b> <b>so</b> it has few endemic birds. The white-eyed river martin, known only from its single wintering site in Thailand, is probably extinct.|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} or three numbers {{appearing}} in the plate correspond to a specific country, for example 69 is issued to the United Kingdom. The following two digits are typically issued with lower numbers to higher-ranking officials, usually 01 being issued to the ambassador from that <b>country.</b> <b>So</b> DC 6901 would {{be found on the}} vehicle of the British High Commissioner to Australia.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Cassation (Yargıtay) is {{the last}} {{instance}} for reviewing rulings and judgments rendered by justice courts, criminal courts, the examination courts and renders verdicts upon appeal. The opinions rendered by the Court of Cassation are taken as precedents for legal rulings {{in the first instance}} courts throughout the <b>country,</b> <b>so</b> that uniform application may be achieved. It is also able to modify its own ruling upon request.|$|E
25|$|A {{year later}} in September 2013, Riley's name is cleared when Browning confesses to Lynsey's murder after being arrested for {{shooting}} Myra McQueen. Myra actually faked her {{death with a}} bullet proof vest and flees the <b>country</b> <b>so</b> Browning would be sent down and therefore kept away from Mercedes. In 2016, {{more than four years}} after her death, Silas told Lindsay Roscoe (Sophie Austin) that she loved her name, as he knew Lynsey before.|$|E

25|$|After its independence, Singapore had two {{infantry}} regiments {{commanded by}} British officers. This force was considered {{too small to}} provide effective security for the new <b>country,</b> <b>so</b> development of its military forces became a priority. Britain pulled its military out of Singapore in October 1971, leaving behind only a small British, Australian and New Zealand force as a token military presence. The last British soldier left Singapore in March 1976. New Zealand troops were the last to leave, in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Although {{intended}} {{to end the}} Oconee War, it angered the American settlers expelled from the Tallassee Country and Muscogee who {{wanted to keep the}} Oconee <b>Country,</b> <b>so</b> the war continued. The treaty also {{marked the beginning of the}} decline of McGillivray's influence in the Muscogee Confederacy and the rise of that of William Augustus Bowles, a bitter rival dating back to the Spanish campaign against Pensacola. By mid-1791, Bowles wielded enough influence to send large war parties raiding the Cumberland once again despite the treaty.|$|E
25|$|From 1997 onwards many {{registered}} {{clubs have}} come into existence and are affiliated with the Pakistan Blind Cricket Council. Cricket is now played regularly in schools among the blind. Tournaments are regularly organized in different cities of the <b>country</b> <b>so</b> that the blind {{may be able to}} meet, exchange information and have some fun. Rules similar to ‘sighted cricket’ are observed for cricket for the blind whenever it is played and efforts are being made to spread this all over the country.|$|E
50|$|States are {{encouraged}} to provide the Council, on a voluntary basis, with a midterm update on follow-up to accepted recommendations. As of 20 February 2013, 28 <b>countries</b> <b>so</b> far have provided the HRC with an implementation report.|$|R
25|$|The two {{sovereign}} {{states in the}} region, the United Kingdom and Ireland, are frequently referred to as <b>countries.</b> <b>So</b> too are England, Wales, Scotland and, to a lesser extent, Northern Ireland (as is the whole island of Ireland).|$|R
5000|$|The Central European Convention is a {{group of}} several IAESTE member {{countries}} in the specific geographic region. Those are all [...] "student-run" [...] <b>countries,</b> <b>so</b> students are in the decision making positions (contrary to academic or professional-run countries).|$|R
25|$|Tryon {{became a}} strong {{supporter}} of the idea that in time of war there should be a national insurance scheme for merchant vessels. He was concerned that in the event of war insurance rates for vessels against loss by enemy action would immediately become impossibly high, so that merchant ships would simply stop trading with Britain, even if the numbers being lost were relatively small. This would be disastrous for the <b>country,</b> <b>so</b> it would be far better for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} the rishonim, or the First Rabbinic Epoch, {{primarily}} consists of the writings from 11th and 12th century Spanish and French schools. With {{the decline of the}} gaonate {{in the first half of}} the eleventh century, the Jews of various countries lost the central spiritual authorities who had hitherto given their decisions in doubtful problems. Thenceforth the appeal in religious and legal questions was to be made to the rabbinical authorities of one's own or a neighboring <b>country,</b> <b>so</b> that inquiries sent during this period to Babylonia were rare and exceptional.|$|E
25|$|Though {{disappointed}} with the election results in Ontario, it increased its presence to 66 MPs, including two MPs from Ontario. Nationally, the party increased its popular vote to 25%. The Alliance remained the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. The Liberals increased their large majority mostly {{at the expense of}} the NDP, and the Tories under Joe Clark lost many seats and remained in fifth place, but Clark was elected in Calgary Centre in the middle of Alliance <b>country,</b> <b>so</b> the overall political landscape was not significantly changed.|$|E
5000|$|Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said: [...] "While {{balancing}} civil {{liberty and}} privacy concerns, this treaty encourages {{the sharing of}} critical electronic evidence among foreign <b>countries</b> <b>so</b> that law enforcement can more effectively investigate and combat these crimes".|$|R
50|$|The celebration {{is during}} the summer, like in many South American <b>countries,</b> <b>so</b> its normal to see many {{families}} in the New Year at tourist centers of the Argentine Atlantic coast (Mar del Plata, Necochea, Villa Gesell, Miramar, etc.).|$|R
50|$|In {{its first}} year (1961) there were 22 {{international}} participants. The symposia in Seča have continued without exception every two years, with sculptors from 30 <b>countries</b> <b>so</b> far participating, creating over 120 works, and up to 30,000 visitors attending.|$|R
