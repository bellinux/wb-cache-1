5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} <b>catalysis</b> {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent <b>catalysis</b> might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for <b>catalysis</b> to occur.|$|E
5|$|The favoured {{model for}} the enzyme–substrate {{interaction}} is the induced fit model. This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding. These conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the active site close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction. Conformational changes can be measured using circular dichroism or dual polarisation interferometry. After binding takes place, one or more mechanisms of <b>catalysis</b> lower {{the energy of the}} reaction's transition state by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction. Mechanisms of <b>catalysis</b> include <b>catalysis</b> by bond strain; by proximity and orientation; by active-site proton donors or acceptors; covalent <b>catalysis</b> and quantum tunnelling.|$|E
5|$|By {{orienting}} the substrates into {{a productive}} arrangement {{to reduce the}} reaction entropy change. The contribution of this mechanism to <b>catalysis</b> is relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{mechanistic}} {{possibility for}} <b>catalysis,</b> multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required {{in order to}} effect the reaction. This limits the atom economy of the reaction.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{that contain}} a {{catalytic}} triad {{use it for}} one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic <b>catalysis.</b> These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete <b>catalysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Robert Walton Vaughan, Professor of Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, leading {{researcher}} in {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} and <b>catalysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to <b>catalysis</b> varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before <b>catalysis</b> begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
5|$|The {{sophistication of}} the active site network causes {{residues}} involved in <b>catalysis</b> (and residues in contact with these) to be highly evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in <b>catalysis.</b> The triad remains {{the core of the}} active site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions.|$|E
5|$|Various {{compounds}} of lanthanum {{and other}} rare-earth elements (oxides, chlorides, etc.) are components of various <b>catalysis,</b> such as petroleum cracking catalysts.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on <b>catalysis</b> have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} <b>catalysis</b> using a residue as a nucleophile. The {{reactivity of}} the nucleophilic residue is increased by the functional {{groups of the}} other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes may use {{several of}} these {{mechanisms}} simultaneously. For example, proteases such as trypsin perform covalent <b>catalysis</b> using a catalytic triad, stabilise charge build-up on the transition states using an oxyanion hole, complete hydrolysis using an oriented water substrate.|$|E
5|$|In this fashion, RNAs {{can achieve}} {{chemical}} <b>catalysis</b> (like enzymes). For instance, {{determination of the}} structure of the ribosome—an enzyme that catalyzes peptide bond formation—revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases {{use different}} amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a nucleophile. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad. The chemical and physical constraints on enzyme <b>catalysis</b> have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different enzyme superfamilies.|$|E
5|$|The {{side-chain}} of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent <b>catalysis</b> on the substrate. The lone pair {{of electrons}} {{present on the}} oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient <b>catalysis.</b> The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S−) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine, however due to steric hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} an enzyme that {{contains}} a cofactor is carbonic anhydrase, which {{is shown in the}} ribbon diagram above with a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site. These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in <b>catalysis.</b> For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} applications of rhodium compounds and their derivatives in medicine and reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a radiopharmaceutical to treat small cancers. Rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these derivatives include molecular electronics and research into the mechanisms of <b>catalysis.</b> The value of rhodocenes tends {{to be in the}} insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems, rather than their applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Catalysis</b> is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} <b>catalysis</b> via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{contains}} the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce. However, {{it is unclear}} how long in the 4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material. RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out <b>catalysis</b> as part of ribozymes. This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both <b>catalysis</b> and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases. This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old, but these claims are controversial.|$|E
5|$|Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit {{their target}} proteases by the typical {{competitive}} (lock-and-key) mechanism used by most small protease inhibitors (e.g. Kunitz-type inhibitors). Instead, serpins use an unusual conformational change, which disrupts {{the structure of}} the protease and prevents it from completing <b>catalysis.</b> The conformational change involves the RCL moving to {{the opposite end of the}} protein and inserting into β-sheet A, forming an extra antiparallel β-strand. This converts the serpin from a stressed state, to a lower-energy relaxed state (S to R transition).|$|E
5|$|Libby {{started the}} first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972. As {{a member of}} the California Air Resources Board, he worked to develop and improve California's air {{pollution}} standards. He established a research program to investigate heterogeneous <b>catalysis</b> with the idea of reducing emissions from motor vehicles through more complete fuel combustion. The election of Richard Nixon as president in 1968 generated speculation that Libby might be appointed as Presidential Science Advisor. There was a storm of protest from scientists who felt that Libby was too conservative, and the offer was not made.|$|E
5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. The parchment worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid <b>catalysis</b> creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower, step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E
5|$|Reversible {{inhibition}} can {{be described}} quantitatively {{in terms of the}} inhibitor's binding to the enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex, and its effects on the kinetic constants of the enzyme. In the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme below, an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES. Upon <b>catalysis,</b> this complex breaks down to release product P and free enzyme. The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the dissociation constants Ki or Ki', respectively.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is used in}} {{numerous}} applications other than as currency, such as solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term silverware), and as an investment medium (coins and bullion) Silver is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, and in <b>catalysis</b> of chemical reactions. Silver compounds are used in photographic film and X-rays. Dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages and wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{chloride}} is {{by a huge}} margin {{the most}} common chlorine compound, {{and it is the}} main source of chlorine and hydrochloric acid for the enormous chlorine-chemicals industry today. About 15000 chlorine-containing compounds are commercially traded, including such diverse compounds as chlorinated methanes and ethanes, vinyl chloride and its polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC), aluminium trichloride for <b>catalysis,</b> the chlorides of magnesium, titanium, zirconium, and hafnium which are the precursors for producing the pure elements, and so on.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} {{rates and}} mechanisms {{are affected by}} a variety of factors including the strength of the surface-adparticle bond, orientation of the surface lattice, attraction and repulsion between surface species and chemical potential gradients. It is an important concept in surface phase formation, epitaxial growth, heterogeneous <b>catalysis,</b> and other topics in surface science. As such, the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries. Real-world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and silver halide salts used in photographic film.|$|E
5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base <b>catalysis,</b> hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E
5|$|The {{boron nitride}} nanomesh {{is not only}} stable to {{decomposition}} under vacuum, air and some liquids, but also up to temperatures of 800°C. In addition, it shows the extraordinary ability to trap molecules and metallic clusters which have similar sizes to the nanomesh pores, forming a well-ordered array. These characteristics promise interesting applications of the nanomesh in areas like <b>catalysis,</b> surface functionalisation, spintronics, quantum computing and data storage media like hard drives.|$|E
5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually {{only a small fraction}} of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in <b>catalysis.</b> The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though iridium also forms {{a number of}} organometallic compounds used in industrial <b>catalysis,</b> and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance spark plugs, crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes {{for the production of}} chlorine in the chloralkali process. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators.|$|E
5|$|The most {{sensitive}} enzyme assays use lasers focused through a microscope to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions. These measurements either use {{changes in the}} fluorescence of cofactors during an enzyme's reaction mechanism, or of fluorescent dyes added onto specific sites of the protein to report movements that occur during <b>catalysis.</b> These studies are providing a new view of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics, which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.|$|E
5|$|The {{second stage}} of <b>catalysis</b> is the {{resolution}} of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.|$|E
5|$|These {{so-called}} non-coding RNAs ("ncRNA") can be encoded {{by their}} own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), {{both of which are}} involved in the process of translation. There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the <b>catalysis</b> of peptide bond formation in the ribosome; these are known as ribozymes.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in <b>catalysis.</b> Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with <b>catalysis.</b> The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E
5|$|When {{dispersed}} on conductive materials, palladium is {{an excellent}} electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media. In 2010, palladium-catalysed organic reactions were recognised by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous <b>catalysis,</b> used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations. A 2008 study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for carbon-fluoride bonds.|$|E
