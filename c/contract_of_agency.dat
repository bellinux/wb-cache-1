50|$|This {{has become}} a more {{difficult}} area as states are not consistent {{on the nature of}} a partnership. Some states opt for the partnership as no more than an aggregate of the natural persons who have joined the firm. Others treat the partnership as a business entity and, like a corporation, vest the partnership with a separate legal personality. Hence, for example, in English law, a partner is the agent of the other partners whereas, in Scots law where there is a separate personality, a partner is the agent of the partnership. This form of agency is inherent in the status of a partner and does not arise out of a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> with a principal. The English Partnership Act 1890 provides that a partner who acts within the scope of his actual authority (express or implied) will bind the partnership when he does anything in the ordinary course of carrying on partnership business. Even if that implied authority has been revoked or limited, the partner will have apparent authority unless the third party knows that the authority has been compromised. Hence, if the partnership wishes to limit any partner's authority, it must give express notice of the limitation to the world. However, there would be little substantive difference if English law was amended: partners will bind the partnership rather than their fellow partners individually. For these purposes, the knowledge of the partner acting will be imputed to the other partners or the firm if a separate personality. The other partners or the firm are the principal and third parties are entitled to assume that the principal has been informed of all relevant information. This causes problems when one partner acts fraudulently or negligently and causes loss to clients of the firm. In most states, a distinction is drawn between knowledge of the firm's general business activities and the confidential affairs as they affect one client. Thus, there is no imputation if the partner is acting against the interests of the firm as a fraud. There {{is more likely to be}} liability in tort if the partnership benefited by receiving fee income for the work negligently performed, even if only as an aspect of the standard provisions of vicarious liability. Whether the injured party wishes to sue the partnership or the individual partners is usually a matter for the plaintiff since, in most jurisdictions, their liability is joint and several.|$|E

Architectural TechnologyThe South African Council for the Architectural Profession (SACAP) {{requires}} that all registered architects clearly {{set out the}} terms (as defined by Rule 4. 1 of the SACAP Code of Conduct, Board Notice 154 of 2009) of their appointment, before they undertake to perform any architectural work. Although the legally tested professional service agreements conform {{to the requirements of}} the Code of Conduct, architects are still reluctant to make use of these contracts. It has become common practice for architects to rely on their own knowledge of contracts to construct self-drafted agreements that are often not legally enforceable, or not to enter in to a client-architect agreement at all. It is the researcher's opinion that architects' knowledge and perceptions of the elements of contract law and the existing client-architect agreements should be investigated in an attempt to encourage the use of established service agreements. The agreement between the client and the architect plays a vital role in setting out the obligations of the parties involved in a construction project. Architects fail to provide their clients with a balanced, equitable and insurable professional service agreement, placing both parties at risk. The architect's authority is not established without a proper <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> and the client does not understand the obligations and the role that the service provider has to undertake to earn his fee. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the origin and development of contracts of agency in the built environment. The study further aims to establish if the current available client-architect agreements are defined clearly and appropriately, as a legal agreement...|$|E

40|$|Executive pay is a {{major issue}} in the {{corporate}} governance debate. As well in practice as in theory debate still exists how executive pay levels and structures can be explained. This paper provides an overview of 16 theories that have been used in the literature to explain the phenomenon. The theories can be classified into three types of approaches; 1) the value approach; 2) the agency approach; and 3) the symbolic approach. A critical assessment of the theories shows that the dominant use in the literature <b>of</b> the perfect <b>contracting</b> approach <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> theory neglects: 1) the socially determined symbolic value that executive pay could represent, and 2) the contextual conditions under which executive pay is set. A more conclusive understanding of executive pay would be based on considering executive pay as an outcome of socially constructed corporate governance arrangements in which the actors involved have considerable discretion to influence the outcomes. Incorporating such a view in attempts to explain executive pay provides a more conclusive explanation of the recurrent debate on executive pay in theory and practice. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> {{mandatum}} in Roman law, unlike its namesake {{in modern}} civil law legal systems, {{was not a}} <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> representation or <b>agency.</b> It was a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> gratuitous performance of services for others. According to Corpus luris Civilis it was a contract which drew its origin from the duties of friendship. This paper examines certain rules of mandatum and compares them with a similar legal institution known as procuratio and concludes that friendship must indeed have been the origin <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> The paper then examines various aspects of friendship in Roman society, and concludes that social custom cannot have been the sole basis for the creation <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> The philosophical and ethical views of Cicero and Seneca are then considered. From the works of these two authors two lines of thought regarding friendship are deduced: friendships are to be entered into for their own sake, or friendships are to be entered into for the benefits that will ensue. The former is the 'noble' view of friendship, the latter the 'utilitarian'. The author concludes after a reexamination {{of the rules of}} mandatum that the 'noble' view provides a better {{answer to the question of}} why mandatum was created by the Roman jurists...|$|R

More specifically, the article focuses on how structural and ideological power works in this setting and {{on the effects of}} this control for TAWs’ working conditions. Open-ended, semi-structured interviews were conducted with TAWs, regular employees, and a manager in a call center specializing in telecommunication services in Sweden.

The results also show how ideological power is mixed with structural control in terms of technological control systems and, most importantly, a systematic categorization of workers in a hierarchical structure according to their value to the call center. By systemically categorizing workers in the staircase model, a structural inequality is produced and reproduced in the call center. The motives for working in the call center are often involuntary and are caused by the shortage of work other than a career in support services. As a consequence, feelings of insecurity and an awareness of the precarious nature of their assignment motivate TAWs to enhance their performance and hopefully take a step up on the staircase.

It works on forms <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> that produce local and international benefits for commercialization (products, goods, and services); this has been understood by commerce and the law. Nonetheless, there are many obstacles (fiscal, taxes, legal protection of some contractual practices, and limiting clauses, among others) and it is sought for these to disappear, especially those that imply exaggerated protection of national commerce. The States seek mechanisms that help them regulate their relations among the different players and treaties are the main source from which emerge mandates that affect national and world economies, facilitating the creation of companies to explore new market places. It is thus that in the trade treaties or agreements, the objective is for trade to flow freely and for the nations to benefit from commercial exchange.
