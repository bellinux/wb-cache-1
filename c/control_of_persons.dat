The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the primary purpose of developing, within the framework of business management, with specific reference to strategic management, a management approach for combl-taxi facilities. Currently no formal approach for the efficient management and operation of combi-taxi facilities exists. The management and operation of combi-taxi facilities occurs on an ad hoc basis, is fragmented and restricted to only a few functions that are executed. Existing combi-taxi facilities are, however, a management and financial burden for the owner (traditionally a local authority) and gave reason to the physical deterioration' of the infrastructure and poor or insufficient management and operation thereof. The quality of combi-taxi services are dependent on the standard of combi-taxi facilities and related activities. In this study a systems approach was followed {{for the development of a}} holistic approach for the management and operation of combi-taxi facilities. The objectives of this management approach from a business perspective are the creation of self supporting combi-taxi facilities that are efficiently managed and operated, as well as an effective management structure with a healthy income base. Management, as the nucleus of the successful functioning of combi-taxi facilities in the context of this study, is regarded as the planning of and the organizing, leading and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> in the business which are responsible for the operation of the combi-taxifacility through the execution of activities and tasks within the relevant business functions, to ensure the optimal utilisation of scarce resources and the achievement of goals...|$|E

In 2008 the protection of soldiers and facilities was experimentally investigated under the aspect of a networked operational leadership. In this context as well a harbour protection trial was carried out in August/September 2008 at the naval base Eckernfoerde in Germany. This trial {{was part of}} the NATO CNADs program of work for “Defence Against Terrorism (DAT) ” starting in 2003, and Germany is the lead nation for item 7 on ”Technology for Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance & Target Acquisition of Terrorists (ISRTA) “. The contactless <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> and the remote surveillance of sensitive infrastructures are important tasks in order to provide the required security measures to protect the human population against the threads of international terrorism. Passive microwave imaging allows a daytime independent observation and examination of objects and persons under nearly all adverse ambient conditions without artificial exposure, hence fully avoiding health risks. The penetration capability of microwaves provides the detection of objects through atmospheric obstacles like bad weather, fog or dust, vapour and smoke, as well as through thin non-metallic materials and clothing. For the latter the detection of hidden objects like weapons, explosives, and contraband is possible by monitoring dielectric anomalies. One main activity in the Eckernfoerde trial was the simulation of a military entrance control facility in a tent including various imaging and a chemical sensor suite in order to provide security for a military camp. Besides commercial optical and infrared cameras various passive millimeter-wave imagers have been used from different German research institutions. DLR provided an imaging radiometer scanner operating at W band. A multitude of situations have been simulated and many persons carrying hidden objects under their clothing have been scanned. Earlier presented exemplary results from the trial have been further analyzed. The ongoing evaluation of the radiometer measurements are shown and discussed in the paper. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the establishment of}} the Commissariat of Education (Narkompros), the formation of its policies and their implementation. The study has two purposes. The first is to present an institutional history of the formation of a Soviet commissariat. The second is to examine the policies and organizational approaches of Narkompros towards education and the arts, as a major factor i# the establishment of relations between the Soviet government and the Russian intelligentsia. The original materials on which the thesis is based are the Narkompros files of the Central State Archives (TSGAOR and TSGA RSPSR) in Moscow. These consist largely of minutes and protocols of the collegium of Narkompros and some of its subordinate departments. Prom these materials, it is possible to reconstruct both the internal workings of Narkompros - its. organizational complexity and confusion, its financial difficulties, the relations between its members - and, to a considerable extent, its relations with other government and Party institutions. One of the problems interesting the author is the relationship of Narkompros with its superiors (VTSIK, Sovnarkom, the Central Committee, the Politburo), {{and the way in which}} these bodies influenced its policies and activities. It appears that interference from above was slight, except in times of crisis; and that at all times the proliferation of 'higher instances' made it relatively easy to evade unwelcome instructions from any one of them. In its relations with other commissariats and Vesenkha, Narkompros engaged in a series of demarcation disputes. These were often won on paper and according to the decision of Sovnarkom, but lost in practice because of Narkompros' weak economic position and lack of political influence. None of the leaders of Narkompros - Lunacharsky, Pokrovsky, Krupskaya and later Litkens - held influential positions in the Party. Narkompros 1 greatest political asset was Lenin's support, which (except on some artistic questions) was almost always given. The interest of other Party leaders in education and Narkompros was intermittent and, as regards Narkompros, not usually benevolent. Zinoviev, Kamenev, Stalin and Preobrazhensky all, on occasion, attacked or opposed Narkompros - a relevant factor in the case of Zinoviev and Kamenev being that both had wives working in Narkompros (Lilina and Kameneva) who were at odds with the Narkompros leadership. Dzerzhinsky made one major intervention in educational affairs, when he removed a whole sphere of Narkompros activity (child welfare) to the effective control of the GPU. VTSIK, of which Lunacharsky was a member throughout this period, was normally sympathetic to Narkompros; but its support of Narkompros projects rarely yielded substantial results, because other bodies disregarded its recommendations. The same was true, although to a lesser extent, of Sovnarkom resolutions on Narkompros 1 behalf. The Central Committee of the Party considered educational questions less frequently than VTSIK or Sovnarkom, and intervened usually to chastise Narkompros. Narkompros was in name, and indeed in fact, the commissariat of enlightenment. Its educational policies were solidly "based on the most enlightened and progressive educational theories of the time. But the execution of these policies was enormously hindered by the hostility of the intelligentsia and the ignorance of the masses. They foundered in the confusion of the Civil War and economic crisis. The leaders of Narkompros believed in encouraging local, popular initiative in the organization of education. They made little attempt to create a strong centralized administration of education. For this reason, among others, few of Narkompros' educational policies were satisfactorily realized in practice. In dealing with cultural and educational institutions - the universities, the Academy of Sciences, the theatres, Proletkult - Narkompros found itself in something of a dilemma of principle. It was ready to give independence and administrative autonomy, "but only in return for some show of cooperation and sympathy with the Soviet government. The universities, though very anxious for autonomy, were overtly hostile to Narkompros and the government. The Academy of Sciences approached Narkompros courteously (although without any declarations of political loyalty), and retained a degree of autonomy which the universities were denied. Proletkult was at first allowed "both autonomy and government subsidy by Narkompros; but, in 1920, Lunacharsky was rebuked for overlooking the political dangers of Proletkult's independence. Lunacharsky was always insensitive to nuances of political relations between revolutionary socialist groups, and this brought him into conflict with Lenin on the Proletkult issue. In the sphere of literature and the arts, Narkompros - and Lunacharsky in particular - acted as intermediary between the government and the intelligentsia. It was an ungrateful task. Narkompros and Lunacharsky were frequently criticized in government and Party circles for 'softness' towards the intelligentsia. They approached the intelligentsia in a conciliatory spirit which was rarely reciprocated: the organized' intelligentsia in the universities, Union of the arts and Teachers' Union responded belligerently, -and with a certain undertone of contempt. In spite of this, Lunacharsky had some success in opening channels of communication between the arts and the government. This, rather than the organization of an 'administration' of the arts, - involving subordination to government <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> and institutions which had been or wished to be independent of it - was his intention. His policy towards the arts was to tolerate and subsidize all groups showing a minimum of cooperation with Narkompros, and to avoid at all costs sponsoring any sort of artistic monopoly or 'official' art. This was a policy which would have appealed to the artistic left in the 1930 s, but in this period it was greatly resented. The futurists and 'proletarian' artists, particularly those who were Communists or Communist sympathizers (including Mayakovsky and Meyerhold), did not want toleration but monopoly, and loudly reproached Lunacharsky for withholding it from them. Lunacharsky defended the principle of individual creative freedom; one of his opponents on the left (Kerzhentsev) suggested in reply that Communist writers and artists should be brought under 'Party discipline' in their work. In 1920 - 21, the leaders and policies of Narkompros suffered heavy criticism and were partially discredited. By the end of 1921, the achievements of Narkompros in the educational sphere had been largely destroyed "by the economic crisis and by the New Economic Policy, which removed the greater part of educational financing from the central budget. This double defeat of Narkompros raises the question of whether its policies and ideals were fundamentally incompatible with the general policies of the Party and the institutions of Soviet government. The thesis concludes that the economic situation contributed overwhelmingly to Narkompros' defeat; and that the educational system which Narkompros had tried to create was beyond the financial and organizational capacity of the Soviet republic to sustain. The political explanation of Narkompros' defeat is accepted in part. On the one hand, many influential members of the Party and government regarded the leaders of Narkompros with suspicion as, in Stalin's phrase, 'old literati' of the revolution. Narkompros remained civilian in outlook and permissively democratic in method, resistant to the enthusiasm for strict centralization and military discipline which had been generated by the Civil War. For this reason, its policies were unlikely to be given the energetic support of most Party members either at central or local level. But, on the other hand, these policies were supported by Lenin. Lenin's wife, Krupskaya, - whom Lunacharsky once described as 'the soul of Narkompros 1 - was the most vehement of Narkompros' leaders in opposition to 'military' methods and the imposition of organizational forms from above. Her aim was not just to avoid 'bureauoratic' organization by departments and appointed officials (which Narkompros was forced to adopt, in spite of her objections), but to create a working participant democracy in the educational field through the organization of local, popularly-elected, educational Soviets. Lenin's speeches on education and political education developed the same theme, and applied it to the whole sphere of local organization. It is therefore suggested that Narkompros had a view of enlightenment which was shared by Lenin and was not foreign to the traditions of the Bolshevik Party; and that the achievements and aspirations of Narkompros under Lunacharsky were the legitimate, though not the only, offspring of the Party in power. </p...|$|E
