40|$|Abstract. The flat {{compression}} {{properties of}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>sandwich</b> structure {{are an important}} factor to evaluate their cushioning properties. At present, more research has been made on the mechanical properties in the cross direction (CD) and machine direction (MD), but less {{has been made in}} the flat compression direction. Selecting corrugated paperboards as samples, we analyzed the flat compression properties of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sandwich</b> structure and explored the critical stress which is a key element for evaluating the cushioning properties based on theory and experiment. It is convenient to evaluate the cushioning properties and optimize the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sandwich</b> structure. Simplifying the corrugated structure into the struts, and referring to the bending theory of the standard beam theory, we explored the evaluating equation of the critical stress for <b>corrugated</b> <b>sandwich</b> structure by the bending moment and Euler formulas. The critical stress is in direct proportion to the elastic modulus and the thickness of the basis material. It is also closely related to the length of the corrugated cell-wall and the pasted width between the corrugated cell-wall and the linerboard. Changing the above parameters, we can change the compression resistance of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sandwich</b> structure. The theoretical value of the critical stress of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sandwich</b> structure is higher than the experimental value, since the mechanical properties are lost when the basis material is manufactured into corrugated sandwiches and corrugated boards. Therefore, the lost coefficient is introduced into the theoretic equation which can not only help optimize and design the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sandwich</b> structure, but also find application in optimized design of cushioning pads of <b>corrugated</b> <b>sandwich</b> structure...|$|E

The numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element code of LS-DYNA. The effect of fin wall imperfection was assessed through the fin wall bending and bulging. The numerical homogenization of the single layer corrugated structure was performed using MAT 26 honeycomb material model. The buckling stress of single- and double-layer <b>corrugated</b> <b>sandwich</b> structures increased when the strain rate increased. The increased buckling stresses were ascribed to the micro inertial effects. The initial buckling stress at quasi-static and high strain rate was numerically shown to be imperfection sensitive. Increasing the number of core layers decreased the buckling stress and increased the densification strain. The panels tested with spherical and flat striker tips were not penetrated and experienced slightly higher deformation forces and energy absorptions in 0 °/ 90 ° corrugated layer orientation than in 0 °/ 0 ° orientation.

40|$|The {{design of}} steel bridge decks has {{remained}} unchanged since {{the introduction of}} orthotropic decks. Orthotropic decks are expensive to produce, mainly due to high labor-costs. Furthermore, several joints (within the deck and between the deck and the surrounding structure) are highly fatigue sensitive, and the deck has a low stiffness in the transverse direction (i. e. perpendicular to the longitudinal stiffeners). This has in many cases led to premature deterioration and high maintenance costs. This thesis has a focus on laser-welded <b>corrugated</b> core steel <b>sandwich</b> bridge decks that have an increased stiffness-to-weight ratio and a more industrialized production with less complex detailing compared to conventional orthotropic steel decks. These enhancements {{lead to a more}} attractive solution with respect to economic and environmental sustainability. Structural analysis of a three-dimensional <b>corrugated</b> core <b>sandwich</b> panel using numerical methods is computationally heavy. In particular, the structural behavior of such panel in the transverse direction is rather complex. For that reason, this thesis is aimed at developing methods for simplified analysis incorporating homogenized beam and plate theories. Focus is put on predicting the stiffness and load effects in the direction transverse to the corrugation. A second aim of this thesis is to investigate the impact of variation of the production-dependent geometric parameters of the core-to-face joints of <b>corrugated</b> core steel <b>sandwich</b> panels on fatigue-relevant stresses {{in the vicinity of the}} laser stake welds. In order to utilize a simplified approach for static analysis of a <b>corrugated</b> core steel <b>sandwich</b> panel, a new analytical formulation for the transverse shear stiffness in the weak direction of the panel is presented in this thesis.

Both the transverse shear stiffness and the rotational spring is verified by numerical analyses and experiments. Furthermore, the impact of the variation of the production-dependent parameters is studied in this thesis by an extensive parametric study incorporating two-dimensional continuum numerical models.

As an example, the parametric study shows that a misalignment between the weld-line and core direction can lead to a large increase of the fatigue-relevant stresses...|$|R
