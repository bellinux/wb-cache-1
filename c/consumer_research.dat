5|$|Despite early success, the series, {{along with}} the overall rhythm game genre, {{suffered}} from poor sales starting in 2009. Company spokesman Eric Hollreiser said <b>consumer</b> <b>research</b> suggested continued solid demand for the series. Still, by early 2011, Activision stated that the series was on hiatus for 2011, while a seventh main title in the series was under development; this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product. Activision later shut down sales of the series' downloadable content, although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought.|$|E

5|$|The {{secondary}} market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic {{secondary market}} evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the secondary market is so large and complex, it has become an area of study for <b>consumer</b> <b>research,</b> and some people make a career out of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E

Toyota dropped the Avalon tag {{for their new}} large car, as it had gained a reputation to be an uninspiring car, both in the flesh and to drive.

500|$|Richard Leakey, who was {{responsible}} for the first major ivory destruction in Kenya in 1989, argues that these acts are primarily about sending a message to foster a public that sees the value in wildlife itself, not its byproducts, and thereby influencing the demand side of the market. In explaining the [...] "enormous impact" [...] that he saw after the 1989 event, Leakey said that [...] "up to that time we'd been losing about three and a half thousand to four thousand elephants a year, and a year later we were losing at most sixty." [...] <b>Consumer</b> <b>research</b> in China, the world's largest consumer of ivory, showed that many potential buyers have little understanding of the connection between the ivory trade and steep declines in elephant populations. High-profile government events bring the problem to large numbers of people and affirm a government stance for anyone who had been unclear. The events also aim to signal decreasing acceptance and popularity of ivory goods, making them less desirable by lowering their status and shaming individuals, organizations, and institutions who buy, sell, or own the goods. In China, prices fell by nearly half between 2015 and 2016, following the government announcement that it would begin phasing out its domestic ivory trade. According to Hongxiang Huang in a report by NPR, the decline was not likely due to conservation reasons, but because [...] "ne thing that proud Chinese people don't want to be, these days, is behind the times." ...|$|E
