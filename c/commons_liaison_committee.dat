50|$|The House of <b>Commons</b> <b>Liaison</b> <b>Committee</b> {{has said}} that claims of {{commercial}} confidentiality are {{making it difficult for}} MPs to scrutinise the growing number of PFI contracts in the UK. The National Audit Office (NAO) is responsible for scrutinising public spending throughout the UK on behalf of the British Parliament and is independent of Government. It provides reports on the value for money of many PFI transactions and makes recommendations. The Public Accounts Committee also provides reports on these issues at a UK-wide level. The devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own equivalents of the NAO such as the Wales Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Audit Office which review PFI projects in their respective localities. In recent years the Finance Committees of the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales have held enquiries into whether PFI represents good value for money.|$|E
40|$|Prime ministerial {{power is}} always contingent, {{based on the}} {{utilisation}} of personal and institutional resources, subject to various formal and informal constraints. Parliament is both a political resource to be utilised, but also a veto-player. In the absence of formal mechanisms setting out the requirements for UK prime ministerial accountability to parliament, a fluid and essentially personalised relationship has developed. Regular prime ministerial appearances before the House of <b>Commons</b> <b>Liaison</b> <b>Committee,</b> begun in 2002, have added to parliament’s scrutiny toolkit. This article considers the accountability {{of the prime minister}} to parliament by analysing the emergence and development of the Liaison Committee evidence sessions, and draws on interviews with participants and examination of the session transcripts, in order to assess the value of this scrutiny mechanism within the broader framework of prime ministerial-legislative relation...|$|E
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} series of {{significant}} innovations in the way Parliament holds government to account, mostly involving the House of Commons, {{but in some cases}} the House of Lords as well. They include: More resources for select committees; The introduction of ‘core tasks’ for select committees in the Commons setting out their work objectives; More select committees in both houses, holding more inquiries and producing more reports; The Prime Minister holding twice-annual oral evidence sessions with the House of <b>Commons</b> <b>Liaison</b> <b>Committee,</b> which comprises the chairs of the various Commons select committees; The introduction of public bill committees for more effective legislative scrutiny in the Commons; Greater transparency for executive financial accountability to Parliament; A Commons backbench business committee, to some extent loosening the grip of the executive, via the whips, on the Commons timetable; Elections for Commons committee members and chairs, again lessening the influence of the whips; Pre-appointment hearings by Commons committees for preferred candidates for major public appointments; and The placing of powers previously exercised under the extra-parliamentary Royal Prerogative on a statutory basis, making Parliament the ultimate authority. Most notably, the Civil Service is now regulated by an Act of Parliament...|$|E
