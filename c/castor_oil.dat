40|$|The {{objective}} {{in this experiment}} {{was to determine the}} effects of feeding diets with canola, sunflower or <b>castor</b> <b>oils</b> on intake, nutrient apparent digestibility and ruminal constituents of crossbred Dorper × Santa Inês sheep. Four rumen-cannulated animals of 90. 2 ± 11. 4 kg average body weight were assigned to a 4 × 4 latin square. Animals remained individually in cages for the metabolism assay and were fed diets containing roughage at 500 g/kg and concentrate based on ground corn and soybean meal also at 500 g/kg. No oil was added to the control diet, whereas the others had canola, sunflower or <b>castor</b> <b>oils</b> at 30 g/kg (DM basis). There was no difference for the intake of DM and nutrients, except for ether extract, which was greater when animals received oil. The digestibility coefficients of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, non-fiber carbohydrates and neutral detergent fiber were not changed; however, the addition of oil increased the ether extract digestibility. The values of total digestible nutrients (TDN, g/kg of DM), digestible energy (DE, Mcal/kg of DM), TDN intake and DE intake also did not change with the addition of lipids. Concerning the ruminal constituents, the addition of vegetable oils reduced the concentrations of acetate, butyrate and total short-chain fatty acids. Adding canola, sunflower or <b>castor</b> <b>oils</b> at 30 g/kg in diets with 500 g roughage/kg and 500 g concentrate/kg does not impair the intake or digestibility of nutrients in sheep, although it reduces the concentration of short-chain fatty acids in the rumen...|$|R
40|$|In {{search of}} {{solution}} to the harmful ecological problems due to toxicity and non-biodegradability posed by conventional transformer insulation oil (mineral oil), the production of transformer <b>oil</b> from <b>castor</b> seed <b>oil</b> (vegetable oil) was carried out.

The solvent employed gave good yield of oil from the seeds. The results of characterization show that the density 0. 987 (g ml– 1), viscosity 7. 01 (cst), Flash Point 253 oC and dielectric strength of 23 (KV) values, of <b>Castor</b> seed <b>oil</b> as transformer oil produced under optimized conditions meet the ASTM standard and was within the acceptable limits as transformer oil.

Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature.

His stomach pains were severe enough that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and <b>castor</b> <b>oil.</b> Higgins died after two days of illness.

40|$|The {{inhibitive}} {{effect of}} the ethyl esters of rubber seed <b>oil</b> and <b>castor</b> seed <b>oil</b> have been studied in order to evaluate their effect on the corrosion of mild steel in HCl and petroleum- water mixtures at 303 and 333 K in this work. The inhibition efficiency of the two inhibitors increased {{with an increase in}} concentration of inhibitor and decreased with temperature at all concentrations. Results obtained in this work showed that the adsorption of the ethyl esters on mild steel is by physical adsorption. At all concentrations of inhibitor and studied temperatures, the ethyl ester of rubber seed oil was found to have higher inhibition efficiency than the ethyl ester of <b>castor</b> seed <b>oil.</b> The negative {{effect of the}} reaction time from the 2 m- 1 fractional factorial design was attributed to the reduction in the effectiveness of the catalyst with time due to deactivation catalyst weight.

5|$|Proteins {{can also}} be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (discussed above) that are found in some legumes, {{as shown in the}} figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as {{irreversible}} inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is ricin, an extremely potent protein toxin found in <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> beans. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin to kill a cell.|$|E
