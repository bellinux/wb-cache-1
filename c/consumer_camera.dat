40|$|The key {{obstacle}} {{to the use of}} <b>consumer</b> <b>cameras</b> in computer vision and computer graphics applications is the lack of synchronization hardware. We present a stroboscope based synchronization approach for the charge-coupled device (CCD) <b>consumer</b> <b>cameras.</b> The synchronization is realized by first aligning the frames from different video sequences based on the smear dots of the stroboscope, and then matching the sequences using a hidden Markov model. Compared with current synchronized capture equipment, the proposed approach greatly reduces the cost by using inexpensive CCD cameras and one stroboscope. The results show that our method could reach a high accuracy much better than the frame-level synchronization of traditional software methods...|$|R

5000|$|The Sony DCR-TRV900 was a DV tape {{camcorder}} {{released by}} Sony in 1998, with an MSRP of USD $2699. It {{was intended as}} a high-end <b>consumer</b> <b>camera,</b> more portable and less expensive than the top-of-the-line DCR-VX1000. It became one of several Sony and Canon models popular in late-'90s desktop video production, delivering quality comparable to then-dominant analog Betacam hardware {{at a fraction of the}} cost. In 2002, Sony replaced the TRV900 with the somewhat less well-received DCR-TRV950.|$|E
50|$|The move {{to digital}} formats was {{helped by the}} {{formation}} of the first JPEG and MPEG standards in 1988, which allowed image and video files to be compressed for storage. The first <b>consumer</b> <b>camera</b> with a liquid crystal display on the back was the Casio QV-10 developed by a team led by Hiroyuki Suetaka in 1995. The first camera to use CompactFlash was the Kodak DC-25 in 1996.. The first camera that offered the ability to record video clips may have been the Ricoh RDC-1 in 1995.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the number}} of pixels for <b>consumer</b> digital still <b>camera</b> are amazingly {{increasing}} by modern semiconductor and digital technology. The biggest pixels as a <b>consumer</b> digital <b>camera</b> were 0. 8 millions at the 1996, and transmission techniques of image to PC had been received attention. Only 4 years later, in the 2000, there are 25 kinds of <b>consumer</b> pixel <b>cameras</b> on the market which have more than 3 million pixels in Japan. The functionary for transmission of image to PC is standardized, and the price is less than 1000 US$. In these circumstances, {{it is expected that}} 3 million <b>consumer</b> digital still <b>cameras</b> will become useful tool in various real-time imaging fields, e. g. industry, machine and robot vision, archeology, architecture, construction management, and so on.

5000|$|In 1947, Polaroid {{introduced}} its first <b>consumer</b> <b>camera.</b> The Land Camera Model 95 {{was the first}} camera to use instant film to quickly produce photographs without developing them in a laboratory. The popular Model 95 and subsequent Land Cameras required complex procedures to take and produce good photographs. Photographic paper had to be manually removed from cameras, peeled open after 60 seconds, needed several minutes to dry, and often left developing chemicals on hands. The instructions for the Model 20 Swinger, introduced in 1965, warned that, if not followed, [...] "you’re headed for plenty of picture taking trouble".|$|E
50|$|The Zeiss Vario Sonnar T* Lens {{provides}} a 12x optical zoom which starts at 29mm equivalent wide angle. There is an optional 24x Clear Image zoom which zooms {{by using a}} smaller number of pixels until it matches the resolution of the output. Digital zoom can extend to 160x although with progressively degrading quality. Optical SteadyShot Image Stabilization has an optional mode called Intelligent Active Mode which using digital techniques on top of the optical stabilization to stabilize even more aggressively. The AX100 has neutral density filters built into the camera which is rare for a <b>consumer</b> <b>camera.</b> It can be set to automatic or manual control with the following settings: Off, 1/4, 1/16, and 1/64.|$|E
50|$|Peterson's {{influence}} {{went beyond}} the photography industry.

Several digital cameras take photos in either ratio, and nearly all digital SLRs take pictures in a 3:2 ratio, as most can use lenses designed for 35 mm film. Some photo labs print photos on 4:3 ratio paper, {{as well as the}} existing 3:2. In 2005 Panasonic launched the first <b>consumer</b> <b>camera</b> with a native aspect ratio of 16:9, matching HDTV. This is similar to a 7:4 aspect ratio, which was a common size for APS film. Different aspect ratios {{is one of the reasons}} consumers have issues when cropping photos. An aspect ratio of 4:3 translates to a size of 4.5"x6.0". This loses half an inch when printing on the [...] "standard" [...] size of 4"x6", an aspect ratio of 3:2.

5000|$|... 1963: Topcon RE Super (Japan; called Super D in USA; name became Super D {{worldwide}} in 1972): first SLR with through-the-lens (TTL) light meter for convenient exposure control. Had internal cadmium sulfide (CdS) photoresistive cells mounted behind non-silvered slits in the reflex mirror for coupled center-the-needle, open aperture, full area averaging metering with auto-diaphragm lenses. Film is rated {{at a particular}} [...] "speed" [...] sensitivity. It needs a specific amount of light to form an image. The Weston Universal 617 (USA) helped introduce light exposure metering by a handheld selenium photoelectric device to sense the ambient light in 1932, but miniature light meters built into the camera that gave TTL readings were a great leap forward in convenience introduced by the Feinwerk Technik Mec 16SB (West Germany) non-SLR subminiature (10×14 mm frames on 16 mm film) camera in 1960. TTL metering became normal in virtually all 35 mm SLRs by the late 1960s. The durable and rugged RE Super had excellent interchangeable Exakta mount lenses and was the only pro level 35 mm SLR {{to compete with the}} Nikon F (see above) with any success.

5000|$|In late 1982, Heyman, by then a savvy risk {{arbitrage}} investor, acquired approximately 4.1% of {{the outstanding}} shares in GAF Corporation (GAF an abbreviation for General Aniline & Film), a troubled, 1960's-style conglomerate that was formerly owned by the US Government during each of World War I and World War II. Heyman invested in GAF {{with the expectation that}} then-Chairman, 65 year old Dr. Jesse Werner, would retire. Between 1978 and 1981, in an effort to streamline the business and improve profitability, Werner sold GAF's <b>consumer</b> <b>camera,</b> projector, and photo processing operations (including the ubiquitous GAF View-Master stereo 3D picture viewer) and its dyes and pigments businesses, leaving GAF with three businesses: GAF Chemicals (which would become International Specialty Products Inc.), GAF Broadcasting (at the time, the New York City-based classical radio station, WNCN-FM), and GAF Building Products (today's GAF Materials Corporation). When Dr. Werner reneged on his pledge to retire (he signed a five-year, multi million dollar employment agreement), Heyman prepared his own slate of directors, including Heyman as Chairman, and ran against the incumbent Board and management team in an unprecedented proxy fight. In late December 1983, the shareholders voted to oust the existing Board (including Werner) and to install Heyman as CEO and chairman. At the time, given Heyman's minority ownership of less than 5% of the company, Barron's hailed the development as [...] "one of the most striking achievements in the annals of corporate finance." ...|$|E

40|$|Commission I/ 2 KEY WORDS: Camera calibration, {{stability}} of interior orientation, effect of zoom, nominal camera parameters. During {{the last years}} the number of available low-cost digital <b>consumer</b> <b>cameras</b> has significantly increased while their prices decrease. Therefore for many applications with no high-end accuracy requirements {{it is an important}} consideration whether to use low-cost cameras. This paper investigates in the use of <b>consumer</b> <b>cameras</b> for photogrammetric measurements and vision systems. An important aspect of the suitability of these cameras is their geometric stability. Two aspects should be considered: The change of calibration parameters when using the camera’s features such as zoom or auto focus and the time invariance of the calibration parameters. Therefore laboratory calibrations of different cameras have been carried out at different times. The resulting calibration parameters, especially the principal distance and the principal point, and their accuracies are given. The usefulness of the information given in the image header, especially the focal length, is compared to the results of the calibration. ...|$|R
