5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{is potentially}} confusing. Procolobus foai has, together {{with all other}} red colobuses, been considered a subspecies of Procolobus badius. When considered a separate species, the scientific name Procolobus oustaleti (Trouessart, 1906) {{has been used for}} the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Colobus,</b> but this is incorrect, as the taxon foai precedes oustaleti by 7 years. Additionally, the taxon tephrosceles has been considered a subspecies of the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> but following Groves (2001) it is here recognized as a separate species, the Ugandan red colobus. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> should be considered a subspecies of P. rufomitratus. As here defined, the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has 5 subspecies, although these are variable and hard to separate: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus foai) is an Old World monkey in {{the family}} Cercopithecidae. It is found in humid forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic and South Sudan.|$|E
50|$|The {{members of}} this {{subgenus}} are found in western, central and eastern Africa, and the species have largely allo- or parapatric distributions. Most are restricted to humid forests, but the Zanzibar red colobus prefers coastal thickets and scrub. Red colobuses are primarily arboreal and are highly sensitive to hunting and habitat destruction, and have {{been referred to as}} probably the most threatened taxonomic group of primates in Africa. If following the taxonomic treatment advocated in Mammal Species of the World, all species except the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> are assessed by the IUCN as endangered or critically endangered.|$|E
50|$|The Tana River <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{had been}} {{considered}} one of The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates. It was, together with the equally endangered Tana River mangabey, {{the main reason for}} the creation of the Tana River Primate Reserve in 1978, but human encroachment within this reserve continues. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} 20,000 hectares of the Tana River Delta should be transformed into sugarcane plantations, but this has, temporarily at least, been stopped by the High Court of Kenya. Contra Groves, it was not recognized as a species separate from the Ugandan, <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> and Thollon's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> in the 2008 IUCN Red List. With these as subspecies, P. rufomitratus is considered to be of least concern in the 2008 IUCN Red List, while P. (r.) rufomitratus is considered endangered.|$|R
40|$|Simian retroviruses are {{precursors}} of {{all human}} retroviral pathogens. However, {{little is known about}} the prevalence and coinfection rates or the genetic diversity of major retroviruses—simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (STLV- 1), and simian foamy virus (SFV) —in wild populations of nonhuman primates. Such information would contribute to the understanding of the natural history of retroviruses in various host species. Here, we estimate these parameters for wild West <b>African</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) in the Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire. We collected samples from a total of 54 <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys; samples consisted of blood and/or internal organs from 22 monkeys and addition-ally muscle and other tissue samples from another 32 monkeys. PCR analyses revealed a high prevalence of SIV, STLV- 1, and SFV in this population, with rates of 82 %, 50 %, and 86 %, respectively. Forty-five percent of the monkeys were coinfected with all three viruses while another 32 % were coinfected with SIV in combination with either STLV or SFV. As expected, phylogenetic analyses showed a host-specific pattern for SIV and SFV strains. In contrast, STLV- 1 strains appeared to be distributed in genetically distinct and distant clades, which are unique to the Taï forest and include strains previously described from wild chimpanzees in the same area. The high prevalence of all three retroviral infections in P. b. badius represents a source of infection to chimpanzees and possibly to humans, who hunt them...|$|R
5000|$|Duikers {{are found}} sympatrically in many {{different}} regions. Most species dwell in the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa, creating overlapping regions among different species of forest duikers. Although [...] "body size is the primary factor in defining the fundamental niches of each species", often dictating the distribution and abundance of duikers in a given habitat, it is often hard {{to distinguish between the}} numerous species of duikers based purely on distribution and abundance. For example, the blue duiker and red forest duiker coexist within a small area of Mossapoula, <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> Republic. But while blue duikers are seen more frequently than red forest duikers “in the heavily hunted area of Mossapoula, <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> Republic", <b>red</b> forest duikers are more observed in a less exploited regions such as the western Dja Reserve, Cameroon.|$|R

50|$|The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has {{two main}} predators: the common {{chimpanzee}} and the crowned eagle. There are many primate species in Kibale National Park but chimpanzees rarely hunt any species {{other than the}} Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Each year in Ngogo, part of Kibale National Park, up to 12% of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> population is killed by chimpanzees. Chimpanzees do not hunt Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> all year round, instead they tend to go through bouts of heavy hunting. In response to attacks by a chimpanzee, all members of a Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> group gather together and males assemble to aggressively try and deter the attacking chimpanzee.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this 3 -year {{investigation}} we documented {{patterns of}} density, diet, and activity of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Procolobus tephrosceles) in six areas {{in or near}} Kibale National Park, Uganda and related these patterns to availability of food resources. There were large differences in the density and behavior of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> among the sites. For example, the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> at one site with a diverse plant community of more than 61 tree species, had a diet that included at least 42 species. In contrast, at a second site <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent 92 % of their feeding time eating from one species that dominated the tree community. The density of important <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> food trees varied among sites from 32 trees/ha to 204 trees/ha, and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density ranged from 0. 70 groups/km 2 to 7. 41 groups/km 2. Among sites, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density {{was related to the}} cumulative DBH of important food trees, when one apparently anom-alous site was excluded, and populations with more plant species in their diets tended to be those that were found at higher densities. Activity budgets of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> populations varied markedly among sites. For example, feeding time ranged among sites from 29 to 55 %, and traveling varied from 5 to 20 %. When faced with increased foraging demands, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> reduced the time spent resting, while the time spent socializing remained fairly constant. Comparative socioecological studies typically contrast species epa-rated by large geographical distances to ensure there is sufficient variation in the environment to detect behavioral responses. The marked ifferences in ecological conditions and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> behavior we docu-mented over short geographical distances, uggests that small-scale contrasts are a useful tool to examine ecological determinants of behavior and community structure...|$|R
50|$|Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Piliocolobus badius waldronae) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> native to West Africa. It has not been officially sighted since 1978 and was considered extinct in 2000.

50|$|Pennant's colobus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1838 by George Robert Waterhouse, {{curator at the}} Zoological Society of London's museum, and was named in honour of the naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant.Three subspecies of this <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> are traditionally recognized: The Bioko <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii pennantii), the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii epieni) and Bouvier's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii bouvieri). However, Groves (2007) raised P. p. epieni, and P. p. bouvieri to Piliocolobus epieni and Piliocolobus bouvieri, respectively (this nomenclature has been followed here). Ting agreed that preliminary genetic evidence supported elevating P. epieni at least.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the time}} it first became known to science (in 1993) until 2007 or 2008, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of the western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius) and more recently Pennant's colobus (Procolobus pennantii), and its trinomial name was Procolobus badius epieni or Procolobus pennantii epieni. Colin Groves recognized the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as a full species in 2007, although Groves considered all the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys, including the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{to be in the}} genus Piliocolobus, rather than Procolobus (this nomenclature has been followed here).

50|$|According to sources, Kirk first drew zoologists' {{attention}} to the Zanzibar <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> which is also commonly known as Kirk's <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> This species, Procolobus kirkii, which is endemic to Zanzibar, is named after him.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius), {{also known}} as the rust <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a species of Old World monkey found in West African forests from Senegal to Ghana. All other species of red colobuses have {{formerly}} been considered subspecies of P. badius. It is often hunted by the common chimpanzee.

50|$|It is {{not certain}} why the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> forms these {{associations}} with other species but protection from predators is the most accepted reason. The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is less vigilant, looking out for predators less often, when associated with the red-tailed monkey.

40|$|Primate {{gastrointestinal}} microbial {{communities are}} becoming increasingly appreciated for their relevance to comparative medicine and conservation, but the factors that structure primate “microbiomes ” remain controversial. This study examined a community of primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to assess {{the relative importance of}} host species and location in structuring gastrointestinal microbiomes. Fecal samples were collected from primates in intact forest and from primates in highly disturbed forest fragments. People and livestock living nearby were also included, as was a geographically distant population of related <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> in Kenya. A culture‐free microbial community fingerprinting technique was used to analyze fecal microbiomes from 124 individual <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus rufomitratus), 100 individual black‐and‐white colobus (Colobus guereza), 111 individual red‐tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius), 578 human volunteers, and 364 domestic animals, including cattle (Bos indicus and B. indicusB. taurus crosses), goats (Caprus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), and pigs (Sus scrofa).

50|$|Another {{remarkable}} behavior {{occurs when}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys reach their restless and somewhat nomadic adolescence. This period {{is when the}} young monkeys leave their natal troops and look for another troop to join. This is not easy, as most troops are very suspicious and can get deadly when new monkeys try to join. The <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys have adapted their behavior by joining troops of green monkeys that are near the potential <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> troops that they wish to join, and living amongst {{them in order to}} spy on their potential new families. In one notable case, an adolescent male <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent two years with a green monkey troop in order to spy in safety on a prospective troop in this manner.|$|R

40|$|Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) hunt various primates, but {{concentrate}} on <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Piliocolobus spp.) wherever {{the two species}} are sympatric. The extraordinarily large Ngogo chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda, preys heavily on the local population of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (P. tephrosceles). Census data showed a steep decline in this population {{in the center of}} the chimpanzees’ home range between 1975 and 2007 [Lwanga et al., 2011; Teelen, 2007 b]. Given no obvious change in food availability, predation by chimpanzees was the most likely cause [ibid.; Teelen, 2008]. However, census data from other parts of the home range raised the possibility that the decline was restricted to this central area [Teelen, 2007 a] We present data from 1998 to 2012 on the rate of encounters between chimpanzees and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> that provide a chimpanzee‐centered estimate of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density, thus of predation opportunities, throughout the home range. These corroborate census data by showing a long‐term decline in encounters near the center. They also show that encounters become relativelymore common at increasing distances from the center, but encounter rates have decreased even in peripheral areas and, by implication, the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> population has declined throughout the study area. These data corroborate Teelen’s [2008] conclusion that chimpanzee predation on <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> during the 1990 s and early 2000 s was unsustainable. Hunting rates and prey offtake rates have also declined markedly; whether this will allow the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> population to recover is unknown. In contrast, rates at which chimpanzees encountered redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius) and grey‐cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) did not decrease.
