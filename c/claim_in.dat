5|$|Author Michael Occleshaw {{made the}} <b>claim</b> <b>in</b> his 1995 book The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor that Tatiana {{might have been}} rescued and transported to England, where she married a British officer and lived under the name Larissa Tudor. Occleshaw based this claim on {{studying}} the diaries of the British agent Richard Meinertzhagen, who hinted at the successful liberation of a Grand Duchess, allegedly Tatiana. However, historians discount this claim. Survival stories persist because two bodies were missing from the mass grave found in the forest outside Yekaterinburg and exhumed in 1991. Those bodies were identified as Tsarevich Alexei {{and one of the}} four grand duchesses, generally thought by Russians to be Grand Duchess Maria and by Americans to be Grand Duchess Anastasia.

5|$|For {{there to}} be a <b>claim</b> <b>in</b> private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of MacGregor's childhood. After his father's death in 1794, {{he and his}} two sisters were raised primarily by his mother {{with the help of}} various relatives. MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor would <b>claim</b> <b>in</b> later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as he did not take a degree, but Sinclair considers it plausible, citing MacGregor's apparent sophistication and his mother's connections in Edinburgh.|$|E
