25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat metal pan called a <b>coolship</b> {{where it is}} left exposed to the open air so microorganisms may inoculate the wort. While this cooling method of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} lambic beer, the most significant being Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coolship</b> (Anglicized {{version of}} the Dutch/Flemish koelschip) {{is a type of}} {{fermentation}} vessel used in the production of beer. Traditionally, a <b>coolship</b> is a broad, open-top, flat vessel in which wort cools. The high surface to mass ratio allows for more efficient cooling. Contemporary usage includes any open fermentor used in the production of beer, even when using modern mechanical cooling techniques. Traditionally, coolships were constructed of wood, but later were lined with iron or copper for better thermal conductivity.|$|E
50|$|Brouwerij 't Koelschip (The <b>Coolship,</b> after a {{traditional}} piece of brewing equipment used {{to cool the}} wort after boiling), full name Ambachtelijke Bierbrouwerij en Distilleerderij 'T KOELSCHIP, is a Dutch Brewer, based in Almere, which made a 60% abv beer called Start the Future.|$|E
50|$|While Anchor Brewing Company is {{the oldest}} continually-operated brewery in the United States to employ open fermentation, <b>coolships</b> in the {{traditional}} sense were first used in the United States by Allagash Brewing Company. Several craft breweries have followed, including Logsdon Organic Farmhouse Ales, Gunbarrel Brewing Company, LIC Beer Project, Funk Factory Geuzeria, Black Project Spontaneous & Wild Ales, Jester King, De Garde, Beachwood Blendery, Blue Jacket, Crooked Stave, Russian River Brewing Company, Oxbow, New Glarus, Transient Artisan Ales, Side Project, Anchorage Brewing Company, Block 15, Reaver Beach Brewing, OEC Brewing, Wicked Weed, Plan Bee Farm Brewery, Peekskill Brewery, Pen Druid Brewing, Burley Oak Brewing Company and Wander Brewing.|$|R
50|$|All of the beers Allagash {{produces}} are bottle conditioned. The technique {{calls for}} two fermentations, {{the first in}} the fermenting tanks and the second in the bottle itself (a process known as the methode champenoise). A <b>coolship</b> is used to cool the wort for some of the beers.|$|E
5000|$|... de Garde Brewing is a brewery {{based in}} Tillamook, Oregon. de Garde {{is one of}} very few breweries in the United States to use all {{spontaneous}} fermentation, in which beer in a <b>coolship</b> takes in wild yeasts from the air; the beer is then aged, sometimes with fruit added, in foeders. In 2016, they won the fifth best brewery in the world award from RateBeer, and were named the best brewer in Oregon.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the 20 barrel brewpub (capable of about 3000 barrels per year), Russian River also has a 50 barrel production brewery, originally from Dogfish Head Brewery. In late 2014, the production facility is being updated with a four vessel, 50 barrel brewhouse made by AAA Metal Fabrication in Beaverton, Ore. Russian River has distributors in California, Colorado, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. A <b>coolship</b> is used to cool the wort {{for some of the}} beers. Barrels of beer are stored in their barrel warehouse and begin tasting after 9 months, though can be aged up to two years before blending.|$|E
5000|$|At one time, all beers were sour to some degree. As pure yeast {{cultures}} {{were not}} available, the starter used from one batch to another usually contained some wild yeast and bacteria. Unlike modern brewing, which {{is done in}} a sterile environment to guard against the intrusion of wild yeast, sour beers are made by intentionally allowing wild yeast strains or bacteria into the brew. Traditionally, Belgian brewers allowed wild yeast to enter the brew naturally through the barrels or during the cooling of the wort in a <b>coolship</b> open to the outside air [...] - an unpredictable process that many modern brewers avoid.|$|E

40|$|American <b>coolship</b> ale (ACA) {{is a type}} of spontaneously {{fermented}} beer {{that employs}} production methods similar to traditional Belgian lambic. In spite of its growing popularity in the American craft-brewing sector, the fermentation microbiology of ACA has not been previously described, and thus the interface between production methodology and microbial community structure is unexplored. Using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP), barcoded amplicon sequencing (BAS), quantitative PCR (qPCR) and culture-dependent analysis, ACA fermentations were shown to follow a consistent fermentation progression, initially dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and a range of oxidative yeasts in the first month, then ceding to Saccharomyces spp. and Lactobacillales for the following year. After one year of fermentation, Brettanomyces bruxellensis was the dominant yeast population (occasionally accompanied by minor populations of Candida spp., Pichia spp., and other yeasts) and Lactobacillales remained dominant, though various aerobic bacteria became more prevalent. This work demonstrates that ACA exhibits a conserved core microbial succession in absence of inoculation, supporting the role of a resident brewhouse microbiota. These findings establish this core microbia...|$|E
