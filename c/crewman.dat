5|$|Sabotage by {{a disgruntled}} <b>crewman.</b> While no {{individual}} was {{named in the}} commission's final report, its conclusion was {{that the cause of}} the explosion was most likely a <b>crewman</b> in No. 3 turret who had recently been accused of theft and was believed to be suicidal.|$|E

40|$|This {{survey was}} {{conducted}} with <b>crewmen</b> on large purse seines {{in order to increase}} satisfaction of <b>crewmen.</b> The degree of fulfillment of internal marketing on <b>crewmen</b> (internal communication, empowerment, welfare benefits, management support, and reward system), satisfaction of <b>crewmen,</b> turnover intention, recommendation intention and need for achievement were examined. 200 surveys were distributed and 150 surveys were returned, among which insincere responses were excluded to analyze 146 responses. The results are as follows. First, factors of internal marketing that influence satisfaction of <b>crewmen</b> include empowerment, welfare benefits, and reward system. Second, turnover intention was reduced and recommendation intention was increased with increasing satisfaction of <b>crewmen.</b> Third, while need for achievement moderated the relationship between satisfaction of <b>crewmen</b> and turnover intention, it did not moderate the relationship between satisfaction of <b>crewmen</b> and recommendation intention. In other words, stronger need of <b>crewmen</b> for achievement causes greater negative(－) effect of crewmen’s satisfaction o...|$|R
50|$|When the {{surviving}} <b>crewmen</b> {{were about to}} draw another lot for cannibalism, they were spotted by the American vessel Agenoria. The <b>crewmen</b> were waving hands and feet of cannibalized victims to express their plight. After being stranded for 20 days, 11 <b>crewmen</b> survived out of 18 <b>crewmen.</b> Three died due to the snow storm, and four were cannibalized. Aboard the Agenoria, the saved survivors were so emaciated and malnourished that they couldn't feed themselves without help.|$|R
50|$|In total, 122 {{people were}} killed: 59 B-37 <b>crewmen,</b> 19 S-350 <b>crewmen,</b> and 44 others. The {{explosion}} hurled B-37s anchor nearly 2 km from the dock.|$|R
5|$|Martin Klebba as Marty: Jack's dwarf <b>crewman</b> {{who also}} joins {{the quest to}} bring back Sparrow.|$|E
5|$|Michael Wincott as Scroop, {{a vicious}} spider-/crab-like <b>crewman</b> on the RLS Legacy.|$|E
5|$|On August 19, 1953, a burned <b>crewman</b> {{talks to}} three {{government}} agents about his {{experience on the}} submarine Zeus Faber, completing the story told in the previous episode. He explains that he and other crew members were locked in with their captain, who was infected by the black oil. After being knocked out from behind, the black oil leaves the captain's body and exits via a grate into the sea. It is revealed that Bill Mulder and the Smoking Man {{are two of the}} agents who are interviewing the <b>crewman.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 22 August 1944, U-965 {{came under}} attack by two RAF Martlets, either in, or close to, Hammerfest. Eight <b>crewmen</b> were wounded with three <b>crewmen</b> killed.|$|R
25|$|Nimble {{had lost}} its rudder, {{and had to be}} {{lightened}} and towed off the reef. The swivel gun was transferred to one of the wreckers and cannonballs and ballast thrown overboard. The <b>crewmen</b> and surviving Africans on Guerrero were loaded onto several of the wreckers. Florida took 20 of the Spanish <b>crewmen</b> and 142 Africans aboard and immediately departed for Key West. Before reaching there, however, the Spanish <b>crewmen</b> from Guerrero hijacked Florida and sailed it and the 142 Africans to Cuba. Thorn took 54 of the Spanish <b>crewmen</b> and 246 Africans, including all of the women. Thorn had not left by late afternoon, and Lt. Bolton requested that it anchor close to Nimble overnight so that the warship could help protect the wrecker from the Spanish <b>crewmen</b> on it. Even so, the Spanish <b>crewmen</b> hijacked Thorn from under the guns of Nimble and took it and the 246 Africans aboard to Cuba.|$|R
2500|$|On 10 January 1963 a USN P2V-7 (BUNO 135559) of VP-17 crashed near NAS Kodiak, Alaska, {{while trying}} to land in bad weather. 7 <b>crewmen</b> were killed and 5 <b>crewmen</b> survived.|$|R
5|$|Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, Radar Countermeasures, Baltimore, Maryland (Beser flew on both atomic missions, {{serving as}} the radar {{countermeasures}} <b>crewman</b> on the Enola Gay on 6 August 1945 and on Bockscar on 9 August 1945).|$|E
5|$|Before {{discovering}} that the incident had {{been caused by}} the accidental launch of two torpedoes by a drunken German <b>crewman</b> on the E-boat S-13, the German authorities in Bergen launched a search for saboteurs in the city. Kommandøren was the only total loss suffered by Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane (the formerly named Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe) during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1876, Yangwu visited the Australian colonies, {{and later in the}} year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain, Kwoh Song Tao and Liu-Si-hung, visited Yangwu via mail steamer in December while she was in Singapore. Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. When she arrived in February 1877, an {{accident}} occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the <b>crewman</b> loaded the charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The <b>crewman</b> was subsequently buried in the city. Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city, particularly the Chinese, some of whom had sailed out to greet her arrival in small boats and others who watched her from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay.|$|E
50|$|From 19 October 1965 to 13 June 1966. On 2 December F-4B BuNo 152220 {{was lost}} over North Vietnam, both <b>crewmen</b> CDR C Austin and LTJG J Logan {{were killed in}} action, body not recovered. On 31 January F-4B BuNo 152233 was hit by antiaircraft fire over Laos, both <b>crewmen</b> ejected {{successfully}} and were rescued. On 5 March F-4B #152224 was hit by target debris over South Vietnam, both <b>crewmen</b> ejected successfully and were rescued. On 26 April F-4B BuNo 152255 was hit by target debris over North Vietnam, both <b>crewmen</b> ejected successfully and were rescued.|$|R
50|$|Fourteen {{critically}} injured {{people were}} taken by helicopter from Bahama Star to Nassau hospitals. Bahama Star rescued 240 passengers and 133 <b>crewmen.</b> Finnpulp rescued 51 passengers and 41 <b>crewmen.</b> Both ships arrived in Nassau on November 13.|$|R
50|$|From 18 November 1967 to 28 June 1968. On 27 December F-4B BuNo 153005 {{was lost}} over North Vietnam, both <b>crewmen</b> LCDR L Lee and LTJG R Innes were killed, their remains were {{identified}} in July 1997. On 15 April F-4Bs BuNo 153002 and BuNo 153043 were lost in a mid-ar collision, all <b>crewmen</b> ejected successfully and were rescued. On 20 April F-4B BuNo 153003 was lost, both <b>crewmen</b> ejected successfully and were rescued.|$|R
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet crew on the Federation {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In the episode, {{the crew of the}} Enterprise investigates the murder of a <b>crewman</b> on a terraforming colony and discover a crystalline life form possessing intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} explosion, Thompson was {{informed}} by an Iowa <b>crewman</b> that the Navy was conducting a dishonest {{investigation into the}} cause of the tragedy. Thompson, a producer for the television newsmagazine 60 Minutes, later produced several television reports which disputed the Navy's conclusions as to what had caused the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The AJ-2 {{incorporated}} all of {{the changes}} made to the late model AJ-2P and 55 aircraft were ordered on 14 February 1951. The AJ-2 deleted the separate compartment for the third <b>crewman,</b> but retained the third seat in the cockpit from the AJ-2P.|$|E
40|$|Only general {{conclusions}} can {{be reached}} {{of the effect of}} Skylab simulation chamber noise on the <b>crewmen.</b> Two <b>crewmen</b> experienced a small hearing decrement in-chamber, but there was no pattern as to the ear and frequency affected. Temporary hearing threshold shifts were observed in all three <b>crewmen</b> postchamber. These postchamber threshold shifts were perhaps the most significant finding of the study. However, no lasting detrimental effects on the crew's hearing were found...|$|R
25|$|As it did so, Topp {{directed}} his <b>crewmen</b> to continue firing, striking the Atwaters <b>crewmen</b> {{as they tried}} to man the lifeboats. When Captain Webster was hit, the crew abandoned attempts to launch the lifeboats and leapt into the sea.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} deployed on the USS Enterprise {{again from}} 3 January 1968 to 18 July 1968. On 7 May 1968 F-4B #151485 {{was hit by}} an SA-2. Both <b>crewmen</b> ejected successfully over water and were rescued. On 2 June 1968 F-4B #150453 suffered mechanical failure while on a barrier combat air patrol. Both <b>crewmen</b> ejected successfully and were rescued. On 7 June 1968 F-4B #150994 suffered mechanical failure on launch. Both <b>crewmen</b> ejected successfully and were rescued.|$|R
5|$|U-47 {{carried out}} ten combat patrols {{and spent a}} total of 238 days at sea. She sank 31 enemy ships (totalling 164,953 tons) and damaged eight more. Prior to her {{disappearance}} in March 1941, U-47 lost one <b>crewman,</b> Heinrich Mantyk, who fell overboard on 5 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was of a lack of seamanship by the captain and watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the death of the only <b>crewman</b> whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned blame on the captain and PWO.|$|E
5|$|Many years later, in September 2002, {{one of the}} unexploded torpedoes that U-47 {{had fired}} during the attack on Royal Oak rose to the surface from its resting place on the bottom. The unexploded torpedo, minus its warhead, {{gradually}} drifted towards the shore, where it was spotted by a <b>crewman</b> aboard the Norwegian tanker Petrotrym. A Royal Navy tugboat intercepted the torpedo, and after identifying it as having belonged to U-47 63 years earlier, EOD (explosive ordnance disposal) personnel discarded it a mile from shore.|$|E
50|$|Only {{with some}} rain water and bottles of wine, the <b>crewmen</b> endured severe cold, {{dehydration}} and hunger until December 18, when the captain suggested they sacrifice {{one of the}} four young <b>crewmen</b> to survive. The captain justified exclusion of other older <b>crewmen</b> {{to the fact that they}} had families depending on them. The four boys cast lots and Patrick O'Brien, a fifteen year old cabin boy, drew the death lot. Captain ordered the cook to kill Patrick O'Brien, who at first refused but was later forced to do so by the captain. However, the cook failed in killing Patrick O'Brien. Patrick O'Brien himself attempted to kill himself by cutting his wrist, but his attempt also failed. In the end, the captain resorted to cutting Patrick O'Brien's throat, at which point Patrick O'Brien resisted but was killed. The surviving <b>crewmen</b> cannibalized on Patrick O'Brien on in the course of three days until the 20th, when one adult <b>crewmen,</b> Michael Behane, and another cabin boy, George Burns became deranged from dehydration and hunger. They were also cannibalized, in addition to another <b>crewmen</b> who died on the same day.|$|R
50|$|In this 22-minute video, a cruel ship captain (Smit) {{keeps his}} <b>crewmen</b> in thrall with his golden voice {{until they are}} finally able to {{overcome}} him. The <b>crewmen</b> are played by sculptor Tony Matelli and performance artist (and artistic influence) Michael Smith.|$|R
50|$|On 7 February 1980, Cape Horn rescued six <b>crewmen</b> {{from the}} Gloucester, Massachusetts based fishing vessel Hattie Rose which was taking on water in 25-foot seas and 45-knot winds 15 nmi km east of Provincetown. During the rescue, two of trawler crew fell {{overboard}} and two <b>crewmen</b> from Cape Horn {{jumped in the}} 35-degree water and attached a line to the <b>crewmen</b> and all four were pulled from the water. Cape Horn earned a Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for this rescue.|$|R
5|$|On 6 and 7 May 1945, Navy divers {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} wreck to recover the captain's safe and the papers within, but failed. Recreational divers first visited the site in 1953. In 1960 a recreational diver brought up a body from the wreck. This provoked former navy admirals and clergy to petition the US government for restrictions on disturbing the dead. The German <b>crewman</b> was buried with full military honors in Newport, Rhode Island. At least two recreational divers have died from exploring the wreckage.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, while the ship is visiting the planet Ligon II to retrieve a vaccine, <b>crewman</b> Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) is abducted by the leader of the Ligonians. The race abide by a strict code of honor, and their leader seeks to use Yar as a pawn to increase his own personal power.|$|E
5|$|The Martin AM Mauler (originally XBTM) was a single-seat {{shipboard}} attack aircraft {{built for}} the United States Navy. Designed during World War II, the Mauler encountered development delays and did not enter service until 1948 in small numbers. The aircraft proved troublesome and remained in frontline service only until 1950, when the Navy switched to the smaller and simpler Douglas AD Skyraider. Maulers remained in reserve squadrons until 1953. A few were built as AM-1Q electronic-warfare aircraft with an additional <b>crewman</b> in the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|After {{arriving}} at Plymouth, England, the <b>crewmen</b> of the NC-4, {{who had been}} reunited with the <b>crewmen</b> of the less-successful NC-1 and NC-3, went by train to London, and there they received a tumultuous welcome. Next, they visited Paris, France, to be lionized again.|$|R
50|$|At launch, {{during and}} shortly after the war, the crews {{consisted}} of around 60 officers and about 1000 rank and file <b>crewmen.</b> When an admiral's staff was aboard during wartime, this number could swell to 80 officers and 1500 <b>crewmen.</b> On the Bostons, the standard crew, even in peacetime and without an admiral's staff, was 80 officers and around 1650 <b>crewmen.</b> Because the Albany class was equipped almost exclusively for guided-missiles, it required fewer crew than the Bostons, and was roughly comparable numerically to the basic Baltimore.|$|R
50|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, rough seas from Danielle {{caused a}} {{maintenance}} barge to capsize, washing all 11 <b>crewmen</b> overboard. A fatality occurred {{when one of}} the <b>crewmen</b> drowned, though the other ten were rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Additionally, the storm also caused a United States Coast Guard helicopter to crash into the sea due to high winds and lack of fuel, though all twelve <b>crewmen</b> survived. Offshore, a barge encountered winds of 58 mph with gusts up to 92 mph and light rainfall.|$|R
