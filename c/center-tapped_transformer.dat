Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.|$|E

The [...] "side circuits" [...] within phantom circuits can be coupled to their respective voltage drops by <b>center-tapped</b> <b>transformers,</b> usually called [...] "repeating coils". The center taps are on the line side of the side circuits. Current from the phantom circuit is split evenly by the center taps. This cancels crosstalk from the phantom circuit to the side circuits.

50|$|In early {{vacuum tube}} audio amplifiers, <b>center-tapped</b> <b>transformers</b> were {{sometimes}} {{used as the}} phase inverter to drive the two output tubes of a push-pull stage. The technique is nearly as old as electronic amplification and is well documented, for example, in The Radiotron Designer's Handbook, Third Edition of 1940. This technique was carried over into transistor designs also, {{part of the reason}} for which was that capacitors were large, expensive and unreliable. However, since that era, capacitors have become vastly smaller, cheaper and more reliable, whereas transformers are still relatively expensive. Furthermore, as designers acquired more experience with transistors, they stopped trying to treat them like tubes. Coupling a class A intermediate amplification stage to a class AB power stage using a transformer doesn't make sense anymore even in small systems powered from a single-voltage supply. Modern higher-end equipment is based on dual-supply designs which eliminates coupling. It is possible for an amplifier, from the input all the way to the loudspeaker, to be DC coupled without any capacitance or inductance.|$|R

5000|$|A {{push-pull}} amplifier {{is more efficient}} than a single-ended [...] "class-A" [...] amplifier. The output power {{that can be achieved}} is higher than the continuous dissipation rating of either transistor or tube used alone and increases the power available for a given supply voltage. Symmetrical construction of {{the two sides of the}} amplifier means that even-order harmonics are cancelled, which can reduce distortion. DC current is cancelled in the output, allowing a smaller output transformer to be used than in a single-ended amplifier. However, the {{push-pull amplifier}} requires a phase-splitting component that adds complexity and cost to the system; use of <b>center-tapped</b> <b>transformers</b> for input and output is a common technique but adds weight and restricts performance. If the two parts of the amplifier do not have identical characteristics, distortion can be introduced as the two halves of the input waveform are amplified unequally. Crossover distortion can be created near the zero point of each cycle as one device is cut off and the other device enters its active region.|$|R

50|$|Historically {{producing}} full-wave DC with a <b>center-tapped</b> <b>transformer</b> and two rectifiers was {{preferred to}} the full bridge rectifier when rectifier costs were higher than the extra cost of copper windings and iron laminations (a centre tap only uses half of the secondary coil per half-cycle.)

5000|$|There is some {{confusion}} in the literature between square-wave-output, classic Royer circuits and variants that output sine (or near-sine) waves. The latter variants (sometimes termed [...] "resonant Royer") additionally employ a capacitor in parallel with the (<b>center-tapped)</b> <b>transformer</b> primary, which together form a (resonant) LC tank; such a circuit was used for example in driving the CRT of the Tektronix 547 oscilloscope. A circuit employing a similar idea appears in a 1973 patent assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories and even in a 1959 conference paper by P.J. Baxandall. A more contemporary application of the resonant Royer is in powering CCFLs.
