40|$|The foaming {{behavior}} of SiC-particulate (SiCp) aluminum composite powder compacts containing titanium hydride blowing agent was investigated by heating to 750 °C in a pre-heated furnace. Aluminum powder compacts were also prepared and foamed using similar compaction and foaming parameters {{in order to}} determine the effect of SiCp-addition on the foaming and compression behavior. The SiCp-addition (10 wt%) was found to increase the linear expansion of the Al powder compacts presumably by increasing the surface as well as the bulk viscosities. The compression tests conducted on Al and 10 and 20 % SiCp foams further showed a more brittle compression {{behavior of}} SiCp/Al foams as compared with Al foams.

40|$|Aluminium foams are a {{new group}} of {{materials}} used for impact energy absorbing elements. They are light (typically 10 - 25 % of the density of the metal they are made of) and stiff, and are frequently proposed as a lightweight structural material.

5000|$|... "Anti-fatigue mats" [...] are {{designed}} to help a person who is working in a standing position for prolonged periods of time. Most anti-fatigue matting is a combination of an ergonomic pattern and a cushioning underlay. The cushioning causes constant subconscious balance checks and micro movements that stimulate blood flow through the legs and lower extremities. This results in better circulation and less fatigue. The cushioning underlay insulates the feet from the hard surface, cold floors, vibrations, moisture and sound. Their unique design encourages the user to make continual micro-movements which provides a wealth of health benefits, such as minimizing back pain, foot pain, weariness, stress, etc. Anti-fatigue mats are one of the approaches to prevent injuries, caused by working in a standing position. This type of mat is recommended by Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The range of common materials for manufacturing anti-fatigue mats includes vinyl, wood, PVC tubing, rubber, PVC <b>closed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>foam,</b> polypropylene, nitrile rubber. Anti-fatigue mats were initially used in factories and production lines where staff has to stand for the majority of their working shifts.|$|E

In 1980 his son, Bob McDavid, officially co-founded the company McDavid Inc. to sell his braces and other sports equipment, alongside Terence Fee (currently vice-president of operations.) The company was founded in Bellwood, Illinois and run out of the co-founder’s basement. Bob McDavid remains the CEO of the company. McDavid first produced prophylactic braces for joints including the ankle, knee, upper extremities, neck, and eventually most other at risk areas of the body. By the mid-1980s McDavid had revenues of about $1 million, selling knee and ankle braces mainly to athletes from the high school to professional level. It {{was one of the first}} companies to produce single-hinge braces as opposed to those with a double-hinge sold by McDavid competitors. In addition to braces, McDavid also produces a line of sports clothing, pads, and sports equipment sold in three lines: SportMed (composed of braces, sleeves, wraps, guards, and straps), Sports Protection (for pads, supports, and other cushioning products), and Performance Apparel (its sports clothing and equipment line). Hex technology items, where <b>closed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>foam</b> padding is sewn directly into the fabric of sports clothing to protect at-risk parts of the body.
