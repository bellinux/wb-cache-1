He worked on the pram dinghy Nancy Endurance; made a small <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> for Shackleton; {{specimen}} shelves for the biologist, Robert Clark; instrument cases for Leonard Hussey, the meteorologist; and put up wind screens to protect the helmsman. He constructed a false deck, extending from the poop-deck to the chart-room to cover the extra coal that the ship had taken on board. He also acted as the ship's barber. As the ship pushed into the pack ice in the Weddell Sea it became increasingly difficult to navigate. McNish constructed a six-foot wooden semaphore on the bridge to enable the navigating officer to give the helmsman directions, and built a small stage over the stern to allow the propeller to be watched in order to keep it clear of the heavy ice.|$|E

25|$|The Meigs family {{returned}} to Washington, D.C., on November 3, 1852, after Montgomery Meigs {{was assigned to}} design and finish the Washington Aqueduct (a public works project which brought large amounts of fresh water to Washington, D.C., for the first time). His parents finally enrolled him in school (public or private is not clear). But his discipline problems continued. After one particularly violent temper tantrum, his father tied John's wrists together, tied him to a <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers,</b> and left him there all afternoon without allowing him to eat lunch. When Meigs learned that his son had untied himself, he spanked him with the rope.|$|E

25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a {{professor}} of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 334 Polaroid {{pictures}} and 34 snapshot prints of various male individuals {{were also found}} stowed in various locations within Berdella's house; these images depicted Christopher Bryson and several other individuals both in life and in death, {{and many of the}} images had been taken as the subjects had been tortured. The search also uncovered numerous restraining and sexual devices; pornographic literature; hypodermic needles; and a book devoted to the creation and remedies of narcotics. Atop a <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> in one bedroom, officers discovered a stenographer's pad containing the detailed torture logs he had taken of each victim, several newspaper clippings from The Kansas City Star regarding a missing young man named Jerry Howell, and both a wallet and a driving license belonging to a missing person named Walter James Ferris was discovered in a closet {{on the second floor of}} the property.|$|E
25|$|Quarto da Rainha (Queen's Bedroom), was {{decorated}} in the Napoleonic-style of 1861, which was popular in Europe at the time, and includes walls in blue silk {{with a silver}} pattern, surmounted by a ceiling painted with allegorical depictions of Fé, Esperança and Caridade, {{as well as a}} figure of John the Baptist. The room is decorated in religious iconography, ornate wood furniture and highlighted by a large canopy bed (also in blue, gold and silver colors), while the floor is covered in carpet, with a polar bear hide. Alongside is thetoucador (changing room and toilette), and also continues the original carpeted space from the Queen's bedroom, with large three-pane standing mirror, fireplace, <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> and commode. It is decorated in rich brown and gold trim, phytomorphic elements and paintings of the figures of Diana, Juno, Venus and Minerva over the doorways. The actual bathroom, more practical then decorative, nonetheless, includes decorated with painted mouldings and rich wood trim, and includes bathtub, double lavatory, double sink and bide, hygienic innovations that came from England around 1880.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to other popular comedies {{of the era}} (such as Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet), which depicted their characters in comfortable, middle class suburban environments, the set design for The Honeymooners reflected the blue collar existence of its characters. The Kramdens lived in a small, painfully sparsely furnished two-room apartment (the main set) in a tenement building at least four stories high (the Kramdens were {{on the third floor}} and the Nortons' were one floor above them), badly aired and with insufficient lighting. They used the single main room as the kitchen, dining and living room. It consisted of a functional table and chairs, a plain <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers,</b> a curtainless window with a view of a fire escape, a noisy sink, and an outdated icebox. The Kramdens' bedroom never was seen, although in the episode about Ed Norton's sleepwalking the Nortons' bedroom is. One of the few other sitcoms about a blue collar family was The Life of Riley, whose first season (1949–50) had featured Jackie Gleason in the lead role, although veteran movie actor William Bendix, who had originated the role of Chester A. Riley on the radio show, thereafter took over the role on television.|$|E
500|$|Exhibits in {{the museum}} include Hung era and Neolothic mortuaries, Bronze Age {{implements}} such as axe heads, and Cham period artifacts. There is an intimidating sculpture of Quan Am, the Goddess of Mercy, which has 1,000 eyes and arms. Also on display are the 13 Nguyễn dynasty emperor's ornamented throne, dresses and other antiquities. These include the large Dong Son drums, which are symbolic of Vietnamese culture. At ground level the display consist of stone implements, pottery, and ornaments, up to 1400 AD. On the first floor the exhibits pertain to the monarchic reign {{from the time of}} the Dinh and Le eras of 900 ADs to Vietnam's last emperors; these are decorative items such as a <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> inlaid with mother-of-pearl, cylindrical containers of enamel (these are funerary jars), ceramics and bright lacquer ware. There is a stele which was found during an archaeological excavation with an inscription at a monument labeled G1, which is dedicated to God Harivamsesvara by Harivarman I (ca. 1137) is preserved {{in the museum}}. The exhibits of new artifacts cover Central Vietnam, Central Highlands, South Vietnam and also an old shipwreck near [...] Cu Lao Cham Island. The museum has signage in English, but this is inadequate to express all that is on display in the museum.|$|E
500|$|Norway's {{prohibition}} from 1916 onwards {{opened up}} possibilities for a lucrative criminal career, and Andersen joined up in 1921 with old friends {{from his days}} at Toftes gave in grand-scale smuggling operations. Using ingenious methods for hiding the spirits, they smuggled alcohol into Norway by sea. In his smuggling years Andersen cooperated with future award-winning author Arthur Omre, serving as both crew and skipper on Omre's boats before getting his own smuggling vessel. Eventually his cover was blown, and being a wanted man in Norway he had to flee to Germany. While in Germany he worked {{for one of the}} biggest suppliers of spirits for the illegal Norwegian market. In 1925 Norway requested that Germany extradite him, and he was arrested in the harbour of Hamburg. Prison life was harsh, but Andersen managed to get transferred to a hospital when faking syphilis by burning his member with a cigarette. He was then deported under police escort back to Norway on the steamship Kong Dag, but when the ship entered the Oslofjord, Andersen escaped by jumping overboard near Spro. For several months he was on the run before being recaptured. In the years that followed he {{was in and out of}} prison repeatedly. He gained considerable renown for his elegantly executed burglaries, being labelled by the media [...] "gentleman-forbryter i Grünerløkka-utgave" [...] (...) [...] He was also well known for his safe-cracking skills. Andersen once more tried to evade justice when he fled a crowded court room in Drammen in 1929, jumping out a window as the sentence was being proclaimed. He was then smuggled from Drammen inside a <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> which was to be repaired in Oslo. He was recaptured shortly before intending to board a cargo ship bound for Canada.|$|E
50|$|The most {{elaborate}} furniture in this style was made around 1815-25, often incorporating columns with rope-twist carving, animal-paw feet, anthemion, stars, and acanthus-leaf ornamentation, sometimes {{in combination with}} gilding and vert antique (antique green, simulating aged bronze). The Red Room at the White House is {{a fine example of}} American Empire style. A simplified version of American Empire furniture, {{often referred to as the}} Grecian style, generally displayed plainer surfaces in curved forms, highly figured mahogany veneers, and sometimes gilt-stencilled decorations. Many examples of this style survive, exemplified by massive <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> with scroll pillars and glass pulls, work tables with scroll feet and fiddleback chairs. Elements of the style enjoyed a brief revival in the 1890s with, particularly, <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> and vanities or dressing tables, usually executed in oak and oak veneers.|$|R

A large fireplace/stove in white marble occupies one wall in rounded Rococo-style decoration, protected by the fire-guard in gold metal. This was a private room, used by the Queen to conduct official duties or receive visitors, but as well was the room where {{she gave birth to}} the royal heir Prince Carlos.

She befriends the two {{children}} living next door: Tommy and Annika Settergren. The three have many adventures. Tommy and Annika's mother, Mrs. Settergren, often disapproves of Pippi's manners and lack of education, but Mrs. Settergren eventually comes to appreciate that Pippi would never put Tommy and Annika in danger, and that Pippi values her friendship with the pair above almost anything else in her life. Pippi's two main possessions are a suitcase full of gold coins (which she used to buy her horse) and a large <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> containing various small treasures.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> {{often come}} in 5-, 6-, and 7-drawer varieties, {{with either a}} single or a double top drawer. The chest {{illustrated}} at right would {{be described as a}} '5 over 2 chest-on-chest', the latter term deriving from the fact that at one time it would have been made as 2 separable pieces. They are commonly made of wood, similar to many other kinds of furniture, but of course can be made of other materials. The inside <b>of</b> the <b>drawers</b> can be accessed by pulling them out at the front side. It is often placed so that the back side faces a wall since access to the back is not necessary. The lateral sides are also usually made such that they can be placed against a wall or in a corner. Although they can be plain in appearance, <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> can also be made with a fancy or ornamental appearance, including finishes and various external color tones. Traditionally, drawers would slide out on smooth wood rails. Most modern cabinets use roll-out shelf sliders, made of metal, with rollers.|$|R
50|$|A {{roll-out}} shelf, {{also known}} as a glide-out shelf, pull-out shelf or slide-out shelf is a shelf that can be moved forward on slides in order to more easily reach the contents stored {{in the back of a}} cupboard or cabinet.

Cox also wonders why his supplies of coals, matches, candles, tea, sugar, etc., seem to be disappearing. Bouncer suggests it was the cat. When Cox will not accept this explanation, Bouncer launches into another reprise of [...] "Rataplan! Rataplan!" [...] Cox, at last, is late for work and leaves without resolving the mystery.|$|E
2500|$|Joyce Meyer Ministries {{was one of}} six {{investigated}} by the United States Senate inquiry into the tax-exempt status of religious organizations by Senator Chuck Grassley. The inquiry sought to determine if Meyer made any personal profit from financial donations, asking for a detailed accounting {{for such things as}} cosmetic surgery and foreign bank accounts and citing such expenses as the $23,000 commode mentioned earlier. Grassley also requested that Meyer's ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. In her November 29 response to Grassley, Meyer notes that the commode is a <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers.</b> Meyer writes that {{it was part of a}} large lot of items totaling $262,000 that were needed to furnish the ministry's [...] headquarters purchased in 2001. She said the commode's price tag was an [...] "errant value" [...] assigned by the selling agent and apologized for [...] "not paying close attention to specific 'assigned values' placed on the pieces." [...] Joyce Meyer Ministries responded with a newsletter to its e-mail list subscribers on November 9, 2007. The organization referred to its annual financial reports, asserting that, in 2006, the ministry spent 82 percent of its total expenses [...] "for outreach and program services toward reaching people with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as attested by independent accounting firm Stanfield & O'Dell, LLP." [...] The message also quoted an October 10, 2007, letter from the Internal Revenue Service which stated, [...] "We determined that you [...] continue to qualify as an organization exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(c)(3)." [...] The same information was also posted to the ministry website. Joyce Meyer Ministries was one of two ministries to comply with the Senate's requests for financial records.
