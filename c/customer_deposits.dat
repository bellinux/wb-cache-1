25|$|In most countries, {{commercial}} banks’ reserve {{accounts with}} the central bank must have a positive balance {{at the end of}} every day; in some countries, the amount is specifically set as a proportion of the liabilities a bank has (i.e. its <b>customer</b> <b>deposits).</b> This is known as a reserve requirement.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, banks {{or similar}} {{financial}} institutions {{are the primary}} originators of mortgages. For banks that are funded from <b>customer</b> <b>deposits,</b> the <b>customer</b> <b>deposits</b> will typically have much shorter terms than residential mortgages. If a bank were to offer large volumes of mortgages at fixed rates but to derive most of its funding from deposits (or other short-term sources of funds), the bank would have an asset–liability mismatch due to interest rate risk: in this case, it would be running {{the risk that the}} interest income from its mortgage portfolio would be less than it needed to pay its depositors. In the United States, some argue that {{the savings and loan crisis}} was in part caused by this problem, that the savings and loans companies had short-term deposits and long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and were caught when Paul Volcker raised interest rates in the early 1980s. Therefore, banks and other financial institutions offer adjustable rate mortgages because it reduces risk and matches their sources of funding.|$|E

Brian Johnson of Barclays said that <b>customer</b> <b>deposits</b> for the Model S and Model X fell by $50 million, potentially indicating that Tesla's introduction of the Model 3 could be adversely affecting their sales.
