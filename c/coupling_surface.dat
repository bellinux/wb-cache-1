50|$|Advantages of {{electrostatic}} loudspeakers include {{levels of}} distortion {{one to two}} orders of magnitude lower than conventional cone drivers in a box, the extremely light weight of the diaphragm which is driven across its whole surface, and exemplary frequency response (both in amplitude and phase) because the principle of generating force and pressure is almost free from resonances unlike the more common electrodynamic driver. Musical transparency can be better than in electrodynamic speakers because the radiating surface has much less mass than most other drivers and is therefore far less capable of storing energy to be released later. For example, typical dynamic speaker drivers can have moving masses of tens or hundreds of grams whereas an electrostatic membrane only weighs a few milligrams, several times less than the very lightest of electrodynamic tweeters. The concomitant air load, often insignificant in dynamic speakers, is usually tens of grams {{because of the large}} <b>coupling</b> <b>surface,</b> this contributing to damping of resonance buildup by the air itself to a significant, though not complete, degree. Electrostatics can also be executed as full-range designs, lacking the usual crossover filters and enclosures that could color or distort the sound.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coupled</b> <b>surface</b> plasmons in {{one-dimensional}} assemblies {{of metal}} nanoparticles have attracted significant attention because strong interparticle interactions lead to large electromagnetic field enhancements {{that can be}} exploited for localizing and amplifying electromagnetic radiation in nanoscale structures. Ohmic loss (i. e., absorption by the metal), however, limits the performance of any application due to nonradiative surface plasmon relaxation.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{automatically}} constructing the <b>coupling</b> <b>surface</b> along shell edges is developed. By using this new "edge " option together with "shell thickness " {{option in the}} *CONSTRAINED_LAGRANGE_IN_SOLID card, we can accurately model problems involving shell structures with leading edges cutting into ALE materials. Engineering problems include bird striking at propulsion system fan blades; helicopter impacting water. This new feature is implemented in the latest LS-DYNA 971 release 7600 and ready to use with minor input deck modifications. Before, in order to correctly model the FSI, blades had to be meshed by using Lagrange solid elements. This approach can ensure an accurate coupling interface but the time step size is greatly reduced due small element sizes. The lengthy running time for the problem makes this approach impractical. The new "edge " and "thickness " feature will construct a proper <b>coupling</b> <b>surface</b> from shell elements and provide reasonable time step sizes for the simulations. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{prototyping}} {{is widely}} used in industrial design processes, allowing optimization and limiting validation costs through experimental testing. Industrial applications nowadays focus on the simulation of complex component assemblies that are generally mass produced. Coupling properties thus have to be modelled, updated and accounted for variability. For squeal applications, simulations still fail at robustly producing exploitable results due to the systems complexity, while experimentations are limited for diagnostic and design improvement. This paper presents a new application of the Component Mode Tuning, an efficient model reduction method adapted to quick system level reanalysis as function of component free modes, to study the effect of coupling. The impact of component coupling stiffness and <b>coupling</b> <b>surface</b> topology is thus assessed on a drum brake subassembly which design is sensitive to squeal. It is shown that significant system differences can come from <b>coupling</b> <b>surface</b> variations with patterns close to experimental observations.
