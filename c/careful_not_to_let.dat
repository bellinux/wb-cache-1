25|$|White wine can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. Fermentation of the non-colored {{grape pulp}} {{produces}} white wine. The grapes from which white wine is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, {{such as the}} Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling. Other white wines are blended from multiple varieties; Tokay, Sherry, and Sauternes are examples of these. Dark-skinned grapes {{may be used to}} produce white wine if the wine-maker is <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the skin stain the wort during the separation of the pulp-juice. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{the great}} trilogy, Clement's only other extant {{work is the}} {{treatise}} Salvation for the Rich, also known as Who is the Rich Man who is Saved? Having begun with a scathing criticism of the corrupting effects of money and misguided servile attitudes towards the wealthy, Clement discusses the implications of [...] The rich are either unconvinced {{by the promise of}} eternal life, or unaware of the conflict between the possession of material and spiritual wealth, and the good Christian has a duty to guide them towards a better life through the Gospel. Jesus' words are not to be taken literally — we should seek the supercelestial [...] meaning in which the true route to salvation is revealed. The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, {{as long as it is}} used charitably, but men should be <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> their wealth dominate their spirit. It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich man is to be saved, all he must do is to follow the two commandments, and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of our neighbor.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{over the}} same period, Caragiale {{ridiculed}} several socialist militants, referring {{to one of their}} leaders with the derisive nickname Edgard Spanachidi (itself a derivative of [...] "spinach"). Instead, his loose association with George Panu signified a return to radicalism, and saw him campaigning in favor of universal suffrage and a complete land reform—this clashed with the views he had expressed earlier in life, and Caragiale was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it seem that he had returned to the [...] "Red" [...] liberalism of his youth.|$|E
50|$|Rimgale and Brian go to Swayzak's home {{to confront}} him, but {{interrupt}} a masked man about {{to set the}} place alight. The latter attacks them with a flashlight, but is burned by an electrical socket on his back. Rimgale saves Brian and Swayzak from the house, but is injured in an explosion.

Response times were generally quick {{and did not}} vary much: of the 235 response connections in the dataset, most occurred within 1 (69 %) or 2 (81 %) days of the initial message. Only 15 responses (6 %) occurred {{more than a week}} after the original message and half of those (53 %) were follow-up messages. There was a weak correlation, r(235)[*]=[*] 0.15, p[*]<[*] 0.05, between length of follow-up and number of descendant messages, but this is skewed by long-term follow-up messages that tended to revive rich conversations with new information.|$|R

[...] Wen, the former executive deputy commissioner of the Chongqing police force Public Security for 16 years, was tried and convicted of a litany of crimes and sentenced to death in a sensational headline-grabbing trial. Contrary to the popular perception at the time that the campaign was part of Bo's perceived penchant for self-promotion, China observer Willy Lam suggested that such a large-scale crackdown will have received approval from central authorities, including Hu Jintao, and that Bo became <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> Chongqing appear <b>to</b> be trying to 'set an example' for the rest of the country so he could benefit from the success politically.|$|R

2500|$|Martin {{was born}} Alfred Manuel Pesano Jr. to Alfred Manuel Pesano Sr. and Joan Salvini [...] "Jenny" [...] Pesano in Berkeley, California. He was of Portuguese and Italian descent, {{as his father}} was a native of the Azores and his mother was born to a large Italian family in California. [...] Alfred Sr. {{abandoned}} the family eight months later; for this reason, Jenny always referred to Alfred, her second husband, as the [...] "jackass." [...] (She had been married before to a native Italian named Donato Pisani, whom her family arranged her to marry, and later married a singer named Jack Downey and took his name; the marriage lasted until Jack's death many years later.) [...] Eventually, Jenny changed the family name to [...] "Martin." [...] He began being called [...] "Billy" [...] after his grandmother (Joan's mother) started calling him [...] "Bello" [...] (Italian masculine for [...] "beautiful"; Martin said in his autobiography Number One that she would also call him [...] "Bellitz", a dialectical version of the same word). [...] As Martin grew up in West Berkeley his mother took <b>careful</b> notice <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> her son know his actual name, <b>not</b> wanting him <b>to</b> know he shared the same name with Alfred Pesano. [...] In fact, such careful care had been taken to hide Martin's birthname from him that he didn't find out until entering junior high; on his first day in Seventh Grade, while the teacher took attendance, his teacher called on [...] "Alfred Pesano" [...] and young Billy thought she had skipped over him.|$|R

[...] "Now, remember," [...] I said to my wife, [...] "Tom will be a very different being from what he was when he went away. He left us {{as little more than a}} school boy, only in his first year at college; in fact, a mere child. You remember how he used to bore us with baseball talk and that sort of thing. And how shy he was! You recall his awful fear of Professor Razzler, who used to teach him mathematics. All that, of course, will be changed now. Tom will have come back a man. We must ask the old professor to meet him. It will amuse Tom to see him again. Just think of the things he must have seen!

60|$|The {{doctrine}} of the Coleridge school, that the language of any people among whom culture is of old date, is a sacred deposit, the property of all ages, and which no one age should consider itself empowered to alter—borders indeed, as thus expressed, on an extravagance; but it is grounded on a truth, frequently overlooked by that class of logicians who think more of having a clear than of having a comprehensive meaning; and who perceive that every age is adding to the truths which it has received from its predecessors, but fail to see that a counter process of losing truths already possessed, is also constantly going on, and requiring the most sedulous attention to counteract it. Language is the depository of the accumulated body of experience to which all former ages have contributed their part, and which is the inheritance of all yet to come. We {{have no right to}} prevent ourselves from transmitting to posterity a larger portion of this inheritance than we may ourselves have profited by. However much {{we may be able to}} improve on the conclusions of our forefathers, we ought <b>to</b> be <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> inadvertently <b>to</b> <b>let</b> any of their premises slip through our fingers. It may be good to alter the meaning of a word, but it is bad <b>to</b> <b>let</b> any part of the meaning drop. Whoever seeks to introduce a more correct use of a term with which important associations are connected, should be required to possess an accurate acquaintance with the history of the particular word, and of the opinions which in different stages of its progress it served to express. To be qualified to define the name, we must know all that has ever been known of the properties of the class of objects which are, or originally were, denoted by it. For if we give it a meaning according to which any proposition will be false which has ever been generally held to be true, it is incumbent on us to be sure that we know and have considered all which those who believed the proposition understood by it.|$|R
