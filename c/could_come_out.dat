The Los Angeles Superior Court in which the suit was filed did not grant the requested restraining order against Activision on DJ Hero. Activision states that Scratch was already delayed by as early as October 2008, before they made contact with 7 Studios, and their acquisition of the developers did not impede them from completing Scratch. However, on April 20, the court reversed its decision, awarding Genius and Numark a temporary restraining order, and ordered the [...] "immediate return" [...] {{of all of the}} material from 7 Studios from Activision, including all source code related to Scratch. 7 Studios subsequently filed a counter-suit against Genius Products, claiming that they engaged in [...] "unlawful and unsavoury business practices" [...] that limited 7 Studios from completing the game as planned.|$|E

He was able to fight almost any style: he <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> one round brawling, the next counterpunching, and the next fighting on the outside flicking his jab. Robinson would use his formless style to exploit his opponents weaknesses, he also possessed great speed and precision. He fought in a very conventional way with a firm jab, but threw hooks and uppercuts in flurries in an unconventional way. He possessed tremendous versatility—according to boxing analyst Bert Sugar, [...] "Robinson could deliver a knockout blow going backward." [...] Robinson was efficient with both hands, and he displayed a variety of effective punches—according to a TIME magazine article in 1951, [...] "Robinson's repertoire, thrown with equal speed and power by either hand, includes every standard punch from a bolo to a hook—and a few he makes up {{on the spur of}} the moment." [...] Robinson commented that once a fighter has trained to a certain level, their techniques and responses become almost reflexive. [...] "You don't think. It's all instinct. If you stop to think, you're gone." ...|$|E

In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival, setting the scene for similar duets {{over the next two}} years. By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the U.K, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film Dont Look Back. Baez later toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975–76, and sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, [...] Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special Hard Rain, filmed at Fort Collins, Colorado, in May 1976. Baez also starred as 'The Woman In White' in the film Renaldo and Clara (1978), directed by Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue.

He {{said that the}} aliens in the episode were [...] "one note", and overall [...] "Code of Honor" [...] didn't generate any emotional investment. He gave the episode a score of C−, summing it up as [...] "I'm not sure I'd believe a great show <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of TNG after watching 'Code', but I could at least say it had promise without sounding like a complete tool." [...] Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Code of Honor" [...] for Tor.com in May 2011. He thought the episode was riddled with clichés, and says that the episode only seems racist because of the casting even though the script didn't call for it. [...] "If the Ligonians had been played by white people, none of the dialogue would change, and nobody would call it racist", he said {{and gave it a}} score of two out of ten. Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation thought the episode was very slowly paced, and that the fight scene at the end was [...] "clunky and awkward", suggesting that this {{had something to do with}} the opposition of the cast and crew to the episode overall. She thought there were several plot holes, including why sickbay couldn't replicate the vaccine, and that the only redeeming quality of the episode was the beginning of the friendship between Data and La Forge.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame {{just for the sake of}} fame, no matter what— sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how she <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of that [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying: ...|$|E

[...] Perkins revealed that she had had the idea for Heading Out for ten years, before she developed the confidence to write it. She knew that she wanted to write about someone who was stuck and whose friends decided to take drastic action to [...] "save her from her own inertia." [...] The idea slowly began to take shape and developed into the narrative of a woman who struggled to tell her parents that she was gay, until her friends drove her to parent's house on her birthday, so she <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to them.

As a result, Fre. José de Garça who on the death of Bishop Jesus Maria José had been appointed administrator, continued as such until his death on 14 July 1817, when Fre.

During the latter's tenure of his office, Madras was visited by Dom Pedro de Alcântara, O.C., Bishop in partibus of Antipheles, 'Vicar Apostolic of the Grand Mogul' [...] and visitor Apostolic of the French Capuchin missions, who [...] "according to the mind of the Sacred Congregation de Propaganda Fide declared the Capuchins of Madras to be independent of the Bishop of Saint Thomas of Mylapur not alone in temporal but also in spiritual matters".
