Molds may exist in top, horizontal or bottom-up pouring and may be fluted or flat walled. The fluted design increases heat transfer owing to a larger contact area. Molds may be either solid [...] "massive" [...] design, sand cast (e.g. for pig iron) or water-cooled shells, depending upon heat transfer requirements. Ingot molds are tapered to prevent the formation of cracks due to uneven cooling.

A heat of pipe is all forged from the same <b>cast</b> <b>ingot,</b> and therefore had the same chemical composition.

The manufacturer performs these tests and reports the composition in a mill traceability report and the mechanical tests in a material test report, both of which are referred to by the acronym MTR. Material with these associated test reports is called traceable. For critical applications, third party verification of these tests may be required; in this case an independent lab will produce a certified material test report(CMTR), and the material will be called certified.|$|E

Powders were prepared by grinding a chill <b>cast</b> <b>ingot</b> and by high pressure gas atomization. The contrasting solidification rates {{of these two}} processes yielded very different solidification structures. The <b>cast</b> <b>ingot</b> was very inhomogeneous and contained icosahedral ([psi]), cubic ([beta]), monoclinic ([lambda]) and tetragonal ([theta]) phases. The gas atomized powder had a finer scale of phase segregation and consisted primarily of the [psi] and [beta] phase; {{a small fraction of}} the [lambda] phase was present as well;Plasma arc sprayed (PAS) coatings were formed using the above powders. The chemical uniformity of the starting powder was carried over into the PAS coatings. Evaluation of starting powder size during PAS revealed that small powder particles (e. g., 3 ̆c 45 [mu]m) tended to lose Al by vaporization. This mass loss brought the composition of the coating into a two-phase region of the Al-Cu-Fe phase diagram and produced less of the desired [psi] phase;Substitution of 1 at. pct.
