40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of {{a single}} 600 mg oral dose of 1 -cinnamoyl- 2 -methyl- 5 -methoxy- 3 -indolylacetic acid (<b>cinmetacin,</b> Cindomet) was studied in 8 healthy volunteers of both sexes. Plasma levels of the drug were assayed by using an HPLC technique ad hoc devised. Following administration, the Cmax was reached at the 2 nd h in 7 out of 8 subjects with an average value of 18. 19 micrograms/ml; 12 h after the dose (last sampling time) appreciable plasma levels of <b>cinmetacin</b> were measured, corresponding to 17. 2 % of the maximum average concentration. The mean values +/- S. E. concerning the elimination half-life, the total volume of distribution, the total plasma clearance and the total area under the curve were 3. 80 +/- 0. 21 h, 0. 28 +/- 0. 03 l/kg, 0. 051 +/- 0. 005 l/kg/h, and 125. 64 +/- 15. 97 micrograms. h/ml, respectively. The plasma decay of <b>cinmetacin</b> was monophasic and the data were interpreted according to a one-compartment open model. Overall results indicate that <b>cinmetacin</b> is well and rapidly absorbed orally and widely distributed in body fluids...|$|E
