Rather than provide wealth as it had for the Southern elite, in stark contrast, slavery considerably hindered progress of whites who did not own slaves by exerting a <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect,</b> eliminating free labor in the region. This effect, compounded by the area's widespread lack of public education and its general practice of endogamy, prevented low-income and low-wealth free laborers from moving to the middle class.|$|E
50|$|The {{crowding-out}} {{hypothesis is}} the assumption that when a government experiences a deficit, the choice to borrow to offset that deficit draws on the pool of resources available for investment and private investment gets crowded out. This <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> is induced by changes in the interest rate. When the government wishes to borrow, their demand for credit increases and the interest rate, or price of credit, increases. This increase in the interest rate makes private investment more expensive as well and less of it is used.|$|E

The results for the short-run suggest that output growth and public investment were the dominant determinants of private investment, while those for the long-run suggest FDI as an additional dominant determinant. The monetary policy variables were on the other hand less effective determinants. Furthermore, whereas output growth and FDI were implicit crowding-in factors, public investment was an effective crowding-out factor. The other determinants imparted both crowding-in and <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effects.</b> While external indebtedness generated long-run <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effects,</b> there is limited evidence to suggest that it did so in the short-run. ...|$|R

Therefore, a differentiated approach to rise retirement age, allowing high-skilled manpower to retire later than low-skilled manpower, can cause much softer <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> than a cookie-cutter approach to delay retirement.|$|E

40|$|The {{major problem}} studied {{in this paper}} is the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is to {{determine}} whether the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> is occurring in the U. S., or around the world, because of U. S. government budget deficits. If it is, the way fiscal policy is handled in this country will probably need changing. To study the problem, interest rates within and outside the U. S. are examined to see if U. S. budget deficits affect them. The paper also looks at both sides of the issue to get a better understanding of what is happening. Research studied includes both popular press items and journals. This allows conclusions to be more complete for they are based on both public opinion and mathematical models. There is one factor that limits this paper, it is the time period during which the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> has been studied. The <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> has been hypothesized for many years, but the likelihood of its occurrence was not very high until the last decade. Therefore, the amount of research done on the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> has been somewhat limited. Unfortunately, there are no clear-cut answers about the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect.</b> After researching the issue, the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> remains as elusive as ever. The effect needs to be studied further until more definitive answers can be found. In the second part of the paper, other possible effects of deficits are studied. These effects highlight the importance of U. S. deficits as they pertain to both the U. S. and the entire world. Only time and more studies will tell if U.

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests that <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effects</b> of government funding for health happen in low-income countries with a high HIV burden. In a survey, we investigated the hypothesis that domestic funding for TB control has fallen in 11 low-income, high-TB-burden countries {{in the context of}} changes in gross domestic product (GDP), development assistance inflows and national health expenditures. We found that despite rises in GDP per capita between 2003 and 2009, health expenditure as per cent of GDP fell or stayed the same for the majority of these countries. Although TB control budgets increased for all 11 countries in absolute terms, 6 countries reduced government contribution to TB control. For health programmes to become sustainable in the long run, we suggest increases in donor funding for health to be accompanied by requirements to increase domestic funding for health. We thereby attribute responsibility to avoid <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effects</b> to donors and governments alike. Moreover, {{it is the responsibility of}} both to ensure essential items to be funded by government sources to avoid a collapse of programmes once aid is withdrawn...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{examines}} the relationships between {{natural resource}} dependence, public education investment, and human capital accumulation. It addresses why the “blessing” of abundant natural resources often {{turns into a}} “curse” in many countries and regions, focusing on the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> of natural resources on human capital. According to our empirical analysis of provincial panel data from China, natural resource dependence is significantly and negatively correlated with human capital accumulation. The <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> of natural resources on human capital exists only in the central and western regions of China. Our introduction of an interaction term for natural resource dependence and public education investment underscores the possibility of investing in public education to reduce the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> of natural resource dependence on human capital. The government should utilize the income of the natural resource sector to increase investment in education to enhance local human capital.|$|E
30|$|Endogenous growth theory {{emphasizes}} {{the role of}} human capital in long-term economic growth. The <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> of natural resource dependence on human capital inevitably leads to a low economic growth rate {{in the long term}} and a low level of economic development, resulting in the phenomenon of the resource curse. The <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> of natural resource dependence on human capital is among the mechanisms by which the resource curse influences economies, raising questions about how to reduce or even avoid the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> of natural resource dependence on human capital. According to our results, it is necessary to increase public investment in education in regions with higher natural resource dependence. The government should utilize the income of the natural resource sector to increase education investment to enhance the human capital of residents. In particular, measures can be taken from two aspects: demand and supply.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} the {{strategic}} interaction between the labor supply decision of the elderly and private transfers from their children lowers the opportunity cost of leisure of the elderly. This in turn magnifies the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> of public pensions on the labor supply of the elderly. We show that this mechanism has implications for evaluating the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> of public pensions in developing countries. That is, a misspecified econometric model that does not control for the endogeneity of private transfers leads to a biased estimate of the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> of public pensions.

30|$|At {{the same}} time, some countervailing factors {{might affect the}} {{relevance}} of mobile phone service in labor-market intermediation. The {{rise in the number}} of potential matches because of reduced search costs would increase the minimum wage a worker will accept or the minimum productivity an employer will accept (Pissarides 2000, Boone and van Ours 2004). Moreover, the fall in search costs may also lead to a fall in match quality due to an excess of applications of unemployed people who belong to groups with chronic problems of employability (Autor 2001), or the emergence of <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effects</b> from traditional search methods. In the Appendix, we present for illustration purposes a theoretical model with endogenous search effort in both public and private search channels that shows uncertain effects of technology-driven search efficiency improvement on unemployment spells. The uncertainty emerges because patient jobseekers could wait for a better wage offer or because of <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effects</b> in the alternative private search channel. In all, the net effect of integrating mobile phone technologies into labor-market intermediation is an empirical question that depends on the relative strengths of these channels.|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} {{property rights}} approach to nonprofit organization claims that attenuation {{of property rights}} {{in the form of}} nondistribution constraint stimulates managerial shirking in nonprofit firms and thereby makes them less efficient than for-profit firms. This paper argues that this view neglects the important role played by intrinsic motivation in nonprofit organization. Intrinsically motivated stakeholders provide resources to nonprofit firms and thereby facilitate their economic survival. However, intrinsic motivation is subject to the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect,</b> i. e., the danger of being displaced by the use of extrinsic (monetary and administrative) incentives. The property rights structure in nonprofit organization is designed to minimize the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effect</b> by dampening monetary and administrative incentives through nondistribution constraint and self-governance orientation, respectively. This facilitates not only economic survival of nonprofit firms but also maximization of utility of their intrinsically motivated stakeholders.

40|$|Beginning in 2000, Japan’s government-owned {{postal saving}} system {{experienced}} a rapid outflow of funds {{as a large}} number of 10 -year fixed-rate Postal Saving Certificates (PSCs) that had been purchased during the period of high interest rates in the early 1990 s were maturing. This paper exploits this episode as a natural experiment to investigate the <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effects</b> of a government-owned depository institution on local economies. The panel data of 47 prefectures from 1995 to 2004 show that the prefectures where local funds were heavily invested in the postal saving system in the early 1990 s tended to experience a larger shift of funds into private banks from the postal saving system in the early 2000 s, suggesting that the exogenous maturing of PSCs was in part responsible for the observed shifts in the allocation of local funds. More importantly, the (instrumented) flow of local funds to private banks from the postal saving system has statistically robust and economically important positive effects on local output and on the number of small firms, but not on the number of large firms. These results provide empirical support for the view that a government-owned depository institution has <b>crowding-out</b> <b>effects</b> on local economies and, in particular, on small firms that rely on local banks in direct competitio...|$|R
