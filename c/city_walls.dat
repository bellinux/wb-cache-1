5|$|Coventry is {{an ancient}} city and a {{metropolitan}} borough in the West Midlands of England. The city's history dates back to at least the 11thcentury (CE), and by the 14thcentury, it was a thriving centre of commerce. Like several of the other monuments in the city, Coventry's <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> were erected {{towards the end of}} the 14th and the beginning of the 15thcenturies, though <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> served little defensive purpose by that time and were largely a status symbol.|$|E

5000|$|The Yuan Dadu <b>City</b> <b>Wall</b> Ruins Park (...) , {{also known}} as the Tucheng or Earth Wall Park, is an urban park and {{historic}} site in Beijing. The park was created in 2003 to preserve the ruins of the northern <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> of Khanbaliq or Dadu, capital of the Mongol Yuan dynasty. The <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> was constructed in 1267 and finished in 1276. It was abandoned in the Ming dynasty when Beijing was rebuilt and slightly shifted to the south. The northern segment of the <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> is preserved, and a narrow and long park was created around the ruin of the <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> in Haidian District and Chaoyang District.|$|R

5|$|Despite Canterbury's walls, a Viking army {{successfully}} {{attacked the}} city in 835, killing many of the inhabitants. Scandinavian raids recommenced from 991 onwards and in 1011 a Danish army demanded fresh tribute from the city. The <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> were used to defend the city during an 11-day siege, and the chronicler Roger of Hoveden recounts how the attacking Danes were thrown off {{the tops of the}} walls to their deaths by the citizens. Roger's account may be an exaggeration, but the story shows that the <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> were in sufficiently good condition for such a story to be considered plausible at the time. After a fire broke out in the city, however, the Danes entered and pillaged Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Gunpowder weapons {{had begun}} to be {{introduced}} into England in the early 14th century, initially being used as offensive siege weapons but rapidly being adapted for defensive purposes during the 1360s. Although they were expensive, by the 1380s their potential value in defending castles and <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> was well understood and specialised facilities {{had begun to}} be built. Norwich had acquired gunpowder weapons {{and a team of}} gunners by 1355, and by 1385 had fifty gunpowder pieces for use along its <b>city</b> <b>walls.</b> Typically, these would have been small guns called hand cannons, rather than the heavier pieces termed bombards.|$|E

5|$|The city's first {{stone was}} laid by Grand Master Jean de Valette on 28 March 1566, {{and the new}} city was called Valletta in his honour. The <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> {{were among the first}} {{structures}} to be built within the city, and were largely complete by the 1570s. Some changes were made to the design while the city was being constructed, and only two cavaliers were constructed, while the arsenal and Manderaggio were never built. Fort St. Elmo, which had been severely damaged in the 1565 siege, was also rebuilt and integrated in the <b>city</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Beijing <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> was {{a series}} of fortifications built between the early 15th century and 1553.Beijing was China's capital during the last three Chinese {{imperial}} dynasties (the Yuan, Ming, and Qing). It was also secondary capital to two northern dynasties (the Liao and Jin), and is therefore often referred to as an ancient capital of five Dynasties in Chinese history.Beijing <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> is consistently built and resorted from the Yuan Dynasty's capital city Dadu was founded. This wall stood for nearly 530 years until 1965 it was removed to allow construction of the 2nd Ring Road Beijing Subway. Although Liang had already tried every possible efforts to avoid the destruction, only one part of the wall is extant, in the southeast, just south of Beijing Railway Station. In fact,the conservation for the Beijing <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> is a major consideration for them to propose a new center outside the <b>city</b> <b>wall.</b> Liang-Chen had their conservation plans for the valuable Chinese <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> left from the Ming Dynasty of Beijing. Liang-Chen proposed to build a ring park system around the <b>city</b> <b>wall,</b> proclaiming that [...] "this green system is not only a recreation area for the citizens, but also a unique urban space in the world.". The wall would work as a buffer zone for the future urbanization in Beijing, as well as civic park space for leisure and recreation. The green belt around the <b>city</b> <b>wall,</b> the upper wall space, and the lower waterfront space beside the moat, could become a compact system which serves the citizens' urban life. However, this idea was not applied in Beijing but almost fully adopted 30 years later by Xi'an which is another city surrounded by a Ming Dynasty <b>city</b> <b>wall.</b> Starting from 1980s, the Xi'an city municipality initiated a [...] "Wall Ring Park" [...] project for the Xi'an <b>city</b> <b>wall.</b> This idea is also applied in other city where they have <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> as heritage site, such as Nanjing, Xiangyang etc.|$|R

50|$|The park {{is located}} at the {{southeast}} corner of Beijing's inner walled city, about 3 km southeast of Tiananmen Square in what is now Dongcheng District, just inside the Second Ring Road. Preserved in the park is a section of the <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> including the Southeast Corner Tower, that once connected Chongwenmen and Dongbianmen, two city gates that have been replaced with roadway intersections. The longer southern <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> is attached to the Southeast Corner Tower itself while a shorter section of the eastern <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> is separated from the corner tower by a railway out of the Beijing Railway Station. Park space {{at the foot of the}} southern <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> extends along Chongwenmen East Avenue to the Second Ring Road. The Beijing Ancient Observatory, built atop another section of the eastern <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> at Jianguomen, is a short walk north of the corner tower. The Beijing Railway Station and its rail depots occupy the area immediately north of the park.|$|R
5|$|The two armies met near Peritheorion on 7 July 1345. Momchil {{tried to}} seek refuge behind the city's walls— {{scholars}} debate whether he actually held {{the city or}} not— but they were shut against him and his men by the locals. The locals did let in Momchil's cousin Rayko along with 50 men, which they hoped would persuade Momchil not to take vengeance on the city if he defeated his opponents. In the subsequent battle before the <b>city</b> <b>walls,</b> Momchil's forces used the Peritheorion's ruined old fortifications as a first line of defence, with the <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> behind them.|$|E

5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E
5|$|In 1565, the Ottomans {{attacked}} {{again in}} the Great Siege of Malta. Fort Saint Elmo fell after fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general Dragut Reis was killed), but the knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived. By {{the end of the}} siege, most of the fortifications had been destroyed in the attacks, so they were rebuilt. The Grand Master, Jean Parisot de Valette, decided to build a new fortified capital on the Sciberras Peninsula. The first stone of the new city was laid down in 1566, and it was called Valletta. The <b>city</b> <b>walls,</b> which were constructed mainly in the 1560s and 1570s, remain largely intact to this day, and they include bastions, cavaliers, counterguards and a ditch. The ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated into the <b>city</b> <b>walls.</b> The area around St Elmo was strengthened a number of times later on in the 17th century, especially by the building of the Carafa Enceinte in 1687.|$|E

50|$|Stockholm's oldest <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> was {{originally}} a fortification line built {{during the second}} half of the 13th century around Stadsholmen. This line of fortifications is thus intimately connected with the origin of Stockholm, founded by Birger Jarl around the year 1250. The old <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> exact design and location is disputed and unknown. According to one common belief, they are remnants of the oldest <b>city</b> <b>wall</b> preserved in buildings where the wall once was.

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{the area around}} the Old <b>City</b> <b>walls</b> was barren and undeveloped. It was only notable for the {{junction}} of paths that would become Jaffa Road and the highway to Jaffa, with the road to Hebron outside the Jaffa Gate. Among its first structures was the Hospice Saint Vincent de Paul, part of the emerging French Compound. The early building developed {{as an extension of the}} adjacent souk along the <b>city</b> <b>walls</b> at the Jaffa Gate as a quarter for merchants and artisans. It became home for commerce and residences that could not find room within the overcrowded Old City, and several of Jerusalem's prominent modern businesses, like Hotel Fast, were first built here. In 1908, the Ottoman authorities erected a clock tower above Jaffa Gate. The British removed it a decade later.|$|E
