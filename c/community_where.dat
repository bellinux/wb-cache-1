40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} on literature about microsociolinguistics, where you can also see a lack of theoretical congruence, are shown in this paper. The authors classify the works in three groups, depending on the community with which they deal: <b>communities</b> <b>where</b> the main spoken language is Catalan, <b>communities</b> <b>where</b> it is Spanish or <b>communities</b> <b>where</b> Catalan became extinct. From the first two groups, they review phonological and morphological studies. From the third, they suggest the study of language vestiges in <b>communities</b> <b>where</b> Catalan became extinct. Finally, they claim that macro and microsocionlinguistics should be unified and remark the interest of language variation studies for the language planning...|$|R

5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Salter Path, North Carolina {{and along}} the Outer Banks near that <b>community,</b> <b>where</b> (despite being only a Category 1 storm) many buildings suffered significant damage {{as a result of}} the storm surge, which has been described as worse than Hurricane Isabel in 2003 and even compared to Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Nearly all of the significant damage occurred on the sound side, or the side facing the mainland. In addition, several piers and many boats were damaged or destroyed by Ophelia's storm surge. Damage was generally lighter on the mainland, and overall structural damage was relatively light, although there was considerable flooding reported in the Wilmington area. Damage was initially estimated to be about $1.6billion, but in final analysis was dropped to only $70million (2005USD; $77.3million 2008USD). On October7, President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency for ten counties in North Carolina as a result of Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|NY177 {{continues}} winding {{itself to}} the southeast through the town of Rodman, as a rural two-lane highway. After Williams Road, the route makes several bends in {{to the south and}} east, straightening out eastward at an intersection with the northern terminus of CR95. This eastward progression remains stagnant as NY177 continues eastward past CR189. After a short, empty stretch of roadway, NY177 crosses the county line into Lewis County, where it enters the town of Pinckney. Through Pinckney, the route turns to the northeast, crossing Old State Road before bending and turning southeastward into the hamlet of Barnes Corners. In Barnes Corners, the dense forest retreats for a rural <b>community,</b> <b>where</b> NY177 intersects with CR21 and CR2 (Seven-by-Nine Road). CR21 is the former southern terminus of NY194, a designation eliminated in 1980.|$|E

5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural <b>community</b> <b>where</b> they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder.|$|E
