For (1 S) -camphor as substrate {{the association of}} CO is slowed down {{by a factor of}} 2, while the dissociation is accelerated by a factor of 3. The CO complex for the (1 S) -camphor-bound P- 450 is less stabilized (ΔG=− 22 kJ/mol) compared to the natural substrate (1 R) -camphor (ΔG=− 30 kJ/mol). The data are interpreted by a smaller change of the mobility of the (1 S) -camphor due to CO binding as compared to (1 R) -camphor, which would indicate a higher mobility of (1 S) -camphor already in the <b>CO</b> <b>free</b> reduced form of P- 450 cam.

Oxidative stress induces heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) expression. This stress-responsive cytoprotective protein is responsible for heme degradation into carbon monoxide (<b>CO),</b> <b>free</b> iron, and biliverdin. CO is an important intracellular messenger; however, the exact mechanisms responsible for its cytoprotective effect are not yet elucidated. Thus, we investigated whether HO- 1 and CO protect primary hepatocytes against oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis. In vivo, bile duct ligation was used as model of chronic liver disease. In vitro, primary hepatocytes {{were exposed to the}} superoxide anion donor menadione in a normal and in a CO- containing atmosphere. Apoptosis was determined by measuring caspase- 9, - 6, - 3 activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and necrosis was determined by Sytox green staining. The results showed that (1) HO-I is induced in chronic cholestatic liver disease, (2) superoxide anions time- and dose-dependently induce HO- 1 activity, (3) HO- 1 overexpression inhibits superoxide-anions-induced apoptosis, and (4) CO blocks superoxide-anions-induced JNK phosphorylation and caspase- 9, - 6, - 3 activation and abolishes apoptosis but does not increase necrosis. We conclude that HO-I and CO protect primary hepatocytes against superoxide-anions-induced apoptosis partially via inhibition of JNK activity. CO could represent an important candidate for the treatment of liver diseases. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Background and aims: Among {{the unique}} flora on copper and cobalt rich soils, some species {{are able to}} hyperaccumulate the Cu and Co in their shoots, however, the unexplained high {{variations}} of Cu and Co concentrations in shoots have been highlighted. A good comprehension of the Cu and Co accumulation variations would go through a characterization of the Cu and Co speciation in soils. We examined the covariations of Cu and Co speciation in soils and Cu and Co concentrations in plants. Methods: Plant samples of two species and soil samples (n = 146) were collected in seven pedogeochemically contrasted sites. Cu and Co speciation in soils was modeled by WHAM 6. 0. Results: Variation in copper accumulation in plant shoots were mostly influenced by Cu adsorbed by the Mn and Fe oxides fractions, whereas Co accumulation variations were strongly influenced by <b>Co</b> <b>free</b> and Co adsorbed by the OM and Fe fractions. Conclusions: Availability of Cu and Co seems to be species-specific and is not explained only by the free Cu and Co content in the soil solution, but also strongly by the part linked to colloidal fractions. Availability of Cu and Co is a complex mechanism, closely related to all the biogeochemical processes which occur in the rhizosphere. Future work should perform experiments in controlled conditions to examine the soil parameters that influence the Cu and Co availability. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Crystallite size effect is observed for MgO and Fe on MgO/Al 2 O 3. It is observed that larger MgO crystallites size shifts gaseous product selectivity towards CO. Further as crystallite size is becomes higher than ~ 5 nm for Fe for gas product selectivity decreases. Basisity has also a similar behaviour; higher basisity or presence of unidentate carbonate basic sites observed at 865 and 800 cm- 1 FTIR bands for CeO 2 promoted catalysts hinder CO formation and promotes CO 2 formation. This also results in high activity of steam reforming. Also basisity studies shows that inorganic carboxylate catalyst site with FTIR band 1535 and 1410 cm- 1 is dominantly effective for gaseous product selectivity. High total basisity do not required for high glycerol conversion, yet high total basisity results in high gaseous product selectivity. Considering studied catalysts and their catalytic activities it can be concluded that MgO and Fe modified catalysts shows better activity for syngas production due to their basic and crystalline properties.

The free troposphere {{was assumed to}} extend from 3. 58 to 11 km altitude, and the related columns were derived for all three molecules from high spectral resolution infrared solar spectra recorded between January 1995 and October 1999. The three molecules show distinct seasonal cycles with maxima during winter for CO and C 2 H 6, and during spring for HCN. These seasonal changes are superimposed on interannual variations. The tropospheric columns of all three molecules were elevated during 1998. Increases were most pronounced for HCN with enhanced values throughout the year, up to a factor of 2 in January 1998 when compared to averages of the other years. The increased tropospheric columns coincide with the period of widespread wildfires during the strong El Nino warm phase of 1997 - 1998. The emission enhancements above ISSJ are less pronounced, and they peaked after the increases measured above Mauna Loa (19. 55 degreesN, 155. 6 degreesW).

It exists in bound form with other elements (e. g. water, hydrocarbons) and as such energy is required to abstract molecular hydrogen from various feedstocks. Solar energy due to its abundance and low cost is being considered as the energy source for environmentally safe hydrogen generation. This dissertation focuses on the development and characterization of nano-structured materials for solar thermochemical hydrogen generation, on the principle that concentrated solar radiation can be employed as the high-temperature energy source for driving an endothermic hydrogen generation process. The reaction mechanism and kinetics of different solar thermochemical processes using those nano-structured materials as reactants or catalysts were investigated. The experimental works in this dissertation can be divided into two main areas. The first area is to study the properties and reactivity of in-situ generated Zn nanocrystals (NCs) for solar thermochemical Zn/ZnO water splitting cycle for hydrogen production. The particle size-resolved kinetics of Zn NCs oxidation, evaporation, and hydrolysis were studied using a tandem ion-mobility method in which the first mobility characterization size selects the NCs, whereas the second mobility characterization measures changes in mass resulting from a chemical reaction of the NCs. The second part of the dissertation is concentrated on the investigation of in-situ generated nano-sized metal particles as catalysts in liquid hydrocarbon decomposition process for hydrogen generation.

Current mitigation measures have reduced <b>free</b> <b>CO</b> 2 levels at the hatchery entrance by only 5 ppm, which is roughly equal to the increase in CO 2 due to fish respiration from the hatchery entrance to exit. The objective of this study has been to determine the source of elevated <b>free</b> <b>CO</b> 2 and provide the hatchery with recommendations for mitigation of the problem. The water source for the hatchery is a shallow pond, which is fed by 10 springs, both warm and cold. The pond was formerly used as a receptor for municipal stormwater and the bottom of the pond includes several feet of organic-rich mud, which may be a product of stormwater input. The objective was first addressed by collecting unfiltered water samples from each spring, the pond outlet, the hatchery entrance (outlet of aerator) and exit, and measuring temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved O 2, and <b>free</b> <b>CO</b> 2 on-site. The Hach DR- 2700 Spectrophotometer was used to measure Cu, Fe, Zn, ammonia, nitrite and hardness, which are the most common stressors of rainbow trout. The discharge of each spring was estimated based upon flow over sharp-crested weirs. Mixing calculations showed that the chemistry and discharge of the springs predicted the chemistry of the pond outlet within (2 - 9) % for all parameters except Cu, Fe and Zn. The <b>free</b> <b>CO</b> 2 at the pond outlet was over-predicted by 9 %, indicating that the organic mud in the pond is not a significant contributor of <b>free</b> <b>CO</b> 2. The heavy metals Fe, Cu and Zn were under-predicted by (22 - 27) %, suggesting that the organic mud is a sink for heavy metals. Mixing calculations showed further that the <b>free</b> <b>CO</b> 2 level at the hatchery entrance could be reduced as low as 12 ppm with acceptable discharge and other chemical parameters by diverting the four springs with the highest CO 2 levels. Current research involves improved documentation of the daily variation in <b>free</b> <b>CO</b> 2 levels at the pond outlet and hatchery entrance and exit along with monthly collection of both filtered and unfiltered samples and on-site measurements at all of the above-mentioned sites. In addition to measuring nitrite, ammonia and hardness with the spectrophotometer, Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Ti are being measured using the PerkinElmer Optima- 8000 ICP-OES. Further results will be reported at the meeting...|$|R
