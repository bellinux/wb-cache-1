The corrective action investigation conducted in February 1999 found the only contaminant of concern above preliminary action levels to be total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics at two sample locations. During this investigation, the two corrective action objectives identified were (1) to prevent or mitigate exposure to near-surface soil containing contaminants of concern, and (2) to prevent spread of contaminants of concern beyond the corrective action unit. Based on the corrective action objectives, the two corrective action alternatives developed for consideration were: Alternative 1 - No Further Action; and Alternative 2 - Clean Closure by Excavation and Disposal. The two alternatives were evaluated based on four general corrective action standards and five remedy selection decision factors, and the preferred corrective action alternative chosen on technical merit, focusing on performance, reliability, feasibility, and safety was Alternative 2. This alternative meets all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the site and will eliminate potential future exposure pathways to the contaminated soils at the Weather Station <b>Fuel</b> <b>Storage</b> site...|$|R

A more accurate estimate was obtained by modelling the rate of evaporation of the liquid fuel and the vapour cloud dispersion in the surrounding atmosphere.

Virtual Reality technologies provide the capability to create accurate, realistic and immersive environments, as well as create ¿objects¿ ¿ representing equipment, measurement devices and radiation sources, with specific properties and behaviours. To be adapted to Safeguards, applications need to reflect the equipment, functions (including the laws of Physics) and procedures that are ultimately used in the field. The paper presents the development of a virtual reality based prototype aimed at simulating the selection, installation, configuration and usage of Safeguards equipment. Examples include surveillance cameras and radiation detection equipment. Design and simulation are achieved by using these devices in realistic environments, including the presence of virtual radioactive sources. Application scenarios include: (a) the design of a Safeguards approach for a given installation; (b) the determination of the most appropriate location to install equipment (e. g., surveillance cameras); (c) the interactive evaluation of equipment¿s effectiveness for specific applications and scenarios; (d) training on the use of specific equipment ¿ e. g., using radiation detection equipment.
