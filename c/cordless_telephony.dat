40|$|The {{concept of}} Smart Home where appliances, sensors, actuators, {{displays}} and computing resources are connected and interact {{to support the}} life of the citizen is being increasingly researched. In this context, the Wi-Fi communication technology has grown to become the de-facto standard for data communications in Smart Home environments, with <b>cordless</b> <b>telephony</b> being dominated by the DECT protocol. Even though both technologies incorporate sets of security features aimed at securing the confidentiality and integrity of the communications, the nature and the design of both radio-frequency protocols make them vulnerable, up to a certain extent, to privacy leakages through traffic analysis attacks.

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} that analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion at the intermediate-frequency {{stage of a}} radio is feasible {{for a wide range}} of cellular and <b>cordless</b> <b>telephony</b> standards. Placing the A/D converter as close as possible to the front end of the radio has manufacturing advantages and allows the use of sophisticated DSP algorithms which are especially usem with digitally coded transmissions. The type of conversion proposed is a switched-capacitor (switched-C) implementation of a bandpass delta-sigm & (BPAZ) modulator. This thesis adhsses the performance of BPAZ A/D converters by focussing on larger bandwidths (1. 2 MHz) and higher centre frequencies (2 OMHz) than previously obtained, while maintaining 12 bit resolution. An 8 *-order 3 -level BPAX A/D modulator is designed to meet these specifications. Through modelling and simulation, it is shown that for low oversampling ratios large gains in signal-to-noise ratio cannot be obtained when going to higher-order modulators. However, by increasing the number of levels in the quantizer, the performance of thg modulator can be gnzatly enhanced by taking advantage of the added stability...|$|E

40|$|Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) is a world-wide {{wireless}} standard {{sustained by}} ETSI and {{widely used in}} <b>cordless</b> <b>telephony.</b> Whilst domestic DECT cordless phones were primarily designed {{to be used in}} connection with the Public Switched Telephone Network, their presence in Unified Communications systems has become more and more common given their reliability, flexibility and interoperability. The DECT protocol foresees the usage of authentication and encryption {{in order to protect the}} privacy of the voice communications. Unfortunately, the cryptographic mechanisms foreseen by the standard do not provide support for forward secrecy. As a consequence, the compromise of the long-term secret cryptographic key leads to the decryption of any previous, present and future encrypted communication. In this paper, we describe and demonstrate experimentally a new physical attack, able to recover the long-term cryptographic key from the memory of DECT devices and use it to decrypt voice communications previously intercepted in encrypted form. In order to mitigate this threat to the privacy of the DECT communications, we propose a set of countermeasures and proposals for modifications of the standard to provide forward secrecy in the communications.

40|$|Dynamic channel {{allocation}} in cellular {{networks have}} become very popular due to the flexibility obtained by using any of the available channels in any cell {{as long as the}} interference level is below a given threshold. Distributed resource allocation is popular in modern day cellular systems due to the increase in micro-cells and picocells. In our problem we study cellular networks, under distributed dynamic channel allocation and propose a two dimensional Markov chain model to analyze the performance of the system in terms of blocking probabilities. In our analysis, we consider all the mobiles and base stations to be perfectly power controlled, i. e. each mobile (base station) transmits on any channel, such that the signal strength received at its corresponding base station (mobile) is unity irrespective of the actual position of the mobile in the cell. We perform this analysis for a linear highway system and a two dimensional cellular system modelling the shape of the cells to be perfect circles. We look at low mobility systems in our problem. In practice, Digital European <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telephony</b> (DECT) is a standard to which our analysis is applicable.

40|$|Class- 1 Bluetooth devices {{support a}} {{transmission}} range of about 100 m and {{are useful for}} indoor <b>cordless</b> <b>telephony</b> with advantages of wider coverage, greater user mobility, and more convenience. To minimize the transmit power of class- 1 devices, feedback power control specified in the Bluetooth specification can be used. This paper shows that further transmit-power reduction is possible by reducing the Golden Receive Power Range (GRPR) from the specified value of 20 dB. For typical indoor log-normal-shadowing channels, more than 4 dB reduction in the mean transmit power can usually be obtained by reducing the GRPR to 10 dB. However, using a smaller GRPR increases the frequency of making power-adjustment requests through the Link Manager Protocol (LMP), thereby pre-empting more voice packets and affecting the voice quality. We compute the overhead cost due to power control, defined {{as the percentage of}} the total number of packets used for power-adjustment requests, when the GRPR is set at 10 dB ± 6 dB, wherein 6 dB is the tolerance allowed in implementation. It is found that the overhead cost is less than about 1 % but becomes close to 1 % as the GRPR approaches 4 dB, indicating that the link performance would become barely acceptable for voice transmission in some situations. We also consider utilizing the reserved byte in LMP power-control commands to convey the preferred number of power-adjustment steps to the transmitter in order to reduce the overhead cost. With this arrangement, the (worst-case) overhead cost is reduced to about 0. 3 %, so that the voice quality can be maintained acceptable even if the GRPR is reduced to 10 dB ± 6 dB for transmit-power reduction. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The present {{explosion}} in digital communications and multi-user wireless cellular networks has urged {{a demand for}} more effective modulation methods, utilizing the available frequency spectrum more efficiently. To accommodate {{a large number of}} users sharing the same available frequency band, one requirement is the availability of large families of spreading sequences with excellent AC and CC properties. Another requirement is the availability of sets of orthogonal basis functions to extend capacity by exploiting all available degrees of freedom (e. g., temporal, frequency and spatial dimesions), or by employing orthogonal multi-code operation in parallel, such as used in the latest 3 GPP and 3 GPP 2 Wide-band Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) modulation standards by employing sets of orthogonal Walsh codes to improve the overall data throughput capacity. The generic Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) transmitter developed in this dissertation has originally been designed and implemented to investigate the practicality and usefulness of complex spreading sequences, and secondly, to verify the concept of non-linearly interpolated root-of-unity (NLI-RU) filtering. It was found that both concepts have a large potential for application in point-to-point, and particularly micro-cellular Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Wireless-Local-Loop (WLL) environments. Since then, several novel concepts and subsystems {{have been added to the}} original system, some of which have been patented both locally and abroad, and are outlined below. Consequently, the ultimate goal of this research project was to apply the principles of the generic DSSS transmitter and receiver developed in this study in the implementation of a WLL radio-frequency (RF) -link, and particularly towards the establishment of affordable wireless multimedia services in rural areas. The extended coverage at exceptionally low power emission levels offered by the new design will be particularly useful in rural applications. The proposed WLL concept can for example also be utilized to add a unique mobility feature to for example existing Private Automatic Branch Exchanges (PABXs). The proposed system will in addition offer superior teletraffic capacity compared to existing micro-cellular technologies, e. g., the Digital European <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telephony</b> (DECT) system, which has been consider by Telkom for employment in rural areas. The latter is a rather outdated interim standard offering much lower spectral efficiency and capacity than competitive CDMA-solutions, such as the concept analyzed in this dissertation, which is based on the use of unique large families of spectrally well confined (i. e., band-limited) constant envelope (CE) complex spreading sequences (CSS) with superior correlation properties. The CE characteristic of the new spreading sequences furthermore facilitates the design of systems with superior power efficiency and exceptionally robust performance characteristics (much less spectral re-growth) compared to existing 2 G and 3 G modulation standards, in the presence of non-linear power amplification. This feature allows for a system with larger coverage for a given performance level and limited peak power, or alternatively, longer battery life for a given maximum communication distance and performance level, within a specified fixed spreading bandwidth. In addition, the possibility to extend the concept to orthogonal multi-code operation provides for comparable capacity to present 3 G modulation standards, while still preserving superior power efficiency characteristics in non-linear power amplification. Conventional spread spectrum communication systems employ binary spreading sequences, such as Gold or Kasami sequences. The practical implementation of such a system is relatively simple. The design and implementation of a spread-spectrum communication system employing complex spreading sequences is however considerable more complex and has not been previously presented, nor been implemented in hardware. The design of appropriate code lock loops for CSS has led to a unique design with 3 dB performance advantage compared to similar loops designed for binary spreading sequences. The theoretical analysis and simulation of such a system will be presented, with the primary focus on an efficient hardware implementation of all new concepts proposed, in the form of a WLL RF-link demonstrator.
