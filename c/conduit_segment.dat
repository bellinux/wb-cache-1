40|$|The flow {{dynamics}} of crystal-rich high-viscosity magma {{is likely to}} be strongly influenced by viscous and latent heat release. Viscous heating is observed {{to play an important role}} in the {{dynamics of}} fluids with temperature-dependent viscosities. The growth of microlite crystals and the accompanying release of latent heat should play a similar role in raising fluid temperatures. Earlier models of viscous heating in magmas have shown the potential for unstable (thermal runaway) flow as described by a Gruntfest number, using an Arrhenius temperature dependence for the viscosity, but have not considered crystal growth or latent heating. We present a theoretical model for magma flow in an axisymmetric conduit and consider both heating effects using Finite Element Method techniques. We consider a constant mass flux in a 1 -D infinitesimal <b>conduit</b> <b>segment</b> with isothermal and adiabatic boundary conditions and Newtonian and non-Newtonian magma flow properties. We find that the growth of crystals acts to stabilize the flow field and make the magma less likely to experience a thermal runaway. The additional heating influences crystal growth and can counteract supercooling from degassing-induced crystallization and drive the residual melt composition back towards the liquidus temperature. We illustrate the models with results generated using parameters appropriate for the andesite lava dome-forming eruption at Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat. These results emphasize the radial variability of the magma. Both viscous and latent heating effects are shown to be capable of playing a significant role in the eruption dynamics of Soufriere Hills Volcano. Latent heating is a factor in the top two kilometres of the conduit and may be responsible for relatively short-term (days) transients. Viscous heating is less restricted spatially, but because thermal runaway requires periods of hundreds of days to be achieved, the process {{is likely to be}} interrupted. Our models show that thermal evolution of the conduit walls could lead to an increase in the effective diameter of flow and an increase in flux at constant magma pressure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} {{cardiovascular}} response under heart failure condition supported by {{two types of}} ventricular assist devices (VADs) : the positive displacement pump and the impeller pump. The cardiovascular system is modeled using the concentrated parameter method developed previously, by considering flow resistance, vessel elasticity and inertial effects of blood in individual <b>conduit</b> <b>segments.</b> The dynamic modeling of displacement and impeller pumps is represented by VAD inlet/outlet flow-rate changes. Results show that in each simulation, the diseased ventricle is effectively unloaded, and the physiological variables of arterial pressure and systemic flow are adequately maintained. The numerical model is under further development for more sophisticated studies of {{the interaction of the}} native cardiovascular system with VAD support and other cardiac prosthetic devices...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the use of}} a diseased native superficial femoral artery as conduit in a 57 -year-old diabetic female who presented with a mixed aetiology lower leg ulcer. She underwent a staged ilio-profunda and profunda to above knee popliteal bypass graft. Owing to the lack of a sufficient length of venous <b>conduit,</b> a <b>segment</b> of the diseased native superficial femoral artery was harvested and used as a conduit in a composite graft. A diseased native artery {{can be used as a}} conduit for bypass if a sufficient length of vein is not available at operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrological}} {{systems of}} heavily-downwasted debris-covered glaciers differ from clean-ice glaciers {{due to the}} hummocky surface and debris mantle of such glaciers, leading to a relatively limited understanding of drainage pathways. Supraglacial ponds represent sinks within the discontinuous supraglacial drainage system, and have been documented to sporadically drain englacially. To assess pond dynamics, pond water level measurements were made on Lirung Glacier during May and October of 2013 and 2014. The four field seasons coincided with aerial, satellite, and terrestrial orthomosaic images and digital elevation models, which provided snapshots of the ponds and their surroundings. We analysed the glacier's closed surface catchments to identify surface drainage pathways and englacial drainage points, and compared this to field observations of surface discahrge. The ponded area was higher in the pre-monsoon than post-monsoon, with individual ponds filling and draining seasonally associated with the surface exposure of englacial <b>conduit</b> <b>segments.</b> We recorded four pond drainage events, all of which occurred gradually (duration of weeks), observed diurnal fluctuations indicative of varying supply and discharge, and we documented instances of interaction between distant ponds. The DEM drainage analysis identified numerous sinks > 3 m across the glacier surface, few of which exhibited ponds (23 %), while the field survey highlighted surface discharge only explicable via englacial routes. Taken together our observations provide evidence for widespread supraglacial-englacial connectivity for meltwater drainage paths. Results suggest that progressive englacial conduit collapse events, themselves likely driven by supraglacial pond drainage, enable the glacier surface to evolve into a configuration following relict englacial conduit systems. Within this system, ponds form in depressions of reduced drainage efficiency and link the supraglacial and englacial drainage networks...|$|R
40|$|Prions, the {{putative}} causative agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are neurotropic pathogens that {{spread to the}} central nervous system via synaptically linked neural conduits upon peripheral infection. Axons and their transport processes have been suggested as mediators of nerve-associated prion dissemination. However, the exact cellular components and molecular mechanisms underlying neural spread are unknown. This study used an established hamster scrapie model to pursue a novel experimental approach using nerve <b>conduits</b> containing <b>segments</b> devoid of neurites generated by incomplete nerve regeneration following Wallerian degeneration to probe the necessity of axons for the neural propagation of prions. For this purpose, animals were subjected to unilateral sciatic neurectomy 4 weeks before footpad inoculation with scrapie agent. The results showed that the regional nerve is the prime conduit for cerebral neuroinvasion and revealed, as evidenced by the accumulation of pathological prion protein PrP TSE, that prions can proceed along segments of peripheral neural projections without detectable axonal structures...|$|R

We have established effective methods for efficient de and recellularization of large animal and human lungs including techniques which allow multiple small segments (~ 1 - 3 cm 3) to be excised that retain 3 -dimensional lung structure. Coupled {{with the use of}} a synthetic pleural coating, cells can be selectively physiologically inoculated via preserved vascular and airway <b>conduits.</b> Inoculated <b>segments</b> can be further sliced for high throughput studies. Further, we demonstrate thermography as a powerful noninvasive technique for monitoring perfusion decellularization and for evaluating preservation of vascular and airway networks following human and porcine lung decellularization. Collectively, these techniques are a significant step forward as they allow high throughput in vitro studies from a single lung or lobe in a more biologically relevant, three-dimensional acellular scaffold...|$|R
40|$|Broadband “open access” {{regulation}} mandates {{openness of}} conduits (e. g. upgraded cable television) to service providers (e. g. America Online), but policy discussion often {{suggests that the}} ultimate goal is openness to advanced content (streaming video, interactive e-commerce, etc.). We define two forms of regulation, open access and common carriage, and discuss when they are equivalent. We argue that they are quite different in local access broadband. We develop a systems model with free entry and competition in all three industry <b>segments</b> (<b>conduits,</b> service providers, and content) and examine how open access regulation affects the number of firms in each. We confirm the view that an open access requirement can reduce entry of physical conduits, and more surprising we also describe conditions under which it can reduce the amount of content available to consumers. open access, broadband...|$|R
40|$|Submarine {{channels}} are ubiquitous on the seafloor and their inception and evolution {{is a result}} of dynamic interaction between turbidity currents and the evolving seafloor. However, the morphodynamic links between channel inception and flow dynamics have not yet been monitored in experiments and only in one instance on the modern seafloor. Previous experimental flows did not show channel inception, because flow conditions were not appropriately scaled to sustain suspended sediment transport. Here we introduce and apply new scaling constraints for similarity between natural and experimental turbidity currents. The scaled currents initiate a leveed channel from an initially featureless slope. Channelization commences with deposition of levees in some slope segments and erosion of a <b>conduit</b> in other <b>segments.</b> Channel relief and flow confinement increase progressively during subsequent flows. This morphodynamic evolution determines the architecture of submarine channel deposits in the stratigraphic record and efficiency of sediment bypass to the basin floor...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{determine}} vasomotor functional responses of conduit coronary artery distal to bare-metal stents (BMS), polymer-only stents (POLY), and sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in a clinically relevant animal model. BackgroundDrug-eluting stents (DES) reduce in-stent restenosis, and also affect neointima formation and vascular remodeling in downstream coronary segments. Whether distal artery vasomotor function is also influenced by DES has not been determined. MethodsPigs (n = 12) received coronary stent implants, and hearts were harvested at 1 month. Arterial segments ≥ 15 mm distal to stents were excised and studied in an organ-chamber apparatus. Endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxation and contraction to classical agonists were measured. ResultsThe SES showed increased lumen area and reduced neointima; abnormal vasomotor function of conduit arteries distal to SES also was observed. Contraction to endothelin- 1 was significantly enhanced for SES compared with both BMS and POLY. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to a maximal dose of substance P was attenuated for SES compared with both BMS and POLY (46 ± 6 % vs. 71 ± 3 % and 78 ± 3 %, respectively, p < 0. 001). Endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside was potentiated for SES, compared with BMS and POLY (100 ± 5 % vs. 69 ± 7 % and 77 ± 5 %, respectively, p = 0. 02). ConclusionsStent-based local delivery of sirolimus profoundly inhibited neointima formation but caused vasomotor dysfunction in distal <b>conduit</b> vessel <b>segments.</b> These observations suggest that distal coronary vasospasm may be more readily evoked {{in the presence of}} DES and contribute to pathophysiological sequela...|$|R
40|$|Although many {{consider}} plaque burden and vasoconstriction as critical components of ‘vulnerable’ coronary atheroma, their intrinsic relationship in vivo remains relatively unexplored. This thesis, {{presented as a}} series of experiments conducted in intact humans with coronary artery disease, explores the fundamental in vivo relationships between coronary atheroma volume, composition and topography in relation to underlying segmental epicardial coronary endothelium-dependent vasomotor reactivity. The contributions of segmental wall shear stress (WSS), and the first-in-man assessment of left main coronary arterial endothelium-dependent vasomotor reactivity and its determinants, are also explored. A novel feature was the utility of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for all coronary structural and functional assessments. In these experiments, IVUS was pivotal in enabling the first-in-man validation of intracoronary salbutamol as a novel epicardial endothelium-dependent stimulus. Of the 3 introductory chapters, chapters 1 and 2 outline the utility of IVUS for exploring coronary atherosclerosis and ‘vulnerable’ plaques. Chapter 3 draws specific attention to the nature of endothelium-dependent stimulus required to safely explore, with greater precision, the coronary structure-function relationship in humans in vivo. Chapters 4 - 9 comprise the results sections of this thesis. Chapter 4 outlines the utility of ‘provocation intravascular imaging’ [IVUS-upon-Doppler Flowire imaging during simultaneous intracoronary (IC) infusions] to validate IC salbutamol as a novel endothelium-dependent epicardial coronary and microvascular stimulus. Chapter 5 describes the coronary structure-function relationship in patients with stable, minimally diseased coronary arteries (i. e. the population studied in chapter 4) compared with patient with non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Irrespective of the nature of clinical presentation, the magnitude of segmental lumen vasoreactivity, controlled for by the degree of atheroma volume, did not differ. Our results also suggested possible interactions between systemic inflammation and coronary atheroma in mediating coronary vasomotor reactivity. Utilizing a custom-built IVUS console to deliver radio-frequency IVUS signals, Chapter 6 outlines the relationship between plaque composition and segmental vasomotor reactivity in the NSTEMI population evaluated in chapter 5. Both the volumes of lipidic and necrotic core composition predicted vasoconstriction, whereas greater fibrotic plaque predicted vasodilatation. Chapter 7 describes a unique investigation into in vivo relationships between segmental WSS, arterial remodeling and vasomotor function in paients with stable, minimally diseased coronaries (population studied in chapter 4). Independent of plaque burden, WSS directly related to vasomotor reactivity, and inversely to arterial remodeling. Regions of high plaque burden associated with lower WSS, expansive remodeling and greater plaque eccentricity, thus providing a novel link between these known individual features of plaque vulnerability. Chapter 8 outlines the first-in-man description of left main coronary arterial (LMCA) vasomotor reactivity, in comparison to downstream epicardial segments. The study population comprised of all patients across study protocols who underwent left-sided coronary imaging with evaluable matched LMCA images. LMCA and proximal epicardial segments were least reactive, compared to more distal <b>conduit</b> <b>segments,</b> which may relate to higher WSS in smaller caliber distal segments. These results may also explain the propensity for culprit plaques to cluster proximally in humans. Chapter 9 describes a unique comparison of in vivo lumen dimensions measured with IVUS, Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) and 3 D quantitative coronary angiography (3 D-QCA). Lumen dimensions were greater with IVUS compared to FD-OCT and 3 D-QCA, and were magnified within smaller coronary segments. We concluded that specific cut-off values validated with IVUS should not be arbitrarily translated into the OCT hemisphere for clinical decision making. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The motor {{patterns}} and luminal {{capacity of the}} human intestine should affect symptoms and resorption during pathological, massive small intestinal flow. Little is known of human intestinal motility in this situation. This study aimed at mimicking secretory diarrhoea (experimentally) in healthy volunteers by intrajejunal infusion of a non-absorbable iso-osmotic solution at 20 ml/min. During the infusion intraluminal jejunal pressures and small intestinal transit times were measured. The infusion initially caused jejunal contractile activity {{similar to that of}} the fed state but this was replaced by discrete clusters of contractions (DCCs) after 29. 1 ((SEM) 8. 2) minutes. DCCs each lasted 38 ((SEM) 0. 8 seconds) and were associated with colicky abdominal discomfort. Later, after 1400 - 1800 ml had been infused, distal jejunal pressure waves fell to 10 mm Hg or less. Frequent fasting DCCs predicted earlier onset and more frequent DCCs during the infusion. Thus, the rate and volume of flow during simulated secretory diarrhoea determine the pattern of the small bowel pressure profile; eventually, a volume load is reached in which the small bowel acts as a poorly <b>segmenting</b> <b>conduit</b> resulting in very fast transit rates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the acute effect of cigarette smoking on proximal and distal epicardial condult and coronary resistance vessels. Background. Cigarette smoking causes constriction of epicardial arteries {{and a decrease in}} coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease, despite an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. The role of changes in resistance vessel tone in the acute coronary hemodynamic effect of smoking has not been examined. Methods. Twenty-four long-term smokers were studied during cardiac catheterization after vasoactive medications had been discontinued. The effect of smoking one cigerette 10 to 15 mm long on proximal and distal <b>conduit</b> vessel <b>segments</b> was assessed before and immediately after smoking and at 5, 15 and 30 min after smoking (n = 8). To determine the effect of smoking on resistance vessels, coronary flow velocity was measured in a nonobstructed artery with a 3 F intracoronary Doppler catheter before and for 5 min after smoking (n = 8). Eight patients were studied without smoking to control for spontaneous changes in conduit arterial diameter (n = 5) and vessel tone (n = 3). Results. The average diameter of proximal coronary artery segments decreased from 2. 56 ± 0. 12 mm (mean ± SEM) before smoking to 2. 41 ± 0. 09 mm 5 min after amoking (− 5 ± 2 %, p < 0. 05). Distal coronary diameter decreased from 1. 51 ± 0. 07 to 1. 39 ± 0. 06 mm (− 8 ± 2 %, p < 0. 01). Marked focal vasoconstriction after smoking was observed in two patients. Coronary diameter returned to baseline by 30 min after smoking. There was no change in vessel diameter in control patients. Despite {{a significant increase in the}} heart rate-mean arterial pressure product, coronary flow velocity decreased by 7 ± 4 % (p < 0. 05) and coronary vascular increased by 21 ± 4 % (p < 0. 01) 5 min after smoking. There was no change in these variables in the control subjects. Conclusions. Smoking causes immediate constrictioin of proximal and distil epicardial coronary arteries and an increase in coronay resistance vessel tone despite an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. These acute coronary hemodynamic effects may contribute to the adverse cardiovascular consequences of cigarette smoking...|$|R
40|$|Achieving an {{understanding}} of the nature of monogenetic volcanic fields depends on identification of the spatial and temporal patterns of volcanism in these fields, and their relationships to structures mapped in the shallow crust and inferred in the deep crust and mantle through interpretation of geochemical, radiometric and geophysical data. We investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of volcanism in the Abu Monogenetic Volcano Group, Southwest Japan. E-W elongated volcano distribution, which is identified by a nonparametric kernel method, is found to be consistent with the spatial extent of P-wave velocity anomalies in the lower crust and upper mantle, supporting the idea that the spatial density map of volcanic vents reflects the geometry of a mantle diapir. Estimated basalt supply to the lower crust is constant. This observation and the spatial distribution of volcanic vents suggest stability of magma productivity and essentially constant two-dimensional size of the source mantle diapir. We mapped <b>conduits,</b> dike <b>segments,</b> and sills in the San Rafael sub-volcanic field, Utah, where the shallowest part of a Pliocene magmatic system is exceptionally well exposed. The distribution of conduits matches the major features of dike distribution, including development of clusters and distribution of outliers. The comparison of San Rafael conduit distribution and the distributions of volcanoes in several recently active volcanic fields supports the use of statistical models, such as nonparametric kernel methods, in probabilistic hazard assessment for distributed volcanism. We developed a new recurrence rate calculation method that uses a Monte Carlo procedure to better reflect and understand the impact of uncertainties of radiometric age determinations on uncertainty of recurrence rate estimates for volcanic activity in the Abu, Yucca Mountain Region, and Izu-Tobu volcanic fields. Results suggest that the recurrence rates of volcanic fields can change by more than one order of magnitude on time scales of several hundred thousand to several million years. This suggests that magma generation rate beneath volcanic fields may change over these time scales. Also, recurrence rate varies more than one order of magnitude between these volcanic fields, consistent with the idea that distributed volcanism may be influenced by both the rate of magma generation and the potential for dike interaction during ascent...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:We have {{investigated}} the effect of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution at different temperatures on endothelial and smooth muscle cell function of the human saphenous vein to define the efficacy of UW solution as a preservation solution for saphenous vein <b>conduits.</b> Methods:Saphenous vein <b>segments</b> from 38 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were examined with an isolated organ bath technique to monitor changes in vessel reactivity. Results:Endothelial-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were attenuated after incubation in UW solution at both 4 ° C and 28 ° C (p < 0. 05, n = 10). In contrast, relaxations to sodium nitroprusside were unchanged after incubation in UW solution at both temperatures (n = 8). The responses to 90 mmol/L KCl were increased at both 4 ° C and 28 ° C, respectively. Tyrode's: 27. 2 % ± 3. 1 % and 23. 8 % ± 3. 0 %, UW: 64. 7 % ± 8. 0 % and 73. 1 % ± 11 % (p < 0. 001). In addition, the responses to 5 -HT were enhanced at 4 ° C and 28 ° C (p < 0. 05). In contrast, responses to noradrenaline were enhanced only at 28 ° C compared with the responses after incubations in Tyrode's solution (p < 0. 05, n = 6). Furthermore U 46619 (0. 3 nmol/L to 1 nmol/L) responses were augmented at 4 ° C (p < 0. 05, n = 7). The potency (pD 2) values for each agonist {{were not significantly different}} after incubations in UW solution. Conclusions:We conclude that UW solution produces attenuation of acetylcholine relaxations and temperature-dependent increased reactivity of smooth-muscle cell function in the isolated human saphenous vein. These studies document the complex interactions brought about by UW solution on the different components of the vascular wall that need to be elucidated further if this solution is to attain a place in vascular preservation...|$|R
