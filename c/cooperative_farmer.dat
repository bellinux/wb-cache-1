This study aimed to: 1) analyze the factors that affect the production of broiler chickens, 2) analyze the risks faced by broiler farmers, and 3) analyze the risk preferences of production. This study used two business patterns of broiler chicken farms, i. e. cooperation/partnership and independent. This {{study was conducted in}} Bekasi, a research area which was intentionally chosen in a consideration that the area hasg a positive population trend. There were 74 breeders involved in this study. The analysis was conducted by using Just Pope function model and utility maximization. The results suggest that the factors affecting broiler production include feeds and husks for the independent farmers. Feeds, vaccines and density are influential variables for production by the <b>cooperative</b> <b>farmers.</b> The variables that increase the production risks in the independent farmers include vaccines, labor, and husk, while the variable affecting the <b>cooperative</b> <b>farmers</b> is labor. The variable that can minimize risks for the independent farmers is feeds, while for the <b>cooperative</b> <b>farmers,</b> the variable is vaccine. The risk preference of the independent farmers on the overall input usage is the risk averse or a tendency to avoid risk. Broiler chicken farms require a counseling to improve their quality of human resources, accurate schedule of vaccine applications, and attention to husk condition in order to reduce risks.

40|$|Abstract The {{poverty of}} Nigerian farmers and their {{inability}} to increase their output and income above the subsistence level {{have been identified as}} one of the factors militating against food production in Nigeria. Yet agricultural cooperative create the ability for the supply of required agricultural inputs so that production of commodities is done timely to enhance productivity. They also provide an assured market for commodities produced by isolated small farmers in the rural areas. This paper was determined to evaluate the effects of cooperative societies on members output. The researchers administered a total of one hundred and twenty-six 126 questionnaires to the respondents {{with the assistance of the}} divisional cooperative officers. The hypotheses were analyzed through the use of t-test statistic and regression analysis. Results showed that the various Services rendered by <b>farmers</b> <b>cooperative</b> to their members include agric credit improved seedlings fertilizer and market access. They however disagreed that they received extension services the <b>cooperative</b> <b>farmers</b> agreed that they have access to the following agricultural services after joining cooperatives Access to Agric credit Access to Improved Seedlings and Access to Fertilizer.

Hence the need to adopt cooperative as a platform for improving farmers productivity and output in Awka South L. G. A of Anambra state.

40|$|Access to {{farm inputs}} {{is one of}} the major {{challenges}} facing rural farmers in Nigeria. To alleviate this problem, government at different levels strongly recommended the formation of <b>cooperative</b> societies to <b>farmers.</b> Against this background, a study was conducted to determine if differential access to farm inputs exists between <b>cooperative</b> and non-cooperative <b>farmers</b> in Abuja, Nigeria. A multi-stage technique was used for sample selection while semi-structured questionnaires were used for data collection. A total of 360 farmers were randomly interviewed in four agricultural zones (180 cooperative and 180 non-cooperative farmers). Data were analyzed using two-way factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean separation was done at 5 % probability level. Results revealed that there was significant difference (P < 0. 01) in cooperative and non-cooperative farmers’ access to farm inputs. Comparatively, the mean perceptions indicated that the <b>cooperative</b> <b>farmers</b> had more access to labour, loan, herbicide, insecticide, rodenticide, fertilizer, tractor services, storage equipment and processing equipment while the non-cooperative farmers had more access to land. The results also indicated that the most accessible farm input to both <b>cooperative</b> and non-cooperative <b>farmers</b> was land while the least accessible farm inputs were loan and tractor services. Based on the findings, the paper concluded that differential access to farm inputs existed between <b>cooperative</b> and non-cooperative <b>farmers</b> in the study area. It was recommended that government and non-governmental agencies should encourage farmers to form and/or join viable cooperative societies.
