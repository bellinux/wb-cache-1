40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for the confirmatory and quantitative analysis of 30 β-lactam antibiotic residues in bovine muscle. The method includes 12 penicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, mecillinam, methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, penicillin G, penicillin V, piperacillin, ticarcillin), 12 cephalosporins (cefacetrile, cefadroxil, cephalexin, <b>cefalonium,</b> cefazolin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefquinome, cefuroxime, desacetyl cephapirin, desfuroylceftiofur cysteine disulfide, desfuroylceftiofur dimer), five carbapenems (biapenem, doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem) and faropenem. Samples were extracted using a simple solvent extraction with acetonitrile:water (80 : 20, v/v) and C 18 dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) clean-up, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) detection. Chromatography was performed on a reversed phase CSH C 18 column, using a binary gradient separation comprising of 0. 01 % formic acid and 0. 2 mM ammonium acetate in water (mobile phase A) and 0. 01 % formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionisation mode (ESI(+)). Validation was performed following the 2002 / 657 /EC guidelines. Trueness ranged between 69 % and 143 % and precision ranged between 2. 0 % and 29. 9 % under within-laboratory reproducibility conditions. The developed method uses minimal sample preparation and 30 test samples can be analysed by a single analyst in a single day. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first method for carbapenems in foodstuff that does not require derivatisation. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} {{antimicrobial}} usage on dairy farms and waste milk feeding practices in England and Wales The {{cause for the}} high prevalence of cefotaximase-producing Escherichia coli reported in dairy calves is unknown but may be {{partly due to the}} selective pressure of antimicrobial residues in waste milk (milk unfit for human consumption) fed to the calves. Antimicrobial use and waste milk feeding practices were investigated in 557 dairy farms in 2010 / 2011 that responded to a randomised stratified postal survey. The mean number of cases of mastitis per herd in the previous year was 47, and 93 per cent of respondents used antibiotic intra-mammary tubes to treat mastitis. The most frequently used lactating cow antibiotic tubes contained dihydrostreptomycin, neomycin, novobiocin, and procaine penicillin (37 per cent), and cefquinome (29 per cent). Ninety-six per cent of respondents used antibiotic tubes at the cessation of lactation (‘drying off’). The most frequently used dry cow antibiotic tube (43 per cent) contained <b>cefalonium.</b> Frequently used injectable antibiotics included tylosin (27 per cent), dihydrostreptomycin and procaine penicillin (20 per cent) and ceftiofur (13 per cent). Eighty-three per cent of respondents (413) fed waste milk to calves. Of these 413, 87 per cent fed waste milk from cows with mastitis, and only one-third discarded the first milk after antibiotic treatment. This survey has shown that on more than 90 per cent of the farms that feed waste milk to calves, waste milk can contain milk from cows undergoing antibiotic treatment. On some farms, this includes treatment with third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. Further work is underway to investigate the presence of these antimicrobials in waste milk...|$|E
40|$|The recombinantly {{obtained}} Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein PBP 2 x* {{has been}} utilised {{to develop a}} novel microtiter plate assay for the detection and determination of penicillins and cephalosporins in milk, honey, porcine, bovine, turkey and deer muscle tissue and egg. The major advantage in using PBP 2 x* is that only intact beta lactams are detected and both, penicillins and cephalosporins, can be screened within one assay. In the assay, the receptor protein was immobilised to a microplate in the first step. To each sample a bifunctional reagent synthesised for this assay was added, with ampicillin and digoxigenin as functional groups (DIG-AMPI). The amount of bifunctional reagent, which was bound via its ampicillin part to the receptor protein, decreased with increasing beta-lactam concentration in the sample. The detection step used anti-digoxigenin F ab fragments marked with horseradish peroxidase. The more bifunctional reagent was bound to the receptor protein, the more antibody fragments were bound via the digoxigenin part of the reagent. A maximum colour development with hydrogen peroxide as substrate for the peroxidase and tetramethylbenzidine as chromogen was achieved, when no beta-lactam residues were present. Consequently, the colour development was reversely related to the beta-lactam concentration in the sample. The expression of PBP 2 x* as recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and the following purification by affinity chromatography were optimised to achieve high protein amounts. Chemometric experimental design was used to optimise the assay procedure. A fractional factorial design was created to detect effects and interactions of the assay parameters. For final optimisation of the significant parameters a Box-Behnken design was used. As {{a result of the}} optimisation, operation parameters could be selected, which allowed a low consumption of PBP 2 x* as the most valuable reagent, while keeping sensitivity at the necessary high level. The assay has been developed for various food matrices to screen for residues of beta-lactam antibiotics. Except <b>cefalonium,</b> all EU relevant beta-lactam antibiotics could be detected at concentrations around their respective MRL. <b>Cefalonium</b> had a too low binding affinity to PBP 2 x*, so that the detection at its MRL was not possible. Matrix interferences could be eliminated by tenfold dilution of raw milk, porcine and turkey muscle meat, honey and egg. The matrix effect observed with raw milk could also be eliminated by a centrifugation step only. Matrix interferences caused by bovine muscle tissue and albumen could only be partially reduced by a tenfold dilution. For the analysis of deer muscle tissue a membrane filtration step was necessary prior to the dilution step. Samples of albumen, bovine and deer muscle tissue needed matrix blank samples using the same microplate for reliable beta-lactam identification. A validation using the principles of EU decision 2002 / 657 was performed for benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, cefquinome and cefoperazone in milk. The developed microplate assay satisfied the criteria for specificity, reproducibility, precision and accuracy. CCα and CCβ values were calculated. A set of 8 blind-fortified samples {{for each of the four}} beta-lactams was analysed. All blanks were correctly identified and a very high accuracy for quantitative results was observed. At the Federal Research Centre for Nutrition and Food (Institute for Hygiene and Food Safety) at the location in Kiel the excretion of antibiotics (e. g. benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, cefquinome and cefoperazone) in milk was studied. There, the residues were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection and different screening methods. From these experiments 289 milk samples (with the four β-lactam antibiotics mentioned above) preserved by lyophilization were available. With these samples and by comparison of the microtiter plate assay results and the HPLC results obtained in Kiel the opportunity to use the microtiter plate assay as quantitative assay (when the identity of the residual beta-lactam is known), the quantitative accuracy and the validity of the developed microplate receptor assay were checked. No false positive reactions could be detected, giving a diagnostic specificity of 100 %. No false negative samples could be observed as well. In conclusion the results indicate that the assay has the potential to emerge into a screening assay for routine use...|$|E
