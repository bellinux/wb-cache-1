5|$|The {{loss of the}} Levin J. Marvel {{during the}} {{hurricane}} prompted the United States <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a law in 1956, which allowed the Coast Guard to inspect all vessels with more than six passengers; the previous law only allowed inspections for boats of more than 700tons, greatly higher than the 183tons that the Marvel weighed. A federal courthouse charged the inexperienced captain with negligence, giving him a one-year probation.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 floods {{swept through}} the Columbia watershed, {{destroying}} Vanport, then the second largest city in Oregon, and impacting cities {{as far north as}} Trail, British Columbia. The flooding prompted the United States <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the Flood Control Act of 1950, authorizing the federal development of additional dams and other flood control mechanisms. By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a public utility district in Grant County, Washington, ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.|$|E

5|$|In June 1844, the Senate, {{with its}} Whig majority, soundly {{rejected}} the Tyler–Texas treaty. The pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> his treaty by simple majorities in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill (by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|E
5|$|Media exposés {{and popular}} outrage led <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> by {{unanimous}} vote the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act of 1977, which criminalized {{the production and}} sale of child porn. This act {{was signed into law}} by President Jimmy Carter on February 6, 1978. The legislation was supported by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in New York v. Ferber, , that images of children need not meet legal definitions of obscenity to be prohibited by the government, since the state's interest in protecting children from harm trumped First Amendment rights in this instance.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the ruling {{in this case was}} that it tested the constitutionality of the Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the Dawes Act the following year. The case has been criticized by legal scholars as drawing on powers that are not granted to Congress by the Constitution. It remains , despite that criticism.|$|E

5|$|Through 1935, as {{the breakup}} {{legislation}} wound through Congress, and litigation through the courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly {{passed a bill}} for the breakup, Willkie {{made a series of}} speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a bill requiring the breakup to take place within three years.|$|E
5|$|With {{the passage}} of the Pittman Act in 1918, the United States Mint was {{required}} to strike millions of silver dollars, and began to do so in 1921, using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I; although they failed to get <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a bill requiring the redesign, they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December 1921, completing the redesign of United States coinage that had begun in 1907.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Burnham {{was living}} in California and was active in counterespionage for Britain. Much of it {{involved}} a famous Boer spy, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne, who became a German spy in both World Wars and claimed to have killed Field Marshal Kitchener while en route {{to meet with the}} Russians. During the Second Boer War, Burnham and Duquesne were each under orders to assassinate the other, {{but it was not until}} 1910 that the two men first met while both were in Washington, D.C., separately lobbying <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a bill in favor of the importation of African game animals into the United States (H.R. 23621). Duquesne was twice arrested by the FBI and in 1942 he and 32 other Nazi agents (the Duquesne Spy Ring) were jailed for espionage in the largest spy ring conviction in U.S. history.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, talk {{started on the}} {{construction}} of a bridge to cross the Mississippi River at Greenville. In 1936, a group called the Arkansas-Mississippi-Alabama US 82 Association was formed to raise funds for the bridge. In 1937, Milton C. Smith (the mayor at that time) worked with John A. Fox, (the secretary of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce), to get <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a law authorizing the bridge. The bill authorizing the bridge was signed into law in August 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1938, Smith applied for money from the Works Progress Administration to fund the estimated $4.5 million it would take to build the bridge. The Works Progress Administration agreed to the proposal in September 1938, and construction started on the bridge a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{called for}} <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> {{legislation}} reforming {{health care in}} the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E
5|$|On March 29, Confederate {{president}} Jefferson Davis {{called on}} the Confederate <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a conscription bill. The bill would require a three-year term of service for all able-bodied white men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35. At first, the bill was unpopular, but as the military situation grew more desperate for the Confederacy, both houses quickly passed it. Still, the measure caused some to question Davis' military decisions; among them was Burnett, usually one of Davis' staunchest allies. In an April 19, 1862 address to the legislature, Burnett denounced Davis' preference for those who were, like Davis himself, graduates of West Point. The speech drew such a vigorous positive response from the gallery that some of the most zealous had to be removed.|$|E

The House proposed and passed H.J.Res 59, a continuing resolution, which included a provision to defund the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACS or [...] "Obamacare"). [...] The Senate removed that provision every time it was added, and the two sides were unable to agree on a resolution, thus the government shut down.|$|R

5|$|Rather than become president, Noriega {{preferred}} to remain behind the scenes, {{and avoid the}} public scrutiny {{that came with the}} post. He did not have a particular social or economic ideology, and used military nationalism to unify his supporters. The Partido Revolucionario Democrático (Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD), which had been established by Torrijos, was used by Noriega as a political front for the National Guard. Noriega compelled the Panamanian <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Law 20, which was supposedly aimed at protecting the Panama Canal from communists, and allowed a huge influx of U.S. weapons to the Panamanian military. The law also tripled the size of the military forces, and gave the National Guard control over immigration, customs, commercial transportation, railroads, and airports. Noriega's period in power saw significant capital flight from Panama; according to Kempe, this was at least in part because wealthy individuals worried their wealth would be seized by Noriega's administration.|$|E
5|$|American negotiators soon {{concluded}} a reciprocity treaty with France, {{and the two}} nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism. The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy, Edward O. Wolcott, {{that he would be}} amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy's Executive Council there agreed. News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard. Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> such a law, and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.|$|E
5|$|The Act was {{implemented}} by the NRA and the Public Works Administration (PWA). Very large numbers of regulations were generated under the authority granted to the NRA by the Act, {{which led to a}} significant loss of political support for Roosevelt and the New Deal. The NIRA was set to expire in June 1935, but in a major constitutional ruling the U.S. Supreme Court held Title I of the Act unconstitutional on May 27, 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). The National Industrial Recovery Act is widely considered a policy failure, both in the 1930s and by historians today. Disputes over the reasons for this failure continue. Among the suggested causes are that the Act promoted economically harmful monopolies, that the Act lacked critical support from the business community, and that it was poorly administered. The Act encouraged union organizing, which led to significant labor unrest. The NIRA had no mechanisms for handling these problems, which led <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. The Act was also a major force behind a major modification of the law criminalizing making false statements.|$|E
