5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>television,</b> used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E

The trial was held at the Beit Ha'am (today known as the Gerard Behar Center), an auditorium in central Jerusalem. Eichmann sat inside a bulletproof glass booth to protect him from assassination attempts. The building was modified to allow journalists to watch the trial on <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>television,</b> and 750 seats were available in the auditorium itself.

Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>television</b> monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E
5|$|This {{all changed}} {{when a new}} regime, chaired by David Holmes, took control of Rangers in 1986. Graeme Souness was {{appointed}} player–manager, while several English stars, including Terry Butcher and Chris Woods, were signed. Season ticket sales rose from 7,000 in 1986 to over 30,000 in the 1990s, while commercial income increased from £239,000 in 1986 to over £2 million in 1989. The introduction of computerised ticketing, zonal public address systems and <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>television</b> for monitoring turnstile areas meant that Ibrox was {{at the forefront of}} stadium management. Rangers also adopted the American technique of analysing the types of fans in each area of the stadium and adjusted their food stalls accordingly.

5|$|Oxford Street changed {{character}} from residential to retail {{towards the end}} of the 19th century. Drapers, cobblers and furniture stores began to appear on the street, and were later expanded into the first department stores. Street vendors began to sell tourist souvenirs on the street during this time. A plan of Oxford Street in Tallis's London Street Views, published in the late 1830s, remarks that almost all the street, save for the far western end, was primarily retail. John Lewis started in 1864 as a small shop at No.132, while Selfridges opened on 15 March 1909 at No.400. Most of the southern side of Oxford Street west of Davies Street was completely rebuilt between 1865 and 1890, allowing a more uniform freehold ownership. By the 1930s, the street was almost entirely retail, a position that remains today. However, unlike nearby streets such as Bond Street and Park Lane, there remained a seedy element including street traders and prostitutes. Aside from a number of fixed places on the street, there are no provisions for selling licensed goods on Oxford Street. The advent of <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>television</b> has reduced the attraction of the area to scam artists and illegal street traders.|$|E

40|$|Magnification can be {{provided}} to assist those with visual impairment {{to make the best}} use of remaining vision. Electronic transverse magnification of an object was first conceived for use in low vision in the late 1950 s, but has developed slowly and is not extensively prescribed because of its relatively high cost and lack of portability. Electronic devices providing transverse magnification have been termed <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>televisions</b> (CCTVs) because of the direct cable link between the camera imaging system and monitor viewing system, but this description generally refers to surveillance devices and does not indicate the provision of features such as magnification and contrast enhancement. Therefore, the term Electronic Vision Enhancement Systems (EVES) is proposed to better distinguish and describe such devices. This paper reviews current knowledge on EVES for the visually impaired in terms of: classification; hardware and software (development of technology, magnification and field-of-view, contrast and image enhancement); user aspects (users and usage, reading speed and duration, and training); and potential future development of EVES. © 2003 The College of Optometrists...|$|R
