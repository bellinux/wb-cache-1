50|$|In baseball, a cutter, or cut fastball, {{is a type}} of fastball which breaks {{slightly}} {{toward the}} pitcher's glove side as it reaches home plate. This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a fastball, as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more motion than a typical fastball. Some pitchers use a cutter as a way to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs. A common technique used to throw a cutter is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand. When a batter is able to hit a <b>cutter</b> <b>pitch,</b> it often results in soft contact and an easy out, due to the pitch's movement keeping the ball away from the bat's sweet spot. The cutter is typically 2-5 mph slower than a pitcher's four-seam fastball. In 2010, the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 mph; the average four-seamer was 92.1 mph.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the EPICA Dronning Maud Land (East Antarctica) deep {{drilling}} operation. Starting with the scientific questions {{that led to the}} outline of the EPICA project, we introduce the setting of sister drillings at NorthGRIP and EPICA Dome C within the European ice-coring community. The progress of the drilling operation is described within the context of three parallel, deep-drilling operations, the problems that occurred and the solutions we developed. Modified procedures are described, such as the monitoring of penetration rate via cable weight rather than motor torque, and modifications to the system (e. g. closing the openings {{at the lower end of}} the outer barrel to reduce the risk of immersing the drill in highly concentrated chip suspension). Parameters of the drilling (e. g. corebreak force, <b>cutter</b> <b>pitch,</b> chips balance, liquid level, core production rate and piece number) are discussed. We also review the operational mode, particularly in the context of achieved core length and piece length, which have to be optimized for drilling efficiency and core quality respectively. We conclude with recommendations addressing the design of the chip-collection openings and strictly limiting the cable-load drop with respect to the load at the start of the run...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that {{variable}} <b>pitch</b> <b>cutters</b> may improve stability of a given milling operation. Several methods are known for tuning the consecutive pitch angles to approach idealistic phase shift on regeneration. Most of the tuning procedures are based on the measurement of the chatter frequency. However, these design procedures completely disregard the effect of the harmonics of the milling process. In this study, the efficiency of these methods is verified in milling for an interrupted cutting engagement. The critical analysis of different tuning methodologies are carried out by means of accurate stability charts constructed with semi-discretization. It is shown that the effectiveness of tuning can be improved further with numerical optimization techniques...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that {{regenerative}} effect, which causes self-excited chatter vibration, can be suppressed in many cases by utilizing irregular pitch tools. In order to suppress the regenerative effect sufficiently, a suitable combination of irregular pitch angles needs to be designed. Although the past researches proposed a basic idea to design irregular pitch angles for the regeneration suppression, they are only applicable to the suppression of single-mode regeneration. The present study proposes a novel design method of irregular <b>pitch</b> <b>cutters,</b> which ensures the simultaneous suppression of multi-mode regenerations. In order to quantify the regenerative effect, a new parameter called as the “Regeneration Factor” is proposed. The effect of pitch angles designed by the proposed method on chatter suppression is investigated analytically, and its validity is verified...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of machining chatter may undermine the workpiece surface quality, accelerate the tool wear, and even result in serious {{damage to the}} machine tools. Consequently, it is of great importance to predict and eliminate the presence of such unstable and detrimental vibration. In this paper, we present an extended Adams-Moulton-based method for the stability prediction of milling processes with multiple delays. Taking the nonuniform <b>pitch</b> <b>cutters</b> or the tool runout into account, the regenerative chatter for milling operations can be formulated as delay differential equations with multiple delays. The dynamics model for milling regenerative chatter is rewritten in the state-space form. Dividing the spindle rotation period equally into small time intervals, the delay terms are approximated by Lagrange interpolation polynomials, and the Adams-Moulton method is adopted to construct the Floquet transition matrix. On this basis, the milling stability {{can be derived from}} the spectral radius of the transition matrix based on Floquet theory. The calculation efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm are verified through making comparisons with the semidiscretization method (SDM) and the enhanced multistage homotopy perturbation method (EMHPM).

5000|$|The {{history of}} milling cutters is intimately {{bound up with}} that of milling machines. Milling evolved from rotary filing, {{so there is a}} {{continuum}} of development between the earliest milling cutters known, such as that of Jacques de Vaucanson from about the 1760s or 1770s, through the cutters of the milling pioneers of the 1810s through 1850s (Whitney, North, Johnson, Nasmyth, and others), to the cutters developed by Joseph R. Brown of Brown & Sharpe in the 1860s, which were regarded as a break from the past for their large step forward in tooth coarseness and for the geometry that could take successive sharpenings without losing the clearance (rake, side rake, and so on). De Vries (1910) reported, [...] "This revolution in the science of milling cutters took place in the States about the year 1870, and became generally known in Europe during the Exhibition in Vienna in 1873. However strange it may seem now that this type of cutter has been universally adopted and its undeniable superiority to the old European type is no longer doubted, it was regarded very distrustfully and European experts were very reserved in expressing their judgment. Even we ourselves can remember that after the coarse <b>pitched</b> <b>cutter</b> had been introduced, certain very clever and otherwise shrewd experts and engineers regarded the new cutting tool with many a shake of the head. When, however, the Worlds Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, exhibited to European experts a universal and many-sided application of the coarse <b>pitched</b> milling <b>cutter</b> which exceeded even the most sanguine expectations, the most far-seeing engineers were then convinced of the immense advantages which the application of the new type opened up for the metalworking industry, and from that time onwards the American type advanced, slowly at first, but later on with rapid strides".|$|R
40|$|Excessive noise {{generation}} often occurs during the face-milling of thin-walled aluminum workpieces. It {{has been suggested}} that such noise can be reduced by utilizing milling cutters which employ non-uniform insert pitch. This report presents the results of a test series undertaken to determine the noise reduction potential of four different non-uniform insert <b>pitch</b> <b>cutters</b> used to machine the engine mounting face of an aluminum transmission housing. The tests were performed using the actual high volume, transfer-line machinery. It is shown that the use of non-uniform insert pitch does not necessarily reduce overall {{noise generation}}. There is, however, often a reduction in noisiness. To better understand the structural response of the workpiece a complete modal analysis is performed. In addition, noise frequency response functions are generated and are shown to form a basis on which to predict the noise radiation characteristics of the workpiece. A hybrid digital-analog computing system is developed and then used to simulate the workpiece response and to demonstrate the influence of various parameters such as forcing function definition, natural frequency, damping, and width of cut on system response. A more realistic forcing function definition, than the often used force impulse model, is developed. It is subsequently shown that significant differences in workpiece response occur for excitations based on these two models. It is also demonstrated that variation in width of cut has a significant influence on the forcing function definition. Several techniques for improving 2 ̆ 2 quiet cutter 2 ̆ 2 design strategies are illustrated. In particular, a technique of sectoring the workface into sections with constant 2 ̆ 2 effective 2 ̆ 2 width of cut is described. Such an approach permits the width of cut variation to be accounted for in a relatively simple manner. It is also shown that noise frequency response functions, when used in conjunction with a realistic model of insert engagement forces, allow prediction of workpiece noise emission characteristics as a function of cutter location.

40|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{manufacturing}} industry, the limiting factor in obtaining higher material removal rates was 'Chatter', an unstable cutting condition with excessive vibrations. Maximum productivity can only be obtained using the knowledge of the theory of regenerative chatter. In the era of modem manufacturing industry, where the greater quality and productivity are increasingly demanded, especially the requirement to understand and avoid chatter is even greater. The key answering to this challenge is to increase the rate of material removal while maintaining stable cutting conditions through reducing chatter during machining operations. In this regard, an active vibration absorber can be used to effectively reduce the undesired vibrations of the structure, thereby increasing the border line of chatter stability. However, to date there has been little attention in applying this technique in the application ofmilling chatter suppression, especially for a flexible workpiece. In this thesis, the stability of milling process dynamics is theoretically investigated using the method of semi-discretization. An alternative means of improving stability in milling is also presented by developing the extended method of semi-discretization for the milling systems with variable time delay. This can be used to predict not only the stability but also the chatter frequencies for milling with irregular <b>pitch</b> <b>cutters.</b> Motivated by an interest in practically improving the stability margin in the milling process, a practical and straightforward active vibration control system with acceleration feedback is implemented using a proof-mass actuator. Based on the general framework of virtual passive control, three controller strategies are first demonstrated and evaluated through a laboratory based vibration study, consisting of virtual sky-hook damper, virtual passive absorber and virtual passive-active absorber. TheÃ‚Â· results indicate that virtual passive absorber control could be a simple and robust solution to the application ofmachining chatter reduction. Through the initial study of the theory of regenerative chatter, analytical optimizations of dynamic vibration absorbers are developed for application to chatter suppression. The performance of a virtual passive absorber to suppress workpiece chatter during high speed machining is then experimentally investigated for each tuning scheme, including the virtual sky-hook damper scheme. The results demonstrate that although the performance of the active milling chatter suppression system is limited by the actuator saturation, the chosen control strategy can provide at least a 6 -fold improvement in the workpiece stability using a small actuator.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} subject of {{titanium}} milling and identifies the need for development of titanium milling strategies to address the key process limitations of chatter and tool wear. These subjects are typically studied in isolation and little work has previously been undertaken on titanium milling dynamics. Titanium is often perceived as difficult to machine as the very properties such as high {{strength at high temperature}} and low thermal conductivity that make it an attractive engineering material can cause rapid tool wear and limit process parameters. Titanium alloys are increasingly popular within the aerospace industry due to the high strength to weight ratios and titanium and carbon fibre composites have replaced many steel and aluminium components within aerostructures. Titanium is still seen by many as expensive to process and there is not the same degree of understanding and process optimisation within the machining industry as there is for aluminium and steel alloys. The literature review considers both advances in titanium tool wear mechanisms and research into machining dynamics. From the literature review three research hypotheses are developed around the knowledge gaps pertaining to titanium milling stability and process optimisation. The limitations on milling performance and productivity are considered and three areas are identified where the research could be advanced to improve titanium milling productivity through manipulation of parameters and tool geometry, these areas are pocketing strategies, special tooling geometries and process damping. A method for controlling radial immersion for pocketing strategies is developed and it is proven that through control of parameters and toolpaths that tool life and productivity can be optimised and controlled. A study is then undertaken into the performance and modelling of variable helix end mills to explore the hypothesis that the tools will outperform standard and variable <b>pitch</b> <b>cutters</b> and that the performance can be modelled. As part of the validation process an analysis of the linearity of machine tool dynamics is undertaken and it is demonstrated that under speed and load, spindle and machine tool frequency responses can differ from those measured in the static condition. The final part of the research investigates process damping performance and sensitivity to cutting tool geometry and feed rates. A method for evaluating process damping performance is developed and through optimisation of tool geometry and feed per tooth increases in productivity up to 17 fold are demonstrated. A method is then presented for tuning machine tool dynamics to optimise process damping performance and stabilise sub optimum tooling and machine tools. The three core strands of the thesis are brought together and demonstrated in an aerospace case study. Through application of the techniques developed in the thesis a titanium aerostructural component is machined at the same rates as an equivalent steel component and at less than 50...|$|R
