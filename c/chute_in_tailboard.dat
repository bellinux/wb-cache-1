5000|$|In {{more recent}} decades, {{buildings}} such as Chicago's John Hancock Center, the Chrysler Building, {{and the old}} RCA Building in New York City have shut down their chutes. The reason is the increase of modern mail rooms in the building lobby with associated mail boxes available for the building tenants. There remain, however, about 360 buildings in Chicago with mail chutes, and more than 900 active <b>chutes</b> exist <b>in</b> Manhattan and the Bronx of New York City alone, as well as elsewhere. Since 1997, however, the National Fire Protection Association has banned mail <b>chutes</b> <b>in</b> all new building construction. Buildings currently using mail <b>chutes</b> <b>in</b> New York include the Chanin Building, Trinity Building, Empire State Building, Port Authority Bus Terminal, and in Boston the historic [...] Lenox Hotel in the Back Bay.|$|R

50|$|In 1924, Carl and Minette Dixon {{purchased}} approximately 100 acre {{surrounding a}} 9 acre lake in Rossville, Georgia. They opened {{the park on}} May 30, 1925, entertaining over 5,000 visitors with amenities for boating, fishing, and picnicking. It was named Lake Winnepesaukah in reference to a Native American word that means “bountiful waters” or “beautiful lake of the highlands”. The following year, they opened a 22000 sq ft swimming pool, {{the largest in the}} southeastern United States at the time. Carl Dixon later designed a mill chute attraction which began construction in the winter of 1926 and opened as Boat <b>Chute</b> <b>in</b> 1927. The National Amusement Park Historical Association (NAPHA) considers it the oldest operating mill <b>chute</b> <b>in</b> the United States.|$|R

Lord Eccles {{returned}} to the government in 1970 when Edward Heath appointed him Paymaster-General and Minister for the Arts, a post he held until 1973. As Minister for the Arts he clashed with the Chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain Arnold Goodman over the funding of controversial plays and exhibitions and introduced mandatory admission charges at public museums and galleries. Lord Eccles was made a Doctor of Science (DSc) in 1966 by Loughborough University. He also received an Honorary Science Doctorate from the University of Bath in 1972.|$|R

Like its smaller co. mpanion, this <b>chute</b> is carved <b>in</b> massive exfoliating granite and terminates at the brink of the glacial U-shaped canyon below.
