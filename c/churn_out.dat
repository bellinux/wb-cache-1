5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to <b>churn</b> <b>out</b> special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might {{be up to the}} task. The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E
25|$|Merezhkovsky's major {{literary}} debut {{came with}} the publication of Poems (1883–1888). It brought the author into the focus of the most favourable critical attention, but – even coupled with Protopop Avvacum, a poetry epic released the same year, could not solve young family's financial problems. Helpfully, Gippius unexpectedly reinvented herself as a prolific fiction writer, starting to <b>churn</b> <b>out</b> novels and novelettes she couldn't later even remember the titles of. Sergey Merezhkovsky's occasional hand-outs also helped the husband and wife to keep their meagre budget afloat.|$|E

Kern was tackled for a loss on the Buckeyes' first drive of the quarter, on fourth down. Michigan got the ball back at the Ohio State 40, and Michigan continued to <b>churn</b> <b>out</b> the yards, getting {{the ball to the}} Buckeye 10. Craw went for it on fourth-and-one and failed, keeping Ohio State in the game. Ohio State's offense went three-and-out, then Michigan drove the ball again to the Buckeye red zone. Craw tried to get a first down again and was once again rebuffed.|$|E

25|$|Hazlitt {{followed}} this by {{many years as}} a literary, art, and theatre critic, at which he enjoyed some success. He was subsequently beset by numerous personal problems, including a failed marriage, illness, insolvency, a disastrous love entanglement {{that led to a}} mental breakdown, and scurrilous attacks by political conservatives, many of them fueled by his indiscreet publication of Liber Amoris, a thinly disguised autobiographical account of his love affair. English society was becoming increasingly prudish, the ensuing scandal effectively destroyed his reputation, and he found it harder than ever to earn a living. He married a second time. Consequently, more than ever in need of money, he was forced to <b>churn</b> <b>out</b> article after article for the periodical press.|$|E

By 1944, more than 1,000 navy personnel were studying at Cal, roughly {{one out of every}} four male Berkeley students. Former secretary of defense Robert McNamara and former Army chief of staff Frederick C. Weyand are both graduates of Cal's ROTC program. With the end of the war and the subsequent rise of student activism, the California Board of Regents succumbed to pressure from the student government and ended compulsory military training at Berkeley in 1962.|$|E
25|$|New England has a {{rich history}} in filmmaking {{dating back to}} the dawn of the motion picture era {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, {{sometimes}} dubbed Hollywood East by film critics. A theater at 547 Washington Street in Boston was the second location to debut a picture projected by the Vitascope, and shortly thereafter several novels were being adapted for the screen and set in New England, including The Scarlet Letter and The House of Seven Gables. The New England region continued to <b>churn</b> <b>out</b> films at a pace above the national average for the duration of the 20th century, including blockbuster hits such as Jaws, Good Will Hunting, and The Departed, all of which won Oscars. The New England area became known for a number of themes that recurred in films made during this era, including the development of yankee characters, smalltown life contrasted with city values, seafaring tales, family secrets, and haunted New England. These themes are rooted in centuries of New England culture and are complemented by the region's diverse natural landscape and architecture, from the Atlantic Ocean and brilliant fall foliage to church steeples and skyscrapers.|$|E

[...] Goldfaden, Grodner, and Goldstein headed first to Botoşani, where they lived in a garret and Goldfaden continued to <b>churn</b> <b>out</b> songs and plays. An initial successful performance of Di Rekruten (The Recruits) in an indoor theater ("with loges!"

500|$|A {{number of}} the top Poverty Row firms consolidated: Sono Art joined another company to create Monogram Pictures early in the decade.

Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature releases in 1938, indicating the studios' relative emphasis on B production (United Artists produced little, focusing on the distribution of prestigious films from independent outfits; Grand National, active 1936–40, occupied an analogous niche on Poverty Row, releasing mostly independent productions): ...|$|E

The Guardian meanwhile, stated that the song [...] "might sound more California than Christmas" [...] but still possesses the [...] "obligatory sleighbells ... shaken throughout".

500|$|From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC {{operated}} {{a de facto}} ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering {{her to be a}} [...] "second-rater" [...] whose work was without literary merit. The children's literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton's books to [...] "slow poison", and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to <b>churn</b> <b>out</b> [...] "mediocre material", noting that [...] "her capacity to do so amounts to genius... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago". Michael Rosen, Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that [...] "I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books." [...] The children's author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the [...] "drip, drip, drip of disapproval" [...] associated with the books. Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, claiming that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from [...] "stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books".|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a positive review, saying [...] "Though not as innovative as her debut, Like a Virgin stands {{as one of}} the most definitive pop artifacts from the indulgent Reagan Era. The mid-tempo ballad 'Shoo-Bee-Doo' and a soulful cover of Rose Royce's 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' proved Madonna could <b>churn</b> <b>out</b> more than just novelty hits, while the sugary 'Angel' and the irresistible 'Dress You Up' contributed to the singer's record-breaking list of consecutive Top 5 hits (16 in all). The retro-infused 'Stay' and the percussive 'Over and Over' are the album's hidden gems." [...] Ed Stevenson from People felt that [...] "Madonna does have a sense of humor, though she is buried under so many layers of self-parody it's hard to tell sometimes... She is backed on this by the reliable rhythmic touch of veteran Nile Rodgers, whose contributions have helped her create a tolerable bit of fluff. Hugo Mistry from Chicago Tribune felt that [...] "Like a Virgin was Madonna's breakthrough, playing off her self-conscious campiness with a series of hot dance tracks, attention-grabbing lyrics and steamy videos." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite these doubts, the {{cornerstone}} of the new church was laid on July 16, 1899, by Archbishop Adélard Langevin of Saint Boniface. [...] Thomas Ennor Julian and H.J. Williams were hired to be the architects, and in just 491 days, the construction was completed. [...] At the time it was finished, the building was praised as [...] "the finest piece of architecture west of Toronto and north of San Francisco." [...] The new Church of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary opened on December 8, 1900 – the Feast of the Immaculate Conception – and was blessed one day later by Archbishop Alexander Christie of Portland, Oregon. [...] By the end of the decade, it became [...] "the most financially important parish" [...] in the archdiocese, since it was the only church that not only could break-even, but could also <b>churn</b> <b>out</b> a surplus. [...] Because of this, Archbishop Timothy Casey wanted to make the church the cathedral for the metropolitan see. [...] The OMI were extremely reluctant to give up their church, and even attempted to give Casey money so that he could buy land elsewhere to build a new cathedral. [...] Nonetheless, the church was elevated to the status of cathedral in 1916, but the Oblates were permitted to remain. [...] The OMI – which administered the parish since 1893 – eventually left in 1927 after difficulties arose from the mortgage agreement that had helped pay for the construction of the cathedral. [...] This was coupled with the [...] "growing manpower shortage" [...] caused by a declining number of members joining the order.|$|E

[...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille never overwhelms, even though it's stocked with action, romance, historical content, family drama and serious statements about the creation of art." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "From the moment Remy enters, crashing, to the final happy fadeout, Ratatouille parades the brio and depth that set Pixar apart from and above other animation studios." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first one that made me positively desire one." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Had Bird gone the safe route, he would have robbed us of a great new cartoon figure in Remy, who {{like the rest of the}} film is rendered with animation that is at once fanciful and life-like.
