[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 İnşaat proje yönetimi anlayışının temelleri, 19. yüzyıl sonlarında ABD’de (Amerika Birleşik Devletleri) inşa edilen büyük ölçekli devlet projeleri sayesinde şekillenmeye başlamış ve sonra “Gantt Tablosu” ile iş programı konusunda büyük adımlar atılmıştır. 1950 ’li yıllar ise CPM ve PERT yöntemlerinin keşfedilmesiyle modern inşaat proje yönetimi kavramının miladı olmuştur. Türkiye’de ise 1960 ’lı ve 1970 ’li yıllardan sonra ise bu konuyla ilgili uygulamalar başlamıştır. Bu tez çalışması kapsamında, Türkiye’de faaliyet gösteren inşaat proje yönetim firmaları arasından toplam inşaat alanı 3 milyon m 2 veya üzerinde olan projelerde inşaat proje yönetim hizmet vermiş firma olan veya en az bir adet uluslararası projede yer almış olan veya bünyesinde 50 veya üzerinde çalışan bulunduran inşaat proje yönetim firmalarından 25 tanesi ile görüşülmüş ve araştırmaya katılmayı kabul etmiş 18 firmaya e-posta veya yüz yüze görüşme yoluyla anket uygulanmıştır. Bu firmalara uygulanan anket çalışması, çoktan seçmeli sorular, derecelendirme yöntemi ile cevaplanan sorular ve açık uçlu sorular içermiştir. Bu sorulardan elde edilen verilere göre sonuçlar analiz edilmiştir. Bu doğrultuda, Türkiye’deki inşaat proje yönetimi alanında hizmet veren inşaat proje yönetim firmalarının özellikleri, verdikleri hizmetler, yerli ve yabancı yatırımcıların proje yönetimi algısı ve Türk inşaat sektörünün genel durumu tespit edilmiştir. Tez çalışmasının sonucunda, Türkiye’deki inşaat proje yönetim kültürünün henüz oturmadığı ulaşılan en önemli sonuç olmuştur. Türkiye’de inşaat proje yönetimi ile ilgili bir standardın eksikliği Türkiye’deki inşaat proje yönetimi firmalarının karşılaştığı en büyük sorun olarak sunulmuştur. İnşaat proje yönetimi ile ilgili düzenlemelerin ve organizasyonların olmayışı inşaat proje yönetimi sektöründe karşılaşılan bir diğer eksiklik olarak gösterilmiştir. Yerli yatırımcıların inşaat proje yönetimi konusunda önemli eksiklikleri olduğu ve bu konuda farkındalık sahibi olmadıkları sonucuna ulaşılmıştır. Üniversitelerdeki inşaat proje yönetimi ile ilgili derslerin ağırlıkları ve sayısı Türkiye’deki inşaat proje yönetimi algısındaki eksikliklerin sebeplerinden birisi olarak gösterilmiştir. Bu çalışma, Türkiye’deki inşaat proje yönetimi sektörüyle ilişkisi olan öğrencilerin, akademisyenlerin, inşaat proje yönetimi firmalarının ve inşaat proje yönetimi hizmeti alan yatırımcıların Türkiye inşaat proje yönetimi sektörünün durumu konusunda bilgilendirilmesini sağlayacaktır. Bu da, Türkiye inşaat proje yönetimi sektörünün gelişmesine katkı sağlayacaktır. Thanks to {{large-scale}} government projects, {{the fundamentals}} of <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> understanding began to take form in the late 19 th century in the USA. With the discovery of “Gantt Chart”, there have been huge progresses about project schedules. The 1950 s {{marked the beginning of}} the modern project management era. Two mathematical project-scheduling models were developed: CPM and PERT. In Turkey, applications and practices that consist CPM and PERT models began after 1960 s and 1970 s. In this thesis, the properties of <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies that have operations in Turkey and the services that these companies give are determined. The <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> perceptions of <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies’ representatives are examined and a field research (Survey) on the construction industry is done. The companies that take place in the thesis are chosen from the <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies that provided <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> services in medium-scaled or large-scaled construction projects (Construction area of projects are 3 million square-meters or more) or involved in at least one or more international construction projects or have at least 50 full-time employees. The number of these selected companies which have operations in Turkey were 25. 18 of them accepted to participate in the thesis. They are reached through e-mails or phone. The survey took place between March 2014 and August 2014. 9 of these companies accepted to participate in the survey by e-mail and face-to-face meetings are done with the other 9 companies. The representatives of the companies were achitects or civil engineers. The questions of the survey that this research consists, are prepared with deep literature scan. After that, questions are presented to a <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> company representative. With his help, questions are updated. Then two meetings were organized with other <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> representatives and clarity of questions are tested. At last, the <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> company representative who reviewed the questions at the beginning, examined the questions again and the final state of questions are formed. Generally, the survey investigates the services of <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies that have operations in Turkey, the differences between the understanding of Turkish <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> sector and the global <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> sector, main criterion of selection of Turkish or foreign <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies and the reasons of participation of <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies in <b>construction</b> projects. The survey consists of multiple-choice questions, questions that are answered with rating method and open-ended questions. Multiple-choice questions and Likert scale-based questions that are answered with rating method are provided to analyze the answers normatively. Open-ended questions are provided to get the opinions and detections of the sector professionals. With the help of open-ended questions, it is aimed to illustrate the construction industry and its objectives. There are 22 questions in the survey and the general topics of the questions are general information of the <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies, the services that the <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies perform, the perception of the local and foreign <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies and the situation of the Turkish construction industry. Within this concept, in the first section of the thesis, introduction is presented. After that, the purpose, the scope and the organization of the thesis and the methods that are used in the thesis are given. General topics and the criterion of the selection of companies are explained. In section two, previous international and national researchs that are related to <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> are given. In addition, the differences between those researchs and this thesis are presented. The difference between international researchs and this thesis are presented pretty clear. In the international researchs section, some of the research were about the <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> fields of different countries and regions and some of the researchs were about specific topics in the <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> field such as concurrent engineering or quality management. The main difference between the national researchs and this thesis is actuality. All of the researchs that are presented in national research section are out of date. In third section of the thesis, the concept and history of contruction project management are given. Project, construction project and <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> terms are defined. Project management (General), cost management, time management, quality management, contract administration and safety management are described. Moreover, the term “standard” and <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> standards are described. The definitions of the standards are made and the contents of these standards (Integration management, scope management, time management, cost management, quality management, human resources management, communication management, risk management, procurement management and project stakeholder management) are indicated according to PMBOK. In section four, the field research on the detection of profiles of <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies that have operations in Turkey is presented. The objective, the concept and the methods of the research are given. The answers that the companies gave are introduced. In addition, criticism of the survey is made. In section five results and recommendations are given. The most important result of this thesis is that Turkey is new at <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> and <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> culture is not recognised properly. The results show that, companies that participated in the survey present the main functions of constrution project management such as project management (General), cost management, time management and quality management, but their customers (Investors) reorganise the services as they want and intervene in the concepts of the services. Other important result is the absence of <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> standards in Turkey. As the results show, <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies that have operations in Turkey have difficulties in performing the services that they offer without the <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> standards. Another important result about the Turkish <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> industry is the absence of arrangement and organizations about the <b>construction</b> project <b>management.</b> The perception of local investors and the negative effects of it is also considered in the results of this research. Numbers of lectures about <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> in graduate and undergraduate programmes in Turkey are also reached as one of the main problems of underdevelopment of Turkish <b>construction</b> project <b>management.</b> The aim of this thesis is to inform the students, academists, <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies and investors who get services from <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> companies, about the situation of Turkey’s <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> sector. By this means, Turkish <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> sector will develop and get more and more productive. This thesis will help both the new companies and the existing companies in the <b>construction</b> project <b>management</b> sector in Turkey. Existing companies can learn the insufficiencies of the sector and can have awareness about their situation. New companies can find their way by tracking the negative and the positive sides of the sector. On the other hand, with this thesis, the absence of up-to-date academic study is overcome. In this research, the field research is conducted only in construction project managent companies’ perspective. Future work can be done in investors’ perspective. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
