5|$|Among the Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest of America, {{earrings}} were {{a sign of}} nobility and wealth, as {{the placement}} of each earring on a <b>child</b> <b>had</b> to be purchased at an expensive potlatch.

All genes from Neanderthals in the current human population are descended from Neanderthal fathers and human mothers.

5|$|On 24 July 1837, Rajendra's {{youngest}} son, Devendra Bikram Shah, {{an infant}} of six months, died suddenly. It {{was at once}} rumored that the <b>child</b> <b>had</b> died of poison intended for his mother the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi: given at the instigation of Bhimsen, or someone of his party. On this charge, Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated. The physicians Ekdev and Eksurya, being Brahmins, were severely tortured but spared, while Bhajuman Baidya was impaled and killed. Under torture, Ekdev confessed, and thus confirmed a widely circulated rumor, that he was directed by Bhimsen to poison not just Devendra, but King Girvan as well.|$|E
5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing <b>child</b> <b>had</b> been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|While {{friendship}} {{patterns and}} the relationship between friendship status and school adjustment have been studied in same-age classrooms, little is known about friendship patterns and the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in mixed-age classrooms. The purposes of the present study were to investigate friendship patterns in a large sample of mixed-age (ungraded) primary classrooms and to examine the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in a smaller subsample of ungraded primary children. Peer acceptance level and age relative to classmates both {{had a significant impact on}} the number of reciprocated friends <b>children</b> <b>had,</b> and on the relative age of their friends. High-accepted and relatively old <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more reciprocated friends than did less accepted and relatively young children. Also, high-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old, and intermediate age friends than did than average- and low-accepted children, and average-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more friends at all relative ages than did low-accepted children. Children who were older in relative age had more friends who were also older in relative age than did children who were intermediate and young in relative age. Intermediate age <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than did relatively young children. Chi square tests of independence revealed that low-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more friends who were young in relative age, and high-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than expected by random pairing, and that relatively young <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively young friends and relatively old <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than expected by random pairing. There were some similarities in friendship patterns between the larger data sample and the school adjustment subsample. Peer acceptance influenced friendship patterns in a similar manner, however, there was no significant effect of relative age. Also, high- and average-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more friends who were young and intermediate in relative age than did relatively young children. High-accepted <b>children</b> also <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than did average and low-accepted children, and average-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than did low-accepted children. Chi-square analysis revealed patterns similar to those in the larger sample; high-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends and low-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively young friends than expected. There was no significant of relative age on the relative age of children 2 ̆ 7 s friends. In the school adjustment subsample, children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math, reading, and science were positively related to math, reading, and science achievement scores. Friendship status was significantly related to children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math and achievement scores. Specifically, if <b>children</b> <b>had</b> at least one friend, they had more positive attitudes toward math and higher average achievement scores. Also, females had more positive attitudes toward math, but not other subjects...|$|R
5|$|In 2009, Adam becomes {{friends with}} Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who {{continuously}} hears a baby crying and finds things supposedly left for her by Sabrina, who is dead. The housekeeper Estella Munoz (Anne Betancourt) is blamed and arrested; however, Adam was secretly gaslighting Ashley. Adam dresses as Sabrina, scares Ashley and she falls down a staircase, {{causing her to}} miscarry her child, whose father is Victor. Adam then blackmails her doctor, Charles Taylor, into telling her that her child was still alive. Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman) is appointed to investigate Adam, who seduces him to divert his attention from Adam's criminal activity. Heather discovers Adam's affair with Rafe and ends her relationship with Adam. Ashley is admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where a pregnant Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) is also staying. Sharon goes into labor and Adam steals her daughter, Faith, and passes her off as Ashley’s child. Sharon believes her <b>child</b> <b>had</b> died, and guilt-ridden, Adam pursues a relationship with Sharon and they elope, but she leaves him when she remembers elements that contradict her losing her child. A note from a dying Charles Taylor saying that Ashley had miscarried and Faith is really Sharon and Nicholas’ daughter is found. Adam is jailed again, but gets the insane Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) to help him escape to attend a masquerade ball, where he unsuccessfully begs Sharon for forgiveness. An explosion at the ball occurs and a burned corpse is positively identified as Adam. Nicholas is arrested for Adam's murder. The corpse is actually that of Richard Hightower, to whom Adam had donated bone marrow and carries Adam's DNA. Adam meets up with Skye Lockhart (Laura Stone) and they plot a confidence trick together, but Adam still dreams of Sharon.|$|E
5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old <b>child</b> <b>had</b> to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E
