5|$|The Hall of Ambassadors ("Sala dos Embaixadores"), {{sometimes}} called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 {{and is one of}} the largest reception rooms in the palace. This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt console table above which are pier glasses adorned with crystal sconces. The throne dais, set in an apse, is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a <b>chequer</b> <b>board</b> pattern of black and white marble tiles.|$|E
5|$|Some of Belton's many {{rooms have}} been altered {{over the last}} 300 years both in use and design. One of the {{principal}} rooms, the Marble Hall (1), {{the first of the}} large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a <b>chequer</b> <b>board</b> patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Chequer</b> <b>Board</b> (1947) : A {{dying man}} looks up three wartime comrades, {{one of which}} sees Burma during Japanese {{occupation}} and in its independence period after the war. The novel contains an interesting discussion of racism in the US and in the US Army stationed in Britain: British townsfolk prefer the company of black soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme is}} the bridging of social barriers such as class (Lonely Road and Landfall), race (The <b>Chequer</b> <b>Board),</b> or religion (Round the Bend). The Australian novels are individual hymns to that country, with subtle disparagement of the mores of the United States (Beyond the Black Stump) and overt antipathy towards the post-World War II socialist government of Shute's native Britain (The Far Country and In the Wet).|$|E

50|$|Lines {{and phrases}} from the poem {{have been used}} as the titles of many {{literary}} works, amongst them Nevil Shute's The <b>Chequer</b> <b>Board,</b> James Michener's The Fires of Spring and Agatha Christie's The Moving Finger; Eugene O'Neill's Ah, Wilderness alludes to the Rubáiyát without being a direct quotation. Allusions to it are frequent in the short stories of O. Henry; Saki's nom-de-plume makes reference to it. The popular 1925 song A Cup of Coffee, A Sandwich, and You, by Billy Rose and Al Dubin, makes reference to the first of the stanzas quoted above.|$|E
5000|$|Checkers or Chequers: often {{derived from}} the coat of arms of a local {{landowner}} (see Chequy), this name and sign originated in ancient Rome when a <b>chequer</b> <b>board</b> indicated that a bar also provided banking services. The checked board {{was used as an}} aid to counting and is the origin of the word exchequer. The last pub to use the older, now American spelling of checker was in Baldock, Hertfordshire, but this closed circa 1990; all pubs now use the modern [...] "q" [...] spelling (but see also Chequers, in Plants and horticulture below).|$|E
5000|$|Following {{a public}} campaign, in 1994 work began on {{restoring}} {{the park to}} its Victorian glory, funded by a £3.3 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, described as: [...] "The jewel in the crown of the city centre regeneration". The Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens were rebuilt, the lake was restored, the bandstand was rebuilt, and the park was re-shaped and adorned with new artworks. A large adventure play area for children was built, to an [...] "Alice Through The Looking Glass Theme" [...] featuring a distorted giant <b>chequer</b> <b>board</b> and giant chess pieces. The park officially re-opened in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|The name Chequers may {{derive from}} an early owner of the manor of Ellesborough in the 12th century, Elias Ostiarius (or de Scaccario). The name [...] "Ostiarius" [...] meant an usher of the Court of the Exchequer and scacchiera means a chess board in Italian. Elias Ostiarius' coat of arms {{included}} the <b>chequer</b> <b>board</b> of the Exchequer, so it is possible the estate is named after his arms and position at court. The house passed through generations of the Scaccario family (spelt many different ways) until {{it seems to have}} passed into the D'Awtrey family, whose name was eventually anglicised to Hawtrey.|$|E
5000|$|In 1393 King Richard II {{created a}} law stating that [...] "Whosoever shall brew ale {{in the town}} with {{intention}} of selling it must hang out a sign, otherwise he shall forfeit his ale." [...] This was to make alehouses easily visible to passing inspectors, borough ale tasters, who would decide {{the quality of the}} ale they provided. The signs were illustrated so as to be identifiable to the mostly illiterate population. The name [...] "The Checkers" [...] or [...] "The Chequers" [...] originated from the design on the pub's sign; the design originated in ancient Rome, where a <b>chequer</b> <b>board</b> indicated that a bar also provided banking services.

40|$|How does nature compute? "So I {{have often}} made the {{hypothesis}} that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement, {{that in the end}} the machinery will be revealed, and the laws {{will turn out to be}} simple, like the <b>chequer</b> <b>board</b> with all its apparent complexities " (Richard Feynman) Could Physics be explained by geometrical and graphical shapes instead of formulas and mathematical statements...|$|E
40|$|Central place theory plays {{a central}} role in {{interpreting}} the special organization of human activities. Simply stated it says there is a breakeven between the advantage of concentrating more and more production and processing and the cost of spreading the products further and further away. The balance between these gains and costs fixes the size of the production units and of their market areas which finally appear as a roughly exagonal <b>chequer</b> <b>board.</b> A critical parameter in the game is the "transportability" of the product. Low transportation costs favour large production units and large captive areas. Hydrogen, with its low transportation costs, as a gas or as LH 2, is ideally suited as an energy vector for very large nuclear or fusion primary energy generators...|$|E
40|$|Gower Street, London, W. C. I, England An {{in vitro}} {{study of the}} {{activity}} of cotrimoxazole against sulphonamide resistant urinary Escherichia coli has been undertaken, using <b>chequer</b> <b>board</b> titration. The results indicate that there is synergy between the sulphonamide and the trimetho-prim. The degree of synergy shown suggests that cotrimoxazole treatment would give better results than treatment with trimethoprim alone in urinary tract infection caused by sulphonamide resistant E. coli. Similar studies undertaken with urinary E. coli resistant both to sulphonamide and to trimethoprim gave two different results. When the trimethoprim resistance was not caused by an R factor, some synergy was demonstrated but its degree was such as to suggest only marginal clinical usefulness in treating such infection with co-trimoxazole. When the resistances were due {{to the presence of}} an R factor, no synergy was demonstrated. The use of cotrimoxazole in the treatment of urinary tract infection caused by R + trimethoprim resistant E. coli cannot be justified...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the performance of an alternative wetting boundary condition for complex geometries in a phase field Lattice Boltzmann scheme, which is {{an alternative to the}} commonly used formulation by Yeomans and coworkers. Though our boundary condition is much simpler in its implementation, all investigated schemes show proper droplet spreading behaviour following the Cox-Voinov law. Still, numerical artefacts like spurious velocities or <b>chequer</b> <b>board</b> effects in the pressure field can be significantly reduced by the use of a two-relaxation-time (TRT) scheme, likewise recent studies by the Yeomans group. The outstanding property of our implementation is the presence of an (artificial) thin wetting layer, which influences the relation between the saturation (S-w) and capillary pressure p(cap) in channels with irregular polygonal cross section. The p(cap) (S-w) relation from our simulation follows the shifted-Young-Laplace (sYL) law, showing that the physics of this wetting layer is similar to precursor films due to Van der Waals forces. With the knowledge of the thickness of the wetting layer, simulation results can be translated back to realistic pore configurations with thinner wetting layers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Research {{into the}} events {{surrounding}} Peter of Verona, a Dominican friar killed on the road between Como and Milan in the Spring of 1252 and canonized {{less than a year}} later, has produced important studies in the last few years, which now allow us to draw a more precise picture. The impression remains, however, that the reconstruction {{of the life of the}} person who was to be venerated as St. Peter the Martyr – both in its hagiographical and historiographical versions, though in opposite senses – is infl uenced by the importance of his destiny post mortem. This paper aims to clarify Peter’s position in the religious and political Milanese <b>chequer</b> <b>board,</b> and more generally, in that of northern Italy in the mid thirteenth century, to shed light on the conspiracy which was to lead to his killing. It also takes into consideration a number of documents, which scholars have so far tended to neglect, regarding the Milanese lay confraternities, whose foundation is made to date back to Peter himself, which appear to shed light on these aspects. The picture which emerges shows a substantial continuity between Peter’s activities in life and the promotion of his cult after his death, in the wider strategies of the Dominican Order and the Papacy...|$|E
