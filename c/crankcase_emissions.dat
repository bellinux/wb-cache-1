40|$|We {{monitored}} two Seattle {{school buses}} {{to quantify the}} buses' self pollution using the dual tracers (DT), lead vehicle (LV), and chemical mass balance (CMB) methods. Each bus drove along a residential route simulating stops, with windows closed or open. Particulate matter (PM) and its constituents were monitored in the bus and from a LV. We collected source samples from the tailpipe and <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> using an on-board dilution tunnel. Concentrations of PM(1), ultrafine particle counts, elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC) were higher on the bus than the LV. The DT method estimated that the tailpipe and the <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> contributed 1. 1 and 6. 8 mug/m(3) of PM(2. 5) inside the bus, respectively, with significantly higher crankcase self pollution (SP) when windows were closed. Approximately two-thirds of in-cabin PM(2. 5) originated from background sources. Using the LV approach, SP estimates from the EC and the active personal DataRAM (pDR) measurements correlated well with the DT estimates for tailpipe and <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions,</b> respectively, although both measurements need further calibration for accurate quantification. CMB results overestimated SP from the DT method but confirmed <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> as the major SP source. We confirmed buses' SP using three independent methods and quantified <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> as the dominant contributo...|$|E

Further use or distribution {{of this paper is}} not permitted without permission from SAE. <b>Crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> are a complex mixture of combustion products and aerosol generated from lubrication oil. The <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> contribute substantially to the total particulate matter (PM) emitted from an engine. Environment legislation demands that either the combustion and <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> are combined to give a total measurement, or the crankcase gases are re-circulated back into the engine. There is a lack of understanding regarding the physical processes that generate crankcase aerosols, with a paucity of information on the size/mass concentrations of particles present in the crankcase. In this study the particulate matter <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> were measured from a fired and motored 4 cylinder compression ignition engine at a range of speeds and crankcase locations. A sequence of sampling equipment was used to characterise the emissions in the size range 5 nm - 19 μm; Cambustion DMS 500 fast particulate spectrometer, TSI Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), TSI™ Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) and, TSI™ Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS). The combination of the two test engines and range of sampling equipment provided new information on the generation and behavior of aerodynamic particulate matter within an engine crankcase. Data is presented for the effect of controlled parameter changes on number distributions over the measured particle size range. A complex lognormal bimodal size distribution of sub micron accumulation mode particles was present in the crankcase of both engines at a low idle speed of 900 rpm. At 1400 rpm this complex distribution was not present. Increasing the engine load, on the fired engine, initially reduced the particle number concentration with a final significant increase in particle number concentration at 75 % load. At 900 rpm 50 % load there was a single strong peak at 32 nm in the rocker cover however sampling from the push rod gallery and sump showed a strongly bimodal distribution with peaks at 32 nm and 133 nm. All other sampling data, from the fired engine, was consistent at each sampling location. The SMPS results, 15 - 665 nm, on the motored engine showed location dependency, with the highest number concentration of particles present in the push rod gallery...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Crankcase ventilation contributes significantly to diesel engine particulate emissions. Future regulations will not only limit the mass of particulate matter, but also the number of particles. Controlling the source of <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> is critical to meeting the perennial legislation. Deficiency {{in the understanding of}} <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> generation and the contribution of lubricating oil has been addressed in detail by the experimental study presented in this thesis. A plethora of high speed laser optical diagnostics techniques have been employed to deduce the main mechanisms of crankcase oil aerosol generation. Novel images have captured oil atomisation and passive oil distribution around the crankcase of an optically accessed, motored, four cylinder, off highway, heavy duty, diesel engine. Rayleigh type ligament breakup of oil films present on the surface of dynamic components, most notably the crankshaft, camshaft and valve rockers generated oil drops below 10 micrometers. Data illustrated not only crankcase oil aerosol generation at source, but it has provided valuable information on methods to control oil aerosol generation and improve oil circuit efficiency. The feasibility of utilising computational fluid dynamics to predict crankcase oil aerosol generation has been successfully assessed using the experimental data. Particle sampling has characterised the <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions</b> from both a fired and motored diesel engine crankcase. The evolution of submicron crankcase particles down to 5 nm has been recorded from both engines, including the isolated contribution of engine oil, at a wide range of engine test points. Results have provided constructive insight into the generation and control of this complex emission. The main mechanism of crankcase oil aerosol generation was found to be crankshaft oil atomisation. This atomisation process has been analysed in detail, involving high speed imaging of primary and satellite drop generation and high speed digital particle image velocity of the crankshaft air flow. A promising mechanism of regulating and controlling crankcase oil aerosol emissions at source has been studied experimentally...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept that}} 100 % {{vegetable}} oil {{cannot be used}} safely in a direct-injection diesel engine {{for long periods of}} time has been stressed by many researchers. Short-term engine tests indicate good potential for vegetable oil fuels. Long-term endurance tests may show serious problems in injector coking, ring sticking, gum formation, and thickening of lubricating oil. These problems are related to the high viscosity and nonvolatility of vegetable oils, which cause inadequate fuel atomization and incomplete combustion. Fuel blending is one method of reducing viscosity. This paper presents the results of an engine test on three fuel blends. Test runs were also made on neat rapeseed oil and diesel fuel as bases for comparison. There were no significant problems with engine operation using these alternative fuels. The test results showed increases in brake thermal efficiency as the amount of rapeseed oil in the blends increases. Reduction of power-output was also noted with increased amount of rapeseed oil in the blends. Test results include data on performance and gaseous <b>emissions.</b> <b>Crankcase</b> oil analyses showed a reduction in viscosity. Friction power was noted to increase as the amount of diesel fuel in the blend increases. ...|$|R
50|$|The Clean Air Act of 1963, which Johnson {{signed into}} law on December 17, was the first federal act {{regarding}} air pollution control. It established a federal program within the U.S. Public Health Service and authorized federal funding for air quality research into techniques for monitoring and controlling air pollution. The act was first amended in 1965, by the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act, which directed the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish and enforce national standards for controlling the emission of pollutants from new motor vehicles and engines. regulations were enacted on March 30, 1966 for <b>crankcase</b> and exhaust <b>emissions</b> beginning with 1968 model year vehicles. This was the federal government’s first active role in clean air policy. In 1967, the Air Quality Act was enacted in order to expand federal government activities {{in the area of}} air pollution reduction. In accordance with this law, enforcement proceedings were initiated in areas subject to interstate air pollution transport. As part of these proceedings, the federal government for the first time conducted extensive ambient monitoring studies and stationary source inspections. The act also authorized expanded studies of air pollutant emission inventories, ambient monitoring techniques, and control techniques.|$|R

40|$|Exposures of {{occupants}} {{in school}} buses to on-road vehicle emissions, including emissions {{from the bus}} itself, can be substantially greater than those in outdoor settings. A dual tracer method was developed and applied to two school buses in Seattle in 2005 to quantify in-cabin fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) concentrations attributable to the buses' diesel engine tailpipe (DPMtp) and crankcase vent (PMck) emissions. The new method avoids the problem of differentiating bus emissions from chemically identical emissions of other vehicles by using a fuel-based organometallic iridium tracer for engine exhaust and by adding deuterated hexatriacontane to engine oil. Source testing results showed consistent PM:tracer ratios for the primary tracer {{for each type of}} emissions. Comparisons of the PM:tracer ratios indicated that there was a small amount of unburned lubricating oil emitted from the tailpipe; however, virtually no diesel fuel combustion products were found in the <b>crankcase</b> <b>emissions.</b> For the limited testing conducted here, although PMck emission rates (averages of 0. 028 and 0. 099 g/km for the two buses) were lower than those from the tailpipe (0. 18 and 0. 14 g/km), in-cabin PMck concentrations averaging 6. 8 microg/m 3 were higher than DPMtp (0. 91 microg/m 3 average). In-cabin DPMtp and PMck concentrations were significantly higher with bus windows closed (1. 4 and 12 microg/m 3, respectively) as compared with open (0. 44 and 1. 3 microg/m 3, respectively). For comparison, average closed- and open-window in-cabin total PM 2. 5 concentrations were 26 and 12 microg/m 3, respectively. Despite the relatively short in-cabin sampling times, very high sensitivities were achieved, with detection limits of 0. 002 microg/m 3 for DPMtp and 0. 05 microg/m 3 for PMc...|$|E
