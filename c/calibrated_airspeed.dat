25|$|<b>Calibrated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (CAS) is {{indicated}} airspeed corrected for instrument errors, position error (due to incorrect pressure at the static port) and installation errors.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft flight instruments, however, don't compute true {{airspeed}} {{as a function}} of groundspeed and windspeed. They use impact and static pressures as well as a temperature input. True airspeed is equivalent airspeed that is corrected for pressure altitude and temperature (which define density). The result is the true physical speed of the aircraft relative to the surrounding body of air. At standard sea level conditions, {{true airspeed}}, <b>calibrated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and equivalent airspeed are all equal.|$|E
25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the <b>calibrated</b> <b>airspeed</b> {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, <b>calibrated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E

25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the <b>calibrated</b> <b>airspeed</b> below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft flight manual of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, they {{have to take into account}} the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E
500|$|Inherent errors {{may fall}} into several categories, each {{affecting}} different instruments. [...] Density errors affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude. [...] This type of error {{is caused by}} variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. [...] A compressibility error can arise because the impact pressure will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube. At standard sea level pressure altitude the calibration equation (see <b>calibrated</b> <b>airspeed)</b> correctly accounts for the compression {{so there is no}} compressibility error at sea level. At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed. A correction may be obtained from a chart. Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above [...] and at airspeeds greater than [...] Hysteresis is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the aneroid capsules located within the instruments. [...] These capsules, used to determine pressure differences, have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape, even though the external forces may have changed. Reversal errors are caused by a false static pressure reading. [...] This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft's pitch. [...] A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction. [...] Reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and vertical speed indicators.|$|E

50|$|The {{pitot tube}} and static port on an {{aircraft}} {{are used to}} determine the airspeed of the aircraft. These two devices are connected to the airspeed indicator, which determines the dynamic pressure of the airflow past the aircraft. Dynamic pressure is the difference between stagnation pressure and static pressure. Bernoulli's principle is used to <b>calibrate</b> the <b>airspeed</b> indicator so that it displays the indicated airspeed appropriate to the dynamic pressure.|$|R
5000|$|... for {{aircraft}} control, CAS (and EAS) {{are the primary}} reference points, since they describe the dynamic pressure acting on aircraft surfaces regardless of density, altitude, wind, and other conditions. EAS {{is used as a}} reference by aircraft designers, but EAS cannot be displayed correctly at varying altitudes by a simple (single capsule) airspeed indicator. CAS is therefore a standard for <b>calibrating</b> the <b>airspeed</b> indicator such that CAS equals EAS at sea level pressure and approximates EAS at higher altitudes.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} of <b>calibrating</b> <b>airspeed</b> installations on airplanes at transonic and supersonic speeds {{by use of}} instrumentation in the airplane only, The method consists in first making a survey of temperature, static pressure, and total pressure over the desired range of altitudes at speeds for which the airspeed calibration is know. The airplane is then flown at speeds for which the calibration is desired through the range of altitude surveyed, and the measurements of temperature, static pressure, and total pressure are repeated. The values of total pressure and indicated temperature at a given instant in the calibration run, together with the temperature recovery factor of the thermometer, define the relation between ambient temperature and static pressure at that instant. Comparison of this relation with that determined from the survey gives the value of free-stream static pressure at that instant. The static-pressure error is then obtained by subtracting the free-stream static pressure from the indicated static pressure. This method requires precise measurements of temperature. An accuracy in the calibration of 1. 0 percent of Mach numibernesr a Mach number of 1. 0 corresponds to au accuracy in the measurement of temperature of Lo F below and 20 F above the tropopause. ...|$|R

40|$|Airspeed is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} how fast an airplane is flying. In flight, airspeed has to be measured very accurately because the safe and efficient operation of an aircraft depends on it. The system (sensors and software) used to measure airspeed is called an air data system. After installation and before its first use, an air data system must be <b>calibrated.</b> Conventionally, <b>airspeed</b> calibrations are done by mounting another calibrated air data system with sensors mounted on long poles jutting out of {{the leading edge of}} the airplane wing or the nose. This calibration procedure is a complex and time-consuming process, which requires expensive and cumbersome equipment. It is not suited for small airplanes such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The aim of this research is to explore ways of using GPS to calibrate air data systems. The main goal of this project was to produce a MATLAB algorithm that relates the accurate GPS velocities to the airspeed measurements on board the UAV in order to <b>calibrate</b> the <b>airspeed</b> sensors on the UAV. It was shown that the MATLAB algorithm produced could determine the errors of the airspeed sensors on the UAV, as well as the wind conditions when the UAV flight test was conducted. The airspeed errors were verified to be correct. The estimates of the wind speeds and directions generated by the MATLAB algorithm generally matched the average wind conditions by the National Weather Service on that day. The creation of this airspeed calibration MATLAB algorithm is definitely a step forward in the airspeed calibration field, because it not only simplifies the whole airspeed calibration process, but also is able to determine the wind conditions encountered by the UAV.
