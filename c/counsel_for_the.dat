5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. <b>Counsel</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. <b>Counsel</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Vacuum Oil Co. explained that it was almost impossible for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E

40|$|AIDS has {{challenged}} {{several aspects of}} contemporary social life and conventional approaches to health care. The social and medical responses to diseases have probably not been challenged so intensely for a long time. One social response to HIV/AIDS that has received much attention is the counselling of people affected by the disease. This paper reviews pertinent issues that must be considered when counselling people who are affected. These are discussed {{from the point of}} view of goals of counselling derived from two different <b>counselling</b> situations: <b>counselling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prevention of transmission that addresses both infected and non-infected people and <b>counselling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> provision of psychological support for those who are affected. Counselling in HIV/AIDS care is unique but there are similarities and differences between counselling in HIV/AIDS care and <b>counselling</b> <b>for</b> general health promotion. Some of the problems associated with HIV/AIDS counselling in Nigeria are presented and some ways of dealing with them are suggested. The meaning of counselling To counsel means ‘to advise, to recommend, to advocate, to exhort, to suggest, to urge...|$|R
5|$|<b>Counsel</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E
5|$|In {{the appeal}} against Prakash J.'s {{judgment}} to the Court of Appeal, also called Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1996), <b>counsel</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> appellants {{argued that the}} restriction placed by the Minister on the importation, sale and distribution of the Jehovah's Witnesses publications was too wide and disproportionate. Applying an approach similar to that taken in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), the Court of Appeal noted that the appellants were essentially seeking to challenge the view taken by the Minister that Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to carry out National Service {{was a threat to}} national security. The Court regarded this as a non-justiciable issue and declined to allow the appellants to bring an application for judicial review of Order No. 405/1995.|$|E
5|$|Miskovsky {{left the}} CIA in 1964, {{and worked for}} the Federal Maritime Commission and the Treasury Department for four years.
