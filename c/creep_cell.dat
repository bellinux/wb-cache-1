In Entandrophragma the changes result from the intrusive growth of a fusiform cell whih repeatedly produces a new pointed tip {{from one side of}} the existing tip which disappears.

When plated onto a {{confluent culture}} of stromal feeder layer, {{a fraction of}} HSCs creep between the gaps (even though the stromal cells are touching each other) and eventually settle between the stromal cells and the substratum (here the dish surface) or trapped in the cellular processes between the stromal cells. Emperipolesis is the in vivo phenomenon in which one cell is completely engulfed into another (e.g. thymocytes into thymic nurse cells); on the other hand, when in vitro, lymphoid lineage <b>cells</b> <b>creep</b> beneath nurse-like <b>cells,</b> the process is called pseudoemperipolesis. This similar phenomenon is more commonly known in the HSC field by the cell culture terminology cobble stone area-forming cells (CAFC), which means areas or clusters of cells look dull cobblestone-like under phase contrast microscopy, {{compared to the other}} HSCs, which are refractile. This happens because the cells that are floating loosely on top of the stromal cells are spherical and thus refractile. However, the <b>cells</b> that <b>creep</b> beneath the stromal cells are flattened and, thus, not refractile. The mechanism of pseudoemperipolesis is only recently coming to light. It may be mediated by interaction through CXCR4 (CD184) the receptor for CXC Chemokines (e.g., SDF1) and α4β1 integrins.|$|R
40|$|Group I allergens are {{the major}} allergens of grass pollen, but their {{biological}} function is unknown.

Extracts of maize pollen possess potent expansin-like activity, as measured in wall extension and wall stress-relaxation assays. This activity is selective for grass cell walls and is, at least partly, due to the action of maize group I allergens. We propose that group I allergens facilitate invasion of the pollen tube into the maternal tissues by loosening the cell walls of the grass stigma and style. Additionally, the presence of related mRNAs in vegetative tissues of rice, Arabidopsis, and soybean implies that allergen homologs may function to loosen walls in growing vegetative tissues as well...|$|R

This paper describes the influence of micro-well geometry and fluid shear stress on cell retention statistics. A 2 -layer PDMS micro-well culture device consisting of flow-cell and micro-well layers was manufactured by soft-lithography. The micro-well layer consisted of an array of 6000 micro-wells that had a diameter of 200 μm and were either 35 -μm or 80 -μm deep. The flow-cell plate separation was 50 μm or 280 μm. The deposition and retention of a KG 1 a cell line in the 4 types of devices were studied under conditions of <b>creeping</b> flow. <b>Cells</b> were injected as a bolus into the device and allowed to sediment into micro-wells under static conditions. Flow was then initiated to determine the retention of cells in the micro-wells at various shear stresses. Cell number in individual micro-wells before and after applied shear stress was counted using large field automated video microscopy. The mean number of retained cells was related to well depth, parallel-plate separation and shear stress. The influence of these parameters on cell retention was described by a multiple linear regression model. At higher shear stress, the cell retention number was Poisson distributed.

In light of cellular viscosity property exhibited by filament actin networks, this study investigates the viscoelasticity alterations of human hepatocellular carcinoma (SMMC- 7721) cell subjected to fullerenol treatment by means of creep tests realized by AFM indentation. An SMMC- 7721 cell was first modeled as a sphere and then a flattened layer with finite thickness. Both Sneddon’s solutions and Dimitriadis model have been modified to adapt for viscoelastic situation, which are used to fit the same indentation depth – time curves obtained by creep tests. We find that the SMMC- 7721 <b>cell’s</b> <b>creep</b> behavior is well described by the two modified models, and the divergence of parameters determined by the two models is justified. By fullerenol treatment, the SMMC- 7721 cell exhibits a significant decrease of elastic modulus and viscosity, which is presumably due to the disruption of actin filaments. This work represents a new attempt to understand the alternation of the viscoelastic properties of cancerous cells under the treatment of fullerenol, which has the significance of comprehensively elucidating the biomechanical effects of anticancer agents (such as fullerenol) on cancer cells...|$|R

In modelingthe creep response of these cells during micropipette aspiration,previous studies have attributed the viscoelastic behavior ofchondrocytes to either intrinsic viscoelasticity of the cytoplasmor to biphasic effects arising from fluid-solid interactionswithin the cell. However, the mechanisms responsible for theviscoelastic behavior of chondrocytes are not fully understoodand may involve {{one or both of}} these phenomena. In this study, the micropipette aspiration experiment was modeledusing a large strain finite element simulation that incorporatedcontact boundary conditions. The cell was modeled using finite strainincompressible and compressible elastic models, a two-modecompressible viscoelastic model, or a biphasic elastic orviscoelastic model. Comparison of the model to the experimentallymeasured response of chondrocytes to a step increase in aspirationpressure showed that a two-mode compressible viscoelastic formulationaccurately captured the creep response of chondrocytes during micropipette aspiration. Similarly, a biphasic two-mode viscoelastic analysis couldpredict all aspects of the <b>cell's</b> <b>creep</b> response to a step aspiration. In contrast, a biphasic elastic formulation was not capable ofpredicting the complete creep response, suggesting that the creepresponse of the chondrocytes under micropipette aspiration ispredominantly due to intrinsic viscoelastic phenomena and is not due to the biphasic behavior...|$|R

To prevent contact loss between {{battery pack}} components and delamination and deformation during battery operation, compressive pressure {{is applied to}} cells in automotive battery modules/packs by way of rigid cell housing within the modules. In this paper, the impact of such compressive pressure on battery degradation is studied. Samples of commercial, 15 Ah LiNiMnCoO 2 /Graphite electrode pouch-type cells were cycled 1200 times under atmospheric, 5 psi and 15 psi compressive loads. After 1200 cycles, the capacity fade for 0, 5 and 15 psi loads was 11. 0 %, 8. 8 % and 8. 4 %, respectively; the corresponding power fade {{was found to be}} 7. 5 %, 39 % and 18 %, respectively, indicating power fade peaks between 0 and 15 psi.

In the existing literature, the population variation of single-cell creep compliance {{has so far been}} modeled universally by using a log-normal distribution. Here we use optical stretching, a non-contact and relatively high-throughput technique for probing cell mechanics, to accumulate a sufficient data set that demonstrates robustly that cell compliance varies according to the similar but distinct gamma distribution. Additionally, we re-examine existing simulations that were originally proposed to justify a log-normal fit, and show that in fact these simulation data also correspond to the gamma distribution. Finally, we propose a general stochastic differential equation that analytically predicts a gamma distribution of <b>creep</b> compliance during <b>cell</b> stretching, as well as the Gaussian distribution of cell recovery that we observe experimentally upon removal of applied load. The population variation is well characterized by just a single parameter in each of the creep and recovery regimes. We expect our correction of a phenomenological distribution fit, enabled by an expansive data set for mesenchymal stem cells, to enable the development of more accurate constitutive laws to describe cytoskeletal deformation. These findings thus serve to replace an empirical distribution with a better-fitting model that rests on a more solid experimental and theoretical foundation, and also provides a basis to predict and understand the stochastic nature of the mechanical response of individual cells within populations.

40|$|Cell wall {{measures}} {{allow for}} direct assessment of wood modification without the adverse effect of varying density and microstructure. In this study, cell wall properties of recent and archeological oak wood from the Vasa shipwreck were investigated for cell wall stiffness, hardness and creep {{with respect to}} effects of chemical degradation, impregnation with a preservation agent, namely polyethylene glycol, and moisture. For this purpose, nanoindentation tests were performed at varying relative humidity, leading to different moisture contents in the wood samples. Concurrently, microstructural and chemical characterization of the material was conducted. Impregnated and untreated recent oak wood showed a softening effect of both moisture and preservation agent at the wood cell wall level. On the contrary, increased stiffness was found for non-impregnated Vasa oak, which {{can be explained by}} aging-related modifications in cell wall components. These effects were counteracted by the softening effect of polyethylene glycol in the impregnated Vasa material, where a lower overall stiffness was measured. The reverse effect of the preservation agent and moisture, namely increased indentation <b>creep</b> of the <b>cell</b> wall material, was revealed. The loss of acetyl groups in the hemicelluloses explained the decreased hygroscopicity of the Vasa oak. In the impregnated Vasa oak, this effect seemed to be partly counteracted by the presence of low-molecular polyethylene glycol contributing to higher hygroscopicity of the cell wall. Thus, the higher overall sorptive capacity of the impregnated Vasa material, with respect to the non-impregnated material, was detected, which has resulted in a sorptive behavior similar to that of recent oak wood. The proposed approach requires only small amounts of material, making it especially suitable for application to precious historical wooden artifacts...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} a structural member is determined by its durability and deformation with time. The bending creep behaviour of modified wood was assessed experimentally {{over a period of}} 35 days (840 hours). Four chemical modification processes were used: 1, 3 -dimethylol- 4, 5 -dihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU), mmethylated melamine formaldehyde resin (MMF), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and amid wax (WA). Wood stakes with 20. 10. 200 mm RTL dimensions of Portuguese Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) from sapwood part of the stem were used for evaluated the primary creep. Experiments were conducted at bending stresses amounting to 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4 of the mean immediate wood bending strength obtained at equilibrium moisture content (EMC). Applying the same stress level (SL, 0. 2), wood creep was also determined at the constant low and high moisture content. As results: Between low and medium SL (8 and 16 N/mm 2), unmodified wood at indoors conditions did not show any effect in the creep factors (kc). However, at high SL (35 N/mm 2) a slight increase (not significant) in the kc was found. It seems that the kc was nearly independent of the SL. In the lumen fill modification (TEOS and wax), the deposited material has not affected the creep behaviour under various SL. The cell wall modification (with DMDHEU and MMF resins) did not show any differences in the kc for low and medium SL (8 and 16 N/mm 2). However, resin modification under high SL (35 N/mm 2) has shown a significant reduction related to unmodified wood. Between both types of resin (DMDHEU and MMF) and levels of modification (WPG), significant effect was not found. At saturated conditions, lumen fill modification (TEOS and wax) did not show any effect on <b>creep.</b> In the <b>cell</b> wall modification (DMDHEU and MMF resin), significant reduction was recorded due to the embrittlement effect imparted by the modification (deposit of resin in the cell wall).

40|$|In Tissue Engineering (TE) applications, it is {{important}} to consider the mechanical properties that are being presented to the cells. Previous studies have shown that variations in substrate compressive modulus (rigidity) can affect a range of cell behaviours including cell spreading, motility, proliferation and differentiation. While these studies focused primarily on the dominant elastic component of a substrate, most matrices surrounding cells in vivo are viscoelastic in nature – that is, they have separable elastic (storage, G`) and viscous (loss, G``) modulus components. This thesis aims to isolate and analyse the effect of the viscous component (i. e. loss modulus) of a substrate on cell behaviour. It was hypothesised that a time dependent dissipation of energy after an initial matrix deformation (or dynamic <b>creep)</b> imposed by <b>cells</b> would influence cell behaviour. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were utilised for the analysis as they have great potential as a cell source in regenerative medicine due to their capacity to self-renew and differentiate towards multiple lineages. Polyacrylamide (PAM), due to its easily tunable properties, was used to develop a platform with which to study the effect of substrate loss modulus on hMSC behaviour. By varying the initial monomer concentrations of bis and acrylamide, a series of gels were produced with a constant storage modulus (G` ~ 4. 7 kPa, representing a constant compressive modulus of ~ 13. 5 kPa) but varying loss moduli over two orders of magnitude (1 - 130 Pa). This platform was then used to test the effect of loss modulus on hMSC behaviours. As substrate loss modulus increased, cell spread area, rate of membrane protrusion, motility and proliferation all increased but the size of focal adhesions decreased. Consistent with the cellular tensegrity model, it was hypothesised that much of the cell behaviour displayed on the high loss modulus (HLM) substrates related to the loss of cytoskeletal tension caused by the inherent creep of the substrates. Inhibitors were used to selectively impair isometric tension (using the non-muscle myosin II inhibitor, Blebbistatin) or both isometric and isotonic tension (using the Rho-Kinase inhibitor, Y- 27632). Blebbistatin treated hMSCs on low loss modulus (LLM) substrates exhibited behaviour similar to untreated hMSCs on HLM substrates. Furthermore, Blebbistatin treatment did not affect the behaviour of hMCSs on the HLM substrates while Y- 27632 had a substantiative effect. This indicated that isotonic tension plays an important role in directing the behaviour of hMSCs on HLM substrates and suggests that any further reduction in isometric tension on these substrates is limited. The effect of dynamic substrate creep on hMSC differentiation was also analysed. While variations in substrate loss modulus did not cause spontaneous differentiation towards osteogenic or adipogenic lineages, hMSCs on HLM substrates showed significantly enhanced differentiation towards both lineages in the presences of soluble induction cues. Furthermore, hMSCs on HLM substrates showed no bias towards either adipogenic or osteogenic lineages when cultured in medium with mixed inductive cues. This demonstrates that rather than directing hMSC differentiation, increasing substrate loss modulus acts to enhance the differentiation induced by soluble cues. The adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs exposed to Blebbistatin and Y- 27632 on the different gels once again indicated that the effect of substrate loss modulus on hMSC behaviour was due to a loss in cytoskeletal tension. Previous studies have shown that the differentiation of hMSCs towards smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is enhanced by increased cell spread area. Given the increased cell spread area on HLM substrates, the effect of substrate loss modulus on SMC differentiation of hMSCs was analysed. Increasing substrate loss modulus was shown to enhance the expression of SMC specific markers within hMSCs in both basal and myogenic media. It was suggested that the increased potential for SMC differentiation on the HLM substrates was due, in part, to the observed increase in expressions of proteins known to promote SMC differentiation. N-Cadherin (N-Cad) expression (which is known to mediate SMC differentiation) was also increased in hMSCs on HLM substrates. It was hypothesised that this would facilitate enhanced SMC differentiation on HLM substrates, in addition to a probable increase in Rac 1 activity (which is known to mediate SMC differentiation and N-Cad expression). In basal medium, inhibition of Rac 1 activity (via the Rac 1 inhibitor, NSC 23766) reduced N-Cad and SMC marker expressions by hMSCs on HLM substrates to levels equivalent to those of untreated hMSCs on LLM substrates. This indicated that increased N-Cad on HLM substrates was due to increased Rac 1 activity, which was supported by the observed translocation of Tiam 1 (a guanine exchange factor responsible for Rac 1 activation) from the nucleus to the periphery of hMSCs on these substrates. In contrast to basal medium, inhibition of Rac 1 activity in hMSCs on HLM substrates in myogenic medium did not result in a decrease of N-Cad expression (unlike those on LLM substrates) suggesting a complex interplay between soluble and mechanical directive cues. Finally, as the majority of previous studies into the effect of substrate mechanical properties on cell behaviour have focused upon substrate rigidity, the effect of substrate rigidity was compared to the effect of substrate loss modulus on SMC differentiation of hMSCs. The enhanced differentiation caused by increasing substrate loss modulus on enhancing SMC differentiation was maintained when the compressive moduli of gels were varied and furthermore, substrate loss modulus was shown to have a greater effect on SMC differentiation than substrate compressive modulus. In these studies we have developed a platform for testing the effect of substrate loss modulus on cell behaviour and shown that it has a significant impact on the behaviour and phenotype of hMSCs. While previous studies into the effect of substrate mechanical properties on cell behaviour have focused primarily on substrate compressive modulus, this thesis highlights the importance of considering the effect of other mechanical properties, namely loss modulus and creep. It is hoped that the information presented here can be used in the future optimisation of biomaterial scaffolds for TE applications, such as those involving blood vessel regeneration...|$|R
