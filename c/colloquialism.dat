His verses approach the popular forms, and his tone approaches a <b>colloquialism,</b> which contributes to the effect of denunciation of everyday vices, of ordinary episodes.|$|E
25|$|Hollywood North is a <b>colloquialism</b> used to {{describe}} film production industries and/or film locations north of its namesake, Hollywood, California.

Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, <b>colloquialism,</b> naturalism, and unnatural contemplation.

500|$|From its inception, {{the coin}} was {{referred}} to as the [...] "Buffalo nickel", reflecting the American <b>colloquialism</b> for the North American bison. As the piece is 75%copper and 25%nickel, prominent numismatist Stuart Mosher objected to the nomenclature in the 1940s, writing that he was [...] "uncertain why it is called a 'Buffalo nickel' although the name is preferable to 'Bison copper'". The numismatic publication with the greatest circulation, Coin World, calls it an Indian head nickel, while R.S. Yeoman's [...] Red Book refers to it as an [...] "Indian Head or Buffalo type".|$|E

500|$|The {{constant}} publicity {{given to}} the debate contributed to a growing distrust of the truthfulness of popular nature writing of the day, and often pitted scientist against writer. The controversy effectively ended when President Theodore Roosevelt publicly sided with Burroughs, publishing his article [...] "Nature Fakers" [...] in the September 1907 issue of Everybody's Magazine. Roosevelt popularized the negative <b>colloquialism</b> by which the controversy would later be known to describe one who purposefully fabricates details about the natural world. The {{definition of the term}} later expanded to include those who depicted nature with excessive sentimentality.|$|E
500|$|Over time, {{the term}} [...] "nature faker" [...] {{began to take}} on a new meaning; rather than {{describing}} someone who purposefully told false stories about animals, it became synonymous with those who overly sentimentalized the natural world. In 1910, journalist and writer Richard Harding Davis published a short story titled [...] "The Nature Faker" [...] in Collier's Weekly, which used the negative <b>colloquialism</b> to refer to the lead character, Herrick, a hapless nature sentimentalist. Animation pioneer John R. Bray also showcased this new definition of [...] "nature faker" [...] while satirizing Roosevelt in two silent cartoons called [...] "Colonel Heeza Liar, Nature Faker" [...] (1915 and 1924).|$|E
500|$|Although {{supporting}} the Conservative Party {{before and after}} that moment, Seara was focusing its efforts on attacking the Conservative-Democratic Party of Take Ionescu, with whom the Conservative Premier Titu Maiorescu had formed a coalition (one resented by Cantacuzino and Bogdan-Pitești). In this context, critic Ion Vianu notes, Seara became [...] "an aggressive publication, {{with a history of}} base attacks and blackmail." [...] The anti-Ionescu discourse was notably outlined in an Arghezi article of September 11, 1913. It collectively and disparagingly identified the Conservative-Democrats (or Takists) as ciocoi ("upstarts"), accusing them of having repressed in blood the 1907 peasant revolt: [...] "They are the symbol of 1907, when, his arms, chest, shoulders and back loaded with ravens, with ciocoi, the peasant tore himself away from his field, split himself, fought to chase them away and [...] fell down murdered by the claws that clutched down, tore down into his flesh and reached inside to his soul and killed it as well. These ciocoi, we will eradicate." [...] In a 1913 issue, Romanian Land Forces General Ștefan Stoica referred to Ionescu's men as craii de Curtea-Veche ("the Old Court rakes"), another <b>colloquialism</b> for [...] "upstarts".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by noted horror author Stephen King. King {{initially}} approached series co-star David Duchovny and {{informed him that}} he loved the show and desired to write an episode. Eventually, he called series creator Chris Carter and expressed his desire to write an episode of Millennium instead. Carter agreed, but once more, King {{changed his mind and}} it was decided that he would write an episode of The X-Files. King sent various drafts to Carter from his home in Maine; the two individuals never actually met one another. King's original story had some issues that Carter rewrote. Carter explained, [...] "Stephen wasn't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [...] the Mulder-and-Scully story in his original draft didn't quite work". Carter separated Mulder and Scully in the finalized draft and helped to finalize the script, hence their dual writing credit on the episode. Kim Manners, the director for the episode, later said, [...] "I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece, and when it was all said and done, there was very little Stephen King left in it. The nuts and bolts were his, but that was really one of Chris' scripts." [...] Unbeknownst to either Carter or King, the word [...] "Chinga" [...] can be considered a vulgar Spanish <b>colloquialism.</b>|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} autocannons became {{available}} and several fighters of the German Luftwaffe and the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service were fitted with 20mm cannon. They {{continued to be}} installed {{as an adjunct to}} machine guns rather than as a replacement, as the rate of fire was still too low and the complete installation too heavy. There was a some debate in the RAF as to whether the greater number of possible rounds being fired from a machine gun, or a smaller number of explosive rounds from a cannon was preferable. Improvements during the war in regards to rate of fire allowed the cannon to displace the machine gun almost entirely. The cannon was more effective against armour so they were increasingly used during the course of World War II, and newer fighters such as the Hawker Tempest usually carried two or four versus the six [...]50 Browning machine guns for US aircraft or eight to twelve M1919 Browning machine guns on British aircraft. The Hispano-Suiza HS.404, Oerlikon 20mm cannon, MG FF, and their numerous variants became among the most widely used autocannon in the war. cannon, as with machine guns, were generally fixed to fire forwards (mounted in the wings, in the nose or fuselage, or in a pannier under either); or were mounted in gun turrets on heavier aircraft. Both the Germans and Japanese mounted cannon to fire upwards and forwards for use against heavy bombers, with the Germans calling guns so-installed Schräge Musik. Schräge Musik derives from the German <b>colloquialism</b> for Jazz Music (the German word schräg literally means slanted or oblique) ...|$|E
500|$|In early March 2010, U.S. Army bomb {{disposal}} expert Master Sergeant Jeffrey Sarver filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against The Hurt Locker. [...] Sarver's lawsuit claimed he used the term [...] "hurt locker" [...] and the phrase [...] "war is a drug" [...] around Boal, that his likeness was used to create the character William James, and that the portrayal of William James defames Sarver. Sarver said he felt [...] "just a little bit hurt, a little bit felt left out" [...] and cheated out of [...] "financial participation" [...] in the film. Sarver claimed he originated {{the title of the}} film; however, the title is a decades-old <b>colloquialism</b> for being injured, as in [...] "they sent him to the hurt locker." [...] It dates back to the Vietnam War where it was one of several phrases meaning [...] "in trouble or at a disadvantage; in bad shape." [...] Boal defended himself to the press, saying [...] "the film is a work of fiction inspired by many people's stories." [...] He said he talked to more than 100 soldiers during his research. Jody Simon, a Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, noted that [...] "soldiers don't have privacy", and that when the military embedded Boal they gave him full permission to use his observations as he saw fit. Summit Entertainment, the producers of the film, said in early March that they hoped for a quick resolution to the suit. In the December 8, 2011, issue of The Hollywood Reporter, it was announced that Master Sergeant Sarver's lawsuit was thrown out by the court, and a federal judge ordered him to pay more than $180,000 in attorney fees.|$|E

500|$|Resident Evil 4, a {{survival}} horror third-person shooter, had its North American premiere on January 11, 2005, and its Japanese release on January 27. Players {{take on the}} role of Leon S. Kennedy, a United States Secret Service agent who has been ordered to rescue the daughter of the President of the United States from a cult in rural hispanophone Europe. The cult has been using a mind-controlling parasite to turn local villagers into violent drones. The game went through numerous changes during its long development—the team created and discarded four prototypes before settling on the final product. Among these was a version directed by Hideki Kamiya that would be turned into the first Devil May Cry game. Taking over directorial duties, Mikami made the fifth and final version very different compared to previous Resident Evil games, with an over-the-shoulder perspective and an increased emphasis on action and combat. Resident Evil 4 was the only game of the five to remain confirmed as a GameCube exclusive; Mikami claimed that he would [...] "cut his own head off" [...] (a Japanese <b>colloquialism</b> for quitting his job) if it were to be released on another platform. However, just two months before the game's January 2005 release, Capcom revealed that a PlayStation 2 port would be published nine months after the GameCube version in response to pressure from users and shareholders. This surprise announcement undercut the title's GameCube sales, which totaled 1.6 million, compared to the sales of the PlayStation 2 version, which exceeded 2 million. Mikami apologized to GameCube fans for failing to uphold his promise of console exclusivity. Despite these corporate conflicts, the game received an overwhelmingly positive critical response with Metacritic scores of 96 for both versions. It went on to sweep many Game of the Year awards for 2005 and is consistently listed among the greatest games of all time.|$|E
500|$|However, not all {{publications}} {{praised the}} new style of Sky Blue Sky. Stylus Magazine editor Ian Cohen criticized the album's {{disregard for the}} [...] "fourth wall", and expressed concern about its dissimilarities to Kicking Television: Live in Chicago. Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian gave the album three stars out of five and said, [...] "On its own terms, Sky Blue Sky succeeds: it's tender, poignant and sumptuously textured, occasionally jolted into fiery life by flaring guitar passages redolent of Neil Young or Television." [...] Now gave it a positive review and stated: [...] "All those self-consciously avant bits of the two previous albums have been ditched along with Jeff Tweedy's laughable lyrical abstractions in favour of tuneful, direct songs that at least seem to carry some emotional weight." [...] Ted Grant of Playlouder gave the album two stars out of five and called it the [...] "blandest and most creatively uninspired record of their career", finding that the album was leading to tame [...] "dad-rock". Pitchfork writer Rob Mitchum also used the [...] "dad-rock" [...] <b>colloquialism,</b> dismissing its straightforwardness and arguing [...] "Tweedy merely {{ended up with the}} wrong personnel to articulate his mood here." [...] Mojo also gave the album three stars out of five, stating that [...] "Many longtime listeners... are sure to be disappointed with the radio-friendly production and sheer innocuousness of [...] lyrics." [...] Andy Gill of Uncut gave the album three stars out of five and called it [...] "a slight disappointment". Billboard gave it an average review and stated: [...] "On first listen, it might seem too derivative, even dull, but Jeff Tweedy's intricate vocal melodies and Nels Cline's ferocious guitar work keep things interesting." [...] Under the Radar gave it five stars out of ten and called it [...] "a very professional but almost inconsequential set... flat and ultimately uninspired." [...] John Walshe of Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said the album was [...] "just too 'nice'." ...|$|E
