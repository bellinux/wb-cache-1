40|$|As {{the world}} gropes for an {{understanding}} of and solutions to poverty, one of its typologies {{that has come to}} the fore is housing poverty. Housing poverty afflicts developing countries in particular, and solving it may bring about solutions to other forms of poverty. One of the strategies {{that can be used to}} promote the understanding of housing poverty, and hence show the way to its reduction, is the decennial <b>census</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing.</b> This essay intends to determine whether the decennial <b>census</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> can be used as a strategy for the reduction of housing poverty in Kenya. It evaluates the whole census business and recommends that some of the missing UN-recommended housing topics be incorporated in order to give a complete picture of housing poverty in the country. It also recommends that the analysis and reporting of the census survey should be more sensitive to the geographical and social extents of housing poverty. This would transform the decennial <b>census</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> into an effective strategy for poverty reduction in Kenya and, for that matter, in any developing country in the world.

The model predicts that the relative price of housing of any two MSAs disproportionately reflects differences in incomes of those MSAs and is independent of housing supply in each MSA. According to the predictions of our calibrated model, the dispersion of rental prices across low- and high- wage MSAs should be larger than we observe: High-wage MSAs like San Francisco are puzzlingly inexpensive relative to low-wage MSAs like Pittsburgh.

Previous literature studies the effect of hypersegregation on housing quality.

Data were drawn from the 1990 <b>Census</b> <b>of</b> <b>Housing</b> and Population at the block group level for Dade County. Two indicators for housing quality were considered: crowding and rent. Six categories for Black areas in Dade County and one residual category were developed for the analysis. Regression 2 ̆ 7 s results show that the effect of each community on housing quality varies. For example, overcrowding goes down in first-ghetto areas when compared to second-ghetto areas, although the percentage of Blacks in both communities is about the same. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} {{seventeen}} years four efforts, nation-wide in scope, {{have been made}} to ascertain the character of housing and housing problems in the United States. In 1930, President Hoover facilitated the first extensive as well as intensive consideration of housing problems through the President’s Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership. The findings and recommendations of his conference committees are available in eleven volumes. After the onset of the depression and its serious effects upon farmers and farm properties, the need for more complete information about the character of farm dwellings became apparent. This need was fulfilled to some degree by The Farm Housing Survey in 1934. The first extensive data about characteristics of and expenditure for housing by families was made available through the Consumer Purchases Study of incomes and expenditures for 1935 - 36. Finally, the need for an even more thorough assessment of the housing conditions under which the nation’s families were living led to the inclusion in the 1940 decennial Census of a set of questions about dwellings. The 1940 <b>Census</b> <b>of</b> <b>Housing</b> provides a larger mass of statistical materials than has ever been compounded previously. The {{purpose of this study is}} to interpret some of the data about farm housing in Nebraska as represented in the 1940 <b>Census</b> <b>of</b> <b>Housing.</b> More specifically, the purpose of the study is three-fold: 1. To develop a brief descriptive picture of the status of farm dwellings in Nebraska as a whole; 2. To represent graphically, by means of maps, some of the relative conditions of farm dwellings in the various counties of the State; 3. To determine the association of the condition of farm dwellings in the counties of the State with some selected economic factors.

40|$|Abstract: Data {{from the}} NIPA {{and from the}} Decennial <b>Census</b> <b>of</b> <b>Housing</b> show that the house-hold {{expenditure}} share on housing is remarkably constant over time and across U. S. metropolitan areas (MSA). Consistent with this fact, we consider a basic frictionless model in which identical households have Cobb-Douglas preferences for consumption and housing. Households choose an MSA in which to live, and MSAs differ in the income residents receive and in quality of life, which is a multiplicative factor in the utility function. Like TFP in macroeconomics, differences across MSAs in quality of life enable us to reconcile observed wages and rents with the predictions of the theory. In equilibrium, given our estimate of the expenditure share on housing at 0. 23, and holding quality of life constant, the difference in log rental prices of two MSA must equal 4. 3 times the dif-ference in log per-capita income. The model provides an exact methodology to estimate MSA-level quality of life. We find that {{quality of life is}} significantly negatively correlated with population...|$|E

We uncover five main results: (a) since 1970, residential land prices have grown faster but (b) have also been twice as volatile as existing home prices; (c) averaged from 1970 to 2003, the nominal stock of residential land under 1 - 4 unit structures accounts for 38 % of {{the market value of}} the housing stock and is equal to 50 % of nominal annual GDP; (d) the real stock of residential land under 1 - 4 unit structures has increased an average of 0. 6 % per year since 1970; and (e) residential investment leads the price of residential land by three quarters. We also estimate that in 2003 :Q 3 the nominal value of the entire stock of residential land is the same as annual GDP.

40|$|Urban areas {{renovation}} {{may lead}} to problematic situations associated with financing of the works in absence of {{a detailed analysis of}} the distribution of resources. An analysis of the needs and the obstacles in achieving buildings refurbishment to improve their energy efficiency must be observed. Buildings requiring energy refurbishment will be those with poor construction quality, not adapted to the new energy efficiency requirements. People with insufficient resources to deal with such actions will inhabit many of them. This paper proposes a model for energy needs assessment at an urban scale with the objective set on the refurbishment of residential buildings neighbourhoods, addressing comfort needs. In this sense, aspects of building energy vulnerability are explored as a prerequisite to the analysis of energy poverty in our cities and neighbourhoods. A methodology to characterize heating needs of urban areas is developed by using statistical data from the Spanish <b>Census</b> <b>of</b> <b>Housing</b> and Population. The superimposition of resulting demand values with demographic data allows introducing socioeconomic criteria in order to locate urban energy efficiency and fuel vulnerability. This information is useful in order to address specific public refurbishment strategies based on the reality of socioeconomic aspects of the neighbourhoods and the state of preservation of buildings...|$|E

40|$|Work in Progress Data {{from the}} NIPA {{and from the}} Decennial <b>Census</b> <b>of</b> <b>Housing</b> show that the {{household}} expenditure share on housing is remarkably constant over time and across metropolitan areas, despite sizeable changes to real rental prices and variation in income. Consistent with this fact, we consider a basic frictionless model in which identical households have Cobb-Douglas preferences for consumption and housing. Households choose an MSA in which to live, and MSAs differ in the income residents receive and in amenities. Equilibrium in the model satisfies the following properties: (1) MSA-level per-capita income and rental prices increase {{at the same rate}} only when per-capita housing is held constant; (2) per-capita housing will not be constant when per-capita incomes increase at different rates across MSAs; (3) this income dispersion leads to disproportionate rent dispersion, that is, given our estimate of the expenditure share on housing of 0. 25, and holding amenities constant, the difference in log rental prices of two MSAs must equal 4 times the difference in log per-capita income; (4) the difference in log rental prices in any two MSAs is independent of the local housing supply in either MSA. The model provides an exact methodology to quantify changes to the MSA-level total stock of housing and MSA-level amenities, much {{in the same way that}} neoclassical growth theory provides a framework to identify changes to TFP given estimates of capital and labor inputs. We find that in the past 24 years, the per-capita and total stock of housing has increased in almost every MSA we consider, and changes to per-capita income and amenities have been nearly perfectly negatively correlated across MSAs. The model raises issues with regard to existing studies of the relationship of house prices, income, and local amenities...|$|E
40|$|Population of the Klang-Langat Extended Metropolitan Region (EMR) is {{changing}} very rapidly. The {{dynamics of the}} EMR population may be explained in several ways including its pattern of distribution, ethnic composition, rate of growth and levels of urbanisation of settlements in the peri-urban areas. This article aims at analysing patterns of population change in terms of distribution and ethnic composition. Elements of natural growth rates, migration and levels of urbanisation of the EMR will be discussed to explain the change. Data from various reports, particularly the <b>census</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> and population of Malaysia for 1957 - 2000 period, were analysed. Results of the analysis show that {{the population of the}} EMR is experiencing a very rapid change in terms of distribution, ethnic compositions, rates of growth and urbanisation. Although the core area of the region is still the most densely populated, there are many evidences to support that the fringe areas of the EMR is experiencing rapid rate growth resulting from natural increase as well as in-migration of people either from the core area or outside the region. After 1990 s the Malays are the majority of population of the EMR followed by the Chinese and Indians. High rates of natural increase and in-migration among the Malays to the EMR particularly the fringe areas, have contributed significantly to the process of urbanisation and rapid growth of small urban centres in the outer zones of the region. It is also found that the rate of growth of population in the core area of the EMR is on the downwards trend. In contrast the rate of growth of population in the fringe areas of the region is steadily increasing. The findings tend to support the view that expansion of an EMR occurs via the process of urbanisation of people living in the fringe zones driven by the development of manufacturing and service activities in the area. Such a pattern of change will certainly have some bearings on the future social, economic, cultural and political milieus of the EMR...|$|E
40|$|In 1970, John S. Adams {{developed}} a descriptive model of residential structure for midwestern cities. The model {{is based on}} the assumption that American residential structure has been shaped during four major transportation eras [...] walking/horsecar, streetcar, recreational auto, and freeway. He suggests that during the walking/horsecar and recreational auto eras, a concentric ring pattern of residential growth prevailed, while during the electric streetcar and freeway eras growth was axial. Testing his model in Minneapolis, Adams came to the conclusion his model fits reality. Other than a map depicting isoage lines for Minneapolis, no quantitative evidence was given to support the validity of the model. This dissertation tests the Adams model in another city Omaha, Nebraska, develops a methodology that permits labeling growth as concentric or axial with some degree of statistical certainty, and assesses the importance of the classical urban models to residential structure. ^ Following Adams model, isoage lines of Omaha 2 ̆ 7 s residential growth are constructed for the census periods from 1920 to 1970. These isoage lines are compared to Omaha 2 ̆ 7 s mean growth rings for the same periods. If deviations of the isoage lines from the mean are within one standard deviation (SD), growth is considered concentric, and if not, growth tends toward being axial. With the mean growth ring as a base, beyond- and behind-the-mean growth ring areas for census periods from 1940 to 1970 are designated and studied further. A series of housing variables available in the U. S. <b>Census</b> <b>of</b> <b>Housing,</b> along with a transportation accessibility index and a topographic indicator (local relief), are collected for each area and analyzed using discriminant analysis. Other data from sources such as address books, newspapers, historical accounts, and personal interviews are also used to study Omaha 2 ̆ 7 s residential structure. Results indicate that the Adams model is a valid approach to conceptualizing American urban structure, and that aspects of the classical models are simultaneously at work shaping residential structure in American cities. ...|$|E
