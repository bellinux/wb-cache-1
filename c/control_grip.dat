40|$|Background. Appropriate {{regulation}} of grip force {{is essential in}} performance of various {{activities of daily living}} such as drinking, eating, but-toning a shirt, and so on. The extent to which individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) are able to regulate grip forces while performing elements of the activities of daily living is largely unknown. Objective. To investigate how individuals with MS <b>control</b> <b>grip</b> force during performance of functional tasks. Methods. This study evaluated the grip force control in selected individuals with MS (n = 9) and healthy control subjects (n = 9) while they performed the task of lifting and placing an instrumented object on a shelf and the task of lifting the object and bringing it close to the mouth to mimic drinking. The grip forces, object acceleration, force ratio, and time lag were recorded and analyzed. Results. The individuals with MS used significantly larger peak grip force and force ratio than control subjects while performing both tasks and for both hands. In addition, the time lag between the peaks of grip and load forces was significantly longer in individuals with MS. Conclusion. The application of excessive grip force could predispose individuals with MS to additional fatigue and musculoskeletal overuse trauma. Rehabilitation protocols for the MS population may need to account for increased levels of grip force applied during the performance of functional tasks...|$|E
40|$|During their life, {{human beings}} {{learn how to}} {{interact}} with their surrounding environment and calibrate their motor system by matching movements and sensory inputs. On Earth, the omnipresence of gravity profoundly affects our everyday actions. For instance, an accelerated hand-held object generates an inertial force that adds to the object’s weight. These two components constitute the tangential load force. Remarkably, humans rarely drop objects, showing their ability to predict this load force by estimating the required normal grip force. However, when gravity is altered, dexterous manipulation becomes much more challenging. By modifying the gravitational forces in parabolic flights, we {{had the opportunity to}} structurally dissociate weight from inertia. We tested the adaptation of internal models that <b>control</b> <b>grip</b> force in various manipulations and in novel dynamic conditions. In rhythmic tasks, we demonstrated that the nervous system finely adjusts the grip controller in function of the physical context. In collisions, participants switched from a well known grip-load force coupling to a new strategy taking into account biomechanical properties of the impact to secure the grasp. Altogether, altered gravity environments allowed us to shed light on mechanisms used by the central nervous system to coordinate gaze, hand and grip motor actions during a variety of tasks that involve transport of an object and interactions with its environment through collisions.

40|$|International audienceNumerous {{studies of}} motor {{learning}} {{have examined the}} adaptation of hand trajectories and grip forces when moving grasped objects with novel dynamics. Such objects initially result in both kinematic and kinetic errors; i. e., mismatches between predicted and actual trajec-tories and between predicted and actual load forces. Here we investigated the contribution of these errors to both trajectory and grip force adaptation. Participants grasped an object with novel dynamics using a precision grip and moved it between two targets. Kinematic errors could be effectively removed using a force channel to constrain hand motion to a straight line. When moving in the channel, participants learned to modulate grip force in synchrony with load force and this learning generalized when movement speed in the channel was doubled. When the channel was removed, these participants continued to effectively modulate grip force but exhibited substantial kinematic errors, equivalent to those seen in participants who did not previously experience the object in the channel. We {{also found that the}} rate of grip force adaptation did not depend on whether the object was initially moved with or without a channel. These results indicate that kinematic errors are necessary for trajectory but not grip force adaptation, and that kinetic errors are sufficient for grip force but not trajectory adaptation. Thus, participants can learn a component of the object's dynamics, used to <b>control</b> <b>grip</b> force, based solely on kinetic errors. However, this knowledge is apparently not accessible or usable for controlling the movement trajectory when the channel is removed...|$|E

Over learning trials, the onset of grip force buildup comes to lead the load force buildup, and the rate-of-rise of grip force, but not load force, scales inversely with the friction of the gripped object.

40|$|Background: Training {{increases}} the functional {{use of an}} upper limb prosthesis, but {{little is known about}} how people learn to use their prosthesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the changes in performance with an upper limb myoelectric prosthesis during practice. The results provide a basis to develop an evidence-based training program. Methods: Thirty-one able-bodied participants took part in an experiment as well as thirty-one age- and gender-matched controls. Participants in the experimental condition, randomly assigned to one of four groups, practiced with a myoelectric simulator for five sessions in a two-weeks period. Group 1 practiced direct grasping, Group 2 practiced indirect grasping, Group 3 practiced fixating, and Group 4 practiced a combination of all three tasks. The Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) was assessed in a pretest, posttest, and two retention tests. Participants in the control condition performed SHAP two times, two weeks apart with no practice in between. Compressible objects were used in the grasping tasks. Changes in end-point kinematics, joint angles, and grip force control, the latter measured by magnitude of object compression, were examined. Results: The experimental groups improved more on SHAP than the control group. Interestingly, the fixation group improved comparable to the other training groups on the SHAP. Improvement in global position of the prosthesis leveled off after three practice sessions, whereas learning to <b>control</b> <b>grip</b> force required more time. The indirect grasping group had the smallest object compression in the beginning and this did not change over time, whereas the direct grasping and the combination group had a decrease in compression over time. Moreover, the indirect grasping group had the smallest grasping time that did not vary over object rigidity, while for the other two groups the grasping time decreased with an increase in object rigidity. Conclusions: A training program should spend more time on learning fine control aspects of the prosthetic hand during rehabilitation. Moreover, training should start with the indirect grasping task that has the best performance, which is probably due to the higher amount of useful information available from the sound hand...|$|E

40|$|Currently <b>grip</b> <b>control</b> during in-hand {{manipulation}} {{is usually}} modeled {{as part of}} a monolithic task, yielding complex controllers based on force control specialized for their situations.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{analyses}} one {{of possibilities}} to use new materials based on polyurethane, polypropylene or silicone having highly adhesive contact surfaces for gripping elements designing. In concrete terms, it {{is a case of}} an alternative approach to the solution of designing standard multi-elements vacuum gripping heads with an active control system (vacuum level <b>control)</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>gripping</b> forces in processes of automatic handling flat objects of the plate type. The aim of this new design solution is to replace individual gripping elements (suction cups) by elements, the surfaces of which coming to the contact with the object handled are provided with adhesion materials. The system minimizing energy demands stemmed from this solution, namely in the way that it decreases or even eliminates the pressure air consumption when combined vacuum-adhesive or only adhesive gripping elements are used. Moreover, it is possible to use the adhesive gripping principle profitably in technological processes susceptible to the environment contamination with airflow when manufacturing new products with many functional layers. Besides a general analysis of problems, the paper presents outputs of laboratory tests. Also a computer model of the contact respecting rheological behaviour of the adhesive material basic matrix is given...|$|R
