40|$|To the Editor: The United States Department ofTransportation {{procedures}} for workplace drug-testing programs authorize {{the collection of}} "split " urine specimens (1). If the split sample method is employed, the donor urinates into a single collection container, and the collection site person, {{in the presence of}} the donor, pours the specimen i to two specimen bottles. The specimens are sealed and shipped to the laboratory for drug testing. The process is designed to produce identical specimens that, upon analysis, would produce quivalent results. For comparison with the split method of collection, we questioned if <b>consecutively</b> <b>collected</b> specimens would differ in drug content between catches. Our working hypothesis was that there would be no difference in drug concentration in <b>consecutively</b> <b>collected</b> specimens. To test his hypothesis, we arranged for subjects who had provided informed consent and were participating in a controlled study of the excretion pattern of cannabinoid metabolites, tocollect sequential urine specimens. The subjects were instructed to begin urine collection, halt micturition when they had produced sufficient volume (approximately 30 mL), change their container, and proceed. Up to four consecutive urine catches were collected at one time. Samples were collected in this manner just prior to smoking marijuana, nd throughout the day following drug administration on three different test days. Th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A major {{marketing}} technique used by pharmaceutical companies is direct-to-physician marketing. This form of marketing frequently employs promotional marketing brochures, based on clinical research, which may influence how a physician prescribes medicines. This study's {{objective was to}} investigate {{whether or not the}} information in promotional brochures presented to physicians by pharmaceutical representatives is accurate, consistent, and valid with respect to the actual studies upon which the promotional brochures are based. Methods Physicians in five clinics were asked to <b>consecutively</b> <b>collect</b> pharmaceutical promotional brochures and to send them all to a centralized location. The brochures for any class of medication were collected on a continuous basis until 20 distinct promotional brochures were received by a central location. Once the brochure was received, the corresponding original study was obtained. Two blinded reviewers performed an evidence-based review of the article, comparing data that was printed on the brochure to what was found in the original study. Results Among the 20 studies, 75 % of the studies were found to be valid, 80 % were funded by the pharmaceutical company, 60 % of the studies and the corresponding brochures presented patient-oriented outcomes, and 40 % were compared to another treatment regimen. Of the 19 brochures that presented the data as graphs, 4 brochures presented a relative risk reduction while only 1 brochure presented an absolute risk reduction. 15 % of the promotional marketing brochures presented data that was different from what was in the original published study. Conclusion Given the present findings, physicians should be cautious about drawing conclusions regarding a medication based on the marketing brochures provided by pharmaceutical companies. </p...|$|R
