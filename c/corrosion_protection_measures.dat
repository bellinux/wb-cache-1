40|$|Aircraft joints feature {{prominently}} in aircraft structural degradation. Fatigue cracking and corrosion damage can reduce joint strength and degrade service life. Corrosion management can include use of paints and sealants and, increasingly, {{the application of}} Corrosion Inhibiting Compounds (CICs) which retard corrosion, by penetrating into crevices and cracks, and displacing water. A combination of coatings and CIC use can provide effective corrosion protection, but both interact - in different ways - with structural performance and overall system durability. This paper discusses the interaction between these two <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> and fatigue performance of joints. The first issue relates {{to a reduction in}} the fatigue life of mechanically-fastened joints after application of CICs (or other lubricants) The lubricating properties of the CICs reduce the friction at the faying surface, which may change the load transfer characteristics of the joint. The paper discusses results from a test program assessing the fatigue life and failure mode of riveted lap joints; the results show a marked reduction in fatigue life for joints containing CICs, and the paper discusses the changes which may be responsible for the reduction. The second issue discussed is the degradation of protective coatings in service. Joints are key locations for coating cracking and failure, since areas such as sheet ends and fastener heads, where displacements are concentrated, will produce concentrated strain in coatings. So far, however, the potential influence of aircraft loading on coating degradation prognostics has received little attention...|$|E

40|$|Vehicle {{bodies are}} {{generally}} constructed from galvanized steel, which, together with phosphate and e-coat paint treatments, ensures corrosion resistance. The {{use of these}} materials alone cannot provide adequate corrosion protection to certain features that are inherent to vehicle body construction but are also vulnerable to corrosion, such as cut edges of panels and creviced joints. The use of further <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> <b>measures,</b> (e. g. sealers, lacquers and waxes), is undesirable because they require additional manufacturing processes, increase weight and reduce recyclability of the vehicle. The potential benefits of using zinc-magnesium alloy coated steel (ZMG) {{as a substitute for}} conventional galvanized steel were investigated in this work. Cyclic corrosion testing in sodium chloride and acid rain- based environments was conducted on panels of ZMG and conventional galvanized steel and the resistance of each material to red rust initiation and propagation was assessed. ZMG offered approximately a 3 -fold improvement in red rust resistance compared to galvanized steel in the sodium chloride test but ZMG's corrosion benefit was attenuated in the acid rain environment. Cyclic corrosion testing was also conducted on painted test panels incorporating geometric features; enhanced edge and crevice corrosion resistance was also observed for panels constructed from ZMG. Corrosion products formed in each environment were characterized using a suite of analysis techniques and mechanisms to explain the enhanced corrosion resistance of ZMG were proposed based on these products and on the literature. An inhibiting corrosion protection mechanism was suggested for ZMG whereby cathodic activity was quenched via the precipitation of insulating, sparingly soluble magnesium hydroxide. Further inhibition of cathodic activity has been attributed to the special oxide layer present at the ZMG surface. The observed efficacy of the corrosion protection mechanisms suggests that ZMG may allow optimization of the - 1 - [...] Abstract vehicle body corrosion protection system for vehicle weight and recyclability targets.

40|$|The {{choice of}} <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> system {{depends on the}} {{environment}} and needed lifetime for the product. The right <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> should be selected in a sustainable point of view, since a well-selected coating system can reduce the environmental and economical impact, by using less and better material. The systems used for classifying <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> often give a passed/not passed result for the number of years it is expected to last in a specific corrosive environment. In the last decades, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has become a popular method for evaluating <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> for organic coatings. EIS can collect quantitative data by monitoring the coatings electrochemical behavior over time, which can be used for optimizing the coating system. The purpose of this thesis was to try to predict how different combinations of coating layers and substrates will perform as a <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection,</b> which could provide information that can optimize the coating process. In this thesis, EIS {{has been used as a}} test method to evaluate organic coating systems for <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection,</b> by looking at barrier properties and adhesion for powder coatings on aluminum substrates. The main part of the coatings were applied in the coating plant at Fagerhult AB, but an external supplier has been used as a reference. The powders used in the coating process were based on polyester resins and the substrates were different aluminum alloys. The EIS measurements were performed in the chemistry lab at the School of Engineering at Jönköping University and depending on the sample setup was each sample evaluated for two or four weeks of testing. Two groups of samples had intact coatings and a third group had samples with an applied defect in the coating. The analysis of sample setups with intact coatings showed that the topcoat absorbed water faster than the primer. The samples showed no significant degradation in <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> for the evaluated period and could thereby not provide enough information to be able to conclude which setup give the best <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> over time. The samples with a defect in the coating indicated that two of the substrates provided similar adhesion in the coating-substrate interface. The coating from the external supplier was also included in the test and it showed the best adhesion of the tested samples. The main conclusion is that the coating system used at Fagerhult AB provides a very good <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection.</b> Longer testing time with EIS measurements on intact coatings is needed to be able to rank the different sample setups by failure of <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection...</b>|$|R
