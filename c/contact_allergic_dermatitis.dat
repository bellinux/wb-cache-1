We present a patient who suffered allergic contact dermatitis to diethylthiourea in a neoprene wader and who required admission to hospital and systemic treatment. We review the literature on allergy to diethylthiourea. Thioureas are not included in the standard GEIDAC (Spanish Contact Dermatitis Research Group) battery of patch tests. In these cases, it is necessary to use a special battery of rubber allergens, which includes thiourea compounds, for diagnosis of the disease and to ensure that cases of <b>contact</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> to thioureas do not go undiagnosed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is a T cell-mediated delayed type {{hypersensitivity}} reaction that occurs upon hapten challenge in sensitized individuals. The inflammatory response in classical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> requires both a sensitization phase and an elicitation phase responsible for the recruitment and activation of specific T cells {{at the site of}} hapten skin challenge. Conversely, previously unsensitized patients may develop a “primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis” after the first skin contact with potent contact sensitizers leading to a skin inflammation with all the features of classical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> In this study we used an experimental murine model, referred to as contact hypersensitivity, to study the pathophysiology of primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and its relationship to classical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> We show that one epicutaneous application of a nonirritant dose of hapten (2, 4 -dini-trofluorobenzene, fluorescein isothiocyanate) was sufficient to induce an optimal <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> reaction at the site of primary contact with the hapten without subsequent challenge. As in classical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> the skin inflammation in primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> was mediated by interferon-γ producing, CD 8 + effector T cells that were induced in the draining lymph nodes at day 5 postsensitization and downregulated by CD 4 + T cells. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> reaction was mediated by a recruitment of CD 8 + T cells at the sensitization skin site at day 6 postsensitization. Analysis of the fate of the hapten fluorescein isothiocyanate applied once on the skin revealed its persistence in the epidermis for up to 14 d after skin painting. These results suggest that the development of primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (i. e., without secondary challenge) is associated with persistence of the hapten in the skin, which allows the recruitment and activation of CD 8 + T cells {{at the site of the}} single hapten application...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Topical {{antibiotics}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} common causes of <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and are frequently used in postoperative wound care. We prospectively followed up patients having cutaneous surgery to determine the frequency of <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> to topical antibiotics used on postoperative wound care. RESULTS: Nine (4. 2 %) of 215 patients who had undergone surgery who were using a topical antibiotic had an eruption develop postoperatively that was consistent with an <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> from the topical antibiotic. Seven of the nine patients agreed to patch testing with the standard tray and selected topical antibiotics. Five patients had a positive patch test to neomycin sulfate and four had a positive patch test to bacitracin. The frequency of <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> proved by patch testing to neomycin and bacitracin is five (5. 3 %) of 94 and four (2 %) of 198, respectively, in the patients who used these antibiotics. All proved sensitivities to bacitracin occurred in patients using a topical antibiotic that also contained neomycin and were patch tested positive to the neomycin. No patients using only pure bacitracin had <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> to a topical antibiotic, especially neomycin, should be considered in any patient who has development of a dermatitis after cutaneous surgery.

Multiple cell types, inflammatory mediators and cytokines {{are involved}} in the regulation of immunologic and inflammatory processes in <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Aloperine is an isolated alkaloid found in the plant of Sophora alopecuroides L. It has been clinically proved effective in China for a long time for skin inflammatory diseases such as <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> However, the mechanism of aloperine on <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is largely unknown. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of aloperine on 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) -induced <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in BALB/c mice and the possible underlying mechanisms. The results showed that topical application of DNFB on the car provoked typical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> with ear swelling and ear erythema in BALB/c mice. Treatments with 1 % aloperine suppressed DNFB-induced increase in ear thickness and ear erythema. Moreover, 1 % aloperine treatment significantly decreased the up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) induced by DNFB in ear biopsy homogenates. Our findings suggest that aloperine greatly improves the DNFB-induced <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in mice. The therapeutic mechanism might be related to the reduction of TNF-alpha, IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 production induced by DNFB. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In this group of disorders, photoallergic contact dermatitis should be accentuated. It manifests as <b>contact</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> on sun-exposed skin areas, following direct contact with photoallergens during UV exposure (predominantly UVA). Under influence of light, photosensitizers get activated, followed by fusion with cutaneous proteins which renders them to complete antigens, and consequential initiation of immunological mechanisms with resulting pathological skin lesions. The most common photoallergens are: sulfonamide antibiotics, phenothiazines, and halogenated salicylanilides. Photoallergic dermatoses are comprised of several disorders, although the causative photoallergen remains unknown (e. g. solar urticaria, polymorphous light eruption and hydroa vacciniforme). Solar urticaria is a rare, acute urticarial reaction on both sun-exposed and covered skin areas, which appears soon after exposure to sun or artificial lighting. Polymorphous light eruption is a relatively common polymorphous skin eruption, which usually appears in spring. Its pathogenesis is unknown, presumably photoallergic reaction.

Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of herbal compound usage in a dermatological out-patient population and to estimate the incidence of consequent cutaneous side effects. Methods: 400 patients were subjected to a self-administered 15 -item questionnaire to assess both prevalence and type of topical botanical preparations used and occurrence of skin adverse reactions. Results: 241 patients (60. 25 %) reported use of natural topical products, predominantly aloe, marigold, chamomile, propolis and arnica.

40|$|In mice, 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) induces <b>contact</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (CAD), which, in a late phase, is {{characterized}} by mast cell (MC) infiltration and angiogenesis. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous anti-inflammatory molecule, acts by down-modulating MCs following activation of the cannabinoid CB 2 receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). We have previously reported the anti-inflammatory effect of PEA in the early stage of CAD. Here, we examined whether PEA reduces {{the features of the}} late stage of CAD including MC activation, angiogenesis and itching. After sensitization to DNFB, female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice underwent to three DNFB challenges at days 5, 12 and 19 and treatments were given at each challenge and for two more days. CAD was expressed as Δ increase in ear thickness between challenged and un-challenged mice. PEA (5 mg/kg/i. p.) reduced: i) the DNFB-induced Δ increase; ii) the number of MCs per tissue area; iii) the expression of VEGF and its receptor Flk- 1. These effects were reversed by co-administration of AM 630 (1 mg/kg/i. p.), a CB 2 antagonist, but not GW 6471 (1 mg/kg/i. p.), a PPAR-α antagonist. Finally, PEA reduced the number of ear scratchings 48 h after DNFB challenge and this effect was reversed by both CB 2 and PPAR-α antagonists, suggesting the involvement of both receptors.

Skin biopsies from allergic (13 cases) and sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritant patch test reactions (13 cases), obtained 1 – 72 [*]h after patch testing, were studied {{by means of an}} in situ hybridization technique. Results of chemokine mRNA expression were correlated with clinical scoring, histology, and immunohistochemical data including the proportion of inflammatory cells expressing CXCR 3, the receptor for IP- 10, Mig, and IP- 9, and ICAM- 1 and HLA-DR expression on keratinocytes. IP- 10, Mig, and IP- 9 mRNA were detected in seven of nine <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> reactions after 24 – 72 [*]h, but not in sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritant contact dermatitis reactions. ICAM- 1 expression by keratinocytes was only found in <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> reactions and correlated with chemokine expression. Moreover, up to 50 % of the infiltrating cells in <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> expressed CXCR 3, in contrast to only 20 % in irritant contact dermatitis reactions. In conclusion, we have demonstrated differences in chemokine expression between <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and irritant contact dermatitis reactions, which might reflect different regulatory mechanisms operating in these diseases and may be an important clue for differentiation between <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and irritant contact dermatitis reactions...|$|R
