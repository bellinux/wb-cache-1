5000|$|Greatly {{simplified}} single-revolution clutches {{were developed}} in the 20th century, requiring much smaller operating forces and in some variations, allowing for a fixed fraction of a revolution per operation. [...] Fast action friction clutches replaced dog clutches in some applications, eliminating the problem of impact loading on the dogs every time the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pulling {{away from}} rest is easily {{achievable}} without pedal assistance {{owing to the}} relatively high torque the motor delivers {{but this is not}} recommended practice as the frail clutch will fail rapidly with this sort of treatment. Pedal assisted starts are therefore much recommended. In fact, engine starting can be done by pedalling away from rest with the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> using the decompressor.|$|R

50|$|When {{the engine}} starts, the car pauses for 11 s - if {{equipped}} with a manual gearbox, 6 s in neutral (with <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged)</b> and 5 s in the 1st gear (with clutch disengaged) - then slowly accelerates to 15 km/h in 4 s, cruises at constant speed for 8 s, brakes to a full stop in 5 s (manual: last 3 s with clutch disengaged), then stops for 21 s (manual: 16 s in neutral, then 5 s in the 1st gear).|$|R
5000|$|The {{underside}} of each link features a small metal finger called a [...] "drive link" [...] (also DL) which locates the chain on the bar, helps to carry lubricating oil around the bar, and engages with the engine's drive sprocket {{inside the body}} of the saw. The engine drives the chain around the track by a centrifugal <b>clutch,</b> <b>engaging</b> the chain as engine speed increases under power, but allowing it to stop as the engine speed slows to idle speed.|$|R
50|$|A manual transmission, {{also known}} as a manual gearbox, stick shift, n-speed manual (where n is its number of forward gear ratios), standard, MT, or in colloquial U.S. English, a stick (for {{vehicles}} with hand-lever shifters), is a type of transmission used in motor vehicle applications. It uses a driver-operated <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> and disengaged by a foot pedal (automobile) or hand lever (motorcycle), for regulating torque transfer from the engine to the transmission; and a gear selector operated by hand (automobile) or by foot (motorcycle).|$|R
50|$|Excessively revving {{the engine}} while using clutch control, or keeping the <b>clutch</b> {{partially}} <b>engaged</b> while accelerating with the gas pedal, can cause unnecessary {{damage to the}} clutch.|$|R
5000|$|Hohenzollern {{supplied}} a [...] {{diesel-mechanical locomotive}} to the Russian State Railways in the 1920s. This had a constant-mesh gearbox {{with an individual}} electromagnetic <b>clutch</b> to <b>engage</b> each gear.|$|R
50|$|At 117 s, the car slowly accelerates to 50 km/h in 26 s (manual: 5 s, 9 s and 8 s in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears, with {{additional}} 2 × 2 s for gear changes), cruises for 12 s, decelerates to 35 km/h in 8 s, cruises for another 13 s, brakes {{to a full}} stop in 12 s (manual: 2 s change to the 2nd gear, 7 s in the 2nd gear, last 3 s with clutch disengaged), then pauses for 7 s (manual: in neutral with <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged).</b>|$|R
50|$|A form of {{differential}} action {{was obtained by}} building each front drive sprocket with a two-way <b>clutch.</b> These <b>clutches</b> <b>engaged</b> when the shaft upon which they were mounted turned in either direction, but disengaged when the wheel turned them faster than the shaft. When driven in a straight line, both <b>clutches</b> would <b>engage,</b> and provide power to both rear wheels. When the car went around a corner, the outside wheel turned slightly faster than the inside wheel, disengaging the sprocket for the outside wheel, and propelling {{the car with the}} inside wheel only. On slippery roads, such as in deep mud, snow, or sand, if one wheel lost traction the other wheel would continue to pull, allowing the car the continue moving until either both wheels found traction once more, or both wheels lost traction completely. Because the cars were very light weight, they were capable of being driven through mud or snow which would immobilize heavier cars with conventional differentials.|$|R
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the shifters is also a matter of design; it need {{not be the case}} that all of the free-rotating gears with selectors are on one shaft, and the permanently splined gears on the other. For instance a five-speed transmission might have the first-to-second selectors on the countershaft, but the third-to-fourth selector and the fifth selector on the mainshaft, which is the configuration in the 1998 Honda Civic. This means that when the car is stopped and idling in neutral with the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> and the input shaft spinning, the third, fourth and fifth gear pairs do not rotate.|$|R
5000|$|A dual-clutch {{transmission}} alternately uses {{two sets}} of internals, {{each with its own}} clutch, so that a [...] "gearchange" [...] actually only consists of one <b>clutch</b> <b>engaging</b> as the other disengages—providing a supposedly [...] "seamless" [...] shift with no break in (or jarring reuptake of) power transmission. Each clutch's attached shaft carries half of the total input gear complement (with a shared output shaft), including synchronised dog clutch systems that pre-select which of its set of ratios is most likely needed at the next shift, under command of a computerised control system. Specific types of this transmission include: Direct-Shift Gearbox.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{fluid pump}} {{driven by a}} combustion engine includes an input shaft which is directly driven by the combustion engine, a pumping unit comprising a pump rotor, and a clutch arranged between the input shaft and the pump rotor. The clutch is provided as a magneto-rheological clutch comprising two clutch bodies, a fluid gap arranged between the two clutch bodies, the fluid gap being filled with a magneto-rheological fluid, and a permanent magnet element which is shiftable between an <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> where a magnetic field penetration flux of the permanent magnet element penetrates the fluid gap with a high magnetic flux, and a disengaged position where the magnetic field penetration flux of the permanent magnet element is less than in the <b>engaged</b> <b>position.</b> An actuator is configured to move the permanent magnet element between the <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> and the disengaged position...|$|R
50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the driven shaft (output), but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction gear on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A {{number of gears}} on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding gears to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate dog <b>clutches</b> instead to <b>engage</b> gears, leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive dog <b>clutch,</b> that gradually <b>engages</b> the gears and matches their speed before the dog <b>clutch</b> <b>engages.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{refers to}} a mechanical combustion-engine-driven fluid pump (10) comprising an input shaft (20) which is directly driven by the combustion engine (12), a pumping unit (18) with a pump rotor (19), and a clutch (16) between the input shaft and the pump rotor, the clutch comprises an input clutch body (24) and an output clutch body (22) and transfers {{the rotation of the}} input clutch body to the output clutch body in the <b>engaged</b> <b>clutch</b> state. The clutch is a combined magneto-rheological eddy-current clutch. The clutch comprises a closed clutch liquid gap (26) between the two clutch bodies, the clutch liquid gap being filled with a magneto-rheological clutch liquid (28), an electroconductive element (50) co-rotating with the output clutch body, and a shiftable permanent magnet element (30) being provided co-rotating with the input clutch body. The shiftable permanent magnet element is shiftable between an <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> wherein the permanent magnet element's magnetic field penetrates the clutch liquid gap with high magnetic flux and the permanent magnet element is close to the electroconductive element, and a disengaged position wherein the magnet element's magnetic field penetration flux in the clutch liquid gap is less than in the <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> and the permanent magnet element is remote from the electroconductive element. An actuator (42) is provided for moving the permanent magnet element between its engaged and its disengaged position...|$|R
50|$|There is {{a cooling}} fan for the {{honeycomb}} radiator and the engine incorporates a pump to ensure the flow of coolant. Lubrication is forced by pump to all the bearings. A float indicator shows the depth {{of oil in the}} crank chamber. Ignition is by High Tension Bosch magneto and may be manually advanced or retarded. The carburettor is by Claudel.The thin steel-cone <b>clutch</b> <b>engages</b> with the Ferodo lined flywheel. The Ferodo linings are in sections which may be replaced individually. The gearbox is suspended at four points. It is operated by a hand lever controlled by a gate and now has four speeds forward and reverse.|$|R
5000|$|Another, {{different}} theme on the {{multiplate clutch}} is the clutches {{used in the}} fastest classes of drag racing, highly specialized, purpose-built cars such as Top Fuel or Funny Cars. These cars are so powerful that to attempt a start with a simple clutch would result in complete loss of traction. To avoid this problem, Top Fuel cars actually use a single, fixed gear ratio, {{and a series of}} <b>clutches</b> that are <b>engaged</b> one at a time, rather than in unison, progressively allowing more power to the wheels. A single one of these clutch plates (as designed) can not hold more than a fraction {{of the power of the}} engine, so the driver starts with only the first <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged.</b> This <b>clutch</b> is overwhelmed by the power of the engine, allowing only a fraction of the power to the wheels, much like [...] "slipping the clutch" [...] in a slower car, but working not requiring concentration from the driver. As speed builds, the driver pulls a lever, which <b>engages</b> a second <b>clutch,</b> sending a bit more of the engine power to the wheels, and so on. This continues through several clutches until the car has reached a speed where the last <b>clutch</b> can be <b>engaged.</b> With all <b>clutches</b> <b>engaged,</b> the engine is now sending all of its power to the rear wheels. This is far more predictable and repeatable than the driver manually slipping the clutch himself and then shifting through the gears, given the extreme violence of the run and the speed at which is all unfolds. Another benefit is that there is no need to break the power flow in order to swap gears (a conventional manual cannot transmit power while between gears, which is important because 1/100ths of a second are important in Top Fuel races). A traditional multiplate clutch would be more prone to overheating and failure, as all the plates must be subjected to heat and friction together until the <b>clutch</b> is fully <b>engaged,</b> while a Top Fuel car keeps its last clutches in [...] "reserve" [...] until the cars speed allows full engagement. It is relatively easy to design the last stages to be much more powerful than the first, in order to ensure they can absorb the power of the engine even if the first clutches burn out or overheat from the extreme friction.|$|R
25|$|Note: {{the above}} all {{function}} like 2WD when multi-plate clutch coupling is not engaged (with exception of Subaru models), and like 4WD highrange in a part-time 4WD system when the <b>clutch</b> is <b>engaged</b> (usually by computer although some allow manual control). Some {{in this category}} have varying degrees of control in the torque distribution between front and rear by allowing some of the clutches in a multi-plate <b>clutch</b> coupling to <b>engage</b> and slip varying amounts. An example of a system like this is the BorgWarner i-Trac(TM) system.|$|R
5000|$|The Times, {{when they}} had a car on test, commented favourably on the new clutch, saying no {{previous}} Austin <b>clutch</b> had <b>engaged</b> smoothly and added [...] "the car is built for steady economical running rather than for speed or brilliance".|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As an {{important}} part of vehicle following control system, vehicle longitudinal dynamic model had significant effect on the research and development phases. The <b>clutch</b> <b>engaging</b> and exhaust brake process of AMT vehicle represented strong nonlinearity, and the theoretical models were complex and depended on many parameters. Focusing on the requirement of following control system, the models of the two processes above were simplified for the engineering application by combining theoretical analysis and real vehicle test data to describe the dynamic processes. Finally, the vehicle model based on MATLAB was build and the comparative experiments were conducted. The comparative results show that the simulation results agree well with the real vehicle tests...|$|R

50|$|The Corvair Powerglide {{provided}} one reduction {{range and}} reverse, {{in addition to}} direct drive and neutral. Low and Reverse ranges were a 1.82 ratio reduction, using a single planetary gearset. Locking the planetary geartrain provided a 1:1 direct drive. The differential driven rear pump permitted push-starting the Powerglide-equipped Corvair (the last American automatic to do so), at speeds over 18 mph by creating adequate pressure to engage low band and turn over the engine via the torque converter. A multiple plate <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> reverse range, low was braked using a band on the forward clutch drum, and direct provided via clutches. The torque converter of the Corvair offered 2.6:1 reduction at stall, and improved car performance when engine speeds were below ~2000 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|Cars with a Saxomat clutch did {{not have}} a clutch pedal. The Saxomat {{consisted}} of two independent systems: the centrifugal clutch, and the servo clutch. The centrifugal <b>clutch</b> was <b>engaged</b> above certain engine speed by centrifugal force acting on spinning weights inside the clutch, similar to a centrifugal governor.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{the car in}} gear {{with the}} <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> causes it to lurch {{forwards}} or backwards, since the starter motor by itself produces sufficient torque to move the whole vehicle; this can be highly dangerous, especially if the parking brake is not firmly applied and can be injurious to the starter and drivetrain. Therefore, novice drivers are taught to rock the knob of a manual gearbox {{from side to side}} before starting the engine to confirm that the gearbox is in neutral. For the same reason, modern cars require the clutch pedal to be depressed before the starter will engage. The latter practice is also useful in extremely cold conditions or with a weak battery, as it avoids the starter motor also having to turn over a gearbox full of cold and highly viscous oil.|$|R

The vacuum pump (10) comprises : an input shaft (20) which is directly driven by the combustion engine (12), a pumping unit (18) with a pump rotor (19) and the suction port (17), and a magneto-rheo!ogical clutch (16) being arranged between the input shaft (20) and the pump rotor (19), the clutch (16) comprising an input clutch body (24) and an output clutch body (22), a closed clutch liquid gap (26) between the two clutch bodies (22, 24), the clutch liquid gap (26) being filled with a magneto-rheological clutch liquid (28), a shiftable permanent magnet element (30) being shiftable between an <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> wherein the permanent magnet element's magnetic field penetrates the clutch liquid gap (26) with high magnetic flux and a disengaged position wherein the magnet element's magnetic field penetration flux in the clutch liquid gap (26) is less than in the <b>engaged</b> <b>position,</b> and a pneumatic control circuit for moving the permanent magnet element (30) between its engaged and its disengaged position, the pneumatic control circuit comprising a pneumatic actuation chamber (50) which {{is connected to the}} vacuum chamber (42) of the brake assistance unit (40) via a pneumatic conduit (46) and comprising a piston means (52) in the actuation chamber (50), whereby the piston means (52) directly shifts the permanent magnet element (30) into its <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> when relatively high pressure is present in the vacuum chamber (42), and whereby the piston means (52) is pretensioned by a passive pretension element (44) into the disengaged or <b>engaged</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{design team}} gained {{confidence}} in their concept in 1989, when they made a breakthrough in the multi-disc clutch's control system. Development of closed-loop control smoothed its operation. Using it, the multi-disc clutch made smaller adjustments, but did it more frequently. The microprocessor would review input from sensors every 20 milliseconds and decide if the front axle needed more torque. Using this technique, the unit's computer watched for drive wheel slip. If it sensed as little as half an rpm difference between {{the front and rear}} axles, it sent a power signal to the multi-disc <b>clutch.</b> The <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged,</b> diverting torque to the front axle in 10 percent increments, until it alleviated the drive wheel slip. As a result, the system could control runaway drive wheel speed in as little as a third of a wheel revolution.|$|R

2500|$|The Gallardo SE was {{a limited}} edition of 250 units {{introduced}} in 2005. It was {{distinguished from the}} regular Gallardo externally by having a black-roofed two-tone color scheme as well as specially designed [...] "Callisto" [...] rims. It comes with a two-tone interior. All piping and stitching on the ultra-quality leather are executed in {{the same color as}} the bodywork of the car. The midsections of the seats are finished in color-coded upholstery and even the black floormats have a color-coded border. A rear-view camera was standard on the Gallardo SE, as was the multimedia and navigation system, the sport suspension and an exclusive cover. The optional E-gear transmission came with a new function: 'thrust' mode. This feature automatically revs the car to 5,000 rpm then drops the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaging</b> all four wheels in a controlled burnout to ensure that the car performs maximum acceleration.|$|R
