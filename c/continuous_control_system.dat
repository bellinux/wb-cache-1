40|$|The {{implementation}} of {{statistical quality control}} methods for monitoring and control of powder abrasion/deposition is of increasing importance in a manufacturing environment. For the wider adoption of both current and new powder coating technologies, quality control systems need to be developed, which are easily installed, non-invasive and work in real time. This study evaluates {{the use of a}} dual electro-acoustic and electrostatic surface-charge measurement technique as means of realising real-time process control. Simultaneous changes in the signals were obtained under both powder flow-on and -off conditions and also for edge detection of the substrate. It was discovered that the most important variables which governed changes in the acoustic response signal were due to variations in the deposition pressure and stand-off distance, whilst those for the electrostatic response signal came from changes in particle size and deposition stand-off distance. A phenomenological predictive equation was developed based on a two-level full factorial design with five variables for both response factors. The coefficients of determination, r 2, for the models were 93 % and 98 %, respectively, with respective χ 2 probability values of 99 % and 99. 5 %.

In the structure under consideration the aperiodic passive  LC -filter operates in conjunction with the active one, the operation principle of the latter is being based on {{the formation of the}} channel feedback system of automatic voltage regulation of compensation of the variable component of the output voltage of the substation. The structure of a control system of a combined active filter of the series type has been proposed, which specific feature is the use of two parallel running circuits of feedback. The first one generates a signal for compensation of the variable component {{in a wide range of}} frequencies. The second one is built with the use of selective links that are configured to low frequency, including the non-canonical harmonic voltage with large amplitude. As a result of analytical studies the expression of the transfer function of the control system of the active filter of the series type with selective link has been obtained. The logarithmic amplitude-frequency characteristics of the combined active filter with and without selective link that had been determined clearly demonstrated the higher efficiency of suppression of the non-canonical harmonics in the second case.

40|$|In [12, 13] {{a theory}} of {{hierarchical}} hybrid control (HHC) was introduced via the formulation of a dynamical consistency (DC) relation between aggregated sets of system states. In the differential control systems case, the state space D of any given continuous base control system S is decomposed by a so-called finite analytic partition pi into a finite set of disjoint open connected blocks. For any such S and pi, a high level finite state control system Mp (called a partition machine of S) is then obtained from the DC dynamics of the blocks of pi. It is shown that {{in the class of}} hybrid in-block controllable (HIBC) partitions the controllability of the base system S is equivalent to the controllability of the partition machine Mp. Within this context, the converse question naturally arises as to whether any given finite state machine has a representation as the partition machine of some <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> S. In Chapter 2, we show that this is indeed the case and we present a constructive solution to this problem for all finite state machines. The question of finding HIBC partitions leads us to the general study of controllability for nonlinear systems. In Chapter 3, a form of open local accessibility for nonlinear control systems is introduced called the continuous fountain condition. Subject to the condition that (i) the states of a system are continuous fountains, and (ii) one of various recurrence conditions holds; it is established that the system state space is (globally) controllable. It is shown that these controllability results imply the controllability of certain subsets of the state space of Hamiltonian control systems called energy slices. Several algebraic conditions for verification of the fountain property without analysing the actual geometry of accessible sets are established. Finally, these results are shown to have application to HHC theory in that they give conditions for a finite analytic partition to satisfy HIBC hypothesis,In practice, an application of HHC theory would encounter problems in which the dynamics of the system, the nature of the controllable flows, and the positions of the boundaries of a partition themselves could only be approximately specified, Consequently, it is of interest to establish conditions under which the dynamics of Mp and its associated set of control laws are robust (that is to say insensitive) with respect to sufficiently small perturbations of the partitions defining Mp and small perturbations of the controllable flow. Chapter 4 addresses this issue. Two notions of the deformation of a partition pi are specified as, respectively, maps of the boundaries and the blocks of pi. The robustness properties of the partition machine Mp with respect to deformations of pi, and with respect to deformations of the controllable flow are investigated. In Chapter 5, HHC theory is generalised to hybrid systems with disturbances. A disturbance rejection hierarchical hybrid control theory is introduced and then applied to a multi-tank example and to a highly simplified air traffic management example...|$|E
