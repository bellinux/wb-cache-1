The {{goal of the}} study is to provide with first insights on the impact that a failure of a gap-seal has on the efficiency and maximum heating of a control surface. The experimental results are obtained in the cold-hypersonic wind tunnel H 2 K of DLR-Cologne. The numerical results are obtained with the DLR computer code TAU. The present investigation shows that a failure of the hinge-line seal does not promote an important increase of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>efficiency</b> and overall flap-surface heating but the flap leading-edge may be severe impacted due to the bad combination of shock stands point location and small leading-edge radius...|$|E

Computations are presented for clean configurations and for configurations with deflected control surfaces. The accuracy of the computed solutions is addressed by grid refinement studies and by comparing numerical results with available experimental data.

With advanced numerical simulation capabilities, complex phenomena involved {{can be taken}} into account. This is illustrated in this paper through several research studies. All the simulations were carried out with the elsA software developed at Onera. In terms of performance prediction, {{the capabilities of the}} CFD software are highlighted with various applications related to aircraft drag, <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>efficiency,</b> high-lift configuration performance and store separation. Unsteady simulations are carried out to investigate complex interactions and off-design conditions: jet simulation, buffet prediction and dynamic stall. The importanceof the coupling of different disciplines is underlined through aeroelastic, aeroacoustic and aero-thermal applications related to aircraft, helicopter rotors, engine compressors and turbines. Performance improvement for transportation vehicles can be studied with optimization and flow control techniques. The adjoint approach has been used to optimize pylons and winglets for transport aircraft and helicopter rotor blades. Flow control is regarded as a key evolution offering new solutions for performance improvement. Control of buffet onset with Vortex Generators and separation control with synthetic jets for helicopter fuselages is presented to highlight the elsA software’s ability to simulate actuator effects. Various innovative concepts have been investigated using the elsA software.

40|$|Unmanned combat {{aircraft}} vehicles (UCAV) are {{an increasingly important}} part of air forces as an addition to conventional manned {{combat aircraft}} vehicles. UCAVs are deployed in the direct fight with weapons {{as well as a}} recon drone in combat zones. An unmanned system has a great advantage against the conventional aircraft since the system can perform an extreme flight manoeuvre which is not possible by the manned system due to the physical limitation of the pilot. Various UCAV configurations exist. Although, in this research work an UCAV with a blended wing or flying wing configuration is concerned. The reference aircraft is the DLR F 17 model in real size which is developed within the DLR UCAV 2010 project. It corresponds to the NASA-SACCON model. The F 17 -model is a blended wing body configuration in lambda-wing design with a half span of y = 6. 15 m and a wing sweep angle of γ = 53 °. The design is driven by the mission requirement. However, the unique aircraft configuration of the F 17 leads to a special aerodynamic phenomenon of different vortex systems. This phenomenon influences the aircraft performance both for the aerodynamic discipline e. g. cp distribution and for the aeroelastic point of view, particularly <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>efficiency.</b> This research work represents the investigation of these effects. The work of this paper shows the first study of the effect on the aircraft aerodynamic performance. The investigation of aerodynamic coefficients distribution and vortex system generation is performed both for a rigid body aircraft and an elastic aircraft. Differences of the results are discussed. Finally as part of the investigation with the elastic aircraft, the parametrical FEM structure setup is also outlined...|$|E

2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the trim tab acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> than the center of pressure of the <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The position of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> on its axis will change until the torque from the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> and the trim surface balance each other.|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response. The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step. The methodology is applied to a representative hypersonic vehicle elevator <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> model which includes aerother-moelastic effects and is attached to a single degree of freedom oscillator representing the fuselage. Results show that <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial effects lead to a departure of the in-stantaneous <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> lift force by up to a factor of eight with respect to the static value.
