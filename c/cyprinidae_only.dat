50|$|The Chinese high fin banded shark (Myxocyprinus asiaticus) (family Catostomidae) has {{a single}} row of {{pharyngeal}} teeth with comb-like arrangements. The Cape Fear shiner (family <b>Cyprinidae)</b> <b>only</b> has pharyngeal teeth, similar to the teeth of other omnivorous shiners. The redear sunfish (family Centrarchidae) has thick pharyngeal teeth composed of hard, movable plates, which it uses to crush the exoskeletons of prey. The pharyngeal jaws of the moray eel (family Muraenidae) possess their own set of teeth. The dentary of the ghost knifefish species Sternarchogiton nattereri (family Apteronotidae) has upper and lower pharyngeal tooth plates bearing 9-11 and 7-9 teeth, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|The Evia barbel or petropsaro (Barbus euboicus), is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish in the family <b>Cyprinidae</b> found <b>only</b> in Greece. It is endemic to the Euboea Island and there now restricted to a single stream, Manikiotikos, {{in the southern part}} of the island. During the dry season it may be found just in a few intermittent pools. It is threatened by habitat loss and considered critically endangered.' ...|$|R

50|$|The flame chub (Hemitremia flammea) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish in the <b>Cyprinidae</b> family found <b>only</b> in the United States. Its range broadly follows the Tennessee River from above Knoxville, Tennessee, {{to the mouth of}} the Duck River. Historically the species was found in Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia. The preferred habitat of flame chub is in small flowing streams often associated with springs.|$|R
40|$|Endogenous {{heterogeneity}} of females and their eggs {{is one of}} the most important factors of annual generation’s formation in nature-spawn and incubative centers. Its assessment is significant for comprehending the notion of biochemical changes in proximate prespawn period. Between the shares of egg’s biochemical composition of <b>Cyprinidae</b> species <b>only</b> protein and b-lipoproteids levels are incovering constant and authentic correlations with embrionic development and larval survival in the conditions of artificial reproduction. The promotion of protein’s level to 20 – 24 % (in wet weigth) in percolating eggs positively affects the fertilization and larvae vitality. This trend is fair for the domesticated and nature-spawn fish. The same significance is important for the b-lipoproteids level in ovular eggs of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella Val.). The optimal concentration is 100 - 200 mg % in wet weight...|$|R
