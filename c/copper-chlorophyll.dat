40|$|Lipoxygenase (LOX) {{activity}} and chloroplast pigment content were monitored during fruit growth in Gordal and Manzanilla olive varieties (Olea europaea regalis and Olea europaea pomiformis respectively). At all growth stages, LOX activity was greater in Gordal than in Manzanilla, {{and in both}} varieties, enzymatic activity peaks coincided with the maximum presence of oxidised chlorophyll pigments in the fruits. The higher lipid peroxidation potential measured directly in vitro and indirectly in vivo in the Gordal variety and its correspondence with higher contents of oxidised catabolites of chlorophyll suggested a greater tendency and sensitivity of this variety to oxidative processes. This could also explain the high organelle disorganisation levels reached during industrial processing of the fruit, allowing the formation of <b>copper–chlorophyll</b> complexes associated with the green staining alteration that affects Gordal olives.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of the formation of}} copper and zinc complexes with chlorophyll in photosynthetic organelles (chloroplasts) and suborganelles (thylakoids) was studied. The visible and fluorescence spectra obtained from chloroplasts and thylakoids {{in the presence of the}} two metals confirmed complex formation in the case of copper, while such possibility appears to be very minor in the case of zinc. The reason for this distinction lies in the different type of complexes which chlorophyll forms with the two metals: only “central” or “substitution” <b>copper–chlorophyll</b> complexes may be formed inside the two isolated entities, while the formation of a possible zinc–chlorophyll “peripheral” type of complex is prevented for steric reasons. The latter fact is of high biological relevance, since both complexes may cause an irreversible impairment and damage of photosynthetic function...|$|E
