500|$|And the Band Played On was {{critically}} acclaimed {{and became a}} best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it [...] "one {{of the most important}} books of the year", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved." [...] The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Gavin {{said that}} “the show {{we are putting}} on is very shiny, it's very colourful. We don't want to bang on about our culture. We {{just want to have}} fun.” [...] Es Devlin added that it [...] "has to make sense in Bognor and Bogotá." [...] She said that the creators had happily indulged in the chance to [...] "visually draw on everything" [...] that British {{imagination}} can offer. David Arnold said “It's going to be beautiful, cheeky, cheesy, camp, silly and thrilling", and added that [...] "we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> 15 times over, and not had the same show, and it would still have been full of amazing British music". He thought that it should be the [...] "greatest after party" [...] and was “really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [...] the arts". Arnold himself had devoted two years working on the ceremony and had turned down all other work including Skyfall, but said that it was the [...] "most fun" [...] he had [...] "ever had in music". In the handover section Rio aimed to express [...] "multicultural embrace." [...] Daniela Thomas stated that Rio [...] "want to show you how sophisticated we mix things, what we do with the things you believe we are, how we mix with pop culture." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps {{said that}} the {{relationship}} [...] "hasn’t worked out or caught fire through the writing, or with the fans watching on-screen!" [...] In August 2012, Victor and Sharon married a second time, and when he disappeared shortly after, {{she thought he was}} abandoning her. Sharon later burned their prenuptial agreement, and took over this company. Talking about the situation, Case stated that the writers <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> storyline [...] "a million other ways" [...] without [...] "marrying him [...] ". In another interview, she spoke thoroughly of the relationship, labeling it incestuous. She stated: [...] "Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so upsetting to the audience. Whenever the actors went to do , the fans would bring it up. Literally, every actor in the building was coming up to me, giving me feedback that they were getting about it!" [...] When asked if the marriage was about [...] "daddy issues", Case said: [...] "That's usually the case in a story like that, but I don't think it's one most people want to watch!" [...] Victor later returned home and annulled their second marriage. During an interview with The Province, Michael Muhney, who portrays Victor's son Adam, said that Victor and Sharon's marriage was [...] "almost like an inside joke".|$|E

500|$|The range {{had grown}} too far for {{accurate}} shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port {{to close the}} range again between 16:12 and 16:15. This manoeuvre exposed Lion to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and she was hit several times. The smoke and fumes from these hits caused [...] {{to lose sight of}} Lion, which had sheered out of line to starboard, and to switch her fire to Queen Mary, now visible to Derfflinger's gunnery officer as the second ship in the British line and therefore assumed to be Princess Royal, at 16:16. Queen Mary hit Seydlitz again at 16:17 and knocked out one gun of her secondary armament. In return, Queen Mary had been hit twice by Seydlitz before 16:21 with unknown effects, but the German battlecruiser hit the turret face of 'Q' turret at that time and knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret. By 16:25 the range was down to , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. This move came too late, however, for Queen Mary, as Derfflingers fire began to take effect, hitting her twice before 16:26. One shell hit forward and detonated {{one or both of the}} forward magazines, which broke the ship in two near the foremast. Stationed inside 'Q' turret, Midshipman Jocelyn Latham Storey survived and reported that there had been a large explosion forward which rocked the turret, breaking the left gun in half, the gun breech falling into the working chamber and the right gun coming off its trunnions. Cordite in the working chamber caught fire and produced poisonous fumes that asphyxiated some of the turret's crew. It is doubtful that an explosion forward <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this,</b> so 'Q' turret may have been struck by the second shell. A further explosion, possibly from shells breaking loose, shook the aft end of the ship as it began to roll over and sink. The battlecruiser behind her, , was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains. 1,266 crewmen were lost; eighteen survivors were picked up by the destroyers , , and , and two by the Germans.|$|E

And if you don't take it serious enough, {{eventually}} one day you're going to say, 'Oh, I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this,</b> I could have done that.'"

2500|$|In October 2007, a juror {{was accused}} of having {{made up her mind}} already that Pickton was innocent. The trial judge {{questioned}} the juror, saying [...] "It's reported to me you said from what you had seen you were certain Mr. Pickton was innocent, {{there was no way he}} <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this.</b> That the court system had arrested the wrong guy." [...] The juror denied this completely. Justice Williams ruled that she could remain on the jury since it had not been proven she made the statements.|$|E

2500|$|William Langewiesche, an {{aviation}} journalist, said: [...] "n {{the case of}} the Egyptians, they were following a completely different line of thinking. It seemed to me that they knew very well that their man, Batouti, had done this. They were pursuing a political agenda that was driven by the need to answer to their higher-ups in a very pyramidal, autocratic political structure. The word had been passed down from on high, probably from Mubarak himself, {{that there was no way}} that Batouti, the co-pilot, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this.</b> For the accident investigators in Egypt, the game then became not pursuing the truth but backing the official line." ...|$|E

She also {{appears in a}} wide range of specialist recordings for the Reader's Digest, notably the Timeless Favourites series of 3-CD sets produced by Jay Productions between 1995 and 2000. [...] In a 2004 interview, Knight said, [...] "I don't think I've ever been satisfied with a recording. [...] I haven't played all my recordings. [...] Some of them I haven't heard. [...] I haven't seen... the video that I did of Salome from Covent Garden.... erhaps when I'm not singing any more, I'll dig it out and watch it....

2500|$|The Reverend Adam Sedgwick, the Woodwardian Professor of Geology at Cambridge, {{was popular}} and well regarded, having {{recently}} strongly defended the new geology against the Reverend Sir William Cockburn, a Scriptural geologist. He turned down several invitations to review Vestiges, pleading lack of time, but in March read it closely and on 6 April discussed with other leading clergymen the [...] "rank materialism" [...] {{of the book}} [...] "against which work he & all other scientific men are indignant". He thought the [...] "hasty jumping to conclusions" [...] indicated a female author. In a letter to Charles Lyell about [...] "the foul book", he expressed his disgust: [...] "If the book be true, the labours of sober induction are in vain; religion is a lie; human law is a mass of folly, and a base injustice; morality is moonshine; our labours for the black people of Africa were works of madmen; and man and woman are only better beasts!.... I cannot but think the work is from a woman's pen, it is so well dressed and so graceful in its externals. I {{do not think the}} 'beast man' <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>this</b> part so well." [...] On 10 April he contacted Macvey Napier, editor of the Edinburgh Review, who quickly accepted the offer. Sedgwick was rather disorganised and had not written a review before. To save time batches of his writing were typeset on arrival, so one part was being printed [...] "while the other part was still uncoiling from my brain in Cambridge." [...] Napier did not insist on the usual concise review, but as it was still arriving in mid May stopped it at what became 85 pages, one of the longest reviews the quarterly ever published.|$|E
