Data on cat feeder personalities as well as a better understanding of their feeding practices offer relevance for decision making concerning FRC population control strategies. The current study surveyed 222 FRC feeders who responded to a municipal trap-neuter-return (TNR) campaign in an Israeli central urban setting. The aim of the study was to describe their personal characteristics, feeding practices and the FRC populations they feed. Feeders were divided into four groups according to the number of cats they claimed to feed per day (group 1 : fed up to five cats; group 2 : fed six to 10 cats; group 3 : fed 11 - 20 cats; group 4 : fed ≥ 21 cats). Most feeders were women (81 %), with a median age of 58 years (range 18 - 81). The feeders reported an overall feeding of 3, 337 cats in 342 different feeding locations. Feeders of group 4 comprised of 15. 31 % (n= 34) of all feeders, but fed 56 % (n= 1869) of the FRC in 37. 42 % (n= 128) of the feeding locations. 'Heavy' feeders (groups 3 and 4) reported that they traveled significantly longer distances in order to feed the cats. Commercial dry food consisted of 90 % of the food they provided, with 66 % of them feeding once a day, with less food per cat per day than the other feeder groups. Interestingly, 'heavy' feeders were usually singles, had on average fewer siblings, a clear preference for owning cats as pets and lived in lower income neighborhoods. According to the feeders' reports on the FRC populations they fed, 69. 7 % (2325 / 3337) cats were neutered and 11. 8 % (395 / 3337) were kittens. In addition, they reported that 1. 6 % (54 / 3337) of the cats were limping, 2 % (67 / 3337) suffered from a systemic disease, 4 % (135 / 3337) had skin lesions, and 3. 9 % (130 / 3337) were suffering from a chronic disability. Abundance of kittens and morbidity rate were significantly and negatively associated with neutering rate. These findings are in accordance with the suggestion that neutering may potentially improve cat welfare by reducing morbidity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{represent}} {{about the}} new design concept of the <b>cat</b> <b>feeder.</b> Others <b>cat</b> <b>feeder</b> comes {{with a lot of}} choices and design but not all are really good for cats. Nowadays, people are getting busier with their life and sometimes forget to take such a good care for their cat’s eating time and need require some helps to ease the burden. The objectives of this thesis are to design and fabricate a manual and an entertaining of <b>cat</b> <b>feeder.</b> There are three design concepts have been suggested and by doing the scoring process, concept C has been chosen. This design consists of five parts and the used of bearing was the most critical part to be designed due to its cover casing spinning. After the fabrication, the dimension of this casing as well as the material selection becomes another critical factor while fabricating this <b>cat</b> <b>feeder.</b> After fabrication, it’s found out that this <b>cat</b> <b>feeder</b> also has wasted a lot of material and wrong of selection material which is zinc. Recommended material selection will be Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) type of plastic...|$|R
