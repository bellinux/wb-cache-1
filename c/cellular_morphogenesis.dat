The assembly of the cytoskeleton, including the actin cytoskeleton, is the determining factor in specifying <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis</b> and conferring shape to cells. The contractility of stress fibers within the cell will therefore help to determine <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis.</b> For example, the circumferential contractile actin belts of adherens junctions contribute to <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis.</b> As well, the dorsal stress fibers, transverse arcs and ventral stress fibers aid in the determination of cell morphology during cell migration.

40|$|Rad 53 is an {{essential}} protein kinase governing DNA damage and replication stress checkpoints in budding yeast. It {{also appears to be}} involved in <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis</b> processes. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that Rad 53 is phosphorylated at multiple SQ/TQ and at SP/TP residues, which are typical consensus sites for phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase-related kinases and CDKs, respectively. Here we show that Clb-CDK 1 phosphorylates Rad 53 at Ser 774 in metaphase. This phosphorylation event does not influence the DNA damage and replication checkpoint roles of Rad 53, and it is independent of the spindle assembly checkpoint network. Moreover, the Ser-to-Asp mutation, mimicking a constitutive phosphorylation state at site 774, causes sensitivity to calcofluor, supporting a functional linkage between Rad 53 and <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis...</b>|$|E

Reversible <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis</b> is an important virulence factor that facilitates invasion of host tissues, escape from phagocytes, and dissemination in the blood stream. The innate immune system is {{the first line of}} defense against C. albicans infections and is influenced by recognition of wall components that vary in composition in different morphological forms. However, the relationship between <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis</b> and immune recognition of this fungus is not fully understood. We therefore studied various vegetative cell types of C. albicans, singly and in combination, to assess the consequences of <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis</b> on selected immune cytokine outputs from human monocytes. Hyphae stimulated proportionally lower levels of certain cytokines from monocytes per unit of cell surface area than yeast cells, but did not suppress cytokine response when copresented with yeast cells. Pseudohyphal cells induced intermediate cytokine responses. Yeast monomorphic mutants had elevated cytokine responses under conditions that otherwise supported filamentous growth and mutants of yeast and hyphal cells that were defective in cell wall mannosylation or lacking certain hypha-specific cell wall proteins could variably unmask or deplete the surface of immunostimulatory ligands. These observations underline the critical importance of C. albicans morphology and morphology-associated changes in the cell wall composition that affect both immune recognition and pathogenesis...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis</b> is an {{important}} process crucial for the proper function of nearly all cells. Cell shape change is a dynamic and highly regulated process and requires the strict spatial control of numerous cellular processes including cytoskeletal remodeling and membrane trafficking. Phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) provide one means of spatiotemporally regulating specific cell morphogenesis-related processes through their recruitment of specific PIP-binding effector proteins. One PIP regulator, myotubularin a predicted PI(3) P and PI(3, 5) P₂ phosphatase {{was identified as a}} gene essential for the ecdysone hormone-induced cellular elongation of Kc cells. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the in vivo mechanisms through which mtm-dependent phosphoinositide regulation provides the spatial information necessary for the proper execution of morphogenetic programs, the role of mtm in the morphogenesis of the Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) was investigated. In this report, I verify previous in vitro studies in our lab implicating mtm in protrusion formation and proper endolysosomal membrane homeostasis, in vivo. Using Drosophila hemocytes, I also examine the relationship between mtm-dependent processes to <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis.</b> Our work points toward a model in which mtm, through the strict spatiotemporal regulation of class II PI 3 -kinase (Pi 3 K 68 D) -synthesized PI(3) P pools, regulates the recruitment and activity of specific PIP binding effector proteins such as Spir to then mediate specific cellular events such as cytoskeletal remodeling and endolysosomal membrane trafficking to control <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis.</b> This study therefore provides greater insight into the mechanisms through which phosphoinositides regulate and integrate multiple cellular processes to mediate changes in cell shape...|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{governing the}} cell behaviors underlying morphogenesis remain {{a major focus}} of research in both developmental biology and cancer biology. TGF-β ligands control cell fate specification via Smad-mediated signaling. However, their ability to guide <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis</b> in a variety of biological contexts is poorly understood. We report on the discovery of a novel TGF-β signaling-mediated <b>cellular</b> <b>morphogenesis</b> occurring during vertebrate gastrulation. Activin/nodal members of the TGF-β superfamily induce the expression of two genes regulating cell adhesion during gastrulation: Fibronectin Leucine-rich Repeat Transmembrane 3 (FLRT 3), a type I transmembrane protein containing extracellular leucine-rich repeats, and the small GTPase Rnd 1. FLRT 3 and Rnd 1 interact physically and modulate cell adhesion during embryogenesis by controlling cell surface levels of cadherin through a dynamin-dependent endocytosis pathway. Our model suggests that cell adhesion can be dynamically regulated by sequestering cadherin through internalization, and subsequent redeploying internalized cadherin to the cell surface as needed. As numerous studies have linked aberrant expression of small GTPases, adhesion molecules such as cadherins, and TGF-β signaling to oncogenesis and metastasis, it is tempting to speculate that this FLRT 3 /Rnd 1 /cadherin pathway might also control cell behavior and morphogenesis in adult tissue homeostasis...|$|E

40|$|Cell {{culture has}} long been a {{valuable}} tool for studying cell behaviour. Classical plastic substrates are two-dimensional, and usually promote cellular proliferation and inhibit differentiation. Understanding cell behaviour within complex multicellular tissues requires the systematic study of cells within the context of specific model microenvironments.

There is increasing agreement that moving up to the third dimension provides a more physiologically-relevant and predictive model system. Moreover, many <b>cellular</b> processes (<b>morphogenesis,</b> organogenesis and pathogenesis) have been confirmed to occur exclusively when cells are ordered in a three-dimensional (3 -D) manner.

40|$|Regulation of {{transcription}} is {{vitally important}} for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis and is also the basis for <b>cellular</b> differentiation, <b>morphogenesis</b> and the adaptability of any organism. Transcription activators, which orchestrate time and locus-specific assembly of complex transcription machinery, act as key players in these processes. One way in which these activators are controlled is by the covalent attachment of the conserved protein, ubiquitin (Ub), which can serve as either a proteolytic or non-proteolytic signal. For {{a subset of the}} activators, polyubiquitination-dependent degradation of the activator controls its abundance. In these cases transcription activation can require protein synthesis as well as internal or external stimulus. In contrast, other activators have been reported to undergo mono- or oligoubiquitination that does not lead to protein degradation. The mechanisms by which monoubiquitination of transcription activators affect their activities have been poorly understood. In a recent study, we demonstrated that monoubiquitination of some transcription activators can inhibit transcription by recruiting the AAA+ ATPase Cdc 48 (also known in metazoan organisms as p 97 or valosin-contain protein, VCP), which then extracts the ubiquitinated activator from DNA...|$|R
