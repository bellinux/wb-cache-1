The soup {{should be brought}} slowly {{to a boil and}} then simmered in a <b>covered</b> <b>pot</b> on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E

Tamales are a favorite comfort food in Mexico, eaten as both breakfast and dinner, and often accompanied by hot atole or champurrado and arroz con leche (rice pudding) or maize-based beverages of indigenous origin.

50|$|Nimono (煮物) is a simmered dish in Japanese cuisine.

The base ingredients for a nimono is typically a vegetable, fish, seafood, or tofu, either singly, or in combination. The shiru stock for a nimono is generally dashi. Other than sake and soy sauce, the stock can be further flavored by mirin, sugar, salt, vinegar, miso, or other condiments. A heavy <b>covered</b> <b>pot</b> is used in making nimono in order to spread the heat evenly throughout the ingredients during the simmering process.|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis evaluated the potential of integrated management of root-knot nematodes. Emphasis {{was given to the}} use of two complementary biological control agents, Paecilomyces lilacinus and Bacillus firmus, together with appropriate cultural practices including soil solarization and organic soil amendments, in comparison with the judicious use of chemical control. Use of soil amendments for nematode population suppression, demonstrated that application of fresh-chopped grass and brassicacaeous amendments suppressed root-knot nematode populations. After incubation of soil for 2 weeks in plastic <b>covered</b> <b>pots,</b> the addition of broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage at 10 kg/m 2 reduced the number of females in roots by 69, 45 and 39. 5 % respectively. Volatiles from grass, broccoli and Vapam reduced the number of females in roots by 32, 40. 5 and 100 % respectively, in plastic <b>covered</b> <b>pots</b> after incubation of amended soil for 1 week. In field experiments, {{at the end of the}} cropping season, significantly more nematodes parasitized the roots in control plots compared with those treated with B. firmus with and without soil solarization. Soil solarization alone or in combination with P. lilacinus provided efficient control of root-knot nematodes in comparison with the untreated control. No significant additive of synergistic interactions occurred between soil solarization and P. lilacinus. Attempts to enhance soil suppressiveness to root-knot nematodes through inundative applications of different inoculum densities of P. lilacinus and B. firmus, singly or together, were successful. There is some evidence that time may be an important factor in determining the activity of these biocontrol agents. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|The {{backbone}} of the Spâh in the Sasanian era was its heavy armoured cavalry, known since Classical antiquity in the west as Cataphracts. This {{was made up of}} noblemen who underwent extensive exercises in warfare and military manoeuvres through military training, gaining discipline and becoming true soldiers. Within the Sasanian military, the cavalry was the most influential element, and Sasanian cavalry tactics were adopted by the Romans, Arabs, and Turks. Their weaponry, battle tactics, tamgas, medallions, court customs, and costumes greatly influenced their Romano-Byzantine neighbours. The Romans had long contended against opponents who fielded heavy cavalry, notably the Sarmatians and the Parthians, and the recurrent wars with the Sasanian were an important factor in the Roman turn to new military organizations and battlefield tactics that centered around the use of heavy cavalry in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The Romans called these newly formed units clibanarii; It is said that the word clibanarii is derived from Persian word grivpanvar or griva-pana-vara meaning neck-guard wearer. Another, more direct and often quoted, etymology is the Greek word ho klibanos, which refers to a <b>covered</b> <b>pot</b> in which bread was baked or a small oven; perhaps a joking reference to the one-piece mask helmets they wore. The Roman term appears {{for the first time in}} the vita Alexandri Severi (56.5) in the Historia Augusta, a work from the very end of the 4th century AD.|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of the effect}} of freezing followed by thawing (air and water immersion, both at environmental temperature) and cooking (traditional boiling in a <b>covered</b> <b>pot)</b> on quality profile (in terms of objective texture, colour, chlorophylls and pheophytins and sensory attributes) and structure of green beans (cv. Win). Freezing was carried out at three different rates by forced convection with liquid nitrogen vapour. Kramer shear cell (KSC) and Warner-Bratzler (WB) tests were used for objective assessment of the texture. The highest parameter values occurred in beans frozen at the highest rate and air-thawed at the slowest rate. Also, minimum alteration of the rheological behaviour of cooked beans was achieved by freezing at the highest rate. The best parameter for assessing the texture of frozen green beans after thawing and cooking was the Warner-Bratzler slope (S WB). Coefficients of softening estimated for S WB in the thawed beans showed that the texture of the beans frozen at - 24 °C was almost four and almost five times softer than that of the beans frozen at - 70 °C, for air and water thawing respectively. Frozen and thawed green beans were darker than fresh control, whereas freezing prior to cooking produced lighter-coloured beans than direct cooking. The freezing rate affected colour parameters differently depending on the process that followed. When beans were thawed, increasing the freezing rate produced lighter-coloured beans, whereas when beans were cooked, increasing the rate produced darker-coloured beans. No difference was found in sensory assessments between cooked samples frozen at - 24 °C, - 35 °C and - 70 °C, which probably reflects the panellists' mixed preferences for quickly and slowly frozen samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed different degrees of mechanical damage to tissue structure, which accounted for the rheological behaviour of the beans. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
25|$|From the 18th century, English {{lead glass}} became popular {{throughout}} Europe, and was {{ideally suited to}} the new taste for wheel-cut glass decoration perfected on the Continent owing to its relatively soft properties. In Holland, local engraving masters such as David Wolff and Frans Greenwood stippled imported English glassware, a style that remained popular through the eighteenth century. Such was its popularity in Holland that the first Continental production of lead-crystal glass began there, probably {{as the result of}} imported English workers. Imitating lead-crystal à la façon d’Angleterre presented technical difficulties, as the best results were obtained with <b>covered</b> <b>pots</b> in a coal-fired furnace, a particularly English process requiring specialised cone-furnaces. Towards {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, lead-crystal glass was being produced in France, Hungary, Germany, and Norway.
