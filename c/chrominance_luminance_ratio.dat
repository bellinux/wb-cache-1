The results of three achromatic color matching experiments, in which a test and matching ring were surrounded by one or more rings of varying luminance, were analyzed in terms of three alternative quantitative edge integration models: (1) a generalized Retinex algorithm, in which achromatic color is computed from a weighted sum of log <b>luminance</b> <b>ratios,</b> with weights free to vary as a function of distance from the test (Weighted Log <b>Luminance</b> <b>Ratio</b> model); (2) an elaboration of the first model, in which the weights given to distant edges are reduced by a percentage that depends on the log <b>luminance</b> <b>ratios</b> of borders lying between the distant edges and the target (Weighted Log <b>Luminance</b> <b>Ratio</b> model with Blockage); and (3) an alternative modification of the first model, in which Michelson contrasts are substituted for log <b>luminance</b> <b>ratios</b> in the achromatic color computation (Weighted Michelson Contrast model). The experimental results support the Weighted Log <b>Luminance</b> <b>Ratio</b> model over the other two edge integration models. The Weighted Log <b>Luminance</b> <b>Ratio</b> model is also shown to provide a better fit to the achromatic color matching data than does Wallach's Ratio Rule, which states that the two disks will match in achromatic color when their respective disk/ring <b>luminance</b> <b>ratios</b> are equal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reliable edge {{detection}} {{is of utmost}} importance to many sophisticated computer vision methods and has been historically computed using luminance differences, which are quite sensitive to changes in illumination. It is argued here that using <b>luminance</b> <b>ratios</b> for {{edge detection}} in computer vision, rather than luminance differences, results in more robust edge information with respect to changes in illumination, which {{is in line with}} theoretical models for the lightness constancy observed in human visual perception.

40|$|The term {{simultaneous}} lightness constancy {{describes the}} capacity of the visual system to perceive equal reflecting surfaces as having the same lightness despite lying in different illumination fields. In some cases, however, a lightness constancy failure occurs; that is, equal reflecting surfaces appear different in lightness when differently illuminated. An open question is whether the luminance profile of the illumination edges affects simultaneous lightness constancy even when the ratio invariance property of the illumination edges is preserved. To explore this issue, we ran two experiments by using bipartite illumination displays. Both the luminance profile of an illumination edge and the <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> amplitude between the illumination fields were manipulated. Results revealed that the simultaneous lightness constancy increases when the luminance profile of the illumination edge is gradual (rather than sharp) and homogeneous (rather than inhomogeneous), whereas it decreases when the <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> between the illumination fields is enlarged. The results are interpreted according to the layer decomposition schema, stating that the visual system splits the luminance into perceived lightness and apparent illumination components.

40|$|AbstractThe {{topographic}} electroretinogram {{evoked by}} multi-focal exchange {{of black and}} white or red and green stimuli was analysed into linear and non-linear Wiener kernels. The first-order (temporally linear) response showed a biphasic waveform which inverted as the <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> of the exchanged colours passed through unity (established both psychophysically and photometrically). A short latency non-linearity which was dependant on luminance contrast was observed in both chromatic and achromatic ERG. However, in the chromatic second-order response, a long-latency non-linearity, foveally prominent, with a distinct skew in power towards the nasal retina, appeared around the isoluminant point, between the points of silent substitution for the L and M-cone types. Modelling of the second-order responses showed that over a wide range of <b>luminance</b> <b>ratios,</b> the chromatic ERG is well described by a linear combination of the achromatic (contrast-dependent) component and the response at isoluminance. The difference in second-order response between coloured and black and white stimulation, at the same luminance contrast, showed that the long-latency non-linearity is recorded when the red and green cone types are operating out of phase and peaks in amplitude at a green/red <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 8. This interpretation was confirmed by the lack of the long-latency non-linearity in colour-anomalous subjects (whether deficient in the L or the M-cone type).

This research study focused on studying the veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> (glare) experienced by drive-by motorists in lanes adjacent to nighttime work zones. The major objectives of this study are to: (1) provide an in-depth comprehensive review of the latest literature on the causes of glare and the existing practices {{that can be used to}} quantify and control glare during nighttime highway construction; (2) identify practical factors that affect the measurement of veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> (glare) in and around nighttime work zones; (3) analyze and compare the levels of glare and lighting performance generated by typical lighting arrangements in nighttime highway construction; (4) evaluate the impact of lighting design parameters on glare and provide practical recommendations to reduce and control lighting glare in and around nighttime work zones; (5) develop a practical model that can be utilized by resident engineers and contractors to measure and quantify veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> (glare) experienced by drive-by motorists near nighttime highway construction sites; and (6) investigate and analyze existing recommendations on the maximum allowable levels of veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> (glare) that can be tolerated by nighttime drivers from similar lighting sources. In order to achieve these objectives, the study was conducted in four major tasks that focused on: (1) conducting a comprehensive literature review; (2) visiting and studying a number of nighttime highway construction projects; (3) conducting field studies to evaluate the performance of selected lighting arrangements; and (4) developing practical models to measure and control the levels of glare experienced by drive-by motorists in lanes adjacent to nighttime work zones. In the first task of the project, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to study the latest research and developments on veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> (glare) and its effects on drivers and construction workers during nighttime highway construction work. Sources of information included publications from professional societies, journal articles, on-line databases, and contacts from DOT???s. The review of the literature focused on: (1) lighting requirements for nighttime highway construction; (2) causes and sources of glare in nighttime work zones, including fixed roadway lighting, vehicles headlamps, and nighttime lighting equipment in the work zone; (3) the main types of glare which can be classified based on its source as either direct or reflected glare; and based on its impact as discomfort, disabling, or blinding glare; (4) available procedures to measure and quantify discomfort and disabling glare; (5) existing methods to quantify pavement/adaptation luminance which is essential in measuring discomfort and disabling glare; (6) available recommendations by State DOTs and professional organizations to control glare; and (7) existing guidelines and hardware for glare control. The second task involved site visits to a number of nighttime work zones to identify practical factors that affect the measurement of the veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> in nighttime construction sites. The site visits were conducted over a five-month period in order to gather data on the type of construction operations that are typically performed during nighttime hours, the type of lighting equipment used to illuminate the work area, and the levels of glare experienced by workers and motorists in and around the work zone. One of the main findings of these site visits was identifying a number of challenges and practical factors that significantly affect the measurement and quantification of the veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> (glare) in nighttime work zones. These practical factors were carefully considered during the development of the glare measurement model in this study to ensure its practicality and ease of use in nighttime work zones by resident engineers and contractors alike. Another important finding of the site visits was the observation that improper utilization and setup of construction lighting equipment may cause significant levels of glare for construction workers and drive-by motorists. In the third task, field experiments were conducted to study and evaluate the levels of lighting glare caused by commonly used lighting equipment in nighttime work zones. During these experiments, a total of 25 different lighting arrangements were tested over a period of 33 days from May 10, 2007 to June 12, 2007 at the Illinois Center for Transportation (ICT) in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The objectives of these experiments were to: (1) analyze and compare the levels of glare and lighting performance generated by typical lighting arrangements in nighttime highway construction; and (2) provide practical recommendations for lighting arrangements to reduce and control lighting glare in and around nighttime work zones. The field tests were designed to evaluate the levels of glare and lighting performance generated by commonly used construction lighting equipment, including one balloon light, two balloon lights, three balloon lights, one light tower and one Nite Lite. The tests were also designed to study the impact of tested lighting parameters (i. e., type of light, height of light, aiming and rotation angles of light towers, and height of vehicle/observer) on the veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> experienced by drive-by motorists as well as their impact on the average horizontal illuminance and lighting uniformity ratio in the work area. Based on the findings from these tests, a number of practical recommendations were provided to control and reduce veiling luminance ratio/glare in and around nighttime work zones. The final (fourth) task of this study focused on the development of a practical model to measure and quantify veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> (glare) experienced by drive-by motorists in lanes adjacent to nighttime work zones. The model was designed to consider the practical factors that were identified during the site visits, including the need to provide a robust balance between practicality and accuracy to ensure that it can be efficiently and effectively used by resident engineers on nighttime highway construction sites. To ensure practicality, the model enables resident engineers to measure the required vertical illuminance data in safe locations inside the work zone while allowing the traffic in adjacent lanes to flow uninterrupted. These measurements can then be analyzed by newly developed regression models to accurately calculate the vertical illuminance values experienced by drivers from which the veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> (glare) can be derived. This task also analyzed existing recommendations on the maximum allowable levels of veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> (glare) that can be tolerated by nighttime drivers from various lighting sources, including roadway lighting, headlights of opposite traffic vehicles, and lighting equipment in nighttime work zones. The main research development of this study contribute to the advancement of current practice in highway construction and can lead to an increase in the safety of construction workers and the traveling public in and around the nighttime work zones. The outcome of this study will help in: (1) identifying practical factors and challenges that affect the measurements of glare in and around nighttime work zones; (2) evaluating and comparing the lighting performance and glare levels of typical construction lighting equipment that are commonly used in nighttime highway construction projects; (3) recommending practical lighting arrangements that generate acceptable levels of lighting glare for motorists and adequate levels of lighting performance for construction workers inside the work zone; (4) developing practical and safe model for measuring and quantifying the veiling <b>luminance</b> <b>ratio</b> experienced by drive-by motorists near nighttime highway construction sites; and (5) providing a baseline for Departments of Transportation (DOTs) to develop specifications and standards on how to control and quantify the levels of glare in nighttime highway construction projects...|$|R
