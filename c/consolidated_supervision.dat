40|$|The Federal Reserve is {{responsible}} for the prudential supervision of bank holding companies (BHCs) on a <b>consolidated</b> basis. Prudential <b>supervision</b> involves monitoring and oversight to assess whether these firms are engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, as well as ensuring that firms are taking corrective actions to address such practices. Prudential supervision is interlinked with, but distinct from, regulation, which involves the development and promulgation of the rules under which BHCs and other regulated financial intermediaries operate. This paper describes the Federal Reserve's supervisory approach for large, complex financial companies and how prudential supervisory activities are structured, staffed, and implemented on a day-to-day basis at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as part of the broader supervisory program of the Federal Reserve System. The goal of the paper is to generate insight for those not involved in supervision into what supervisors do and how they do it.

5000|$|Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke stated {{there is}} a need for [...] "well-defined {{procedures}} and authorities for dealing with the potential failure of a systemically important non-bank financial institution." [...] He also argued in March 2009: [...] "... I would note that AIG offers two clear lessons for the upcoming discussion in the Congress and elsewhere on regulatory reform. First, AIG highlights the urgent need for new resolution procedures for systemically important nonbank financial firms. If a federal agency had had such tools on September 16, they could have been used to put AIG into conservatorship or receivership, unwind it slowly, protect policyholders, and impose haircuts on creditors and counterparties as appropriate. That outcome would have been far preferable to the situation we find ourselves in now. Second, the AIG situation highlights the need for strong, effective <b>consolidated</b> <b>supervision</b> of all systemically important financial firms. AIG built up its concentrated exposure to the subprime mortgage market largely out of the sight of its functional regulators. More-effective supervision might have identified and blocked the extraordinarily reckless risk-taking at AIG-FP. These two changes could measurably reduce the likelihood of future episodes of systemic risk like the one we faced at AIG." ...|$|E

40|$|Models of EU {{financial}} market supervision Author: JUDr. Evžen Šťastný, LL. M. This paper seeks the optimal way of supervision {{of a single}} EU {{financial market}}. The reason for my research is that, based {{on the development of}} financial markets in recent years, the interconnection of markets, modern investment instruments and the strengthening of multinational financial groups allow for quick and easy transfer of capital and risk between countries and financial sectors.

The increasing mistrust of host countries in the ability and willingness of the home countries authorities to protect their national interests represents a serious threat to the sustainability of bank globalisation.
