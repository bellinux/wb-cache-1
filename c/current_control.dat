25|$|The collector–emitter current can {{be viewed}} as being {{controlled}} by the base–emitter current (<b>current</b> <b>control),</b> or by the base–emitter voltage (voltage control).

25|$|This {{property}} {{can lead}} to more precise <b>current</b> <b>control</b> than merely choosing an appropriate fixed resistor. The power lost in the resistive ballast is also reduced because a smaller portion of the overall power is dropped in the ballast compared to what might be required with a fixed resistor.|$|E
40|$|Embodiments of the {{invention}} may {{provide for a}} load regulation tuner that reduces the load regulation effect. The load regulation tuner may include a load <b>current</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>current</b> source that is responsive to a load current from a power transistor of a linear regulator, where the load <b>current</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>current</b> source includes a sensing transistor that generates {{a fraction of the}} load current as a sensed partial load current. The load regulation tuner may also include a resistor in parallel with a load <b>current</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>current</b> source, and where the paralleled resistor and the load <b>current</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>current</b> source form at least a portion of a feedback block that adjusts an operation of the linear regulator to provide a substantially constant load voltage.

In lieu of track circuit indications, the AVI system is displayed {{in the control room}} to provide a periodic update to train position wherever AVI detectors exist. The AVI system user interface was solely text based until the <b>current</b> <b>control</b> room was opened, in which a new schematic display based on AVI data was instituted. Track circuit indications are available digitally in signal houses at the Park Street interlocking, at the new North Station interlocking, and at the new Kenmore interlocking, but are not transmitted to OCC. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle location tracking on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines. The first real-time data—location data on the surface lines—became available in October 2014. Full tracking is expected by early 2015.|$|E

The circuit {{makes use of}} a recently proposed active building block (ABB), namely the <b>current</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>current</b> differencing transconductance amplifier (CCCDTA). The circuit offers the following advantages: (i) a complete current-mode circuit makes it suitable for current-mode signal processing applications, (ii) the circuit operation is temperature insensitive, (iii) use of two CCCDTAs and no external passive components makes the circuit suitable for monolithic integration, (iv) current tunability of the square rooting function, (v) high frequency potential and (vi) circuit exhibits high output impedance.

This paper focuses on the stepper motor controller, with the feedback to improve the accuracy and the microstepping technique to improve the resolution. Sine cosine and trapezoidal <b>current</b> <b>controlling</b> techniques for the micro stepping are used in two different types of situations. The proposed controller uses the linear interpolation and sine cosine <b>current</b> <b>controlling</b> technique to double the rotation accuracy than the resolution of the encoder and detect the obstacle by using the encoder and the static characteristic of the stepper motor. Also, the variable step interval technique is proposed to overcome the speed variation in the trapezoidal <b>current</b> <b>controlling</b> technique. The simulation and the experimental results show that, proposed controller can produce the accuracy at 0. 0045 Â°, the resolution at 0. 0009 Â° and obstacle detection.
