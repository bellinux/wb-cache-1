50|$|The {{print is}} then floated {{face down in}} a bath of room-temperature water to allow the soluble gum, excess dichromate, and pigment to wash away. Several changes of water bath are {{necessary}} to clear the print. Afterwards, the print is hung to dry. When all layers are complete and dry, a <b>clearing</b> <b>bath</b> of sodium metabisulfite is used to extract any remaining dichromate so the print will be archival.|$|E
50|$|Black-and-white {{transparencies}} {{can be made}} {{directly with}} some modern black-and-white films, which normally yield negatives. The negative image is developed but not fixed. The negative image is removed by bleaching with a solution of potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate in dilute sulfuric acid, which is removed by washing and a <b>clearing</b> <b>bath</b> containing sodium metabisulfite or potassium metabisulfite. The remaining silver halide salts are re-exposed to light, developed and fixed, and the film is washed and dried.|$|E
50|$|When {{the print}} is {{completely}} dry {{and no more}} layers will be applied, a potassium metabisulfite <b>clearing</b> <b>bath</b> is used to remove excess dichromate trapped in the paper. This {{can be seen on}} the reverse of the paper as a yellow stain where pigment was applied on the verso. In a well-ventilated room mix 250g Potassium Metabisulphite in a tray of water and soak the print for 1-5 minutes. This bath may soften the image so care must be taken when washing away the metabisulphite in the next step. In a separate tray, gently run cool water for 10-20 minutes with the print face down to remove all metabisulphite solution. Hang to dry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} also {{included}} on the set list of the 2012 Born This Way Ball tour. The song was shortened and had Gaga performing it in a <b>clear</b> <b>bath</b> tub while wearing a Statue of Liberty styled head piece. Gaga ventured into the crowd during the song, through the extended pathways from the stage and after the performance she invited a fan onstage. Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle believed that the appearance of [...] "LoveGame" [...] during the tour proved {{it to be a}} far superior track than the ones from Gaga's second studio album, Born This Way (2011). Most recently, Gaga performed [...] "LoveGame" [...] during her headline performance at the first weekend of Coachella 2017. The song was included on her set list both weekends she headlined the festival.|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of walking droplets, an {{analogous}} Zeeman Effect can be demonstrated by observing orbiting droplets in a vibrating fluid bath. The bath is also brought to rotate at a constant angular velocity. In the rotating bath, the equilibrium distance between droplets shifts slightly farther or closer. The direction of shift depends on whether the orbiting drops rotate {{in the same direction}} as the bath or in opposite directions. The analogy to the quantum effect is <b>clear.</b> The <b>bath</b> rotation is analogous to an externally applied magnetic field, and the distance between droplets is analogous to energy levels. The distance shifts under an applied bath rotation, just as the energy levels shift under an applied magnetic field.|$|R
50|$|The gelatin silver {{print or}} gelatin {{developing}} out paper (DOP) is a monochrome imaging process {{based on the}} light sensitivity of silver halides. They have been made for both contact printing and enlarging purposes by modifying the paper’s light sensitivity. A brief exposure to a negative produces a latent image, which is then made visible by a developing agent. The image is then made permanent by treatment in a photographic fixer, which removes the remaining light sensitive silver halides. And finally, a water <b>bath</b> <b>clears</b> the fixer from the print. The final image consists of small particles of silver bound in a layer of gelatin. This gelatin image layer {{is only one of}} the four layers found in a typical gelatin silver print, which typically include the overcoat, image layer, baryta, and paper support.|$|R
60|$|On {{the farther}} {{side of a}} little lawn, the stream leapt through a chasm beneath {{overarching}} vines, sprinkling eternal freshness upon all around, and then sank foaming into a <b>clear</b> rock-basin, a <b>bath</b> for Dian's self. On its farther side, the crag rose some twenty feet in height, bank upon bank of feathered ferns and cushioned moss, over the rich green beds of which drooped a thousand orchids, scarlet, white, and orange, and made the still pool gorgeous with the reflection of their gorgeousness. At its more quiet outfall, it was half-hidden in huge fantastic leaves and tall flowering stems; but near the waterfall the grassy bank sloped down toward the stream, and there, on palm-leaves strewed upon the turf, beneath {{the shadow of the}} crags, lay the two men whom Amyas sought, and whom, now he had found them, he had hardly heart to wake from their delicious dream.|$|R
5000|$|Sutton {{had been}} busy {{handling}} two express up goods {{and trying to}} dispatch three light engines to the south between them. At 5.39, Sutton was offered the midnight sleeping car express, St.Pancras-Glasgow, which he offered forward to Ais Gill. It was accepted at once and at 5:44 he pulled set all his signals [...] "off" [...] i.e. set them to <b>clear.</b> Scott and <b>Bath</b> briefly [...] "popped" [...] their whistles and set off. Barely two minutes later the express passed through. It consisted of four timber-bodied coaches, two sleeping cars and two brake vans, hauled by [...] "Kirtley" [...] 2-4-0 No. 48 and rebuilt Class 2 No. 549, under drivers Oldcorn and Wadeson. It was running sixteen minutes late due to signal and other delays at Leeds and Skipton, but was running at 60 mph and accelerating before making the final ascent to Aisgill.|$|R
2500|$|In August 1902 USSC {{purchased}} the Union, Bath, Hyde Windlass, Crescent, Moore, Eastern, Harlan & Hollingsworth shipyards, the Canda Manufacturing company, {{and the capital}} stock of Bethlehem Steel. The par value of these transactions totaled $69.5 million – yet (with the exception of Bethlehem Steel) {{the total value of}} the companies was appraised at less than $12.5 million. It soon became <b>clear</b> that the <b>Bath,</b> Crescent, Moore, Eastern, and Harlan & Hollingsworth shipyards were deeply indebted, and that the new trust lacked the ability to meet charges arising from the bond issuance. [...] The goal of organizing a huge trust had been accomplished, [...] but the result was doomed to fail, because from the start it was [...] "already a water-logged wreck." [...] The promoters were immediately forced to personally borrow $1.5 million from New York banks, to make up for cash that never arrived from foreign subscribers. [...] USSC’s problems brought down the Trust Company of the Republic, which had placed its own future on the line when arranging USSC’s financing, by purchasing the largest share of bonds.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} that a {{prospectus}} for USSC was formally issued in June 1902, Newport News and Vickers Sons & Maxim were no longer listed as participating interests, but Harlan & Hollingsworth Co. of Wilmington, Delaware, and Eastern Shipbuilding Company of New London, Connecticut were now included. The June 1902 prospectus stated, among other things, that the USSC had been organized under {{the laws of the}} State of New Jersey and described as its directors Nixon, Henry T. Scott (president of Union Iron Works), Charles J. Canda (president of Canda Manufacturing Co.), John S. Hyde (president of Hyde Windlass Co.), E. W. Hyde (president of Bath Iron Works), and Irving M. Scott (Vice President and General Manager of Union Iron Works). In fact, incorporation had not yet occurred, and the board had not yet been constituted. [...] Once the company was organized several months later, only four of those mentioned in the prospectus as directors ever served as directors. The prospectus also stated that the plants were earning $2.25 million for a year and had abundant facilities for additional work and increased earnings. Even with positive representations in the prospectus, however, the public purchased less than $500,000 of the $9 million in bonds offered for sale, and foreign underwriters offered no cash, only promises (that were ultimately never honored). Eager to make the USSC more attractive to investors but facing a huge shortfall in funds, the promoters turned to Charles M. Schwab, then president of United States Steel, to discuss USSC acquiring Bethlehem Steel Company (which at the time was more sound than the shipyards already in the combination). With little cash to offer for Bethlehem (then held by a J.P. Morgan syndicate), the promoters instead proposed to pay for the acquisition with $7.2 million in cash and $2.5 million in USSC stock issued against the plants themselves. The cash came from Schwab, who furnished it on conditions that were highly favorable to him. [...] By bringing Bethlehem into the combination, however, USSC could send a message to potential investors that Morgan was now behind the overall venture, and claim to be the world’s only company capable of building a battleship complete with armament, armor and all equipment. In August 1902 USSC purchased the Union, Bath, Hyde Windlass, Crescent, Moore, Eastern, Harlan & Hollingsworth shipyards, the Canda Manufacturing company, and the capital stock of Bethlehem Steel. The par value of these transactions totaled $69.5 million - yet (with the exception of Bethlehem Steel) the total value of the companies was appraised at less than $12.5 million.
