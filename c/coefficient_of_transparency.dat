40|$|Transparency is {{considered}} a key value for trustworthy governments. However, the effect <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> on citizens’ trust across different national cultures is overlooked in current research. This article compares the effect <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> on trust in government between the Netherlands and South Korea. The effect is investigated by two similar series of three experiments. We hypothesize that the effect <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> differs, because both countries have different cultural values regarding power distance and short and long-term orientation. Results reveal similar patterns in both countries: transparency has a subdued and sometimes negative effect on trust in government. However, the negative effect in South Korea is much stronger.
