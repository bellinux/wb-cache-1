The study involves single agent subnetworks and simple movement patterns, i. e. straight movement from one subnetwork to another with no comeback. It is assumed that the wireless technology is unable to pass link-layer information to the IP layer and that it also restricts the Mobile Node from contemporarily participating in multiple subnetworks when in their overlap area (e. g.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} {{to reduce the}} energy {{consumption}} of cellular networks by leveraging coordinated <b>cell</b> <b>switching</b> algorithms with user cooperation. <b>Cell</b> <b>switching</b> consists in deactivating some base stations in periods of low load {{in order to reduce}} the power consumption, while the coverage is provided by remaining active base stations.

40|$|Abstract—With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} usage of wireless devices, the power consumption and energy efficiency of cellular networks have become important performance indicators. In recent years, {{various types of}} energy saving schemes have been proposed for cellular networks. However, most of these schemes do {{not take advantage of}} the advanced features offered by the recent cellular standards, such as the 3 GPP release 10 (also known as LTE-Advanced) and beyond. One of the recently proposed energy saving schemes in cellular networks is the <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> off technique in which a lightly loaded <b>cell</b> is completely <b>switched</b> off and the traffic in that region is absorbed by the nearby cells whose transmit powers are increased to enable larger coverage areas. In this paper, we propose to use the <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> off scheme without increasing the transmit powers of the active cells; instead, we propose to use the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission radio technology, which is being standardized for the beyond-LTE cellular networks, to enable a sufficient received power level from a number of nearby cells whenever possible. Through simulations with realistic parameters, we demonstrate that the above described <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> off + CoMP combination used with proper CoMP active set degree yields a more energy efficient solution with better received user experience in comparison to the traditional <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> off schemes. In the proposed scheme, channel estimations are needed {{in order to determine the}} CoMP active set accurately. We analyze the performance by modeling the channel estimation error as a Gaussian random variable with 4, 8, and 12 dB standard deviation and observe that perfect channel estimation can provide up to 46 % capacity and 24 % energy efficiency increase in comparison to the scenarios with the channel estimation errors.

40|$|Abstract—The green {{communications}} paradigm {{has been}} re-ceiving much attention in wireless networks in recent years. More specifically, {{in the context}} of cellular communications, the concept of <b>Cell</b> <b>Switch</b> Off (CSO) has been recognized as a promising approach to reduce the energy consumption. The need is expected to be pressing especially in the next decade with the increasing small cell deployment. However, the <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> on/off decisions compounded by the resource allocation task in CSO constitute a highly challenging optimization problem {{due to the fact that}} this problem can be viewed as a generalized version of the resource allocation (scheduling) problem in the conventional cellular networks without CSO, which itself is already difficult. This paper introduces a novel framework to CSO based on multiobjective evolutionary optimization. The main contribution of this paper is that the proposed multiobjective framework takes the traffic behaviour in both space and time (known by operators) into account in the optimal <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> on/off decision making which is entangled with the corresponding resource allocation task. The exploitation of this statistical information is done in a number of ways, including through the introduction of a weighted network capacity metric. This indicator prioritizes cells which are expected to have traffic concentration resulting in on/off decisions that achieve substantial energy savings in scenarios where traffic is highly unbalanced, without compromising the QoS. The proposed framework dis-tinguishes itself from the CSO papers in the literature in two ways: 1) The number of <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> on/off transitions as well as handoffs are minimized. 2) The computationally-heavy part of the algorithm is executed offline, which makes the real-time implementation feasible.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the climax}} of {{amphibian}} metamorphosis many tadpole organs remodel. The different remodeling strategies are controlled by thyroid hormone (TH).

40|$|In {{this study}} the Fast Hinted <b>Cell</b> <b>Switching</b> {{movement}} detection method for Mobile IP is introduced. This method {{assumes that the}} Link-Layer is capable of delivering information to Mobile IP regarding {{the identity of the}} local mobility agent. This tends to negate the need for Mobile IP movement detection as well as agent discovery and leads to accelerated Mobile IP hand-offs. Moreover, the existence of Link-Layer information renders the presence of periodic mobility agent broadcast advertisements as unnecessary which enables a more efficient utilisation of the network capacity. The performance of the proposed solution is experimentally compared against that of Eager <b>Cell</b> <b>Switching</b> that is considered the fastest of traditional Mobile IP movement detection methods. The scenarios investigated involve straight line movement patterns and Mobile IP hand-offs between Foreign Agents that provide wireless network connectivity through IEEE 802. 11 b Wireless LAN standard, compliant hardware. The IEEE 802. 11 SSID field was utilised to contain information important to Mobile IP such as the identity of the local mobility agent. The overlying communication involves a unidirectional GSM audio stream directed to the mobile node. Through the experimental investigation it is determined that the proposed solution outperforms its Eager <b>Cell</b> <b>Switching</b> counterpart by managing faster Mobile IP hand-offs and minimum packet loss of the active audio stream...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{nitrogen}} doping on {{the stability and}} memory window of resistive state switching in N-doped Ta 2 O 5 deposited by atomic layer deposition is elucidated. Nitrogen incorporation increases the stability of resistive memory states which is attributed to neutralization of electronic defect levels associated with oxygen vacancies. The density functional simulation with screened exchange hybrid functional approximation finds that the incorporation {{of nitrogen}} dopant atoms in the oxide network removes the O vacancy midgap defect states, thus nullifying excess defects and eliminating alternative conductive paths. By effectively reducing the density of vacancy-induced defect states through N doping, 3 -bit multilevel <b>cell</b> <b>switching</b> is demonstrated, consisting of eight distinctive resistive memory states achieved by either controlling the set current compliance or the maximum voltage during reset.
