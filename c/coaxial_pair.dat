The Altec 604 was given this elaborate new crossover feature and incorporated into the UREI 813 studio monitor, which also had a second woofer physically separate from the <b>coaxial</b> <b>pair.</b> This design dominated recording studios of the 1980s, and time alignment became a feature of competing manufacturers. In the 2000s, digital signal processing (DSP) was used by Fulcrum Acoustic to reduce some of the coaxial drawbacks such the diffraction of the woofer's upper range around the central horn, by filling in this [...] "shadow" [...] with low frequency sound from the compression driver, and by countering the out-of-time reflections bouncing off of the woofer.|$|E

40|$|A {{family of}} axially {{symmetric}} mirror shapes are proposed for panoramic imaging. These shapes keep the {{resolution in the}} image invariant to changes in elevation in the scene. In other words, this family of shapes achieves solid angle pixel density invariance. An analysis of range finding using two coaxial, axially symmetric resolution invariant mirrors in a <b>coaxial</b> <b>pair</b> is presented. The resolution invariance property of these mirrors mean that when the image captured is unwarped the resultant image will not suffer from variable image quality. This problem is present in unwarped images captured with any mirror shape not designed for resolution invariance. The resolution invariance of these mirrors is especially important {{in the case of}} stereo panoramic mirrors where one view of the scene is captured within the other and thus will have lower resolution. It is necessary to clearly identify two views of an object to undertake range finding. The proposed mirror shapes will be useful for mobile robotics and machine vision. Other applications areas such as visual sensing for control of traffic lights at street intersections could be considered. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate a}} nanoscale mode-division multiplexing {{scheme based on}} parity-time (PT) symmetric coaxial plasmonic waveguides. <b>Coaxial</b> waveguides support <b>paired</b> degenerate modes corresponding to distinct orbital angular momentum states. PT symmetric inclusions of gain and loss break the degeneracy of the paired modes and create new hybrid modes without orbital angular momentum. This process can be made thresholdless by matching the mode order {{with the number of}} gain and loss sections within the coaxial ring. Using both a Hamiltonian formulation and degenerate perturbation theory, we show how the wavevectors and fields evolve with increased loss/gain and derive sufficient conditions for thresholdless transitions. As a multiplexing filter, this PT symmetric coaxial waveguide could help double density rates in on-chip nanophotonic networks. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

5000|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of analog signals {{is that any}} system has noise - i.e., unwanted variation. As the signal is copied and re-copied, or transmitted over long distances, or electronically processed, the unavoidable noise introduced by each step in the signal path is additive, progressively degrading the signal-to-noise ratio, until in extreme cases the signal can be overwhelmed. This is called generation loss. Noise can show up as [...] "hiss" [...] and intermodulation distortion in audio signals, or [...] "snow" [...] in video signals. This degradation is impossible to recover, {{since there is no}} sure way to distinguish the noise from the signal; amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise (distortion/interference) as well. Digital signals can often be transmitted, stored and processed without introducing noise. Electrically, analog noise can be diminished by shielding, good connections and several cable types such as <b>coaxial</b> or twisted <b>pair.</b>|$|R

In (b) we simulate homogeneous backlighting from the second projector combined with the illumination used in (a). For validation, a ground-truth image (c) was captured by loading the same projector patterns into the real projectors. Our approach is able to faithfully capture and reconstruct the complex light transport in this scene. (d) shows a typical frame captured during the acquisition process with the corresponding projector pattern in the inset. We present a novel technique called symmetric photography to capture real world reflectance fields. The technique models the 8 D reflectance field as a transport matrix between the 4 D incident light field and the 4 D exitant light field. It is a challenging task to acquire this transport matrix due to its large size. Fortunately, the transport matrix is symmetric and often data-sparse. Symmetry enables us to measure the light transport from two sides simultaneously, from the illumination directions and the view directions. Data-sparseness refers to the fact that sub-blocks of the matrix can be well approximated using low-rank representations.

40|$|A priori {{prediction}} of rocket engine combustor flowfields {{is extremely difficult}} due {{to a number of}} complicating effects including multiple property phases, unsteadiness due to high rates of energy release and turbulence, and three-dimensionality. Proof of predictive accuracy is limited by the severe environment that precludes direct measurement of most validating parameters. This dissertation describes an experiment undertaken to provide benchmark data for the validation of computational models by measuring the local wall heat flux and axial pressure variations in a multielement rocket combustor operating at pressures between 300 and 1200 psia and mixture ratios between 3 and 6. The experimental combustor comprised seven liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen shear coaxial injector elements and a heat-sink cooled thrust chamber instrumented with 41 <b>coaxial</b> thermocouple <b>pairs</b> to measure axial and circumferential variations and 8 pressure transducers to measure axial variations. An additional three coaxial thermocouples were placed on the injector face. Chamber pressure was varied from 300 to 1200 psia and the O/F ratio was varied from three to six. A total of 19 tests were conducted. Maximum measured wall temperatures were kept near 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. To calculate local heat flux, the thermocouple data were modeled using methods including numerical differentiation formulas and inverse methods including Tikhonov Regularization. Calculated wall heat flux ranged from 8 to 20 Btu/in 2 /sec. Although difficulties were encountered with thermocouple reliability, a high-quality data set was obtained with with experimental uncertainty in the heat flux of approximately 0. 06 Btu/in 2 /sec and demonstrated repeatability. The results of the benchmark study have been assembled for transfer to CFD modelers for validation. Recommendations for improved validation experiments are provided including revised thermocouple design and installation methods, heat flux determination methods, and test article design for maximum utilization of facility and personnel resources. ...|$|R
