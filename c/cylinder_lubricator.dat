The boiler feed was by two Cape pattern Gresham & Craven's no. 8 injectors, while the engine used Gresham & Craven's patent sanding gear and a Nathan no. 8 double sight feed <b>cylinder</b> <b>lubricator.</b> It had steam brakes on two pairs of coupled wheels, while the Type WE tender {{was equipped with}} a vacuum brake for itself and the train. The whistles were one 3 in and one 4 in Star Chime no. 3 types.|$|E

In Korea, a motor-driven <b>cylinder</b> <b>lubricator</b> for a large two-stroke marine diesel engine manufactured by Wärtsilä Switzerland Co., Ltd. was first developed by authors through the joint research of industry-university in 2002. The characteristic of the developed product is that can control automatically the oil feed rate to a load fluctuation by the motor drive and the offset cam. The performance of the product is not also inferior to the conventional one. For manufacturing the reliable and useful products, however, it is necessary to investigate further characteristics and improve the performance of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>lubricator.</b> In this study, the effect of quill with and without accumulator on maximum discharge pressure, delivery delay duration and oil feed rate relative to motor revolution speed using plunger stroke as a parameter is experimentally investigated by using the developed <b>cylinder</b> <b>lubricator.</b> It is found that the maximum discharge pressure with accumulator is higher than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and motor revolution speed are elevated, and the delivery delay duration with accumulator is shorter than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and motor revolution speed are increased. Also, oil feed rate with accumulator is les...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Minimizing the {{cylinder}} wear and the consumption rate of cylinder {{oil in a}} large two-stroke diesel engine is of great economic importance. A motor-driven <b>cylinder</b> <b>lubricator</b> for Sulzer RT-flex large two-stroke diesel engines developed by authors is in need of mounting a quill system to lubricate cylinder parts for a smooth operation. In order to apply the common-rail lubricating system to the developed <b>cylinder</b> <b>lubricator</b> as the second research stage, the mechanical quill system with a progressively quantitative distributor (M. D. S.) is improved in the electronically controlled quill system with an accumulating distributor (E. D. S.). In this study, the effects of lubricator motor speed, plunger stroke and cylinder back pressure on oil feed rate and inequality rate are experimentally investigated by applying E. D. S. to the developed <b>cylinder</b> <b>lubricator.</b> It is found that the oil feed rate of E. D. S. is higher than that of M. D. S. because of the increase of delivery speed and volume by changing the role of accumulator in the same experimental condition. It can be also shown that, in E. D. S., the inequality rate is decreased a little or hardly unchanged as {{the cylinder}} back pressure and plunger stroke is elevated, while the inequality rate increased in M. D. S [...] The inequality rates of E. D. S. and M. D. S. are lowered as the lubricator motor speed is increased.
