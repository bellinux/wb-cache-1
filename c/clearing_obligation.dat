ESMA published the eleventh iteration of its Q&A report on EMIR on October 24, 2014. In the report, ESMA announced that {{any third country}} firm not originally subject to EMIR trade reporting obligations that subsequently becomes a financial counterparty subject to EMIR must comply with the EMIR reporting obligation in respect of all outstanding derivatives contracts.|$|E
50|$|Entities that {{qualify for}} EMIR must report every {{derivative}} contract they enter into to a trade repository. They must also implement new risk management standards according to EMIR, including operational processes and margining {{related to their}} bilateral OTC derivatives. EMIR also covers trades that are not cleared by a central counterparty, and entities that qualify must submit all OTC derivatives subject to a mandatory <b>clearing</b> <b>obligation</b> for review.

50|$|The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) applies {{mandatory}} <b>clearing</b> <b>obligations</b> {{for specific}} OTC derivative contracts if a contract {{has been assigned}} a central counterparty under EMIR. The obligations require that over-the-counter derivatives trades are cleared through central counterparties. EMIR granted a temporary exemption from these guidelines to pension funds until August 2017.|$|R
50|$|Mandatory {{reporting}} for exchange-traded derivatives began in January 2015, and in February {{of the same}} year, a European Commission report recommended an extension to the exemption until August 2017. As of March 2015, EMIR's regulations are under analysis in regards to pension funds, {{with the possibility of}} extending the extension to 2018. As of May 5, 2015, ESMA has been discussing a fourth consultation, this time revisiting the <b>clearing</b> <b>obligation</b> under EMIR. The 2013 report on clearing indicated a need for further analysis of the classes of OTC interest rate derivatives denominated in other currencies than the ones included in the first report, and the 2015 consultation is expected to present new analysis and invite discussion on these other currencies. The consultation is expected to conclude on July 15, 2015.|$|E
40|$|After the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, {{the financial}} innovation product Credit-Default-Swap (CDS) was widely blamed {{as the main}} cause of this crisis. CDS is one type of over-the-counter (OTC) traded derivatives. Before the crisis, the trading of CDS was very popular among the financial institutions. But meanwhile, excessive speculative CDSs transactions in a legal environment of scant regulation accumulated huge risks in the financial system. This dissertation is divided into three parts. In Part I, we discussed the primers of the CDSs and its market development, then we analyzed in detail the roles CDSs had played in this crisis based on economic studies. It is advanced that CDSs not just promoted the eruption of the crisis in 2007 but also exacerbated it in 2008. In part II, we asked ourselves what are the legal origins of this crisis in relation with CDSs, as we believe that financial instruments could only function, positive or negative, under certain legal institutional environment. After an in-depth inquiry, we observed that at least three traditional legal doctrines were eroded or circumvented by OTC derivatives. It is argued that the malfunction of these doctrines, on the one hand, facilitated the proliferation of speculative CDSs transactions; on the other hand, eroded the original risk-control legal mechanism. Therefore, the 2008 crisis could escalate rapidly into a global financial tsunami, which was out of control of the regulators. In Part III, we focused on the European Union’s regulatory reform towards the OTC derivatives market. In specific, EU introduced mandatory central counterparty <b>clearing</b> <b>obligation</b> for qualified OTC derivatives, and requires that all OTC derivatives shall be reported to a trade repository. It is observable that EU’s approach in re-regulating the derivatives market is different with the traditional administrative regulation, but aiming at constructing a new market infrastructure for OTC derivatives...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the process}} of {{globalization}} and rapid economic evolution in the last several years, transnational corporations have become extremely powerful. There is an evident disproportion between the numerous rights enjoyed by transnational corporations and the scarce obligations undertaken by them. Given their transnational nature, transnational corporations have been successfully avoiding national regulations of both their home and host states, and they are seeking to operate in countries with the lowest standards so as to increase their profits. This has resulted in the violation of basic human rights. Therefore, there is an increasing need for the creation of international instruments addressed to transnational corporations with express and <b>clear</b> <b>obligations</b> aimed at the respect of human rights.

40|$|Governments {{are striving}} to define the terms of {{international}} cooperation to address climate change. This paper considers whether there are {{lessons to be learned}} from more than six decades of international cooperation on trade through the GATT/WTO. It argues that in comparison to trade cooperation, the climate change negotiations are taking place against a background of great uncertainty, a long gap in time between actions and results, significant distributional issues, basic differences among parties in terms of the appropriate balance of national responsibilities for action, and sharp differences over policy approaches. All these factors make the negotiations more complex and less likely to result in the kind of detailed policy commitments that characterize the GATT/WTO. Nevertheless, the paper argues that excessive imprecision or reliance or voluntarism at the national level will result in insufficient effort to address the challenges of climate change. A universal agreement with differentiated but <b>clear</b> <b>obligations,</b> a phased approach to the assumption of these obligations, and creative flexibilities offer the best chance of success. trade policy, international trade organizations, trade and environment, government policy,...|$|R

Implementation would improve the flow of information within and among government institutions, enterprises and citizens to bring about social and economic benefits. This would transform the mode of delivery of public services from traditional face-to-face interaction to online channels to ensure that citizens and business entities could access services anywhere and anytime. (Government, Z., 2017 a, b). This steadily was implemented through the use of E-Services using government agencies such as the Patent and Company Registration Agency (PACRA) and the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) that enabled SMEs to perform services through the websites and payments.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{question}} of possible effect of the law of international criminal procedure for domestic war crimes trials. With the increasing number of national prosecutions for war crimes this question will gain in relevance. The article starts with an exploration of the origin and development of the law of international criminal procedure, to reach the conclusion that {{because of the lack of}} a strong foundation it is difficult to discern firmly established rules in this field. Next, two areas are examined where the law of international criminal procedure is capable of producing effect for national trials: human rights and rules that have developed in the specific context of war crimes prosecutions. Whether rules of international criminal procedure are formally effective in the domestic legal order remains to be seen. There is no <b>clear</b> <b>obligation</b> under international law to do so. Furthermore, the law of international criminal procedure may be difficult to harmonise with domestic inquisitorial systems. In spite of these difficulties, the article concludes that national courts will increasingly face similar procedural problems in complex war crimes trials as international criminal tribunals and will be happy to learn from their experiences...|$|R

Next, we develop an algorithm that both clears the financial system in a computationally efficient fashion and provides information on the systemic risk faced by the individual system firms. Finally, we produce qualitative comparative statics for financial systems. These comparative statics imply that, in contrast to single-firm results, even unsystematic, nondissipative shocks to the system will lower the total value of the system and may lower the value of the equity of some of the individual system firms.
