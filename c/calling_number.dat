40|$|The <b>call</b> <b>number</b> {{system that}} we use in this library, which is called the Library of Congress Classification System, is an {{arrangement}} by subject. <b>Call</b> <b>numbers</b> in this system begin {{with one or two}} letters, which represent broad subject areas. If you know what letter indicates the classification for the subject you need, you can find out what print materials we have in the library relevant to your subject. You can find reference books to help you in that field by browsing the <b>call</b> <b>numbers</b> starting with that letter in the Reference Section on the second floor. You can find out what journals we have in that subject by looking for <b>call</b> <b>numbers</b> beginning with that letter in the Periodicals Area on the first floor. You can even get a general idea of how large a collection of books we have in that field by browsing in that area in the collection of circulating books, on the third or fourth floor. In the catalog, you can do a <b>call</b> <b>number</b> search; if you put {{in the first part of}} a <b>call</b> <b>number,</b> it will pull up all of the items with <b>call</b> <b>numbers</b> which begin with that.

50|$|Caller ID (caller {{identification}}, CID), {{also called}} calling line identification (CLID), <b>calling</b> <b>number</b> delivery (CND), <b>calling</b> <b>number</b> identification (CNID), calling line identification presentation (CLIP), or call display, is a telephone service, available in analog and digital telephone systems, including VoIP, that transmits a caller's telephone number to the called party's telephone equipment {{when the call}} is being set up. The caller ID service may include the transmission of a name associated with the calling telephone number. This service is called CNAM.|$|E

50|$|Telephone {{exchange}} {{equipment manufacturers}} {{vary in their}} handling of caller name display. Much of the equipment manufactured for Bell System companies in the United States sends only the caller's number to the distant exchange; that switch must then use a database lookup to find the name to display with the <b>calling</b> <b>number.</b> Canadian landline exchanges often run Nortel equipment which sends the name along with the number. Mobile, CLEC, Internet or independent exchanges also vary in their handling of caller name, depending on the switching equipment manufacturer. Calls between numbers in differing country codes represent a further complication, as Caller ID often displays the local portion of the <b>calling</b> <b>number</b> without indicating a country of origin or in a format that can {{be mistaken for a}} domestic or invalid number.|$|E

50|$|Each {{subscriber}} in an MPT-1327 trunked {{radio network}} {{has a unique}} <b>call</b> <b>number.</b> This <b>call</b> <b>number</b> (address) is a compound number consisting of a prefix (three digits), the fleet number and the subscriber's <b>call</b> <b>number</b> within the fleet. Different numbering schemes work differently, for example Zetron uses the first two digits of the Ident as the fleet number, and the last two digits as the unit number. Idents in the 6,000-6,999 range are typically used to establish group calls. After it has been entered the <b>call</b> <b>number</b> will be converted in the mobile to a 20-bit address. The numbering rules are clarified and expanded by supplementary standards such as MPT-1343.|$|R

50|$|Libraries and {{indexing}} services {{handle them}} in various ways. The Library of Congress catalogs {{each part of}} them as an individual book with an individual <b>call</b> <b>number</b> and ISBN and a series note (technically a series added entry for the overall series, which has its ISSN, and usually a <b>call</b> <b>number.</b> As the Library of Congress receives two copies of most scholarly books as copyright deposits, it normally keeps one by individual <b>call</b> <b>number</b> and one by series <b>call</b> <b>number.</b> Most other libraries do not have that luxury and have to choose.

5000|$|In 2002, Mustafa Skaf (his father) {{was accused}} of {{offering}} a bribe to a prison officer. Mr Skaf allegedly phoned the maximum security facility at 1.30 pm on Wednesday, 22 September 2002, and was put through to a duty officer. He gave his name and telephone number and asked to speak to his son. When the officer told him that outside calls had to be booked in advance and approved for set times, Mr Skaf offered to pay $100 to be put through to his son. The officer dismissed the offer and ended the conversation. He immediately called the number from the <b>calling</b> <b>number</b> display and Mustafa Skaf answered.|$|E
5000|$|However, CNID and ANI are not {{the same}} thing. ANI was {{originally}} a term given to a system that identified the telephone number placing a call, in a non-electronic central office switch. Previous to this, the <b>calling</b> <b>number</b> could not be identified electronically. Caller ID is made up of two separate pieces of information: the <b>calling</b> <b>number</b> and the billing (or subscriber) name where available. When a call is made from a given name, this name can be passed on through a number of different methods. For example, the caller's name may be datafilled in the originating switch, in which case it is sent along with the number. More commonly, a database is accessed by the receiving switch, in order to match the number to a name. If the name does not exist, then the city, State, Province, or other designation may be sent. Some of these databases may be shared among several companies, each paying every time a name is [...] "extracted". It {{is for this reason that}} mobile phone callers appear as WIRELESS CALLER, or the location where the phone number is registered (these vary based on which company owns the block of numbers, not the provider to which a number may have been ported). Additionally, nothing ensures that the number sent by a switch is the actual number where the call originated; the telephone switch initiating the call may send any digit string desired as caller ID. As such, the telephone switch, and therefore the operating entity, must also be trusted to provide secure authentication.|$|E

50|$|In seven-digit dialing {{the area}} code is only dialed when the area {{code of the}} called number is {{different}} {{than that of the}} <b>calling</b> <b>number.</b> Some communities on an area code boundary, such as Ottawa-Hull (613/819), Kansas City MO/KS (816/913) or Washington, D.C. (202) implemented central office code protection to ensure the same seven-digit local number was not assigned in two different area codes in the same city to retain seven-digit dialing in the entire community. Code protection is not possible for calls across area code boundaries within split plan cities where area codes have been added due to a shortage of available local numbers; these local calls became ten digits when the code was split.|$|E
50|$|When a {{cell phone}} {{receives}} a call made to an office number, the caller ID display would normally show the office as the caller, since the call is routed though the PBX. When the client software {{on the cell phone}} can pre-empt the built-in phone software (depends on the handset and client software vendor) this caller ID is suppressed and the mobility controller passes the correct <b>calling</b> <b>number</b> and name to the client software on the handset using the cellular data channel. Alternatively, depending on the PBX and carrier, the system may be able to insert the caller ID of the person calling into the regular caller ID notification (caller ID spoofing). This will show the 'correct' caller ID even on the built-in handset interface.|$|E
50|$|According to Telcordia GR-283-CORE, the Simplified Message Desk Interface (SMDI) is {{an analog}} {{interface}} between the local stored program controlled switching system (SPCS) and a message storage and retrieval (MSR) system. Calls are {{distributed to the}} call answering points with normal call processing or using multiline hunt group (MLHG) features. One or more MLHGs {{may be associated with}} the same set of SMDI data links. An identification scheme is assigned in the SPCS to identify each MLHG uniquely and each line in the MLHG, for which call information (e.g., <b>calling</b> <b>number)</b> is provided over the SMDI data link. This identification information is provided to the MSR system, with the call information, to help the MSR system correlate the call information with a call terminating on a particular line.|$|E

5000|$|Service Switching Function (SSF) or Service Switching Point (SSP) is {{co-located}} {{with the}} telephone exchange, and {{acts as the}} trigger point for further services to be invoked during a call. The SSP implements the Basic Call State Machine (BCSM) which is a Finite state machine that represents an abstract view of a call {{from beginning to end}} (off hook, dialing, answer, no answer, busy, hang up, etc.). As each state is traversed, the exchange encounters Detection Points (DPs) at which the SSP may invoke a query to the SCP to wait for further instructions on how to proceed. This query is usually called a trigger. Trigger criteria are defined by the operator and might include the subscriber <b>calling</b> <b>number</b> or the dialed number. The SSF is responsible for controlling calls requiring value added services.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} the main type of memory used in the TXE2 (and the TXE4) was {{particularly}} characteristic of the general design philosophy, that the components used had to be of a technology that had been tested over many years. The choice thus went to the 'Dimond ring' type of memory, named after T. L. Dimond of Bell Laboratories, who invented them in 1945. They were large-diameter magnetic ferrite toroidal rings with solenoid windings, through which are threaded writing and reading wires. This set-up is shown fairly clearly in the picture (above) of the Ambergate <b>Calling</b> <b>Number</b> Generator (CNG) and Class of Service (COS) racks. These racks gave the ability to convert a subscriber's directory number into an equipment location identity. This was a considerable innovation in British exchanges, since in Strowger exchanges the directory and equipment numbers {{had to be the}} same.|$|E
