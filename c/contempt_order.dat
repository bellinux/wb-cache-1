25|$|On August 17, 2006, Anderson again {{refused to}} testify before the grand jury {{investigating}} Bonds. Judge Alsup ordered Anderson to return to court August 28 for a contempt hearing. In requesting the hearing, prosecutors for the first time publicly acknowledged they were targeting Bonds. Anderson was held in contempt of court at the August 28 hearing and sent to federal prison for a second time. Judge Alsup said Anderson had provided no legal justification for refusing to tell the grand jury on August 17 whether he had supplied steroids to Bonds or other athletes, or even whether he knew Bonds. Geragos said he would file an appeal with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Anderson was released from prison on October 5, after serving 37 days. Judge Alsup ordered his release because the federal appeals court hadn't affirmed the <b>contempt</b> <b>order</b> within the required 30 days after Anderson was jailed. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal had sent the <b>contempt</b> <b>order</b> back to Judge Alsup, thus delaying any ruling.|$|E
2500|$|In 19841985, Russell Sanborn {{was charged}} with first degree murder. Sanborn was {{represented}} by three attorneys at different times, each of whom withdrew from the case. Sanborn's mother, a fruit peddler, asked Rubin to represent Sanborn pro bono. Rubin entered the case and was prepared for trial however on {{the date of the}} trial, Rubin petitioned the court to withdraw, implying strongly that Sanborn was planning to give false testimony and he would not defend a client who would lie on the stand. His petition was denied, and Rubin sought certiorari by the Third District Court of Appeal, which also denied the petition. When the case was rescheduled, Rubin again sought to withdraw on the same grounds and again was denied and ordered to proceed to trial. When he again refused, the court issued a <b>contempt</b> <b>order</b> (affirmed on appeal in Rubin v. State) denying review of the district court decision and denying Rubin's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Rubin was ordered to serve 37 days in jail for contempt of court.|$|E
2500|$|A Virginia District Court {{held that}} he had no legal basis to refuse to testify. The court held him in civil {{contempt}}, and imprisoned him on November 16, 2006, for contempt of court, with the days served for civil contempt not counting towards the days of imprisonment he had remaining on his guilty conspiracy plea. He appealed the Virginia District Court decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the lower court's ruling. Thirteen months later, on December 14, 2007, the Virginia District Court lifted its <b>contempt</b> <b>order,</b> starting the clock ticking again on his days-served on his conspiracy guilty plea sentence. A Florida District Court also held that the plea agreement was not ambiguous, and did not prevent the government from issuing a subpoena requiring him to testify before a grand jury. Al-Arian, who is diabetic, began a 60-day hunger strike on January 22, 2007, to [...] "protest continued government harassment." [...] By March 20, 2007, the [...] Al-Arian had gone from [...] Al-Arian appealed the Florida District Court decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court on January 25, 2008. It pointed out that the plea agreement did not contain any mention of whether Al-Arian would be compelled to testify in front of a grand jury in the future. It also noted that the agreement said it reflected all promises and agreements between Al-Arian and the government, and that this accorded with Al-Arian's statement, when questioned by the trial court judge, that there were no promises or inducements made to him other than those reflected in the written agreement. Furthermore, the court observed that the plea agreement only spoke to the issue of the government prosecuting Al-Arian for crimes known to the office {{at the time of the}} agreement, but did not immunize Al-Arian from future subpoenas. The court therefore held the plea agreement to be clear, unambiguous, and to not grant Al-Arian immunity from the grand jury subpoena. The Justice Department issued its third subpoena later that month.|$|E

On December 26, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed Schiff's convictions except for the criminal contempt convictions. The Court vacated the contempt convictions because of the failure of the trial court judge to file <b>contempt</b> <b>orders</b> under rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.|$|R

In April 2006, the Dinosaur Adventure Land buildings were closed by county officials, and the Florida circuit court found the owners in <b>contempt,</b> <b>ordering</b> fines of $500 for each day the buildings were used. Hovind argued {{he did not need}} a permit {{due to the nature of}} the building, but after a 5-year court battle over the $50 building permit, on June 5, 2006, Hovind pleaded nolo contendere as charged to three counts: constructing a building without a permit, refusing to sign a citation, and violating the county building code. Hovind paid fines totaling $675.|$|R

40|$|At {{the time}} of this writing, recent events in Ferguson, Baltimore, New York City, and {{elsewhere}} have triggered quite justified social outrage at debtors’ prisons. Our country’s state and city courts keep scores of indigent people in jail for the crime of being poor, despite the Supreme Court’s clear prohibition on the practice. Skilled litigators and their journalist allies have seized on the moment to win victories in court and in the public eye, which prevent unconscionable bond and probation practices and try to reduce our burgeoning jail populations. Lost in the uproar, though, are the many ways that a savvy anti-defendant judge could insulate herself from corrective litigation, evade effective judicial oversight, and essentially perpetuate current debtors’ prisons by using pretextual sanctions and <b>contempt</b> <b>orders</b> to circumvent Bearden v. Georgia indigency determinations...|$|R

[...] On that same day, the Executive Branch—i.e., a U.S. Marshal—attempted to execute Taney's writ of attachment, but the U.S. Marshal was refused entry into the fort. However, there is no concrete evidence that Cadwalader was in receipt of those instructions prior to the time the Marshal was refused entrance at Fort McHenry; indeed, {{there is no evidence}} that Cadwalader ever received those instructions from Army Headquarters. Because the Marshal was unable to serve the attachment, the citation for contempt was never actually adjudicated, and at the end of the Merryman litigation, it became a nullity, as do all civil <b>contempt</b> <b>orders</b> at the termination of litigation.|$|R

This culminated in the CFMEU's picketing of at least one entrance to the Emporium development which resulted in an impassable physical barrier, preventing access to the site through that entrance for Grocon workers. Grocon subsequently launched a 10.5 million compensation claim in the Supreme Court of Victoria for the blockade. It is also seeking <b>contempt</b> <b>orders</b> against the union for allegedly breaching two Supreme Court injunctions that ordered an end to the blockade. Justice Cavanough held that free access to the site for Grocon workers was prevented by the CFMEU as access could only be obtained through 'elaborate' police assistance. The Fair Work Building and Construction (the relevant regulatory body) has subsequently also launched legal proceedings against the CFMEU.|$|R

Perry {{could not have been}} a fugitive at the time he moved to Mexico, he wrote, since the contempt citations were issued after he went there. He noted that the <b>contempt</b> <b>orders</b> from the probate court stemmed from his failure to return to the Levines a beaded evening bag and a baby blanket, which he called [...] "patently insignificant grounds" [...] for what he characterized as [...] "the Levines' vindictive attempt to deprive March of his day in court." [...] He also noted that the Levines exceeded the authority of the Mexican court order, which only allowed them to take the children as far as Guadalajara, and that by taking them back to Nashville the Levines and their son had incurred kidnapping charges in Mexico, for which an arrest warrant (later dismissed) had been issued.|$|R
