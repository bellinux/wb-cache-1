40|$|AbstractProteins of {{all living}} organisms must reach their {{subcellular}} destination {{to sustain the}} cell structure and function. The proteins are transported {{to one of the}} cellular <b>compartments,</b> <b>inserted</b> into the membrane, or secreted across the membrane to the extracellular milieu. Cells have developed various mechanisms to transport proteins across membranes, among them localized translation. Evidence for targeting of Messenger RNA for the sake of translation of their respective protein products at specific subcellular sites in many eukaryotic model organisms have been accumulating in recent years. Cis-acting RNA localizing elements, termed RNA zip-codes, which are embedded within the mRNA sequence, are recognized by RNA-binding proteins, which in turn interact with motor proteins, thus coordinating the intracellular transport of the mRNA transcripts. Despite the rareness of conventional organelles, first and foremost a nucleus, pieces of evidence for mRNA localization to specific subcellular domains, where their protein products function, have also been obtained for prokaryotes. Although the underlying mechanisms for transcript localization in bacteria are yet to be unraveled, it is now obvious that intracellular localization of mRNA is a common mechanism to spatially localize proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

30|$|The most {{consistent}} observation from our review is that lesions classified as benign {{often do not}} show significant internal enhancement. Those that enhance (such as haemangiomas, schwannomas) tend to be homogeneous. They also usually demonstrate smooth margins and homogeneous signal on T 2 w sequence while intermediate-grade and malignant lesions tend to show more heterogeneous signal. Larger benign lesions may show lobulated margins, insinuate around adjacent structures or <b>cross</b> <b>compartments</b> (such as large lipomas), resembling intermediate-grade lesions in this respect. However, the surrounding fat planes are preserved, while intermediate-grade lesions (such as desmoplastic fibromas) may show loss of surrounding fat planes. Bony scalloping with no overt bony destruction is suggestive of an intermediate-grade lesion (GCTTS, glomus tumours, neurofibromas). Frank bony destruction and irregular, infiltrative margins certainly suggest a malignant lesion. One exception is benign lipomas, which {{are more likely to}} demonstrate insinuating margins and <b>crossing</b> of <b>compartments</b> than liposarcomas [24]. We postulate that benign lipomas tend to be softer and hence insinuate more easily than their malignant counterpart. Another exception is that of soft tissue sarcomas. Despite their malignant nature, they may show fairly well-defined or lobulated margins and can be confused with the intermediate-grade lesions radiologically. In these situations, the pattern of enhancement can be a useful distinguishing feature. Malignant lesions tend to show heterogeneous enhancement while intermediate-grade lesions tend to enhance homogeneously. Another notable exception is that of nodular fasciitis. While this is a benign entity and almost never recurs after excision, the heterogeneous signal and enhancement on MR resembles that of a malignant lesion, such as the case of pleomorphic sarcoma. Only histological examination confirms the benign nature of this lesion and avoids more extensive surgery.|$|R

40|$|The {{striatum}} is key for action-selection and {{the motivation}} to move. Dopamine and acetylcholine release sites are enriched in the striatum and are cross-regulated, possibly to achieve optimal behavior. Drugs of abuse, which promote abnormally high dopamine release, disrupt normal action-selection and drive restricted, repetitive behaviors (stereotypies). Stereotypies occur {{in a variety of}} disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia and Huntington's disease, as well as in addictive states. The severity of drug-induced stereotypy is correlated with induction of c-Fos expression in striosomes, a striatal compartment that is related to the limbic system and that directly projects to dopamine-producing neurons of the substantia nigra. These characteristics of striosomes contrast with the properties of the extra-striosomal matrix, which has strong sensorimotor and associative circuit inputs and outputs. Disruption of acetylcholine signaling in the striatum blocks the striosome-predominant c-Fos expression pattern induced by drugs of abuse and alters drug-induced stereotypy. The activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons is associated with behaviors related to sensory cues, and cortical inputs to striosomes can bias action-selection in the face of conflicting cues. The neurons and neuropil of striosomes and matrix neurons have observably separate distributions, both at the input level in the striatum and at the output level in the substantia nigra. Notably, cholinergic axons readily <b>cross</b> <b>compartment</b> borders, providing a potential route for local cross-compartment communication to maintain a balance between striosomal and matrix activity. We show here, by slice electrophysiology in transgenic mice, that repetitive evoked firing patterns in striosomal and matrix striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are interrupted by optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons either by the addition or the deletion of spikes. We demonstrate that this cholinergic modulation of projection neurons is blocked in brain slices taken from mice exposed to amphetamine and engaged in amphetamine-induced stereotypy, and lacking responsiveness to salient cues. Our findings support a model whereby activity in striosomes is normally under strong regulation by cholinergic interneurons, favoring behavioral flexibility, but that in animals with drug-induced stereotypy, this cholinergic signaling breaks down, resulting in differential modulation of striosomal activity and an inability to bias action-selection according to relevant sensory cues.

P- 32 distribution measured by densitometry {{on the day of}} harvest closely agreed with values obtained by liquid scintillation counting after destructive harvest. Virtually all labeled PO 4 was absorbed by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) hyphae, but transfer to the roots appeared to be incomplete.

However, clinical diagnosis is often difficult; thus, the use of imaging is required to demonstrate neurovascular compression and to determine the nature and location of the structure undergoing compression and the structure producing the compression. Cervical plain radiography should be performed first to assess for bone abnormalities and to narrow the differential diagnosis. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed in association with postural maneuvers is helpful in analyzing the dynamically induced compression.

These results suggest that inhalation of linalool oxide may be a useful means of counteracting anxiety...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective is to {{identify}} epidemiologic and radiologic criteria allowing specific diagnoses of tumors and tumor-like lesions in the hip region and pelvis, and to optimize pre-operative staging. Patients with pelvic tumors are usually older, and their tumors are larger relative to patients with tumors in extremities. The majority of tumors in the pelvis are malignant (metastases, myeloma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing-, osteo-, and MFH/fibrosarcoma), while those in the proximal femur are in majority benign (fibrous dysplasia, solitary bone cyst, and osteoid osteoma). Soft tissue masses in the thigh in the elderly are typically sarcomas without tumor specific signs. Common tumor-like lesions occurring in the hip and pelvis that can mimic neoplasm are: infections (including tuberculosis), insufficiency/avulsion fractures, cysts, fibrous dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cyst, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and Paget's disease. Local MR staging {{is based on the}} compartmental anatomy. The psoas and gluteal muscles are easily invaded by sarcoma originating in the ileum. The pectineus muscle protects the neurovascular bundle {{at the level of the}} hip. The thigh is separated into three compartments, some structures (Sartorius muscle) <b>cross</b> borders between <b>compartments.</b> Immobile joints (SI-joints, osteoarthritic hip) are relatively easily crossed by sarcoma and giant cell tumor...|$|R
