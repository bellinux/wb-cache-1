50|$|In {{humans and}} other mammal species, sex is {{determined}} by two sex chromosomes called the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. Human females are typically XX; males are typically XY. The remaining pairs of chromosome are found in both sexes and are called autosomes; genetic traits due to loci on these chromosomes are described as autosomal, and may be dominant or recessive. Genetic traits on the X and Y chromosomes are called sex-linked, because they are linked to sex chromosomes, {{not because they are}} characteristic of one sex or the other. In practice, the term almost always refers to X-linked traits and a great many such traits (such as red-green <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiency)</b> are not affected by sex. Females have two copies of every gene locus found on the X chromosome, just as for the autosomes, and the same dominance relationships apply. Males however have only one copy of each X chromosome gene locus, and are described as hemizygous for these genes. The Y chromosome is much smaller than the X, and contains a much smaller set of genes, including, but not limited to, those that influence 'maleness', such as the SRY gene for testis determining factor. Dominance rules for sex-linked gene loci are determined by their behavior in the female: because the male has only one allele (except in the case of certain types of Y chromosome aneuploidy), that allele is always expressed regardless of whether it is dominant or recessive.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, great {{advances}} {{have been made}} in our understanding of the molecular basis of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> defects, {{as well as of the}} patterns of genetic variation in individuals with normal <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> Molecular genetic analyses have explained the diversity of types and degrees of severity in <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> anomalies, their frequencies, pronounced individual variations in test results, etc. New techniques have even enabled the determination of John Dalton’s real <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> defect, 150 years after his death. Inherited <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies</b> most often result from the mutations of genes that encode cone opsins. Cone opsin genes are linked to chromosomes 7 (the S or “blue” gene) and X (the L or “red” gene and the M or “green” gene). The L and M genes are located on the q arm of the X chromosome in a head-to-tail array, composed of 2 to 6 (typically 3) genes - a single L is followed by one or more M genes. Only the first two genes of the array are expressed and contribute to the <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> phenotype. The high degree of homology (96 %) between the L and M genes predisposes them to unequal recombination, leading to gene deletion or the formation of hybrid genes (comprising portions of both the L and M genes), explaining the majority of the common red-green <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> The severity of any deficiency is influenced by the difference in spectral sensitivity between the opsins encoded by the first two genes of the array. A rare defect, S monochromacy, is caused either by the deletion of the regulatory region of the array or by mutations that inactivate the L and M genes. Most recent research concerns the molecular basis of complete achromatopsia, a rare disorder that involves the complete loss of all cone function. This is not caused by mutations in opsin genes, but in other genes that encode cone-specific proteins, e. g. channel proteins and transducin...|$|R

Selection criteria comprised the absence of visual dysfunctions other than Daltonism and no history of systemic diseases that could impair the visual system performance. Results from <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> deficient were compared with those from 127 normal trichromats, 29. 3 ± 10. 3 years old. For the MR test, measurements were taken around five points of the CIE 1976 colour space, along 20 directions irradiating from each point, {{in order to determine}} with high-resolution the corresponding colour discrimination ellipses (MacAdam ellipses). Three parameters were used to compare results obtained from different subjects: diameter of circle with same ellipse area, ratio between ellipse's long and short axes, and ellipse long axis angle. For the FM 100 test, the parameters were: logarithm {{of the total number of}} mistakes and positions of mistakes in the FM diagram. Data were also simultaneously analysed in two or three dimensions as well as by using multidimensional cluster analysis. For the MR test, Mollon-Reffin Ellipse # 3 (u' = 0. 225, v' = 0. 415) discriminated more efficiently than the other four ellipses between protans and deutans once it provided larger angular difference in the colour space between protan and deutan confusion lines.

40|$|Purpose: Visual {{discrimination}} skills, like discrimination {{of motion}} and colour, improve throughout adolescence in normal trichromats. Some adult carriers of red-green <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies</b> exhibit reduced <b>colour</b> discrimination, but {{little is known}} about colour discrimination abilities in young carriers. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the colour discrimination abilities of young obligatory carriers. Methods: 100 normal trichromatic females (aged 18. 28 (± 7. 11) years) and 30 obligatory carriers of red-green <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies</b> (8 protan carriers and 22 deutan carriers, aged 32. 07 (± 15. 5) years) were tested with a battery of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests comprising Ishihara (24 pl. ed.), Hardy-Rand-Rittler 4 thed. (HRR 2002), Neitz Test of Color <b>Vision</b> (NTCV), Cambridge <b>Colour</b> Test (CCT), Farnsworth- 100 -Hue Test (FM 100 -Hue), HMC anomaloscope (both Rayleigh and Moreland matches) and Medmont C- 100. The results are presented for four different age groups (9 - 12, 18 - 29, 30 - 39 and 40 +). Results: Carriers aged 9 - 12 years failed the pseudoisochromatic (PIC) tests more often than their normal trichromatic peers. These tests were failed by 80 % of deutan carriers and 50 % of protan carriers, but only 20 % of normal trichromats in the same age group. These figures decreased to 75 %, 20 % and 12 %, respectively, in the 30 - 39 year age group. Colour discrimination, as assessed by the FM 100 -Hue test, improved with age for both groups, but the carriers’ performance was, on average, poorer than that of normal trichromats. Variability in the FM 100 -Hue error scores was significantly greater for the 9 - 12 year age group, compared to the three older age groups, both for normal trichromats and for carriers. Protan carriers required, on average, more red and deutan carriers required more green, compared to normal trichromatic females, when tested on the Rayleigh match and the Medmont C- 100 tests. However, the Medmont C- 100 failed to identify protan and deutan carriers amongst the normal trichromats and the null-point settings of all three groups overlapped considerably. Conclusion: The results imply that some young female carriers may have exacerbated problems with colour discrimination due to the combined effects of being a carrier and having an immature visual system. The improvement in colour discrimination with age seen in normal trichromats is also evident in carriers of red-green <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Deutan carriers scored significantly worse on the <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests used, which shows that they have poorer <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> than protan carriers. The results from the Rayleigh anomaloscope and the Medmont C- 100 tests imply that it may be possible to classify known obligate carriers as either protan or deutan carriers...|$|R

40|$|Four studies {{including}} ten experiments adresses {{interrelations between}} some major and classical issues in visual perception: 3 -D perception, colour constancy, colour perception and <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> The main experimental paradigm {{to investigate the}} issues is within that of simulated shape from shading. 3 -D impressions are induced by projecting space-modulated illuminations onto flat surfaces (displays), varying the colours and layout of the displays and the colour and modulation of the illumination. Study I includes four experiments investigating three types of space- modulated illumination. All experiments confirmed earlier findings that chromatic colour and complex display layout with reflectance edges crossed by illumination edges enhances shape from shading. In Study II the impressions of shape from shading and real 3 -D objects were compared between persons with deutan <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and normals. As predicted, the deutans show fewer and less distinct 3 -D impressions in situations with their specific "problem colours" red and green. They also show a generally lower tendency for 3 -D impressions, interpreted as a generally weaker colour constancy. Study III presents the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon; a novel twofold ambiguous shape from shading situation, continuously alternating between two different 3 -D impressions coupled with different colour attributions. One solution is of an object with two clear surface colours, the other one of an object with greyish (desaturated) colours in coloured illumination which means classical colour constancy. The phenomenon illustrates the visual processes of separating reflectance and illumination characteristics and may provide a useful experimental setting to study colour constancy. In Study IV the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon {{is found to be}} robust as to chromaticness and different luminance contrasts for both normals and deutans. However, the deutans show slower shifts between percepts and a less pronounced desaturation of colour, which indicates a weaker colour constancy. The studies add evidence to the contribution of colour to 3 -D shape perception, validated in a novel way by the results on "colour-blinds". The AMBEGUJAS phenomenon provides further support that the factors affecting shape from shading and the deutans different impressions are to be understood with reference to colour constancy. The deutans different impressions compared to normals are remarkable per se, but probably with very limited implications to everyday life. Diss.

40|$|Abstract: The {{evaluation}} of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> and discrimination {{of an individual}} forms {{an integral part of}} routine eye and <b>vision</b> examinations. <b>Colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies</b> have a high prevalence and defects of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> can be detected in an optometric practice by means of a variety of tests available. <b>Colour</b> <b>vision</b> can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively using tests that are sometimes grouped as arrangement, matching and vocational tests or pseudo-isochromatic plates. Specifically, a more sophisticated computerised procedure, the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT) was developed using the basic principles of traditional pseudo-isochromatic plates and modern technology of randomized luminance to evaluate colour function or discrimination. Unlike previous computerised <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests, an advantage of this (CCT) computer-controlled test is that the difference in chromaticity between target and background is adjusted automatically according to the performance of the patient, thereby preventing a loss of time needed in calculating preliminary equations of luminance for each subject or for each part of the visual field. This {{is believed to be the}} first study that aims to extensively investigate the reliability and repeatability of results produced by the two testing protocols of the CCT, namely the Trivector test and the Ellipse test’s shorter 8 -vector and longer 20 -vector testing method, using both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results from this dissertation provide test and retest reliability measures (including, for example, Coefficients of Repeatability) and new parameters on discrimination ellipses that are not provided by the CCT were calculated to better understand the results that are produced by participants with normal trichromatic vision. Although not the purpose here, limited normative data has also been provided in this study, which perhaps can be used comparatively with past and future studies. Multiple CCT measurements, using both the Trivector and Ellipse tests were performed for the right eye only of each participant selected. Where necessary, colour tests were performed through the habitual spectacle compensation for the right eye concerned. Two measurements (test and retest) of both the Trivector test and also the Ellipse test were measured for all participants (N= 20) to assess the reliability of test and retest measurements, and the 8 - and 20 -vector testing methods were both performed twice on all subjects (N= 20) to investigate which CCT test protocol produces the most reliable results and whether or not the 8 - and 20 -vector methods could be used interchangeably.

40|$|Introduction Colour {{codes are}} used {{extensively}} in railways to convey specific information governing movement of trains and equipment on the track. One such task is the railway traffic control display that uses colour coded video display terminals (VDTs) to convey information {{of the signal}} status, train movements and track status to the railway dispatcher. Because individuals with <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies</b> (colour-defectives) may have problems with these colour-related tasks, questions were raised about the suitability of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> defectives to work as railway dispatchers. In order to answer that, a VDT based Dispatch <b>Colour</b> <b>Vision</b> Test based on the actual railway traffic display was developed previously. Purpose The main purpose of this thesis is to establish the pass/fail scores and repeatability of the VDT based Dispatch <b>Colour</b> <b>Vision</b> Test that resulted from the previous work. Secondly, the study will also examine whether clinical <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests can predict the performance on the practical task. Methods The Dispatch <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> test was divided into three parts based on the colour sets that the dispatcher had to recognize. The testing computer system used the the same RGB colour settings, graphics card and monitor as in railway dispatch centres. Subjects viewed the display colours and entered their responses by using a mouse. One hundred colour-normals and fifty two colour-defectives participated in the initial session. The test was repeated approximately after 10 days. Ninety three colour-normals (93 %) and 44 (85 %) colour-defectives participated in the second session. The total number of errors and time to complete the test was recorded. Results Pass/Fail on the VDT Dispatch <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> test was based on colour-normal errors. Ignoring orange-red errors, two errors were allowed in the first session and one error was allowed in the second session. Based on this criterion, 42 % of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> defectives could perform as well as colour normal subjects. The kappa coefficient of agreement between the sessions for the colour-defectives was 0. 85. Detailed analysis between the colour differences and the errors showed only a weak correlation between the two. However, the general trend was that colour-defectives made more errors on colours that were near or {{along the same lines}} of confusions and the colours were nearly equal in luminance. Nevertheless, the interaction between luminance and location with respect to the lines of confusion was not easy to interpret. The time to complete the task for the colour-defectives who passed the test took 14 % longer than colour-normals and colour-defectives who failed took 30 % longer than colour-normals. All groups showed a similar learning effect with an 18 % reduction in mean times to complete the task at the second session. There was no significant correlation between the number of errors and time to complete or the clinical tests and completion times for any of the groups. Clinical <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests have limited value in predicting performance of colour-defectives on the Dispatch test. Logistic analysis results showed that the Farnsworth D- 15 along with the Nagel was the best predictor of the VDT Dispatch colour test pass/fail results. However, these results were similar to using the Farnsworth D- 15 test alone. Ninety-five percent of the individuals who failed the Farnsworth D- 15 also failed the Dispatch test. However, approximately 25 % of the individuals who passed the Farnsworth D- 15 failed the VDT Dispatch colour test which is an unacceptable false negative rate. These results indicate the Farnsworth D- 15 can only be used to predict who is likely to fail the dispatch test. Conclusions Forty two percent of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> defectives could perform as well as colour-normals in identifying VDT railway display colours and time to complete the task. Clinical <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests were inadequate predictors of performance in practical task, overall. However, the Farnsworth D- 15 was a very good predictor of who would fail the VDT Dispatch test. Hence a practical VDT Dispatch test may be needed to test individuals who would want to work as railway dispatchers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Measuring colour {{discrimination}} {{of people who}} carry out tasks where colour is used to convey information and accurate colour judgments are essential for safe and efficient performance of the task is important {{in order to ensure}} that they can carry out the tasks. Individuals with congenital <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are at a greater risk in making an error in colour judgment and this is the primary reason for <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> testing in industry. Today, there are a large number of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests to detect <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and/or estimate one’s ability to discriminate colours. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the validity and repeatability of new <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> test “Colour Vision Reaction Time” (CVRT) for screening for <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> defect. The study will also determine the repeatability of a selection of clinical <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests, which are currently in use. Material and methods: The test series was administrated to 75 colour normal subjects and 47 participants with red-green defects. <b>Colour</b> <b>vision</b> was classified based on Nagel anomaloscope. In the pseudoisochromatic tests, the Hardy, Rand, Rittler 4 th edition (HRR), Ishihara 38 plate edition and Pseudoisochromatic Plates Ishihara Compatible (PIPC) tests subjects are required to identify coloured figure within background of a different colour. For the <b>Colour</b> <b>Vision</b> Reaction Time (CVRT) test, subjects need to locate a coloured Square on a computer’s screen using a mouse. The Cone Contrast Sensitivity Test (CCST) requires individuals to identify coloured letters that may appear in a gray background on the computer’s screen. A prototype of the ColorDx (pColorDx) test is similar to the printed pseudoisochromatic plates except that the plates are displayed on a computer screen. The Farnsworth-Munsell D 15 (D 15) test requires subjects to arrange coloured caps in order according to colour starting from a fixed cap. Results: The agreement of the printed pseudoisochromatic tests with anomaloscope in terms of screening for red-green defect was good with kappa (κ) coefficient of agreement value of 0. 96 or more on all three tests. The repeatability of the three tests was good with κ coefficient of 0. 96 or more on the three tests. Both HRR and PIPC tests can screen for blue-yellow defects. There were 2 deuteranomalous subjects at the first visit and a different deuteranomalous individual at the second visit who made a single blue-yellow error in the HRR test. In the PIPC test, only one deuteranomalous subject failed the blue-yellow screening plates at the first visit with two errors. In terms of the classification as either protan or deutan, the agreement with the Nagel anomaloscope was perfect with the HRR test and acceptable with the Ishihara, but only fair for the PIPC test. The agreement of the repeatability of the classification was perfect at the HRR test and good at the Ishihara test whereas it was reasonable at the PIPC test. The HRR test was designed to classify the severity of the defect and there was a reasonable correlation between the HRR severity and the Nagel anomaloscope matching ranges. The agreement of the three computerized <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests with anomaloscope was good with κ coefficients ≥ 0. 91. The repeatability of these three tests was good with κ coefficients ≥ 0. 98. All the three tests can screen for blue-yellow defects. In the CVRT test, the response times of most subjects to the blue-yellow test figures were within 1. 0 standard deviation of the white control value. The single exception was deuteranomalous subject who did not fail any other blue-yellow screening test. Ten subjects failed the pColorDx blue-yellow test, whereas 3 subjects failed the CCST S-cone portion. The CCST and pColorDx computer test can classify the defect as protan or deutan. Both tests showed a good-to-perfect agreement with anomaloscope. The pColorDx test can grade the severity of the defect in terms of mild, moderate to severe. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient with the Nagel matching ranges was only moderate. The Farnsworth D 15 test was included to determine whether there was a difference in the pass rate using the results from the first trial or requiring the subjects to pass on 2 of 3 trials. There was a marginal improvement in the pass rate using the 2 out of 3 rule. The repeatability of the 2 out of 3 trails in the D 15 test showed that there was a good agreement between sessions with κ coefficient of 0. 87. In terms of classifying the defect as protan or deutan, based on the visual inspection, there was a good agreement with κ coefficient = 0. 83. However, based on the Colour Difference Vector (CDV) angle parameter, all the colour defective subjects was correctly classified. The repeatability of classifying the type of the defect based on the CDV showed perfect agreement between the first and second visit. The D 15 can classify the defect as mild versus moderate-to-severe. As expected, the majority of individuals who failed the D 15 were classified as having moderate to severe classification on the HRR and pColorDx tests. Discussion and Conclusion: The current study confirms that the three pseudoisochromatic tests are effective in screening for red-green <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> defect. The HRR test may be preferred over the Ishihara and PIPC because the sensitivity was marginally higher than the other two tests. Agreement of the diagnostic plates with the Nagel anomaloscope as to whether the <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> defect was protan or deutan varied across tests. The results from this study agreed with the Birch’s (1997) results for the Ishihara in that approximately 85 % of the colour defectives were classified correctly as either protan or deutan. However, HRR classification results were slightly better than Cole, et al’s. In terms of the severity, our results were similar to Cole et al in that there were a reasonable correlation between the HRR severity and the Nagel anomaloscope matching ranges. The three computerized <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests are effective in terms of screening for red-green defects. The CCST had the highest agreement with anomaloscope, but it was not significantly different from the other two tests. However, the pColorDx ability to grade the severity was moderate, but it was slightly lower than the HRR plates. All three tests are capable of screening tritan defects. Our results suggest that a small number of deutans are likely to fail this portion of these tests. The D 15 test showed a reasonable repeatability on terms of pass/fail when we used 2 out of 3 rule and marginally better than performing only one trail on separate days. In terms of the repeatability of classification, the study showed that there was a good agreement between sessions based on the visual inspection and perfect agreement between sessions based on Colour Difference Vector parameters...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found that spatial {{processing}} in children and adults with Down syndrome is different in comparison to the normal population. Some previous studies have also found that there is a high prevalence of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in people with Down syndrome. The aim {{of the present study was}} to use an objective test, the transient visual evoked potential (VEP), to assess achromatic and chromatic visual processing in adults with Down syndrome. Achromatic VEPs were recorded in response to black-white stimuli presented in pattern reversal mode. Chromatic VEPs were recorded in response to two types of colour pattern, presented in pattern onset-offset mode. The two colour types were intended to preferentially stimulate the two principal chromatic pathways of the visual system, the &# 145;red-green&# 146; and &# 145;blue-yellow&# 146; colour-opponent pathways. These stimuli are here termed the &# 145;LM&# 146; and &# 145;S-(L+M) stimuli, respectively, reflecting the cone types that input to the pathways they are intended to stimulate. Each subject also completed two subjective <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> tests, the <b>Colour</b> <b>Vision</b> Test Made Easy (CVTME) and the City University <b>Colour</b> <b>Vision</b> Test (CUT). Morphology of the achromatic and chromatic VEPs was found to differ between the group with Down syndrome and an age-matched control group. The latency of the P 100 component of the achromatic VEP was found to be significantly later in the group with Down syndrome compared to the control group (the N 75 latency was earlier in the group with Down syndrome, but not significantly so). The group-averaged peak-to-peak amplitude of the achromatic VEP was significantly lower in the group with Down syndrome compared to the control group. The major positive component of the VEP in response to the L-M stimulus was of significantly longer latency compared to that of the control group. The major negative component and the peak-to-peak amplitude of this response were not significantly different between the groups. For the response to S-(L+M) stimuli, the latency of the major negativity was significantly earlier in the group with Down syndrome and the major positivity was later, but not significantly so. Amplitude of this response was significantly higher in adults with Down syndrome compared to the control group. Most subjects in both groups passed both the CVTME and CUT. Our findings indicate that chromatic VEPs are abnormal in Down syndrome, and this may reflect abnormal processing of chromatic stimuli in this population. Alternatively, these abnormalities may arise due to abnormal cortical morphology, which may occur with normal or abnormal processing of chromatic signals. These findings further indicate that abnormality of chromatic VEPs may be expected in Down syndrome, and is not necessarily indicative of pathology or other abnormal function that is unrelated to the syndrome...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{discipline}} of Biological Anthropology (or Human Biology) incorporates study of biology and environmental factors, {{as well as}} the forces of micro-evolution leading to macro-evolution, which ultimately influences the structure of human populations. In the present paper and attempt has been made to study the distribution differences in Red and Green <b>Colour</b> <b>Vision</b> <b>Deficiency</b> in India, which are analysed in relation to ecological, socio-economic and linguistic factors. The frequency of colour defects is 0. 036 in population groups of India (males only) which varies from complete absence to 0. 231. The validity of the hypothesis of relaxation of selection among different ethnic groups explains to some extent the status of colour blindness in tribal population groups i. e. low frequency among them as compared to other ethnic groups particularly caste groups, but still it has to be substantiated with further data...|$|E
40|$|Colour {{is often}} used as a sign in medicine, yet {{there have been few}} studies into the effects of a <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiency</b> (CVD) on doctors' medical skills. Using a {{literature}} search, the results indicate the prevalence of CVD in the medical profession and its effects on medical skills. For the congenital form among male doctors in the United Kingdom, the prevalence is shown to be probably about the same as for the population at large; i. e. 8 %. However, the data is insufficient for any estimate to be made of the small number of female doctors and for the acquired forms of CVD. The effect on skills is also shown. Because of certain features of their work, general practitioners may have special problems. Thus, it is concluded that medical students and doctors should be screened for the deficiency and advised about it, and that there should be more study of the effects of CVD on decision-making in general practice and some specialties...|$|E
40|$|Objective: visual {{disorders}} {{are among the}} earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. It is, however, still controversial as to whether Alzheimer’s disease impairs colour vision. In this study, colour vision of Alzheimer’s disease patients was tested using the Ishihara test and the PV- 16 choice test. The latter test, primarily designed for children, was chosen {{in order to avoid}} problems due to cognitive decline. Methods: 26 patients with mild to severe Alzheimer’s disease (M:F= 5 : 21; mean age: 80 " 9 years, range: 53 – 95 years) and 25 controls (M:F= 5 : 20; mean age 80 " 10 years, range: 56 – 100 years) were rated after undergoing complete neuro-ophthalmologic examination. Results: the Alzheimer’s disease patients made significantly more unspecific errors in the Ishihara test (P= 0. 02) and in the PV- 16 choice test (P= 0. 0008) than the controls. No relation between test performance and severity of Alzheimer’s disease was found. Conclusions: Alzheimer’s disease patients have an unspecific <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiency</b> independent of the severity of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and subjective function in early age-related maculopathy (ARM). Methods. Seventeen subjects with early ARM with visual acuity (VA) of 6 / 12 or better and 20 age-matched control subjects were examined. We assessed mfERGs, {{high and low}} contrast distance VA, near VA, low luminance VA, contrast sensitivity, saturated and desaturated Panel D- 15 and visual fields (mean sensitivity). The mfERG responses were analysed by comparing central-overall (method 1) and superior-inferior (method 2) ratios. Results. The mfERG did not discriminate between the groups whereas <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> (tritan <b>deficiency),</b> contrast sensitivity, and high contrast and low contrast VA showed significantly reduced responses for the early ARM group compared with the control group (p ≤ 0. 01). The mfERG first-order kernel responses correlated significantly with the desaturated D- 15 in both methods (r = − 0. 5, p ≤ 0. 05). Fundus grading was not correlated with the mfERG measures. Conclusions. Although the mfERG correlated significantly with the desaturated D- 15 in early ARM, suggesting it operates at a sensitive level, it failed to discriminate between the control and ARM groups. In our sample, the subjective function measures were more sensitive than the mfERG measures...|$|R
40|$|What is good map {{design and}} how should {{information}} best be visualised {{for a human}} reader? This is a general question relevant {{for all types of}} design and especially for digital maps and various Geographic Information Systems (GIS), due to the rapid development of our digital world. This general question is answered in this thesis by presenting a number of principles and tips for design of maps and specifically interactive digital visualisation systems, such as a GIS. Furthermore, this knowledge is applied to the application dpPower, by Digpro, which present the tools to help customers manage, visualise, design and perform calculations on their electrical networks. The visualisation and design of the network was analysed together with the usage of two common background maps, GSD-Fastighetskartan by Lantmäteriet and Primärkartan by the municipalities, whose default appearances are defined by Digpro. The aim was to answer whether there is a more suitable design of the background maps and network to better complement the usage of dpPower and if so, what is the better design? When designing interactive systems that will later have various end-users, a user-centred design is important. Therefore, the initial step was to collect user inputs and feedback on the current design via customer interviews. This gave a set of user criteria for good map design of dpPower specifically. A study of existing relevant literature and previous work was also performed where several general key principles for good design could be identified. Finally, a comparison between the dpPower design and other existing map products, such as e. g. Google Maps and Eniro, was made where key similarities and dissimilarities were identified and discussed. These user criteria and design principles could be combined, both to present an answer to the general question “What is good design?” and to present a suggestion of new map appearance in dpPower. Key considerations in the new design suggestions were e. g. to have a toned down background map with all features in the same hue family. However, for GSD-Fastighetskartan the important convention of land classes, blue = water, green = vegetation & yellow = open land, should be kept. Colour combinations and contrast is the most important design element and since a design cannot be optimally adapted for all types of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> the suggestion is to separate the designs to specifically target user groups of different <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> abilities. Important map information such as e. g. detailed road data should be kept while unnecessary features such as contour lines and polygon borderlines should be hidden. Text positions should also be considered. The results were evaluated both via a survey, distributed to users of dpPower, GIT-students and users with no previous experience of GIT or dpPower, and a seminar with employees at Digpro. The conclusions drawn from the evaluation was that the presented design suggestions and principles are good, but adjustments should be made. E. g. a use of yellow for low voltage cables, as suggested for Red-Green impaired, is perhaps not the best solution. The results present a good foundation for design of dpPower but more adjustments should be made based on the evaluation and then another evaluation can be performed. It would give an even better result...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review revealed that very little {{work has been}} conducted to investigate the possible benefits of coloured interventions on reading performance in low vision due to ARMD, under conditions {{that are similar to}} the real world reading environment. Further studies on the use of colour, as a rehabilitative intervention in low vision would therefore be useful. A series of objective, subject based, age-similar controlled experiments were used to address the primary aims. Trends in some of the ARMD data suggested better reading performance with blue or green illuminance but there were also some individuals who performed better with yellow, or with illuminance of reduced intensity. Statistically, better reading in general occurred with a specialised yellow photochromic lens and also a clear lens than with a fixed lens or a neutral density filter. No reading advantage was gained from using the coloured screen facility of a video-magnifier. Some subjects with low vision were found to have co-existent binocular vision anomalies, which may have caused reading difficulties similar to those produced by ARMD. Some individuals with ARMD benefited from the use of increased local illuminance produced by either a standard tungsten or compact fluorescent lamp. No reading improvement occurred with a daylight simulation tungsten lamp. The Intuitive Colorimeter® can be used to detect and map out <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> discrimination <b>deficiency</b> in ARMD and the Humphrey 630 Visual Field Analyser can be used to analyse the biocular visual field in subjects with ARMD. Some experiments highlighted a positive effect of a blue intervention in reading with ARMD...|$|R
