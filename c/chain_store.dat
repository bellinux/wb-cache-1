She also started a company called Happy Chairs in the Matthews area of Charlotte where she creates her own furniture and redesigns old chairs. It came after Robinson looked for furnishings in a national furniture <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> and discovered a display chair that she liked. She begins the process of renovating old chairs by searching for those that are in poor condition but are structurally intact and are architecturally appealing. Robinson dismantles the chair and starts reconstructing it. Her work has received critical acclaim from online magazines and customers. Robinson names designer Trina Turk and several clothing companies as her influences.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{coverage}} of Youngstown's economic challenges has overshadowed the city's long entrepreneurial tradition. A number {{of products and}} enterprises introduced in Youngstown later became national household names. Among these is Youngstown-based Schwebel's Bakery, which was established in neighboring Campbell in the 20th century. The company now distributes bread products nationally. In the 1920s, Youngstown was {{the birthplace of the}} Good Humor brand of ice cream novelties, and the popular franchise of Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt was established there in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Youngstown-born developer Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. established one of the country's first modern shopping plazas in the suburb of Boardman. The fast-food chain, Arby's, opened the first of its restaurants in Boardman in 1964, and Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips was headquartered in Youngstown in the late 1970s. More recently, the city's downtown hosted the corporate headquarters of the now-defunct pharmacy <b>chain</b> <b>store</b> Phar-Mor, which had been established by Youngstown native Mickey Monus.|$|E

By the early 1920s, the U.S. boasted three national chains: A&P, Woolworth's, and United Cigar Stores. By the 1930s, <b>chain</b> <b>stores</b> had come of age, and stopped increasing their total market share.

[...] This effort predated the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that established a nationwide minimum wage.

Penney and Sears, Roebuck and Company), low-interest farm loans, and a state unemployment insurance program.

2500|$|McGee had {{concerns}} about falling cattle prices and that large chain drug stores were engaging in unfair practices with large meat processors {{at the expense}} of western cattle farmers.

Special emphasis was to be given to why a sharp drop in meat producers' income since January 1963 had not been reflected in consumer prices, which had generally remained level since a rise in 1962.|$|E
