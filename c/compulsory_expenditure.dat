Given the current decision procedures of the EU, EP has effective power on non-compulsory expenditure covering structural spending, but not on <b>compulsory</b> <b>expenditure</b> consisting mainly of agricultural spending. We use this fact to assess how the assumed benevolent objectives of EP turn into member states' budget receipts in a power politics based model. European integration, EU budget, voting power...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{determination}} of receipts from EU budget by considering a richer institutional structure than in earlier studies. We assume that the member states have self-interested objectives in CM trying to minimize their contributions within the given framework of the EU budget whereas EP is supposed to support benevolent objectives using its competence in non-compulsory expenditure, i. e. structural spending, internal and external policies and administration. CM exerts power in the allocation of both <b>compulsory</b> <b>expenditure,</b> mainly consisting of agricultural spending, and in non-compulsory expenditure. The {{purpose of this paper}} is not, however, to evaluate EP's influence but rather how the assumed benevolent objectives of EP and income differences turn into member states' budget receipts in a power politics based model.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the proposed}} {{reform of the}} annual budgetary procedure of the European Union (EU) during the 2002 - 04 Convention and Intergovernmental Conference (IGC). We offer two findings. First, the European Parliament already {{has the power to}} reduce agricultural and fisheries spending subject to support from a blocking minority in the Council. Hence, a reduction of the Union's spending on agriculture and other areas of <b>compulsory</b> <b>expenditure</b> is not dependent on a reform of the budgetary procedure. Second, the proposal from the Convention would have increased EP budgetary powers while the procedure adopted by the IGC strengthens the hand of the Council, removing Parliament's right to overrule it. In constitutional bargaining, we see that Parliament gains in a deliberative forum where unanimity is not required, while it loses in a closed IGC.

Social justice, social class, habitus and literacy are the main cultural elements, which are used to probe the problems of rural education in China. And then, the article suggests several strategies for addressing the problems. Basically, we need to increase financial input to the underdeveloped rural areas. However, what is important is to reform the funding assurance system for compulsory education in the countryside, thus bringing rural <b>compulsory</b> education <b>expenditure</b> into the overall public funding assurance framework.

In this study, the {{relationship between}} household consumption expenditure and household disposable income were analyzed by Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing Regression which is a nonparametric method using R programming. This study aimed to determine relationship between variables directly, unlike making any assumptions are commonly used as in the conventional parametric regression. According to the findings, effect on expenditure with increasing of income and household size together increased rapidly at first, and then speed of increase decreased. This increase can be explained by having greater <b>compulsory</b> consumption <b>expenditure</b> relatively in small households. Besides, expenditure is relatively higher in middle and high income levels according to low income level. However, the change in expenditure is limited in middle and is the most limited in high income levels when household size changes...|$|R
5|$|Croatia has a {{universal}} health care system, the roots {{of which can be}} traced back to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance for all factory workers and craftsmen. The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2014, the annual <b>compulsory</b> healthcare related <b>expenditures</b> reached 21.8billion kuna (2.9billion euro). Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare, representing a decline from approximately 8% estimated in 2008, when 84% of healthcare spending came from public sources. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Croatia ranks around the 50th in the world in terms of life expectancy.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{examines}} "The realization of 'Public Education Provided by the Local Government' in Japan" from an essential side of public education, as {{a continuation of}} my paper which was already published. The contents are as follows: (1) An introduction. (2) Historical patterns of public education. (3) Public education provided by the local government before 1945 (4) Public education provided by the local government after 1945 (5) Conclusions. The conclusions are as follows: 1. In 1890 it was recognized legally that the organizations of cities, towns, and villages had the authority of establishment of primary school and the expenditure of primary school has been "public". 2. In a view of essencial side, public education provided by the local government until 1945 {{can be said to}} be "public education in absolutism provided by the local government". The people were obliged to receive it as a duty for an emperor and a nation. There is no thought of a guarantee of children's rights to receive education. An education that the nation demanded was carried out by trying all availafle ways. 3. After 1945 public education provided by the local government was realized as a guarantee of children's rights to receive education due to Article 26 in the Constuittion of Japan, Article 4 in Foundamental Law of Education and the Law of National Grant for <b>Compulsory</b> Education <b>Expenditure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although {{political}} leaders, {{donors and}} some scholars {{would argue that}} there is nothing illegal behind the idea of giving and receiving campaign contributions, this research attempts to demonstrate the contrary. Here, I claim that small and large contributions constitute representations of political corruption because they are given for specific purposes either ideological or personal. Since the relationship between campaign financing and political corruption has not been studied worldwide, in this thesis I conduct a cross-country analysis of 83 countries and find that there is less political corruption: 1) in countries where elections are not funded with public resources; 2) in countries where the impact of legal campaign financing on public policy outcomes is lower; 3) in countries where regulations impose ceilings on election expenses and on {{the amount of money that}} parties/candidates can raise in each election; and 4) in countries where regulations make the public disclosure of campaign <b>expenditures</b> <b>compulsory...</b>|$|R
40|$|Research {{into the}} effects of electioneering at the {{constituency}} level suggests positive impacts on voters of campaign spending by one party relative to another. In much of this research, however, the political context of the elections studied is ignored or fitted into Key's category of normal or maintaining elections, where voting patterns remain relatively constant from one election to another. There are few, if any, reports of money - votes relationships associated {{with other types of}} elections. Analysis of a deviating election followed by two reinstating elections in the state of New South Wales, Australia, from 1988 to 1995 confirms the generality of postulated relationships between campaign spending and voting patterns, even allowing for some degree of underestimation associated with a misreading of voter intentions by the major parties in times of electoral volatility. Further insights into money - votes relationships are provided from particular features of Australian elections: a focus on marginal seats associated with strategic use of a public funding component of election-campaign <b>expenditure,</b> <b>compulsory</b> voting, and the use of an alternative vote or preferential voting system. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{collection}} of studies analyses {{the various ways}} and means that the financial system of the European Union has at its disposal for handling the inevitable uncertainties {{of the future and}} traces their evolution since the creation of the general budget of the European Communities in 1968. Special attention is paid to the consequences of this evolution not only for the various actors involved – namely the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States – but also for the financial system of the European Union as a whole. The question of the uncertainty of the future is addressed {{in the light of the}} theory of “Budgetary Flexibility”, which posits an essential distinction between “External Flexibility and “Internal Flexibility, on the one hand, and “Annual Flexibility“ and “Multiannual Flexibility“ on the other. External Flexibility differs from Internal Flexibility in that, in the case of the former, more resources (or fewer, in the case of budget cuts) can be allocated in the course of the budgetary year. In the case of the latter, budget limits (frames) are maintained, i. e. a reallocation of resources during the financial year will not lead to the growth in the overall size of the budget. At the same time, Multiannual Flexibility differs from Annual Flexibility in that the former can be considered as an exception to the principle of budgetary annuality as set out by the EC and EU Treaties. The theory of “Budgetary Flexibility” allows to place under a common theoretical framework processes that are often considered separate (and treated in the academic literature as such), and also enables to analyse the pros and cons and the consequences of such flexibility, and to draw conclusions at the level of the European Union. The studies also develop further the theory, devised originally in the 1990 s to analyse the budgetary systems of the Member States. The studies focus on three recent major negotiations which led to the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002, to its first modification, adopted on 13 December 2006, and to the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2007 - 2013. The main forms of flexibility identified in the studies are: the system of amending budgets, the quantity of various budget headings and ”operational” budget lines in the general budget and the system of transfer of appropriations during the budgetary year (”structural flexibility”), the system of <b>compulsory</b> vs non-compulsory <b>expenditure</b> (”normative flexibility”), the system of provisional appropriations, reserves and Funds, the system of commitment appropriations, the system of carry-overs, and the various flexibility elements present in budgetary discipline system and the multiannual financial perspectives and framework of the European Union...|$|R
