40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking has {{previously}} been developed for use in calculations of wheel and <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> temperatures. Block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel. Heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is accounted for. The thermal model was calibrated using results from both standard brake rig tests and tests when a “rail-wheel” {{was introduced in the}} rig. Furthermore, the model was successfully calibrated using results from field studies. In the present work, the thermal model is utilised to study temperatures and partitioning of heating power during different braking set-ups and braking loads. First, the influences from geometrical changes are studied, with parameters such as wheel design, wheel wear and block wear. Also the effect of <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> configuration is studied. Second, the influence from <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> material is considered. Third, the influences from braking parameters are studied. Gradient braking on mountain descents is simulated but also the related case of brake system malfunctioning. Stop braking is studied. Fourth, the importance of rail chill is investigated with respect to shape and size of the contact patch between wheel and rail. A general result from the present parametric study is that rail chill is important for a useful simulation of wheel temperatures and heat partitioning at drag braking. Rail chill consumes a considerable part of the total heat at drag braking and it becomes increasingly important as the tread temperature rises. For example, {{at the end of a}} brake cycle at 30 kW per wheel for 30 min with <b>composition</b> <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> using a 920 mm wheel, 21 % of the total heat enters the rail...|$|R

40|$|Conventional brakes {{require a}} {{powerful}} actuator, leading to large, heavy {{and in most}} cases energy consuming brakes. This paper introduces a fundamen-tally different brake concept called statically balanced brakes (SBBs). SBBs do not require any actuation force to maintain a braking torque and only have to move a small mass to vary that torque. Therefore, their energy consumption is potentially very low. In an SBB, one of the two friction surfaces is connected through springs to a <b>braking</b> <b>block.</b> This <b>braking</b> <b>block</b> is connected through a mechanism to a second set of springs, the other side of which connects to the ground. The total energy in the two sets of springs is constant, which results in a zero-force characteristic at the <b>braking</b> <b>block.</b> The position of this statically balanced <b>braking</b> <b>block</b> determines the displacement of the first set of springs and thus the normal force between the friction surfaces. We categorize mech-anisms {{that can be used in}} SBBs and show two embodiments: one with leaf springs with a range of positions with negative stiffness and one with torsion springs and a non-linear cam mechanism. Results show that the actuation force can be reduced by approximately 95 - 97 % in comparison to regular brakes. This shows that in SBBs, the actuation force can be almost eliminated and thus showing the potential of SBBs to be small, lightweight and energy efficient...|$|R

40|$|Tread (<b>block)</b> <b>braking</b> {{is still}} one of the most common braking systems on railway vehicles. The action is carried out by {{pressing}} <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The extensive use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated stop braking. The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, an extensive literature survey has been made with special focus on the braking capacity of wheels. Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. It was concluded that even though the same nominal routes were simulated in the brake rig tests as those the field tests, the braking efforts are different. Therefore, simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. Heat partitioning between wheel, block and rail has been numerically studied in a broad parametric study to investigate the influence of <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution. By use of a plane model, the implication of temperature variations around the wheel circumference (hot spots) is studied in detail. Even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures, they were found to have only a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system. By use of an axisymmetric model, it was found that a presumed constant axial position of the wheel-rail contact towards the flange side of the tread leads to substantially higher maximum tread temperatures than a wheel-rail contact centred at the <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> position...|$|R
