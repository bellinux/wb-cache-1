25|$|In the 1960s, {{because of}} the {{prediction}} and discovery of pulsars, the Crab Nebula again became a major <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> It was then that Franco Pacini predicted {{the existence of the}} Crab Pulsar for the first time, which would explain the brightness of the cloud. The star was observed shortly afterwards in 1968. The discovery of the Crab pulsar, and the knowledge of its exact age (almost to the day) allows for the verification of basic physical properties of these objects, such as characteristic age and spin-down luminosity, the orders of magnitude involved (notably the strength of the magnetic field), along with various aspects related to the dynamics of the remnant. The role of this supernova to the scientific understanding of supernova remnants was crucial, as no other historical supernova created a pulsar whose precise age we can know for certain. The only possible exception to this rule would be SN1181 whose supposed remnant, 3C 58, is home to a pulsar, but its identification using Chinese observations from 1181 is sometimes contested.|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid to}} late 17th century, the Paris Jardin des Plantes was a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{with the}} {{greatest}} number of new introductions to attract the public. In England, the Chelsea Physic Garden was founded in 1673 as the [...] "Garden of the Society of Apothecaries". The Chelsea garden had heated greenhouses, and in 1723 appointed Philip Miller (1691–1771) as head gardener. He had a wide influence on both botany and horticulture, as plants poured into it from around the world. The garden's golden age came in the 18th century, when it became the world's most richly stocked botanical garden. Its seed-exchange programme was established in 1682 and still continues today.|$|E
2500|$|Probably in 1645 Paget {{became aware}} of overtures from Shrewsbury. The town had fallen to the Parliamentarians {{as a result of}} a daring {{operation}} planned by Willem Reinking, a Dutch professional soldier, under the direction of its parliamentary committee, on 21 February. Royalist and Laudian clergy were purged from the town and the surrounding areas and replacements sought. Initially the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in Amsterdam was Julines Herring, who was probably invited back by Thomas Rowley, the merchant and former bailiff who had first introduced him to Shrewsbury around 1617. However, both Rowley and Herring were dead by the summer of 1645. Attention then turned to Paget: presumably Herring had recommended him. Some time in 1646 the congregation of St Chad's Church elected him as their minister, [...] "for this was now become the mode of appointment," [...] as Owen and Blakeway, both later Anglican clergymen in the town, remark in their 1825 History of Shrewsbury. The previous incumbent was one Lendall (forename unknown), who was perhaps appointed under the first royalist governor, Sir Francis Ottley. He seems to have been treated as a prisoner of war on the capture of the town and removed under an Act of 16 December 1642 ordering sequestration of the livings of those who joined the king's army.|$|E

40|$|The Kingdom of Morocco {{is special}} for its {{geographical}} {{location in the}} <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the African, European and American continents and for its position as a monarchy. Morocco s historical tradition as a monarchy does not prevent it from addressing important social changes. In spite of its geopolitical importance, Moroccan history and politics have long been overlooked. International development {{of the last two}} decades have shown that the importance of the Kingdom in regional and international environment is growing. Morocco proved to be an important ally of the West and the Gulf states in the Global War on Terror, the events of the Arab Spring and the current refugee crisis. Foreign relations with the United States, France and Spain have a long history and are mostly based on economic and security cooperation. Morocco is also in the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the European Union, especially {{within the framework of the}} European neighbourhood policy. Relations with the Gulf monarchies have once again gained its importance in the context of the security threat that was posed by the revolutions of the Arab Spring.

60|$|They {{met with}} no {{interruption}} on the road, and arrived in Paris {{on the last}} day of April, 1792. Harry was glad at the change. The doings at Paris had been the subject of conversation and thought for nearly two years, and he had caught the excitement which pervaded France.

60|$|I doubted for {{a moment}} whether I ought to follow and speak to her or not. My intense anxiety to find myself {{face to face with}} her {{companion}} helped me to decide in the negative.

The person who had written it was the one <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> and the one source of information, and that person I now felt convinced was before me in the churchyard.|$|E

It wasn't, of course, I who was the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> but a distinguished French portrait painter; I was there as just any guest. I hadn't even perceived Gidding until he came round to me in that precious gap of masculine intercourse that ensues upon the departure of the ladies. That gap is one of the rare opportunities for conversation men get in America.|$|E
