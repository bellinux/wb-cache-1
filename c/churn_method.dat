Unlike traditional <b>churning</b> <b>methods,</b> the ice cream {{does not need to}} be frozen once it is done churning. Since this freezing stage produces large ice crystals, which gives the ice cream a grainy texture, manufacturers would add milk fat to counterbalance the grainy texture. As this extra freezing process isn't necessary with low-temperature extrusion, the [...] "slow churned" [...] line of ice cream is labeled as containing two-thirds the calories and half the fat of [...] "regular" [...] ice cream. Dreyer's has also extended this process to other brands besides its two flagship brands, such as Häagen-Dazs, which it produces under a license from General Mills.|$|R

Until recently, camel milk could not {{be made into}} camel cheese because rennet was unable to coagulate the milk proteins to allow the collection of curds. Developing less wasteful uses of the milk, the FAO commissioned Professor J.P. Ramet of the École Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et des Industries Alimentaires, {{who was able to}} produce curdling by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet. The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant. The sale of camel cheese is limited owing to the small output of the few dairies producing camel cheese and the absence of camel cheese in local (West African) markets. Cheese imports from countries that traditionally breed camels are difficult to obtain due to restrictions on dairy imports from these regions.|$|R

Dairy {{products in the}} area were sampled in the first season, and chemically analyzed and assessed for microbial profile. ILCA (International Livestock Centre for Africa) wooden agitator for milk fat separation was used and compared with the traditional milk <b>churning</b> <b>method.</b> In the second season, ILCA agitator was modified {{to fit into the}} local gourd instead of the original clay pot. In the third season, the three methods were compared in a 3 x 2 factorial experiment using milk condition (fresh vs. boiled) as a second factor. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the hygiene measures in rural dairy products and to assess the introduced wooden agitator for milk fat extraction. The rural dairy products sampled had high total bacteria and mold counts and reflected poor hygiene and sanitation measures. Both ILCA wooden agitator and the modified model had significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced churning time and resulted in higher ghee yield of good quality compared to the traditional method. Considerable proportion of milk fat was lost to butter milk in the traditional method in comparison with ILCA and the modified wooden agitators (P< 0. 001). ILCA wooden agitator was superior to the traditional method in terms of money returns. Both ILCA and the modified wooden agitators were easy to operate and had a time saving advantage compared to the traditional method. It was concluded that the modified wooden agitator should be advocated for more rural women in the area and similar ecological zones. Furthermore, there is a high need for introducing new, simple and easy methods for dairy processing to women in such areas. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In service-based industries, churn poses a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} integrity of the user communities and profitability of the service providers. As such, research on <b>churn</b> prediction <b>methods</b> has been actively pursued, involving either intrinsic, user profile factors or extrinsic, social factors. However, existing approaches often address each type of factors separately, thus lacking a comprehensive view of churn behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new churn prediction approach based on collective classification (CC), which accounts for both the intrinsic and ex-trinsic factors by utilizing the local features of, and dependencies among, individuals during prediction steps. We evaluate our CC approach using real data provided by an established mobile social networking site, with a primary focus on prediction of churn in chat activities. Our results demonstrate that using CC and social features derived from interaction records and network structure yields substantially improved prediction in comparison to using conventional classification and user profile features only.

Our approach overcomes limitations such as ‘humans cannot do random’ and that humans will follow the easiest path. Our findings show that CHURNs are significantly more random than values produced by unaided humans; that humans may be used as a second source of randomness, and we give measurements as to how much randomness can be gained from humans using our approach; and that our CHURN-generator makes the user feel more in control, thus removing the need for complete trust in devices and underlying protocols.

40|$|Existing {{methods to}} utilize capacity-heterogeneity in a P 2 P system either rely on {{constructing}} special overlays with capacity-proportional node degree or use topology adaptation to match a node's capacity {{with that of}} its neighbors. In existing P 2 P networks, which are often characterized by diverse node capacities and high <b>churn,</b> these <b>methods</b> may require large node degree or continuous topology adaptation, potentially making them infeasible due to their high overhead. In this thesis, we propose an unstructured P 2 P system that attempts to address these issues. We first prove that the overall throughput of search queries in a heterogeneous network is maximized {{if and only if}} traffic load through each node is proportional to its capacity. Our proposed system achieves this traffic distribution by biasing search walks using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, without requiring any special underlying topology. We then define two saturation metrics for measuring the performance of overlay networks: one for quantifying their ability to support random walks and the second for measuring their potential to handle the overhead caused by churn. Using simulations, we finally compare our proposed method with Gia, an existing system which uses topology adaptation, and find that the former performs better under all studied conditions, both saturation metrics, and such end-to-end parameters as query success rate, latency, and query-hits for various file replication schemes...|$|R
40|$|In many applications, {{identifying}} potential churners is {{of great}} importance and has been widely studied. Recently, literature has acknowledged the power of social network analysis for churn detection, which has been proven to achieve more accurate results. We focus on churn detection in the telecommunications industry, where a social network is constructed based on call records. We contribute by evaluating and comparing two community detection approaches and, as a result, identify the effects of peer pressure on the likelihood of individuals to churn. Particularly, we propose a two-step procedure. In a first step, we detect the relevant communities of the social network using two different methods: (1) a top-down clustering approach, and (2) a bottom-up clustering approach. The top-down clustering approach results in few and large clusters, whereas the bottom-up clustering identifies complete cliques and hence produces smaller but {{a greater number of}} clusters. In a second step, we enrich churn prediction models, which traditionally only use intrinsic features. From the clusters, we extract community features and use them as additional variables to predict customer churn.

The churning efficiency and microbiological quality of the milk and butter samples were analyzed following standard procedures. The fermentation time (11. 33 days), churning time (121. 7 min) and churning temperature (28 °C) of T 1 were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than the other milk samples. T 1 had significantly (P < 0. 001) lower churning pH (4. 13) and butter yield (49. 3 g/L) than the other samples. T 3 and T 4 had significantly (P < 0. 001) higher butter yield than the other milk samples. The fermentation time, churning time and churning temperature of T 5 were significantly (P < 0. 001) lower than the rest and T 5 required significantly (P < 0. 001) higher churning pH than the other milk samples. The coliform count (CC), enterobacteriaceae count (EBC), lipolytic bacteria count (LBC) and {{yeast and mould count}} (YMC) of T 1 was significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than the other butter samples.

40|$|A {{study on}} {{characterization}} of cattle milk and meat production, processing and marketing system {{was conducted in}} Metema district based on data collected between September and October, 2006. A multistage sampling procedure was employed to select representative kebles and households from CBFS, SBFS and Gendawuha town. A total of 270 households were randomly selected using systematic random sampling method. Questionaire based formal survey as well as PRA techniques were employed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on cattle milk and meat production and processing systems in the district, while RMA techniques were used to characterize the marketing system of dairy products, meat and live cattle. In addition, 30 households were voluntarily selected from the two rural farming systems and were continually monitored to collect quantitative data on milk and other dairy products produced per household. Accordingly, the latter data were used to corroborate the survey based information on related parameters. Two types of livestock production systems were identified in the district, namely crop-livestock mixed farming, which is exercised by resident farmers, and transhumance production system practiced by seasonally in fluxing farmers from neighboring highlands. The current study was concerned entirely on the former production system type. The average cattle herd size of households was 15. 53 heads, but it varied significantly (P< 0. 05) among the three areas. Cows (30. 45 %) and calves (32. 29 %) mainly dominate the herd composition, while heifers (13. 90 %), oxen (12. 02 %) and bullocks (10. 30 %) represented minor proportions. Cattle type (Zebu) locally called Agew, Simada and Fogera were dominantly found in the district, although some cattle types introduced from neighboring countries known as “Ruthana” and “Felata” cattle were observed in minor proportions. Where as introduced temperate breeds were entirely lacking in the district. The breeding system was entirely natural mating. 65. 8 % of the interviewed farmers practiced selective mating, while the rest one-third left their cows for open mating with no concern for selecting the best bull, although some variation exist from area to area. Major feed resources used by the households were natural grazing (31. 0 %), crop residues (29. 5 %), crop aftermath (21. 8 %) and hay (17. 8 %). The available vast communal range lands provide high potential for conserving excess fodder during the wet season {{in the form of}} hay. Despite this, households make insignificant quantity of hay and face critical feed shortage during the dry season. Critical shortage of water was also noted during the dry season, particularly in highly arid lowlands. Three types of diseases were identified as the major health problem of cattle and these included tick infestation (37. 2 %), babesiosis (31. 6 %) and FMD (15. 6 %). Average milk off-take of indigenous cows was 1. 9  0. 045 liter/cow/day and on average cows gave a lactation yield of 324. 0  10. 274 liters/cow during an average lactation period of about 5. 9  0. 14 months. Cows in Gendawuha town gave significantly higher daily milk yield as well as were milked for longer lactation period than in the two rural areas. As a result, the lactation yield xix was significantly higher in the former than in the latter areas and these differences were mainly attributed to better feeding (supplementation) and management provided for the cows in the town. Overall, mean CI was 17. 97  0. 313 months, but it was significantly higher in the town than in the rural areas because of extended lactation. Mean AFC of cows in Metema was quite late (4. 54  0. 05 years) even by local standard. Out of the total milk produced, most of it was processed (63 %), while some quantity was consumed with in the household (18 %) and used for calf rearing (13 %). On the other hand, most of the butter was consumed with in the household (58 %), while small proportion was sold out (25 %). In general, the market share of whole milk and other milk derivatives (cottage cheese, butter milk and fermented milk) was almost negligible, while butter was comparatively the most marketable commodity in all the three areas. The dairy marketing system identified in the study area was entirely informal marketing system. <b>Churning</b> <b>methods</b> includes <b>churning</b> by placing the churner on the floor, hanging the churner on tripods and churner is shacked with both hands. Cattle fattening experience was not developed well, because of lack of experience (34. 9 %), shortage of labor (30. 8 %), feed shortage during dry season (17. 5 %) and shortage of capital (15. 9 %). Out of the total fresh meat produced, 49. 8 % was consumed by the household in the form of fresh, while 50. 2 % was retained for processing. Milk and meat production and marketing system were constrained by theft of cattle, infectious and parasitic disease, lack of milk processing services, poor market information on the price and supply condition, lack of services (extension, inputs, and veterinary) and lack of feed processing and utilization management. Extension intervention should focus on dairy and meat production and processing as well as on improving the marketing system of these products. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|R
40|$|For {{telecommunication}} businesses it {{is important}} to retain as many customers as possible. For this purpose it could be useful to predict which customers have a high potential to stop their subscription. When a customer leaves the company by stopping the subscription, it is called a customer churn. In this thesis customer churn was predicted for KPN, a telecommunication business in the Netherlands. To predict customer churns for KPN, a data set with information about the network, subscriptions and calls to the call centres was used. The data set contains numerical, ordinal and categorical features and just over two million customers. One of the features is the response feature churn, which suffers from class imbalance. Only 3. 39 percent of the customers had churned. Firstly, the data was explored by a cluster analysis. For this cluster analysis partitioning around medoids was used, with the Gower distance as dissimilarity measure. This clustering was illustrated using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding. The cluster analysis showed {{that it is hard to}} distinguish churners from non-churners since they are not clearly grouped. To find a model that predicts customer <b>churns,</b> several classification <b>methods</b> were compared. Those methods were logistic regression, lasso, adaptive boosting, naive Bayes, random forest and a super learner, respectively. Not only the classification methods were applied to the data as is, but also to the data where the training set was balanced by up-sampling. To assess which model performs the best, an in-depth study into performance measures was executed. In the end, three different performance measures were used to assess the performance. Those performance measures are the weighted risk, the H-measure and the area under the recall-precision curve, respectively. It turned out that the super learner, which was an ensemble of logistic regression and random forest, performed the best for the KPN data set. Furthermore, it turned out that all feature should be included in the modelling process since a model that only contains the most important features, as determined by a feature importance method, gives worse predictions.

40|$|Software {{applications}} {{developed for}} large-scale systems {{have always been}} difficult to de- velop due to problems caused by {{the large number of}} computing devices involved. Above a certain network size (roughly one hundred), necessary services such as code updating, topol- ogy discovery and data dissemination are challenging to operate and thus difficult to design and implement. This is caused by the sheer size of the system in terms of number of devices that have to be managed. Practical aspects such as harsh and unpredictable deployment con- ditions and varying system properties such as topology dynamics due to device mobility and variations of the communication links cannot be ignored. In this thesis, we investigated how distributed computing techniques can be used for detecting some of the specific properties of large-scale dynamic systems. Additionally, novel online algorithms have been presented for detecting some of the detrimental effects such as unpredictable topology dynamics and random link and device failures. We started our research by focusing on ways to cope with topology dynamics caused by device mobility and corresponding techniques for managing the creation of overlays in mobile networks. The ASH clustering algorithm introduced in Chapter 2 copes well with device mobil- ity and is remarkably resilient to topology dynamics in general. It is able to create quasi-static overlays while the underlying devices are mobile. Unlike traditional clustering schemes, ASH does not use device location, and the computation is based solely on 1 -hop information. By making use of local interactions, it benefits from the so-called emergent behaviour in complex networked systems to achieve self-stabilisation. The second challenge that we addressed in Chapter 3 was the design of a distributed es- timator for the aggregate quality of the communication links in a large-scale network. Data dissemination protocols employed in wireless systems can use this information in order to ad- just various application behaviours. We have introduced an algorithm, named LossEstimate, for run-time estimation of the aggregate number of communication failures present in a re- gion or the entire system. Our approach has the advantage of being completely decentralised - each device computes an estimate of the number of errors using a localised, gossip-based algo- rithm. The devised method follows changes in the mean value of the communication failures over time. The algorithm has an important building block - a mechanism called DiffusionRe- set - that is able to track dynamic system properties by continuously re-starting the gossiping process. In Chapter 4 we addressed the problem of computing the number of nodes that are actively entering and exiting a large-scale system, also called <b>churn</b> level. A <b>method</b> that solves this problem can be utilised in traffic monitoring applications. At its core, it uses the DiffusionReset mechanism for being able to offer an estimate at every device in realtime. The current state of the art offers a limited set of alternatives. ChurnDetect is able to cope well also with the effects of device mobility such as dynamic, multi-hop topologies characterised by frequent device and communication failures. The next problem we addressed in Chapter 5 was the detection of a phenomenon called FlashCrowd in peer-to-peer systems. Content-delivery applications benefit from having an on- line estimation of such a phenomena. We specifically focus on the problem of online detection with an algorithm called FlashDetect. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is one of the}} first on- line methods for detecting this phenomenon. We use again the DiffusionReset mechanism and a special protocol initialisation for the peers that are entering the system - the initial gossiping values are set to 0. The remarkable property of FlashDetect is that peers do not need to ad- vertise their departure. This makes the algorithm very robust to various device and application failures, unlike competing methods. For networked embedded systems, the ultimate validation of distributed algorithms on real hardware is always preferable. In order to check our algorithms and open-up the possibility for non-IT specialists to test ideas, in Chapter 6 we introduced a software tool chain that enables fast prototyping of algorithms on large-scale systems, by abstracting away from the underlying technological complexity related to communication protocols, programming languages, operat- ing systems, virtual machines and hardware platforms. We made use of the Spatial Computing paradigm to map interactive design applications and distributed algorithms in general onto em- bedded systems middleware. By abstracting away from low-level implementation details of advanced communication protocols and numerous algorithmic building blocks, we offer the possibility for rapid prototyping of ideas. Spatial eLua accelerates thus the work of algorithm designers as well as non-IT specialists interested in making use of the latest technologies in interactive design installations. Our work has lead us to the conclusion that managing large-scale systems is possible via feedback provided by distributed algorithms that estimate various system properties. Ran- domised communication strategies such as gossip-based protocols are very well suited for cre- ating online estimators while being robust to failures. With the help of spatial computing, ideas can be tested and validated easily on various embedded platforms even by non-IT specialists. Even though we made steps in this direction, further effort is required for testing other novel algorithms and their corresponding spatial computing constructs.
