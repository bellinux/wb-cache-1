In particular, every graph property that can be expressed in MSO1 monadic second-order logic (a form of logic allowing quantification over sets of vertices) has a linear-time algorithm for graphs of bounded clique-width, by a form of Courcelle's theorem. It is also possible to find optimal graph colorings or Hamiltonian cycles for graphs of bounded clique-width in polynomial time, when a <b>construction</b> <b>sequence</b> is known, but the exponent of the polynomial increases with the clique-width, and evidence from computational complexity theory shows that this dependence {{is likely to be}} necessary.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the behavior of}} multistory composite frames is presented. The investigation includes a review of the state-of-the-art of composite frame analysis and design methods, and also details the features of the response of composite frames during the construction phase. In an original development, solution procedures that incorporate the effects of <b>construction</b> <b>sequencing</b> on the strength and stability of composite frames are developed. This is extended to define the new concept of a construction limit state for use in design of such structures. These procedures are intended for use by designers and contractors as guidelines. In order to achieve a certain quality of construction, the builder must comply with a set of specific erection sequences. These sequences may vary from one structure to another, depending on a number of factors. Although general standards of construction that include the effects of sequencing do not exist, and would likely be very difficult to develop, it is clear that designers and contractors must consider the influences. From the viewpoint of economy and efficiency, it is necessary to specify sequences that satisfy the structural behavior and stability requirements. The primary {{purpose of this study is}} the development of a numerical procedure for the determination of the behavior of composite frames during erection. A second objective is that the procedure developed will be such that it would lend itself to improved construction economy by taking into account the effects of <b>construction</b> <b>sequencing.</b> It will be demonstrated that simple calculations of <b>construction</b> <b>sequencing,</b> together with the given frame response, may be used by the contractor during erection to establish the different activities required for the erection of a building frame...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and design of}} composite beams prestressed by external tendons involves difficulties mainly related to the cable slip at the saddle points and to the <b>construction</b> <b>sequences.</b> The paper presents a model for analyzing such structural systems under general conditions. Generic nonlinear constitutive laws are considered. No restrictions are assumed for tendon profiles and static scheme. Usual <b>construction</b> <b>sequences</b> can be considered. Kinematics and the compatibility equations refer to a beam model preserving the cross section planarity, and the tendon is free to slip at the saddle points. The characteristics of the problem make it convenient to obtain the balance condition from the virtual work principle. The numerical solution was performed by variational approximating methods and the nonlinear equations were solved by the Newton-Raphson procedure. The paper presents a tool {{for the analysis of}} externally prestressed composite beams up to failure in order to investigate the influence of typical design parameters on the ultimate capacity.

50|$|In {{the center}} of the complex is Mound 2, the largest and the best-preserved mound at the site, it {{measures}} 36 ft high and 272 ft by 312 ft at the base (11 m × 83 m × 95 m). Like all of the mounds at the site where an original shape can be determined, it is a simple truncated-pyramidal platform mound. Very little excavation has taken place at this mound, so not much is known about the <b>construction</b> <b>sequence</b> or what structures may have been built upon it. There was limited work done on the mound in 1947 by John Griffin, in a salvage cleanup effort of a looters trench. He found a series of fill layers of black muck, various soil types, and caps of red clay, but as the cut was not through the entire mound or located near any structures he could not learn much about its <b>construction</b> <b>sequence</b> or definitive purpose. It was most likely the first mound started at the site, early in Fort Jacksons history. If it is similar to mounds at other sites then it was the house platform of the ruler of the site, who was also possibly a paramount chief over many other sites.|$|E

5000|$|The Maldonado bridge, or Puente de La Barra, [...] {{located in}} Maldonado, Uruguay, {{illustrated}} below, {{was created by}} the engineer Leonel Viera (1913-1975) to expand the area of Punta del Este. This pioneered the <b>construction</b> <b>sequence</b> now typical for concrete segment bridges of this type. After placement of the principal cables, precast concrete tiles were placed to form the initial structure. The cables were then prestressed by loading sandbags upon the tiles, followed by final concretization of the gaps between tiles. Removal of the sandbags then compressively stressed the concrete structure, enhancing its stiffness and durability under load. An identical bridge was later constructed parallel to the first.The concrete segment stressed ribbon footbridge shown below carries pedestrians, bicyclists, and pipelines across the Rogue River at Grants Pass, Oregon.|$|E
50|$|Realizing the {{benefits}} of precast shapes requires that designers have a thorough knowledge of how the shape system is used and installed in the field. Successful design and manufacture of a high-performance refractory shape system requires understanding refractory materials, manufacturing, anchoring systems, and construction practice.

50|$|A {{different}} method uses an inductive {{construction of}} 3-connected graphs to incrementally build planar embeddings of every 3-connected component of G (and hence a planar embedding of G itself). The construction starts with K4 and {{is defined in}} such a way that every intermediate graph on the way to the full component is again 3-connected. Since such graphs have a unique embedding (up to flipping and the choice of the external face), the next bigger graph, if still planar, must be a refinement of the former graph. This allows to reduce the planarity test to just testing for each step whether the next added edge has both ends in the external face of the current embedding. While this is conceptually very simple (and gives linear running time), the method itself suffers from the complexity of finding the <b>construction</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{consideration}} of the <b>construction</b> <b>sequence</b> of buildings under gravity load will significantly change the internal forces of the structural members, especially for super high-rise and long span structures. The elasto-plastic performance assessment of building structures under earthquakes commonly start with the internal forces of structural members under gravity load. Due to its loading history dependent behavior, the seismic performance of the building structures will be different with different initial internal forces under moderate rare earthquakes. However, the <b>construction</b> <b>sequence</b> of building structures is commonly not considered during the seismic assessment process in practices due to the high computing capacity and complicated algorithm requirements. An innovative virtual load method is proposed in this study to evaluate the impact of <b>construction</b> <b>sequence</b> on the seismic performance of building structures. By using the virtual load vectors, the proposed method can reproduce the <b>construction</b> <b>sequence</b> based internal forces of critical structural members using traditional gravity load analysis method.
