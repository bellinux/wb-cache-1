The act led to further related {{developments}} {{in the creation of}} the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden as co-chair along with Jarrett.

500|$|From {{the late}} 1960s onwards, Piccard {{returned}} to her childhood interest in religion. She was ordained a deacon of the Episcopal Church in 1971, and on July 29, 1974, {{became one of the}} Philadelphia Eleven, the first women to be ordained prieststhough the ordinations were regarded as irregular, performed by bishops who had retired or resigned. Piccard {{was the first of the}} women to be ordained that day, because at 79 she was the oldest, and because she was fulfilling an ambition she had had since she was 11 years old. When asked by Bishop John Allin, the head of the church, not to proceed with the ceremony, she is said to have told him, [...] "Sonny, I'm old enough to have <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> nappies." [...] In September 1976, the church voted to allow women into the priesthood, and Piccard served as a priest in Saint Paul, Minnesota, until she died at the age of 86. One of her granddaughters, the Rev. Kathryn Piccard, also an Episcopal priest, said of her: [...] "She wanted to expand the idea of what a respectable lady could do.
