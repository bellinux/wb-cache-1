5|$|On July 1, 2016, Anbang {{announced}} plans to refurbish the hotel and turn some rooms into condominiums. Under the plan, some of the hotel's rooms will be turned into apartments, with {{the remainder of the}} rooms remaining hotel suites. As part of the refurbishment process, the hotel closed on March 1, 2017, with plans to reopen it in 2020. The hotel's restaurants, including Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and the recently opened La <b>Chine,</b> closed along with the hotel; they will reopen when the renovation is completed. A week after the hotel closed, on March 7, 2017, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to list the interiors of the hotel's famous public spaces as New York City landmarks, protecting them from any alteration during the renovations.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} {{especially}} rich in literary associations {{during the late}} 19th century and earlier years of the 20th century. P. C. Wren author of Beau Geste, Frederick E. Smith, writer of the 633 Squadron books, and Beatrice Webb, later Potter, all lived in the town. Paul Verlaine taught at Bournemouth a preparatory school and the writer J. R. R. Tolkien, spent 30 years taking holidays in Bournemouth, staying {{in the same room}} at the Hotel Miramar. He eventually retired to the area in the 1960s with his wife Edith, where they lived close to Branksome <b>Chine.</b> Tolkien died in September 1973 at his home in Bournemouth but was buried in Oxfordshire. The house was demolished in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Writing for the Chinese-owned {{newspaper}} Lay Po in 1923, Tio {{revealed that}} Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari had been {{heavily influenced by}} the 1847 poem Sjair Abdoel Moeloek, credited variously to Raja Ali Haji or his sister Saleha. He noted that Sair Siti Akbari, which Lie stated to be his own, closely followed the earlier work's plot. In his 1958 biography, Tio revealed that Lie's Tjhit Liap Seng was an amalgamation of two European novels: Jacob van Lennep's Klaasje Zevenster (1865) and Jules Verne's Les Tribulations d'un Chinois en <b>Chine</b> (1879). Tio noted that a third book, Pembalasan Dendam Hati, had extensive parallels with a work by Xavier de Montépin translated as De Wraak van de Koddebeier. In face of these revelations, literary critics such as Tan Soey Bing and Tan Oen Tjeng wrote that none of Lie's writings were original.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Morris {{was kept}} largely housebound at Elm House by his mother; there, {{he spent much}} time reading, favouring the novels of Walter Scott. Aged 6, Morris moved {{with his family to}} the Georgian Italianate mansion at Woodford Hall, Woodford, Essex, which was {{surrounded}} by 50 acres of land adjacent to Epping Forest. He took an interest in fishing with his brothers as well as gardening in the Hall's grounds, and spent much time exploring the Forest, where he was fascinated both by the Iron Age earthworks at Loughton Camp and Ambresbury Banks and by the Early Modern Hunting Lodge at Chingford. He also took rides through the Essex countryside on his pony, and visited the various churches and cathedrals throughout the country, marveling at their architecture. His father took him on visits outside of the county, for instance to Canterbury Cathedral, the Chiswick Horticultural Gardens, and to the Isle of Wight, where he adored Blackgang <b>Chine.</b> Aged 9, he was then sent to Misses Arundale's Academy for Young Gentlemen, a nearby preparatory school; although initially riding there by pony each day, he later began boarding, intensely disliking the experience.|$|E
5|$|The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a {{total of}} 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini suites, while the Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. Several of the luxury suites are named after celebrities who lived or stayed in them such as The Cole Porter Suite, The Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the MacArthur Suite and the Churchill Suite. The most {{expensive}} room, the Presidential Suite, is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It was the residence of Herbert Hoover from his retirement for over 30 years, and Frank Sinatra kept a suite at the Waldorf from 1979 until 1988. The hotel has three main restaurants, Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and La <b>Chine,</b> a new Chinese restaurant that replaced Oscar's Brasserie in late 2015. Sir Harry's Bar, named after British explorer Sir Harry Johnston, {{is the home of}} the Rob Roy and the Bobbie Burns cocktails.|$|E

5000|$|Blending the <b>chines</b> {{into both}} the {{fuselage}} {{and the main}} wing avoids presenting corner reflectors or vertical sides to radars. This has led fifth-generation jet fighter designs to replace low-stealth canard surfaces with <b>chines,</b> when helping to generate vortex lift over the main wings. (An exception is the Chengdu J-20, whose canards are mounted inline with its <b>chines.)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>chines</b> also {{increase}} directional stability, {{by reducing the}} adverse effects of crosswinds or yaw on the forward fuselage. Unlike a conventional fuselage, the <b>chines</b> allow the crossflow to travel smoothly over their profile and beyond, avoiding the side forces due to flow separation and stagnation. Again the effect is stronger at higher speeds, and reduces {{the size of the}} vertical stabilisers (tail fins). The YF-12A lacked the foremost section of the <b>chines</b> seen on the SR-71 and consequently needed extra vertical tail surfaces.|$|R
5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en <b>Chine.</b> The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a different matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E

50|$|The hull, {{which had}} adopted a radically new shape, mainly {{employed}} traditional construction methods at Shorts. The structure used {{a combination of}} 'Z'-shaped stringers and 'I'-shaped girders to form triangular sections that ran along the <b>chines</b> located {{at the point where}} the fuselage sides met with the planning underside. As a measure to simplify manufacturing and to increase the available internal volume, only a simple curvature sweeping the sides of the hull into the <b>chines</b> was employed; on previous Shorts-built flying boats, a more complex 'S'-shaped curvature and a sudden reduction in beam just above the <b>chines</b> had been employed instead.|$|R

50|$|Aerodynamicists {{discovered}} that the <b>chines</b> generated powerful vortices and created additional lift, leading to unexpected aerodynamic performance improvements. The angle of incidence of the delta wings could be reduced for greater stability and less drag at high speeds, and more weight carried, such as fuel. Landing speeds were also reduced, as the chines' vortices created turbulent flow over the wings at high angles of attack, making it harder to stall. The <b>chines</b> also acted like leading-edge extensions, which increase the agility of fighters such as the F-5, F-16, F/A-18, MiG-29 and Su-27. The addition of <b>chines</b> also enabled {{the removal of the}} planned canard foreplanes.|$|R
