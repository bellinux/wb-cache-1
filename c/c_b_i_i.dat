40|$|We {{compute the}} number of rhombus tilings of a hexagon with sides n, n, N, n, n, N, where two triangles on the {{symmetry}} axis touching in one vertex are removed. The case of the common vertex being {{the center of the}} hexagon solves a problem posed by Propp. 1. Introduction The interest in rhombus tilings has emerged from the enumeration of plane partitions in a given box. The connection comes from looking at the stacks of cubes of a plane partition and projecting the picture to the plane. Then the box becomes a hexagon, where opposite sides are equal, and the cubes become a rhombus tiling of the hexagon where the rhombi consist of two equilateral triangles (cf. [2]). The number of plane partitions in a given box was first computed by MacMahon [7, Sec. 429, q # 1, proof in Sec. 494]. Therefore: The number of all rhombus tilings of a hexagon with sides a, <b>b,</b> <b>c,</b> a, <b>b,</b> <b>c</b> equals a # i= 1 b # j= 1 c # k= 1 <b>i</b> + j + k - 1 <b>i</b> + j + k - 2 = a # i= 1 (<b>c</b> + <b>i)</b> <b>b</b> (<b>i)</b> <b>b.</b> (1) (The [...] ...|$|R

The doctrine of scrivener 2 ̆ 7 s error is inapplicable to the plain language of subsection 112 (<b>c)</b> (9) (<b>B)</b> (<b>i).</b> There are plausible reasons why Congress would have used the term 2 ̆ 2 subcategory 2 ̆ 2 in subsection 112 (<b>c)</b> (9) (<b>B)</b> (ii) for non-carcinogenic chemicals that were assumed to have a safe threshold but deliberately omitted the term 2 ̆ 2 subcategory 2 ̆ 2 in subsection 112 (<b>c)</b> (9) (<b>B)</b> (<b>i)</b> for carcinogenic chemicals that were assumed in 1990 to have no safe threshold other than zero emissions. Part II examines the differences between 2 ̆ 2 non-threshold 2 ̆ 2 carcinogens and 2 ̆ 2 threshold 2 ̆ 2 non-carcinogens and the difficulties that the EPA had in regulating air toxics under the 1970 Amendments to section 112.

Part IV examines two provisions in Section 112 -subsections 112 (d) (4) and 112 (<b>c)</b> (9) (<b>B)</b> -that treat non-threshold carcinogens differently than threshold non-carcinogens.
