40|$|Survival {{analysis}} {{techniques were}} used to compare experimental exposure methods of Loma salmonae (Microspora) in rainbow trout (RBT) by measuring xenoma onset and clearance time. Twenty-eight naive RBT were exposed <b>per</b> <b>os</b> (fed L. salmonae spores) and 28 RBT were exposed by cohabitation with 28 L. salmonae-infected RBT. Exposed fish were examined once every week (7 days) post exposure (PE). For xenoma onset, the median survival time, the time to first appearance of branchial xenomas, was 6 weeks PE for both <b>per</b> <b>os</b> and cohabitation exposure. For xenoma clearance, the median survival time, the time to total clearance of branchial xenomas, was 10 weeks for <b>per</b> <b>os</b> exposure and 12 weeks for cohabitation exposure. There {{was a significant difference}} between the survival curves of <b>per</b> <b>os</b> fish compared with cohabited fish for both xenoma onset and xenoma clearance. The incidence rate of xenoma development was greater for <b>per</b> <b>os</b> exposure (0. 1745 cases per fish-week) compared with cohabitation exposure (0. 1342 cases per fish-week). Similarly, the rate of xenoma clearance was greater for <b>per</b> <b>os</b> exposure (0. 1028 cases per fish-week) compared with cohabitation exposure (0. 0885 cases per fish-week). Differences between exposure methods were attributed to differences in the frequency and duration of exposure to spores. Survival analysis was useful for examining the onset and clearance of L. salmonae and may have applications for understanding disease dynamics in aquaculture. ...|$|R

This {{study was designed to}} investigate the plasma disposition and efficacy of ivermectin (IVM) following pour-on, <b>per</b> <b>os</b> and intravenous administrations. Eighteen female horses weighing 510 ??? 610 kg were used in this study. The animals were allocated into three groups (<b>per</b> <b>os,</b> pour-on and intravenous groups). The equine paste, bovine pour-on and bovine injectable {{formulations of}} IVM were administered orally, topically and intravenously at the dose rates of 0. 2, 0. 5 and 0. 2 mg/kg bodyweight, respectively. Heparinized blood samples and hair samples were collected at various times between 1 h and 40 days. The samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector. Faecal strongyle egg counts (EPG) were performed by a modified McMaster's technique before and at weekly intervals during 10 weeks after treatment. The results indicated that the plasma concentration and systemic availability of IVM was lower but the plasma persistence was prolonged after pour-on administration compared with <b>per</b> <b>os</b> route. IVM (paste) reduced the EPG by > 95 % for 10 weeks, whereas the reduction in pour-on group varied from 82 to 97 %. EPG reduction in pour-on group was lower than that of <b>per</b> <b>os</b> group. Degradation on the application site, cutaneous biotransformation, binding of IVM to the haircoat and/or sebum are probably responsible for the relatively lower bioavailability of IVM in horses after pour-on administration. In conclusion, the poor plasma availability observed after pour-on administration could result in subtherapeutic plasma concentrations, which may promote the development of drug resistance in parasites...|$|R
