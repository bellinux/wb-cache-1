40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that opportunities for two-sided partner choice in finitely repeated social dilemma games can promote cooperation through a combination of sorting and opportunistic signaling, with late period defections by selfish players causing an end-game decline. How such experience would affect play of subsequent finitely-repeated games remains unclear. In each of six treatments that vary the <b>cooperation</b> <b>premium</b> and the informational basis for reputation formation, we let sets of subjects play sequences of finitely-repeated voluntary contribution games to study the competing forces of (a) learning about the benefits of reputation, and (b) learning about backward unraveling. We find, inter alia, that with a high <b>cooperation</b> <b>premium</b> and good information, investment in reputation grows across sets of finitely-repeated games...|$|E
40|$|Often the fuller the {{reputational}} record people's actions generate, {{the greater}} their incentive {{to earn a}} reputation for cooperation. However, inability to “wipe clean” one's past record might trap some agents who initially underappreciate reputation's value in a cycle of bad behaviour, whereas a clean slate could have been followed by their “reforming” themselves. In a laboratory experiment, we investigate what subjects learn from playing a finitely repeated dilemma game with endogenous, symmetric partner choice. We find that with a high <b>cooperation</b> <b>premium</b> and good information, investment in cooperative reputation grows following exogenous restarts, although earlier end-game behaviours are observed...|$|E
40|$|Current {{aircraft}} {{models from}} different manufacturers have already structural components made of CFRP (fuselage and wing shell, rudder, flaps), {{which must be}} reinforced by special profiles. In {{the state of the}} art processes, these profiles are pre-bonded with conduction- and convection-based heating methods, which are time consuming and inefficient. At the Center for Lightweight Production Technology (ZLP) of the German Aerospace Centre in Stade a new method for pre-bonding was patented and the foundation for industrialization was laid by extensive research. By using inductive heating, the process time for the pre-bonding of stringers is reduced from 30 - 45 seconds to 3 - 5 seconds per adhesive point. In <b>cooperation</b> with <b>Premium</b> Aerotec GmbH the applicability to Airbus A 350 fuselage panel manufacturing was investigated. A comparison to ultrasonic heating and {{the state of the art}} pre-bonding method as well as the development and testing of automation concepts were performed. While the technique reached the next phase on the way to series production several findings emerged, which may require further process adaptions. To control the temperature on the bottom side repeatable and independent from stringer type or side attempts to regulate the process were made. Based on optical temperature measurements on the stringer’s top surface, the induction generator power was adjusted using different algorithms. Then several experiments were performed to establish a relation between top and bottom side temperatures in fast processes. Thermographic analysis showed that hotspots occurred during the heating process of A 350 stringers, which worsened the temperature homogeneity and shrunk the process window. The problem was considered to be related to the junctions between different plies and could be solved by using an alternative induction coil design. Additionally, this new coil design is supposed to increase overall temperature homogeneity and decrease material dependencies significantly. It makes the process much more controllable. This paper summarizes the methods used to confront inductive heating with ultrasonic and the state of the art technology. Furthermore the automation concepts and thoughts on quality assurance are presented. Finally it shares the insights and results of the performed experiments as well as the future focus of research...|$|R
