5|$|One of the {{earliest}} innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more sucrose than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a hybrid of the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, resistant to hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} {{commissioned}} by the Dutch government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production. This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> is lower than in citric, corn, coffee and soybean cropping. The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control {{and is one of}} the primary objectives of Brazil’s cane genetic improvement programs. Disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane.|$|E
25|$|Sugarcane can {{be grown}} on many soils ranging from highly fertile well-drained mollisols, through heavy {{cracking}} vertisols, infertile acid oxisols, peaty histosols, to rocky andisols. Both plentiful sunshine and water supplies increase <b>cane</b> <b>production.</b> This has made desert countries with good irrigation facilities such as Egypt some of the highest-yielding sugarcane-cultivating regions.|$|E

25|$|The {{base of the}} Alajuela's economy remains {{agricultural}} production. In {{the southern}} highlands of the province, tropical ornamentals, coffee, tubers, and green vegetables are the major crops. Toward the north and northeast, rice, corn, pineapple, bananas, and sugarcane are important crops. Alajuela ranks first nationwide in national coffee production and national sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production.</b> Many of the agricultural products are exported overseas.|$|E
25|$|Across {{much of the}} islands, {{agricultural}} {{damage was}} widespread. Primarily due to damages sustained on the Fiji Sugar Corporation sugar mill in Labasa, sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> in 2003 dropped by 800,000tonnes (882,000 short tons), equivalent to 15%less than forecast. Coconut plantations also sustained heavy damages. In Lau Province and Lomaiviti Province, an estimated 158houses were completely destroyed. In the two provinces, damages totaled to F$4.5million (US$2.2million). However, in Macuata, Cakaudrove, and Bua provinces, 2,287houses were destroyed. In those threeprovinces, damages were estimated to be F$23.7million (US$11.6million).|$|E
25|$|The Proserpine {{area was}} first settled from the 1860s and {{agriculture}} became the main industry. An initial attempt at sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> {{in the early}} 1880s at Glen Isla plantation failed and the estate was subsequently sold and subdivided into small farms. Much of the present-day Proserpine town area occupies land formerly part of the plantation site. A stable sugar-growing industry was eventually established in Proserpine in 1897 {{with the opening of}} the Proserpine Central Mill. By 1900, there were 200 settlers and 70 suppliers to the mill.|$|E

25|$|Presently, 75 tons of {{raw sugar}} cane are {{produced}} annually per hectare in Brazil. The cane {{delivered to the}} processing plant is called burned and cropped (b), and represents 77% {{of the mass of}} the raw cane. The reason for this reduction is that the stalks are separated from the leaves (which are burned and whose ashes are left in the field as fertilizer), and from the roots that remain in the ground to sprout for the next crop. Average <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> is, therefore, 58 tons of b per hectare per year.|$|E
25|$|The Pernambucan {{revolt of}} 1817 {{occurred}} {{in the province of}} Pernambuco in the Northeastern region of Brazil, and was sparked mainly by the decline of sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> and the influence of the Freemasonry in the region. Other important reasons for the revolt include: the ongoing struggle for the independence of Spanish colonies in South America; the independence of the United States; the generally liberal ideas that came through all of Brazil the century before, including many French Enlightenment Philosophers, such as Charles Montesquieu and Jean-Jacques Rousseau; the actions of secret societies, which insisted on the liberation of the colony; the development of a distinct culture in Pernambuco.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{rain and}} poor soil {{productivity}} resulted {{in most of}} the region being planted out with sugarcane from the 1880s. In 1883, Brie Brie Sugar Plantation established Mossman's first mill but this was unsuccessful and largely inoperative by 1886. This did not deter Commissioner WO Hodgkinson from assessing the flat land around the Mossman River as having great potential for <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> during his investigation of sites for central sugar mills conducted in 1886. The impetus for more extensive sugar cropping in the district came with the establishment of the Mossman Central Co-operative Mill in the mid- 1890s under the provisions of the 1893 Sugar Works Guarantee Act.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{governor}} Shimpei Goto's rule, many major {{public works projects}} were completed. The Taiwan rail system connecting {{the south and the}} north and the modernizations of Kirun (Keelung) and Takao (Kaohsiung) ports were completed to facilitate transport and shipping of raw material and agricultural products. Exports increased by fourfold. 55% of agricultural land was covered by dam-supported irrigation systems. Food production had increased fourfold and sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> had increased 15-fold between 1895 and 1925 and Taiwan became a major foodbasket serving Japan's industrial economy. The health care system was widely established and infectious diseases were almost completely eradicated. The average lifespan for a Taiwanese resident would become 60 years by 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{colony of}} Surinam began {{importing}} {{slaves in the}} 1650s, since there were not enough indentured servants coming from England for the labour-intensive sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production.</b> In 1662, the Duke of York got a commission to supply 3,000 slaves to the Caribbean, and Lord Willoughby was also a slave trader. For the most part, English slavers dealt with slave-takers in Africa and rarely captured slaves themselves. The story of Oroonoko's abduction is plausible, for such raids did take place, but English slave traders avoided them where possible for fear of accidentally capturing a person who would anger the friendly groups on the coast. Most of the slaves came from the Gold Coast, and in particular from modern-day Ghana.|$|E
25|$|The {{mid-19th century}} ushered {{an end to}} the industry's prosperity. First came the 1851 {{discovery}} of powdery mildew, which severely reduced production over the next three years. Just as the industry was recovering through the use of the copper-based Bordeaux mixture fungicide, the phylloxera epidemic that had plagued France and other European wine regions reached the island. By the end of the 19th century, most of the island's vineyards had been uprooted, and many were converted to sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production.</b> The majority of the vineyards that did replant chose to use American vine varieties, such as Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris or hybrid grape varieties rather than replant with the Vitis vinifera varieties that were previously grown.|$|E
50|$|In the Dominican Republic, moonshine {{is called}} cleren {{in the towns}} near the border with Haiti and pitrinche in the eastern towns. It is made from sugar or {{fermented}} sugar <b>cane.</b> Its <b>production</b> is illegal but the law is rarely enforced. Another form is berunte, fermented from either corn (which is the most common), rice, melon, pineapple or wheat.|$|R

25|$|The {{remaining}} 5% {{or so of}} {{the population}} consist of a mix of Indians, Chinese, Whites from the United States and Canada, and many other foreign groups brought to assist the country's development. During the 1860s, a large influx of East Indians who spent brief periods in Jamaica and American Civil War veterans from Louisiana and other Southern states established Confederate settlements in British Honduras and introduced commercial sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> to the colony, establishing 11 settlements in the interior. The 20th century saw the arrival of more Asian settlers from mainland China, South Korea, India, Syria, and Lebanon. Said Musa, the son of an immigrant from Palestine, was the Prime Minister of Belize from 1998 to 2008. Central American immigrants and expatriate Americans and Africans also began to settle in the country.|$|E
25|$|Although {{only about}} one-quarter of Taiwan's land area is {{suitable}} for farming, virtually all farmland is intensely cultivated, with some areas suitable for two and even three crops a year. However, increases in agricultural production have been much slower than industrial growth. Agricultural modernization has been inhibited by {{the small size of}} farms and the lack of investment in better facilities and training to develop more profitable businesses. Taiwan's agricultural population has steadily decreased from 1974 to 2002, prompting the Council of Agriculture to introduce modern farm management, provide technical training, and offer counseling for better production and distribution systems. Promotion of farm mechanization has helped to alleviate labor shortages while increasing productivity; both rice and sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> are completely mechanized. Taiwan's main crops are rice, sugar cane, fruits (many of them tropical), and vegetables. Although self-sufficient in rice production, Taiwan imports large amounts of wheat, mostly from the United States. Meat production and consumption has risen sharply, reflecting a high standard of living. Taiwan has exported large amounts of frozen pork, although this was affected by an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in 1997. Other agricultural exports include fish, aquaculture and sea products, canned and frozen vegetables, and grain products. Imports of agriculture products are expected to increase due to the WTO accession, which is opening previously protected agricultural markets.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the first}} {{settlement}} by the British in 1625, through history {{the economy of}} Barbados was primarily dependent on agriculture. It had been recorded that minus the marshes and gully regions, during the 1630s much of the desirable land had been deforested across the entire island. Quickly Barbados was then divided into large estate-plantations and using indentured labour mainly from the British Isles for the cultivation of tobacco and cotton crops were first introduced. The island, facing {{a large amount of}} competition from the North American colonies and the neighbouring West Indian islands, switched to the crop of sugar cane. Cultivation of sugar cane was quickly introduced by the exiled Jewish community which immigrated into Barbados from Dutch Brazil during the mid-17th century. The introduction of sugar cane became the single best move for the Barbados economy at the time, the economy boomed and Barbados had become populated with so many windmills that the island had the second highest density of windmills per square mile in the world, second only to the Netherlands. For about the next 100 years Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in the Caribbean region due to sugar. The prosperity in the colony of Barbados remained regionally unmatched until sugar <b>cane</b> <b>production</b> caught up in geographically larger countries such as Jamaica and elsewhere. Despite being eclipsed by larger makers of sugar, Barbados continued to produce the crop well into the 20th century and to this day.|$|E
