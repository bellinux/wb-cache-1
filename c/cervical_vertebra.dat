5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra</b> (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra.</b> However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra</b> behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The esophagus is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E
5|$|The tail, {{according}} to Schwartz, {{is longer than}} in the potto. He does not provide measurements of the tail of AMZ 6698 and notes {{that at least one}} vertebra is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 caudal vertebrae in an illustration of AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of caudal vertebrae ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the potto, though {{according to}} Stump the tail of Pseudopotto is longer than any seen in pottos. The false potto allegedly has shorter spines on its cervical (neck) and first and second thoracic (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false potto differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a bifid (two-tipped) spine on the second <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra,</b> but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 potto specimens he examined.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are the {{smallest}} of the moveable vertebrae, and are characterized by a foramen in each transverse process. The transverse process is morphologically composite around the foramen transversarium. AIM The present study has been undertaken to know the incidence of double foramen transversarium in dried <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> in upper Assam population. MATERIALS & METHODS A total number of 210 dried <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> of unknown age and sex were collected from the anatomy department. All the collected <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> were examined macroscopically for the existence of the double foramen transversarium on both sides. The data was then compiled and later analyzed.

25|$|Manatees are unusual amongst mammals in {{possessing}} {{just six}} <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> {{which may be}} due to mutations in the homeotic genes. All other mammals have seven <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> other than the two-toed and three-toed sloths.|$|R
5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{arise from}} the subclavian artery, and run through the transverse foramen of the upper six vertebrae of the neck. After exiting {{at the level of}} the first <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra,</b> its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the skull through the foramen magnum. Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which joins the circle of Willis. In total, three quarters of the artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to rotational movement in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen {{at the level of the}} first and second vertebrae. The vertebral artery supplies a number of vital structures in the posterior cranial fossa, such as the brainstem, the cerebellum and the occipital lobes. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as respiration) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The cerebellum is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision.|$|E
5|$|The Stonesfield Slate {{material}} {{contains no}} neck vertebrae; {{but a single}} broken anterior <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra</b> is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests {{the presence of a}} crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing {{more than half of the}} total vertebral height.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{carotid artery}} is a terminal branch of the common carotid artery; it arises around {{the level of the}} fourth <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra</b> when the common carotid bifurcates into this artery and its more superficial counterpart, the external carotid artery.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the validity of <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> radiographic assessment to predict skeletal maturation. Materials and Methods: Left-hand wrist and lateral cephalometric radiographs of 100 Bangalore children aged 8 - 18 years, divided into 10 groups of 10 subjects each with equal distribution of males and females, were measured. On left-hand wrist radiograph, the classification of Fishman was used to assess skeletal maturation. <b>Cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> maturation was evaluated with lateral cephalometric radiograph, using the stages developed by Hassel and Farman. The changes in hand wrist and <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> were correlated. Results: Significant association was observed between skeletal maturation indicator stages and <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> maturation indicator stages. Correlation coefficient was found to be significant (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion: The results of the study indicated that the <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> maturation and hand wrist skeletal maturation was significantly related...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Congenital {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} craniovertebral or cervical region are common. Among these congenital anomalies the important ones are the fused <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> {{which can be}} due to either congenital or acquired causes. Fused <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> can b e asymptomatic or it can produce a myriad of clinical symptoms from mild to severe. Hence {{a knowledge of the}} prevalence of these variations are essential. METHOD: 147 dry adult human skulls with 280 adult, dried <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> were observed in this stu dy for evidence of fusion. The morphologic details of the fusion were also noted. RESULTS: The total prevalence of fusion of <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> was 1. 4...|$|R
25|$|A {{total of}} four <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> were {{recovered}} from the holotypic quarry. Two of these are fragmentary, whereas the other two vertebrae are nearly complete. According to the quarry map, the two poorly preserved <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> were articulated when found and belong to a more anterior part of the cervical series than the nearly complete vertebrae. Little anatomical information can be gleaned from the two fragmentary <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> aside from some measurements.|$|R
25|$|The upper {{cervical}} spine has a curve, convex forward, {{that begins}} at the axis (second <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra)</b> {{at the apex of}} the odontoid process or dens, and ends at the middle of the second thoracic vertebra; it is the least marked of all the curves. This inward curve is known as a lordotic curve.|$|E
25|$|The paratype, MPM-PV 3546, {{consists}} of a partially articulated postcranial skeleton of a slightly smaller individual whose remains were discovered in the same location as the holotype. It includes a partial anterior <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra,</b> multiple dorsal vertebrae and ribs, the sacrum, seven caudal vertebrae and five haemal arches, a nearly complete pelvis, and the left femur.|$|E
25|$|The common carotid arteries {{are present}} {{on the left and}} right sides of the body. These arteries {{originate}} from different arteries, but follow symmetrical courses. The right common carotid originates in the neck from the brachiocephalic trunk; the left from the aortic arch in the thorax. These split into the external and internal carotid arteries at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, at around the level of the fourth <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{vertical}} portion arises, below, {{from the}} front of the bodies of the upper three thoracic and lower three <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebræ,</b> and is inserted into the front of the bodies of the second, third, and fourth <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebræ.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two-toed sloths are unusual among mammals in {{possessing}} {{as few as}} five <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> {{which may}} be due to mutations in the homeotic genes. All other mammals have seven <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> other than the three-toed sloth and the manatee.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{evaluation of}} hand wrist and <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> {{was done to}} know the validity of <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> as maturity indicators. A sample of 50 subjects (25 females and 25 males) in {{the age group of}} 10 - 12 years were selected on criteria of normal occlusion and the result showed that <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> can be used with the same confidence as hand wrist radiographs to evaluate skeletal maturity, thus avoiding the need for an additional radiograph...|$|R
25|$|From {{the ninth}} <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra</b> to the back, the {{vertebral}} joints show {{the remains of}} articular capsules. Between the spines at places very thin interspinal and supraspinal ligaments are visible. Six vertebrae are visibly capped by cartilaginous synchondroses, a typical juvenile feature. Cartilaginous caps are also present on all limb joints, even the smallest, and are especially thick in the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. Also the pubic foot is capped and the ilium and pubic bone are separated by cartilage.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} ligaments {{involved in the}} holding together of the vertebrae in the column, and in the column's movement. The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments extend {{the length of the}} vertebral column along the front and back of the vertebral bodies. The interspinous ligaments connect the adjoining spinous processes of the vertebrae. The supraspinous ligament extends the length of the spine running along the back of the spinous processes, from the sacrum to the seventh <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra.</b> From there it is continuous with the nuchal ligament.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{distinguishing}} skeletal {{features of}} Barosaurus {{were in the}} vertebrae, although a complete vertebral column has never been found. Diplodocus and Apatosaurus both had 15 cervical (neck) and 10 dorsal (trunk) vertebrae, while Barosaurus had only 9 dorsals. A dorsal may have {{been converted into a}} <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra,</b> for a total of 16 vertebrae in the neck. Barosaurus cervicals were similar to those of Diplodocus, but some were up to 50% longer. The neural spines protruding {{from the top of the}} vertebrae were neither as tall or as complex in Barosaurus as they were in Diplodocus. In contrast to its neck vertebrae, Barosaurus had shorter caudal (tail) vertebrae than Diplodocus, resulting in a shorter tail. The chevron bones lining the underside of the tail were forked and had a prominent forward spike, much like the closely related Diplodocus. The tail probably ended in a long whiplash, much like Apatosaurus, Diplodocus and other diplodocids, some of which had up to 80 tail vertebrae.|$|E
5000|$|Like Tanystropheus, Dinocephalosaurus had an {{exceptionally}} long neck, which measured 1.7 m long {{compared to a}} torso (excluding the tail) 1 m long. However, Tanystropheus and Dinocephalosaurus accomplished their neck length in different ways. The neck of Tanystropheus was composed of 12 elongated <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> whereas the neck of Dinocephalosaurus was composed of at least 27 <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> that were not completely elongated. Additionally, the <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> of Dinocephalosaurus are not hollow, unlike those of Tanystropheus.|$|R
50|$|In many species, {{though not}} in mammals, the <b>{{cervical}}</b> <b>vertebrae</b> bear ribs. In many groups, such as lizards and saurischian dinosaurs, the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to the vertebrae. The transverse processes of mammals are homologous to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. In the whale the <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are typically fused, an adaptation trading flexibility for stability during swimming. All mammals except manatees and sloths have seven <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> whatever {{the length of the}} neck. This includes seemingly unlikely animals such as the giraffe, the camel, and the blue whale, for example. Birds usually have more <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> with most having a highly flexible neck consisting of 13-25 vertebrae.|$|R
50|$|Three-toed sloths are unusual {{amongst the}} mammals in {{possessing}} {{as many as}} nine <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> which {{may be due to}} mutations in the homeotic genes. All other mammals have seven <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> other than the two-toed sloth and the manatee, which have only six.|$|R
25|$|The {{vertebral}} column in dinosaurs {{consists of the}} cervical (neck), dorsal (back), sacral (hips), and caudal (tail) vertebrae. Saurischian dinosaur vertebrae sometimes possess features known as pleurocoels, which are hollow depressions on the lateral portions of the vertebrae, perforated to create an entrance into the air chambers within the vertebrae, which served to decrease the weight of these bones without sacrificing strength. These pleurocoels were filled with air sacs, which would have further decreased weight. In sauropod dinosaurs, the largest known land vertebrates, pleurocoels and air sacs may have reduced the animal's weight by over a ton in some instances, a handy evolutionary adaption in animals that grew to over 30 metres in length. In many hadrosaur and theropod dinosaurs, the caudal vertebrae were reinforced by ossified tendons. The presence of three or more sacral vertebrae, {{in association with the}} hip bones, is one of the defining characteristics of dinosaurs. The occipital condyle is a structure on the posterior part of a dinosaur's skull which articulates with the first <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{spine of}} a horse's back is {{supported}} by muscles, three ligaments, and abdominal muscles. The Spinalis Dorsi originates on the fourth <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra</b> and inserts beneath the thoracic section of the Trapezius. The Longissimus dorsi originates from the last four cervical vertebrae, and courses along the spine, inserting eventually into the ilium and sacrum. This muscle contracts the spine and also raises and supports the head and neck, and is the main muscle used for rearing, kicking, jumping, and turning. It is the longest and strongest muscle in the body, and is the muscle the rider sits on. The Intercostal muscles begin at the spaces between the ribs and aid in breathing. The external and internal abdominal obliques {{are attached to the}} ribs and pelvic bones, and support the internal organs. The Supraspinous ligament begins at the poll and ends at the croup (sacral vertebrae). It supports the head and neck, and its traction force aids in supporting the weaker thoracic and lumbar areas. It spreads out and attaches to the spines of the cervical vertebrae. In the wither and neck area, it is called the nuchal ligament.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{symbolism}} Jesus {{used in the}} New Testament revolved around the pastoral culture of Israel, and explained {{his relationship with his}} followers as analogous to that of a good shepherd protecting his flock from wolves. An innovation in the popular image of wolves started by Jesus includes the concept of the wolf in sheep's clothing, which warns people against false prophets. Several authors have proposed that Jesus's portrayal of wolves, comparing them to dangerous and treacherous people, was an important development in perceptions on the species, which legitimized centuries of subsequent wolf persecution in the western world. Subsequent medieval Christian literature followed and expanded upon Biblical teachings on the wolf. It appeared in the seventh century edition of the Physiologus, which infused pagan tales with the spirit of Christian moral and mystical teaching. The Physiologus portrays wolves as being able to strike men dumb on sight, and of having only one <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra.</b> Dante included a she-wolf, representing greed and fraud, in the first canto of the Inferno. The Malleus Maleficarum, first published in 1487, states that wolves are either agents of God sent to punish the wicked, or agents of Satan, sent with God's blessing to test the faith of believers.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cervical</b> <b>{{vertebrae}}</b> of Teleocrater {{from the}} front half of the neck are quite long, up to 3.5 times {{as long as they}} are high; they are among the longest of Triassic avemetatarsalians. Proportionally, they are longer than either the rest of the <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> or any of the vertebrae {{from the front}} of the trunk. On the <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> the tops of the neural spines are blade-like, but are accompanied by rounded and roughened projections; the front portions of the neural spines strongly overhang the preceding vertebrae; and the <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> from the back of the neck have an additional projection above the parapophysis, previously identified by Nesbitt as part of a [...] "divided parapophysis". These are shared characteristics of the Aphanosauria. In contrast to most other archosauriforms, the openings of the cervical neural canals in Teleocrater are large, subelliptical, and transition from being wider than they are tall at the front of the neck to being taller than they are wide at the back of the neck; this may be unique to the genus. The epipophyses from the front and middle <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> project backwards, and, as in Yarasuchus and some pseudosuchians, the back <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> appear to have supported three-headed ribs.|$|R
500|$|Tanystropheus and Dinocephalosaurus {{accomplished}} their extremely elongated necks {{in different}} ways. The neck of Tanystropheus {{is composed of}} 13 elongated <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> whereas the neck of Dinocephalosaurus is composed of at least 27 <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> that are not as elongated. Among the 27 vertebrae of Dinocephalosaurus, the longest is the nineteenth, which measures approximately [...] long. By comparison, the longest vertebrae in a Chinese specimen of Tanystropheus are the ninth and tenth, which measure [...] long. Additionally, the <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> of Dinocephalosaurus are not hollow, unlike those of Tanystropheus.|$|R
40|$|Radiologist always {{examines}} X-ray {{to determine}} abnormal changes in cervical, lumbar & thoracic vertebrae. Osteophyte (bony growth) may {{appear at the}} corners of vertebrae so that vertebral shape becomes abnormal. This paper presents the idea from Image processing techniques such as customised Hough transform which will be used for segmentation which should be independent of rotation, scale, noise & shape. This segmented image will be then used for computing size invariant, convex hull based features to differentiate normal <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> from <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae</b> containing anterior osteophyte. This approach effectively finds anterior osteophytes in <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebrae...</b>|$|R
500|$|Spinal nerves emerge {{sequentially}} {{from the}} spinal cord with the spinal nerve closest to the head (C1) emerging in the space above the first <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra.</b> [...] The cranial nerves, however, emerge from {{the central nervous system}} above this level. Each cranial nerve is paired and is present on both sides. Depending on definition in humans there are twelve or thirteen cranial nerves pairs, which are assigned Roman numerals I–XII, sometimes also including cranial nerve zero. The numbering of the cranial nerves is based on the order in which they emerge from the brain, front to back (brainstem).|$|E
500|$|The giraffe has an {{extremely}} elongated neck, {{which can be}} up to [...] in length, accounting {{for much of the}} animal's vertical height. The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra</b> is over [...] long. They comprise 52–54 per cent of the length of the giraffe's vertebral column, compared with the 27–33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe’s closest living relative, the okapi. This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults. The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a strengthened nuchal ligament, which are anchored by long dorsal spines on the anterior thoracic vertebrae, giving the animal a hump.|$|E
500|$|While {{the skull}} of Hatzegopteryx was unusually large and robust, its wing bones are {{comparable}} to those of other flying pterosaurs, indicating that it was not flightless. Buffetaut et al. suggested that, in order to fly, the skull weight of Hatzegopteryx must have been reduced in some way. The necessary weight reduction may have accomplished by the internal structure of the skull bones, which were full of small pits and hollows (alveoli) up to [...] long, separated by a matrix of thin bony struts (trabeculae). The wing bones also bear a similar internal structure. This unusual construction differs from that of other pterosaurs, and resembles more closely the structure of expanded polystyrene (used to manufacture Styrofoam). This would have made the skull sturdy and stress-resistant, but also lightweight, enabling the animal to fly. A similar internal structure is also seen in the <b>cervical</b> <b>vertebra</b> referred to Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
