5|$|Despite the series' {{success on}} Fox Kids, Animaniacs on Kids' WB was only {{successful}} in an unintended way, bringing in adult viewers and viewers outside the Kids' WB target demographic of young children. This unintended result of adult viewers {{and not enough}} young viewers {{put pressure on the}} WB network from advertisers and caused dissatisfaction from the WB network towards Animaniacs. Slowly, orders from the WB for more Animaniacs episodes dwindled and Animaniacs had a <b>couple</b> <b>more</b> short seasons, relying on leftover scripts and storyboards. The fourth season had eight episodes, which was reduced from 18 because of Warner Bros.' dissatisfaction with Animaniacs. The 99th and final Animaniacs episode was aired on November 14, 1998.|$|E

In early January, Pusha stated that fellow Clipse member No Malice could appear on the album, however, in July, he confirmed that Malice would not be featured on the album. He also said his dream collaboration for the album would be with Jay-Z. In an August 22, 2013, appearance on MTV's RapFix he confirmed that additional guest appearances, that had yet to be revealed would come from Ab-Liva, Kelly Rowland, and Pharrell.|$|E

40|$|Using the American Community Survey data 2012 - 2013, I study {{married and}} {{cohabiting}} same-sex couples.

Education does not increase the odds of marriage among same-sex couples, contrary to heterosexual couples; lesbians are instead similar to heterosexual couples in their education being negatively associated {{to the number of}} children...|$|R
5|$|Years later, Bennett would {{recall his}} dismay at {{being asked to}} do {{contemporary}} material, comparing it to when his mother was forced to produce a cheap dress.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the B_ 1 g and B_ 2 g Raman spectra of electron-doped cuprate superconductors Nd_ 2 -xCe_xCuO_ 4 and Pr_ 2 -xCe_xCuO_ 4 using a weakly coupled two-band model. One {{of these two}} bands is centered around (±π/ 2, ±π/ 2) and <b>couples</b> <b>more</b> strongly with the B_ 2 g mode, while the other is centered around (±π, 0) and (0, ±π) and <b>couples</b> <b>more</b> strongly with the B_ 1 g mode. This model explains in a natural way why the B_ 2 g Raman peak occurs at a higher frequency than the B_ 1 g one at optimal doping, and how these two peaks change with doping in agreement with experiments. Our result suggests that the superconducting pairing in electron-doped high-T_c cuprates has the d_x^ 2 -y^ 2 -wave symmetry and results from the same mechanism as for hole doped materials.

40|$|Are married <b>couples</b> <b>more</b> credit {{constrained}} than unmarried households? If {{the cost}} of separation {{increases the risk of}} default, banks might be willing to lend to stable couples. In presence of incomplete information, marriage {{could be used as a}} signal of the quality of the match. This paper investigates the link between marriage and credit constraints. I use matching methods to evaluate the impact of marriage on credit constraints. I find that married <b>couples</b> are <b>more</b> likely to be approved for their loan, but they bear higher costs of credit. The differences between married and unmarried couples can be attributed to selection in the marriage rather than to discrimination against unmarried couples. marriage, credit constraints, signal, matching estimator...|$|R

Upon Leopold's death in 1792, his son, Francis, a conservative ruler, was ready to support the cause of the French royal <b>couple</b> <b>more</b> vigorously because he feared the consequences of the French Revolution and its ideas for the monarchies of Europe, particularly, for Austria's influence in the continent.|$|E

25|$|After a <b>couple</b> <b>more</b> turns, {{the routes}} leave {{the town of}} Highland for the town of Bethel, where the route turns northeast, passing Toronto Lake at a {{junction}} with CR26 (Crystal Lake Road). At this junction, the co-designation changes once again as NY55 becomes concurrent with CR13 as it passes the Toronto Reservoir. Winding out of the reservoir area, NY55 and CR13 pass multiple homes as the route passes through the hamlet of Black Lake. Passing the namesake body of water, NY55 and CR13 bend northeast and soon northward past numerous homes for several miles. A short distance later, the routes reach a junction with NY17B. At this junction, NY17B and NY55 become concurrent (and maintained by NYSDOT).|$|E

Released by MCA it reached UK No.46. The band continued working on new material, but Regan soon left. Although remaining members continued for a <b>couple</b> <b>more</b> months without Regan's input, they disbanded in early 1993, with the album they had been working on being subsequently released under the group name Seeing Stars.|$|E
25|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E was {{the final}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season. The storm developed out of a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on October 8. The wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the eastern Pacific on October 18. The system began to gradually organize, and on October 25 it was classified as a tropical depression. The storm did not significantly intensify, as wind shear prevented it from attaining tropical storm status. The short-lived depression moved northward, and made landfall in Mexico on October 26. Quickly deteriorating, the system dissipated shortly thereafter, although its remnants persisted for a <b>couple</b> <b>more</b> days. The depression had no major effects on land. However, it produced heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico, and the remnants triggered thunderstorms over the southwestern United States.|$|E

25|$|That {{was before}} they got in to bat, however. England survived the first three overs, bowled by McGrath and Lee, without loss. From then on, however, the English lost wickets by the bucketful. England went from 11 for 0 to 19 for 4 {{in the space of}} four overs, as the bowlers put the {{pressure}} on immediately, and their entire top-order came and went for single-figure scores. Paul Collingwood and Andrew Flintoff survived for a <b>couple</b> <b>more</b> overs, before Flintoff edged McGrath to slip – the score 33 for 5, and England should see themselves lucky to bat out 50 overs – or even score 100 runs. Collingwood and Geraint Jones decided to wait, giving McGrath maiden overs (as he finished his first bowling spell with figures of 7–4–9–3), and despite the batsmen being rapped on the pads, they survived, even taking the occasional six off Jason Gillespie.|$|E
25|$|After a <b>couple</b> <b>more</b> completions, the Badgers had {{the ball}} at the Sun Devil 13-yard line for 1st and 10. The Badgers were in {{possession}} of the football with 18 seconds left, hoping to kick a game-winning field goal. Upon the hike Quarterback Joel Stave knelt {{in the middle of}} the field to center the ball for their kicker. Stave then placed the ball quickly on the ground after the play was blown dead by the referee. Replays showed that Stave did get his knee down for a brief second, however Arizona State believed that it was a fumble, and ASU Anthony Jones dove on top of the ball, with the game clock running. At this point Badgers players signalled to the officials, pointing out the delay of game penalty by ASU due to Anthony being top of the football. Umpire Jack Folliard motioned to Stave acknowledging his knee, however the rest of the officiating crew allegedly did not see this signal. The umpire then spotted the ball after a significant delay, but told the Wisconsin offensive line to wait to line up, even though the clock continued to run. Finally, with approximately 2 seconds remaining, the umpire rushed behind the defensive line as Wisconsin tried to run a play to spike the ball and stop the clock but the clock reached zero before the ball was snapped and the game was over.|$|E

Back inside the town hall after they entered through a tunnel, Regina and Robin uses Zelena's distraction to take the baby, only to be caught by Hades, who wants to use the crystal to destroy Regina first explaining that the crystal won't allow the person {{to move on to the}} Underworld but rather simply destroying their very presence, but Robin sacrifices himself as he saves Regina from being destroyed by Hades. Then Zelena comes in, and picks up the crystal as Hades tempted Zelena to kill Regina, only to have Zelena realize that Hades never changed and kills Hades instantly by stabbing the crystal through his heart. Later, Emma, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, Regina, Zelena and others attend Robin Hood's funeral, as Zelena tells Regina that she has named her daughter Robin in honor of her father. Emma decides to stay for a <b>couple</b> <b>more</b> minutes, and notices a resurrected Hook, who was brought back by Zeus as a reward for helping to defeat Hades, and the two are happily reunited. During this time, Mr. Gold comes inside Regina's office, and it is revealed that a piece of the Olympian Crystal is still around, which Mr. Gold collects for a new plan.|$|E
