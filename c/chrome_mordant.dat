500|$|Natural alum (aluminum sulfate) is {{the most}} common {{metallic}} salt mordant, but tin (stannous chloride), copper (cupric sulfate), iron (ferrous sulfate, called copperas) and chrome (potassium dichromate) are also used. [...] Iron mordants [...] "sadden" [...] colors, while tin and <b>chrome</b> <b>mordants</b> brighten colors. [...] The iron mordants contribute to fabric deterioration, referred to as [...] "dye rot". Additional chemicals or alterants may be applied after dying to further alter or reinforce the colors.|$|R

[...] <b>Chrome</b> or <b>mordant</b> dyes produced a muted but very fast color range for woollens. [...] These were followed by acid dyes for animal fibres (from 1875) and the synthesis of indigo in Germany in 1880.

[...] Disperse dyes were introduced in 1923 to color the new textiles of cellulose acetate, which could not be colored with any existing dyes. [...] Today disperse dyes are the only effective means of coloring many synthetics. [...] Reactive dyes for both wool and cotton were introduced in the mid-1950s, and are used both in commercial textile production and in craft dyeing.|$|R
