50|$|Strobing {{can also}} refer to <b>cross</b> <b>colour</b> and Moiré patterning. <b>Cross</b> <b>colour</b> refers to when any high {{frequency}} luminance {{content of the}} picture, close to the TV systems colour sub-carrier frequency, is interpreted by the analogue receiver's decoder as colour information. Moiré patterning is where an interference pattern is produced by fine scene detail beating with the line (or even pixel) structure of the device used to analyse or display the scene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>Colours</b> is a {{clothing}} brand launched in 1989 by Carl Jones. Launched {{on the premise}} of producing “clothes without prejudices” <b>Cross</b> <b>Colours</b> helped establish a fashion market based around black youth. The clothing was used to broadcast political and social messages.|$|R
50|$|In 2014 <b>Cross</b> <b>Colours</b> made a {{fresh start}} as a multistyle street fashion label. <b>Cross</b> <b>Colours</b> does not {{specifically}} target the African-American youth but targets a broader multicultural group. The original mission, to make clothes without prejudice, was incorporated into a broader mission.|$|R

50|$|He {{eventually}} {{started a}} company called Surf Fetish, which rode the wave of beachwear trends. He also hired Thomas Walker, a graphic designer who would eventually become vice president of <b>Cross</b> <b>Colours.</b> For Jones, <b>Cross</b> <b>Colours</b> {{was a way to}} broadcast political and social messages-such as denouncing gangs or calling for racial unity-to the African American community, and eventually other communities as the clothes' popularity spread.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>Colours</b> was relaunched in the USA for Spring/Summer 2014. The {{collection}} {{is available at}} retailers such as Jimmy Jazz, DTLR, Sheikh Shoes, Zumiez, and Dr. Jays.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>Colours</b> {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{companies}} to make urban gear fashionable. It set out to harness the hip-hop craze with a line of street-inspired fashions for young men. Its products are sold by more than 3,000 retail outlets.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to working with}} a mainstream color selection Williams modified the baggy pants that had become the basis of street fashion. According to Williams black people never liked tight fitting jeans. They would always buy a bigger size but then the waist would be too big, {{so he decided to}} increase the pant size. In 1994, Williams used $500,000 in profits to launch his company [...] "Karl Kani Infinity". In {{addition to}} his old partners, Kani now faced a marketing onslaught from hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons's Phat Farm and a number of mainstream clothiers. Kani also had reason to worry that his involvement in <b>Cross</b> <b>Colours</b> might taint his operation in the minds of retailers. [...] "I expected some resistance," [...] Kani himself averred.

This [...] "generalised" [...] serialism (in the strongest possible sense) aims not to exclude any musical phenomena, no matter how heterogenous, in order [...] "to control the effects of tonal determinism, dialectize its causal functions, and overcome any academic prohibitions, especially the fixing of an anti-grammar meant to replace some previous one" [...]|$|R

2500|$|Isotropic solids do not exhibit birefringence. However, {{when they}} are under {{mechanical}} stress, birefringence results. The stress can be applied externally or is [...] "frozen in" [...] after a birefringent plastic ware is cooled after it is manufactured using injection molding. When such a sample is placed between two <b>crossed</b> polarizers, <b>colour</b> patterns can be observed, because polarization of a light ray is rotated after passing through a birefringent material {{and the amount of}} rotation is dependent on wavelength.

This effect was first discovered in Japanese silks, when the material was folded, optical patterns and colours floated above the actual patterns and colour of the material. This method produced a dramatic effect when Kidner <b>crossed</b> 2 <b>colour</b> bands with a third at a slight angle, resulting in a completely new pattern, with a wave like vertical image hovering into view producing an intense optical dazzle.|$|R

40|$|Mimetic {{colour pattern}} races of Heliconius {{butterflies}} provide a striking example of adaptive radiation and numerous crossing experiments {{have investigated the}} genetics of these racial differences. However, colour pattern differentiation between closely related Heliconius species has not been previously studied. Here we present data from crosses between H. erato cyrbia and its sister species, H. himera. The genetic architecture underlying colour pattern divergence between these species is identical to that observed between races of H. erato. As in inter-racial <b>crosses,</b> <b>colour</b> pattern differences resulted from segregation at a few major loci. Evidence from 1321 offspring in 4 F 1, 17 backcross, 7 F 2 and 21 further crosses showed that two major loci controlled most of the colour pattern differences between H. erato and H. himera. There were strong interactions between these loci in their patterns of expression and evidence for other loci with relatively minor phenotypic effects. More importantly, based on patterns of expression within broods and linkage with Aconitase, we conclude that these major loci were homologous with those known {{to be responsible for}} colour pattern differences within H. erato. Our crosses also permit a re-evaluation of the relationships between colour pattern races of H. erato. This suggests that H. e. hydara, which occurs across a major mtDNA break, is the ancestral phenotype from which other races have evolved. Based on this assumption, we find no evidence to support the recent suggestion that apparently homologous colour pattern alleles have arisen multiple times...|$|R
