5|$|A {{mitochondrion}} contains DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, {{such as those of}} the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this <b>co-location</b> is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure is also found in prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the mitochondrion was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E

50|$|Parent company Darden also {{announced}} {{it was going to}} begin co-locating Olive Garden and sibling chain Red Lobster locations. The new format stores are designed for smaller market locations and will have separate entrances and dining areas but operate a single kitchen and support areas.

40|$|Summary: Breeding {{programs}} {{face the}} challenge of integrating information from genomics and from quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in order to identify genomic sequences controlling the variation of important traits. Despite the devel-opment of integrative databases, building a consensus map of genes, QTL and other loci gathered from multiple maps remains a manual and tedious task. Nevertheless, this is a critical step to reveal <b>co-locations</b> between genes and QTL. Another important matter is to determine whether QTL linked to same traits or related ones is detected in inde-pendent experiments and located in the same region, and represents a single locus or not. Statistical tools such as meta-analysis can be used to answer this question. BioMercator has been developed to automate map compilation and QTL meta-analysis, and to visualize <b>co-locations</b> between genes and QTL through a graphical interface...|$|R

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana natural {{variation}} {{was used}} to study plant performance viewed as the accumulation of photo-assimilates, their allocation and storage, {{in relation to other}} growth-related features and flowering-related traits. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis using recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between Landsberg erecta (originating from Poland) and Kondara (originating from Tajikistan) grown on hydroponics, revealed QTLs for the different aspects of plant growth-related traits, sugar and starch contents and flowering-related traits. <b>Co-locations</b> of QTLs for these different aspects were detected at different regions, mainly at the ER locus; the top of chromosomes 3, 4 and 5; and the bottom of chromosome 5. Increased plant growth was associated with early flowering and leaf transitory starch, and correlated negatively with the levels of soluble sugar at early phases of development. From the significant correlations and the <b>co-locations</b> of the QTLs for these aspects, we conclude that there is a complex relationship between plant growth-related traits, carbohydrate content and flowering-related traits...|$|R

25|$|This {{system was}} {{deployed}} to satisfy {{scientific and technical}} intelligence collection requirements during the Cold War. The first installation (designated AN/FPS-17, XW-1) at Diyarbakir was originally intended to provide surveillance of the USSR's missile test range at Kapustin Yar south of Stalingrad - especially to detect missile launchings. The data it produced, however, exceeded surveillance requirements, permitting the derivation of missile trajectories, the identification of earth satellite launches, the calculation of a satellite's ephemeris (position and orbit), and the synthesis of booster rocket performance. The success achieved by this fixed-beam radar led to the <b>co-location</b> of a tracking radar (AN/FPS-79), beginning in mid-1964.

25|$|King Charles was {{executed}} by Parliament in 1649; his death left Henrietta Maria almost destitute and in shock, a situation not {{helped by the}} French civil war of the Fronde, which left Henrietta Maria's nephew King Louis XIV short of money himself. Henrietta Maria also {{was no longer the}} Queen but the Queen Mother to the young King Charles II. During the ensuing, and final, Third English Civil War the whole of the Royalist circle now based itself from St-Germain, with the Queen Mother's followers being joined by the old Royalist circle who had been with Charles II at the Hague, including Ormonde and Inchiquin and Clarendon, whom she particularly disliked. She also quarrelled with Ormonde: when she said that if she had been trusted the King would be in England, Ormonde, with his usual bluntness, retorted that if she had never been trusted the King need never have left England. <b>Co-location</b> began to bring the factions together, but Henrietta Maria's influence was waning. In 1654, Charles II moved his court on to Cologne, eliminating the remaining influence of the Queen Mother in St-Germain.|$|E
40|$|The Department of Education's ("Department") {{decisions}} to close or co-locate schools frequently involves {{the loss of}} critical space and programs, which can have serious impacts on students' education. Historically, in making these decisions the Department has a poor track record of soliciting and incorporating parental and community input. Despite new parental engagement procedures added to the law in 2009 to facilitate greater parental consultation in major school change decisions, this year's story {{does not seem to}} be markedly different. The Department treated these hearings as procedural hurdles in order to satisfy the letter of the law, rather than an opportunity to engage in a productive dialogue about the impacts of proposed school closures and <b>co-locations</b> on students and what is in the best interests of affected students. By examining the New York State Education Law, Educational Impact Statements (EIS), transcripts from public hearings, and by conducting a parent survey of 873 parents at 34 schools affected by <b>co-locations,</b> the report concludes that the Department's parental engagement process provided insufficient information and left too many questions unanswered questions about how students and the school community will be affected by these major school decisions. The report's key finding is that the EIS [...] the official document assessing the impact that a proposed change will have on school services [...] does not provide adequate information for members of the school community to understand and comment about how students will be affected by these decisions. This finding is consistent with the courts' recent decision that the school closure process is flawed. Further, if not well-planned and coordinated, closures and <b>co-locations</b> can disrupt students' education and decrease their access to school facilities such as classrooms, gymnasiums and cafeterias...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the genetic}} control of sugar {{metabolism}} is essential to enhance fruit quality and promote fruit consumption. The sugar content and composition of fruits varies with species, cultivar and stage of development, and is controlled by multiple enzymes. A QTL (quantitative trait locus) study was performed on peach fruit [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch], the model species for Prunus Progeny derived from an interspecific cross between P. persica cultivars and P. davidiana was used. Dynamic QTLs for fresh weight, sugars, acids, and enzyme activities related to sugar metabolism were detected at different stages during fruit development. Changing effects of alleles during fruit growth were observed, including inversions close to maturity. This QTL analysis was supplemented by the identification of genes annotated on the peach genome as enzymes linked to sugar metabolism or sugar transporters. Several cases of <b>co-locations</b> between annotated genes, QTLs for enzyme activities and QTLs controlling metabolite concentrations were observed and discussed. These <b>co-locations</b> raise hypotheses regarding the functional regulation of sugar metabolism and {{pave the way for}} further analyses to enable the identification of the underlying genes.

40|$|Ensuring {{the quality}} of service (QoS) for latency-sensitive {{applications}} while allowing <b>co-locations</b> of multiple applications on servers is critical for improving server utilizationandreducingcostinmodernwarehouse-scalecomputers (WSCs). Recent work relies on static profiling to precisely predict the QoS degradation that results from performance interference among co-running applications {{to increase the number}} of “safe ” <b>co-locations.</b> However, these static profiling techniques have several critical limitations: 1) a priori knowledge of all workloads is required for profiling, 2) it is difficult for the prediction to capture or adapt to phase or load changes of applications, and 3) the prediction technique is limited to only two co-running applications. To address all of these limitations, we present Bubble-Flux, an integrated dynamic interference measurement and onlineQoSmanagementmechanismtoprovideaccurateQoS control and maximize server utilization. Bubble-Flux uses a Dynamic Bubble to probe servers in real time to measure the instantaneous pressure on the shared hardware resources and precisely predict how the QoS of a latency-sensitive job will be affected by potential co-runners. Once “safe ” batch jobs are selected and mapped to a server, Bubble-Flux uses an Online Flux Engine to continuously monitor the QoS of the latency-sensitive application and control the execution of batch jobs to adapt to dynamic input, phase, and load changes to deliver satisfactory QoS. Batch applications remain in a state of flux throughout execution. Our results show that the utilization improvement achieved by Bubble-Flux is up to 2. 2 x better than the prior static approach. 1...|$|R
