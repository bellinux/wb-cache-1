5|$|The {{hospital}} ship , {{which had been}} sent out to rescue survivors from the sunken boats, was seized by the British for violating the Hague Convention rules {{on the use of}} {{hospital ship}}s. The loss of a squadron of German torpedo boats led to a drastic change in tactics in the English Channel and along the coast of Flanders. There were fewer sorties into the Channel and the torpedo boat force was relegated to coastal patrol and rescuing aircrew. The British received a bonus on 30 November, when a trawler pulled up the sealed chest thrown off S119 by Captain Thiele. The chest contained a German <b>codebook</b> used by the German light forces stationed on the coast, allowing the British to read German wireless communication for long afterwards.|$|E
30|$|Grassmannian <b>codebooks</b> {{are widely}} used to {{quantize}} the CSI [13 – 15]. It has been well-known that the Grassmannian <b>codebooks</b> are optimal for independent identically distributed channels, but {{it is challenging to}} design the optimal <b>codebooks</b> except for some special cases. Therefore, it is impractical to use Grassmannian <b>codebooks</b> for limited feedback [17, 18]. Random vector quantization (RVQ) <b>codebooks,</b> which consist of independent isotopically distributed unit norm vectors, are proposed to reduce the design complexity in [19] and [20]. For moderate size <b>codebooks,</b> RVQ <b>codebooks</b> perform close to the Grassmannian <b>codebooks</b> for wireless channels with independent identically distributed gain. An IA scheme with RVQ-based quantized transmit precoders for MIMO interference channel is proposed in [21].|$|R

5|$|Still 200 {{miles from}} the Afghan border, the {{expedition}} now had to race against time. Ahead were British patrols of the East Persia Cordon (later known as the Seistan Force) and Russian patrols. By September, the German <b>codebook</b> lost by Wassmuss had been deciphered, which further compromised the situation. Niedermayer, now in charge, {{proved to be a}} brilliant tactician. He sent three feint patrols, one to north-east to draw away the Russian troops and one to the south-east to draw away the British, while a third patrol of thirty armed Persians, led by a German officer—Lieutenant Wagner—was sent ahead to scout the route. After leading the Russians astray, the first group was to remain in Persia to establish a secret desert base as a refuge for the main party. After luring away the British, the second group was to fall back to Kermanshah and link with a separate German force under Lieutenants Zugmayer and Griesinger. All three parties were ordered to spread misleading information about their movements to any nomads or villagers they met. Meanwhile, the main body headed through Chehar Deh for the region of Birjand, close to the Afghan frontier. The party covered forty miles before it reached the next village, where Niedermayer halted to await word from Wagner's patrol. The villagers were meanwhile barred from leaving. The report from Wagner was bad: His patrol had run into a Russian ambush and the desert refuge had been eliminated. The expedition proceeded towards Birjand using forced marches to keep a day ahead of the British and Russian patrols. Other problems still confronted Niedermayer, among them the opium addiction of his Persian camel drivers. Fearful of being spotted, he had to stop the Persians a number of times from lighting up their pipes. Men who fell behind were abandoned. Some of the Persian drivers attempted to defect. On one occasion, a driver was shot while he attempted to flee and betray the group.|$|E

25|$|For {{decades after}} the end of the Second World War, the {{involvement}} of the GC, as well as the code breaking methods used, were kept secret. A number of controversial theories were published before more complete accounts emerged after records were declassified in 1978. Only later, after Dilly's rodding method was demonstrated by Mavis Batey to the Admiral in charge of naval history, were Italian official records corrected. In 1966, H. Montgomery Hyde published a story alleging that a spy (codename Cynthia) seduced Admiral Alberto Lais (the Italian naval attaché in Washington, D.C.) and that she obtained a <b>codebook</b> used by the British to defeat the Italians at Matapan. Hyde was found guilty of libelling the dead, but evidence of GC involvement was not made public at that time.

25|$|The rotors and the {{positioning}} of the ring containing the notch were changed daily. The settings were defined in a <b>codebook</b> that was common to all operators on that network. At {{the start of each}} day, before any messages were sent or received, Enigma operators implemented the day's rotor selection and ring settings. Having selected the three rotors, they adjusted the ring settings. That could be done before the rotors were mounted on their axle or after they had been inserted into the machine. It was possible to adjust the ring settings of the loaded rotors by moving the spring-loaded retaining pin to the right and turning the rotor to display the specified letter. Herivel thought it likely {{that at least some of}} the operators would adjust the rings after they had mounted the rotors in the machine. Having set the alphabet rings and closed the lid, the operator should then have moved the rotors well away from the positions that displayed the three letters of the ring setting in the windows, but some operators did not.|$|E

40|$|Commutation {{signaling}} is an anti-multipath {{modulation technique}} that employs bandwidth spreading to overcome multipath induced intersymbol interference. In this work, a wireless communication system using differential binary phase shift keyed commutation signaling {{has been considered}} for a two-wave Rayleigh fading channel. Commutation signaling code parameters that characterize the system performance (average and worst case) are revealed and <b>codebooks</b> have been constructed based on these parameters. For binary <b>codebooks</b> constructed based on average performance, the maximum probability of error may be very large at certain inter-wave delays. On the other hand, binary and four phase <b>codebooks</b> constructed based on the worst case performance not only ensure an acceptable maximum probability of error, but also give very good average performance. Normally, systems using <b>codebooks</b> that require more bandwidth expansion have better anti-multipath capability.

2500|$|However, {{if we use}} {{very large}} blocks, then the {{estimate}} of per-character entropy rate may become artificially low. This is because in reality, the probability distribution of the sequence is not knowable exactly; it is only an estimate. For example, suppose one considers the text of every book ever published as a sequence, with each symbol being the text of a complete book. If there are [...] published books, and each book is only published once, the estimate of the probability of each book is , and the entropy (in bits) is [...] As a practical code, this corresponds to assigning each book a unique identifier and using it {{in place of the}} text of the book whenever one wants to refer to the book.

Kolmogorov complexity is a theoretical generalization of this idea that allows the consideration of the information content of a sequence independent of any particular probability model; it considers the shortest program for a universal computer that outputs the sequence.
