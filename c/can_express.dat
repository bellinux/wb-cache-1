5|$|In each case, these {{simplified}} models display many of {{the issues}} that have to be handled in practice. Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism problems, <b>can</b> <b>express</b> various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). This allows the models to be made more realistic and practical.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of IS UNKNOWN {{to the other}} operators of SQL's three-valued logic makes the SQL three-valued logic functionally complete, meaning its logical operators <b>can</b> <b>express</b> (in combination) any conceivable three-valued logical function.|$|E
30|$|The same object <b>can</b> be <b>expressed</b> in {{different}} ways.

5|$|Groups share a {{fundamental}} kinship {{with the notion}} of symmetry. For example, a symmetry group encodes symmetry features of a geometrical object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. Lie groups are the symmetry groups used in the Standard Model of particle physics; Poincaré groups, which are also Lie groups, <b>can</b> <b>express</b> the physical symmetry underlying special relativity; and point groups are used to help understand symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry.|$|E
25|$|When {{the tree}} weight {{is the product}} of the rule weights, WCFGs and PCFGs <b>can</b> <b>express</b> the same set of {{probability}} distributions.|$|E

5000|$|The modal verb <b>can</b> <b>expresses</b> {{possibility}} {{in either a}} dynamic, deontic, or epistemic sense, that is, in terms of innate ability, permissibility, or possible circumstance. For example: ...|$|R

25|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that we <b>can</b> <b>express</b> the jet of a curve through p {{in terms of its}} Taylor series in local {{coordinates}} on M.|$|E
25|$|Apart from logical connectives (Boolean operators), {{functional}} completeness can {{be introduced}} in other domains. For example, {{a set of}} reversible gates is called functionally complete, if it <b>can</b> <b>express</b> every reversible operator.|$|E
25|$|Hairstyles <b>can</b> <b>express</b> a character's emotions: warriors {{express their}} sadness at losing a battle by {{swinging}} their ponytails. For the female roles, buns indicated a maiden, while {{a married woman}} has a 'dai tau' (低頭).|$|E
5000|$|Delambre and Bessel both wrote their {{series in}} a form that allows them to be {{generalized}} to arbitrary order. The coefficients in Bessel's series <b>can</b> <b>expressed</b> particularly simply ...|$|R

25|$|The XPS print path can {{automatically}} calibrate color profile settings {{with those}} {{being used by}} the display subsystem. Conversely, XPS print drivers <b>can</b> <b>express</b> the configurable capabilities of the printer, by virtue of the XPS PrintCapabilities class, to enable more fine-grained control of print settings, tuned to the individual printing device.|$|E
25|$|Brentari classifies sign {{languages}} as a {{whole group}} determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) <b>can</b> <b>express</b> several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine {{the direction of the}} verb's movement (inflection).|$|E
25|$|Reweighted range voting (RRV) is a multi-winner {{voting system}} similar to STV in that voters <b>can</b> <b>express</b> support for {{multiple}} candidates, but different in that candidates are graded instead of ranked. That is, a voter assigns a score to each candidate. The higher a candidate’s scores, {{the greater the}} chance they {{will be among the}} winners.|$|E

25|$|A mother <b>can</b> <b>express</b> (produce) her {{milk for}} storage and later use. Expression occurs with massage or a breast pump. It {{can be stored}} in freezer storage bags, {{containers}} made specifically for breastmilk, a supplemental nursing system, or a bottle ready for use. Using someone other than the mother/wet nurse to deliver the bottle maintains the baby's association of nursing with the mother/wet nurse and bottle feeding with other people.|$|E
25|$|Sentences of {{the second}} type are called false passives by some linguists, who feel that such {{sentences}} are simply confused with the passive voice due to their outward similarity. Other linguists consider the second type {{to be a different}} kind of passive – a stative or static passive, in contrast to the dynamic or eventive passive illustrated by the first sentence. Some languages express or <b>can</b> <b>express</b> these different meanings using different constructions.|$|E
25|$|Any {{transfer}} {{of more than}} 30% of the ownership of a broadcasting licence (including cable/satellite distribution licences) requires advance approval of the commission. One condition normally {{taken into account in}} such a decision is the level of foreign ownership; federal regulations require that Canadian citizens ultimately own a majority of a broadcast license. Usually this {{takes the form of a}} public process, where interested parties <b>can</b> <b>express</b> their concerns and sometimes including a public hearing, followed by a commission decision.|$|E

25|$|Homosexuality is {{the romantic}} or sexual {{attraction}} to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation <b>can</b> <b>express</b> their sexuality {{in a variety of}} ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors. Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.|$|E
25|$|Hasidic thought {{extends the}} Divine immanence of Kabbalah by holding that God {{is all that}} really exists, all else being {{completely}} undifferentiated from God's perspective. This view {{can be defined as}} monistic panentheism. According to this philosophy, God's existence is higher than anything that this world <b>can</b> <b>express,</b> yet he includes all things of this world within his Divine reality in perfect unity, so that the Creation effected no change in him at all. This paradox is dealt with at length in Chabad texts.|$|E
25|$|RuneScape {{features}} a character-customisation system. Player characters are always human; however, players may choose the gender, hairstyle, facial hair, skin colour, and clothing options. Appearance is further complemented by wearing or wielding items. Players <b>can</b> <b>express</b> emotions {{through the use}} of specialised animations called emotes, some of which are standard and others earned through gameplay or released during holiday events. Standard weapons of the same class, such as swords, use the same set of animations in combat, while special weapons have their own, distinctive animations.|$|E
50|$|Eigenfunctions <b>can</b> be <b>expressed</b> as column vectors and linear {{operators}} <b>can</b> be <b>expressed</b> as matrices, {{although they}} may have infinite dimensions.

5000|$|Future <b>can</b> be <b>expressed</b> using [...] + infinitive. For example, (Pirkei Avoth 3:1): [...] "". However, unlike Modern Hebrew {{but like}} {{contemporary}} Aramaic, the present active participle <b>can</b> also <b>express</b> the future.

50|$|Thus in the {{positional}} decimal system, {{the numbers}} 0 to 9 <b>can</b> be <b>expressed</b> using their respective numerals '0' to '9' in the rightmost 'units' position. The number 12 <b>can</b> be <b>expressed</b> with the numeral '2' in the units position, {{and with the}} numeral '1' in the 'tens' position, {{to the left of}} the '2' while the number 312 <b>can</b> be <b>expressed</b> by three numerals: '3' in the 'hundreds' position, '1' in the 'tens' position, and '2' in the 'units' position.|$|R
