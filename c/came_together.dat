5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups <b>came</b> <b>together</b> in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) <b>came</b> <b>together,</b> and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|A {{murder by}} cyanide was sensational news in Washington.

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty to animals and people.

5|$|Through {{most of the}} Archean Eon, the Earth had a heat {{production}} at least twice that of the present, which caused tectonic processes to be more active.

5|$|Dr. Lamberti of Bari had {{suggested}} to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo {{might be the}} Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali {{was the same as}} Zinfandel, among them Croatian-born winemaker Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers <b>came</b> <b>together</b> as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Havelock {{moved away}} from the socialist organisations he had been {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued to write about politics, however, and his political and academic work <b>came</b> <b>together</b> in his ideas about education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E
5|$|First Nations peoples have lived, hunted, and {{traveled}} across {{the area for}} at least 10,000 years, as shown by archaeological evidence on Walpole Island.

These clans <b>came</b> <b>together</b> through common links in both language and culture, developing a self-sufficient society where tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among all members.|$|E

5|$|From 1859 to 1865, Kogălniceanu was {{on several}} {{occasions}} the cabinet leader in the Moldavian half of the United Principalities, then Prime Minister of Romania, being {{responsible for most of}} the reforms associated with Cuza's reign. His first term in Moldavia ended during December 1860, when Kogălniceanu became involved in the scandal involving Metropolitan Sofronie Miclescu, who opposed Cuza's secularization of the monastery estates. In 1863, secularization was imposed by Cuza, with the land thus freed being divided among peasants—the land reform of 1864, which <b>came</b> <b>together</b> with the universal abolition of corvées.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, {{the city}} council {{submitted}} a memorial to the Minister of Health for permission to extend the borough boundary to include Gunthorpe, Longthorpe, Paston, Walton, Werrington and the area north-east of Fengate; this became effective from 1929. Until this point the council were using the Guildhall {{and a large number}} of subsidiary offices, but the need to widen Narrow Bridge Street and the need for a new Town Hall <b>came</b> <b>together</b> in a combined scheme, resulting in the building of the present Town Hall.

The 4th Brigade assembled at Camp Borden in Ontario, the 5th at Valcartier Camp in Quebec, and the 6th at Camp Shilo in Manitoba. The divisional artillery was concentrated at artillery training centres at Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and at Shilo.|$|E
