40|$|Alkyl nitrites are {{important}} {{building blocks for}} the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In this article, we report a case study for the <b>continuous-flow</b> <b>production</b> of alkyl nitrites, originally designed by BIOS Chemicals. The intrinsic advantages of a Corning(R) Advanced-Flow T reactor system, including high versatility, high mixing, and heat-exchange efficiency under corrosive conditions, allowed {{the development of an}} economically viable and user-friendly process {{in a short period of}} time, leading to a throughput of 10 t/year of processed material with high purity (93 - 98 percent) ...|$|E

40|$|Phenols can be {{efficiently}} {{reduced by}} sodium formate and Pd/C as the catalyst {{in water and}} {{in the presence of}} amines to give the corresponding cyclohexylamines. This reaction works at rt for 12 h or at 60 °C under microwave dielectric heating for 20 min. With the exception of aniline, primary, secondary amines, amino alcohols, and even amino acids can be used as nucleophiles. The reductive process is based on a sustainable hydrogen source and a catalyst that can be efficiently recovered and reused. The protocol was developed into a <b>continuous-flow</b> <b>production</b> of cyclohexylamines in gram scale achieving very efficient preliminary results (TON 32. 7 and TOF 5. 45 h- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{scheduling}} manufacturing systems where {{the capacity of}} a production resource is subject to stochastic change, {{is the subject of}} this paper. Resources which are dependent upon labour intensive processes provide typical examples. In the United Kingdom the manufacture of clothing garments is still dominated by the progressive bundle system. Garments are produced on a <b>continuous-flow</b> <b>production</b> line in which garment pieces are passed in succession through a network of workstations where skilled manual workers complete operations on garments using sewing machines. These production systems are subject to numerous perturbations caused by operator absenteeism and machine breakdown necessitating the need for reactive rescheduling to maintain line balance. In the approach described here, line balance is maintained via periodic schedule repair, based upon reassignment heuristics, supported by partial order backtracking...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of a microfluidic-based process for the production of polymeric micelles (PMs) in continuous-flow microreactors where Pluronic® tri-block copolymer is used as model polymeric biomaterial relating to drug delivery applications. A flow focusing configuration is used enabling a controllable, and fast mixing process to assist the formation of polymeric micelles through nanoprecipitation which is triggered by a solvent exchange process when organic solutions of the polymer mixed with a non-solvent. We experientially investigate the effect of polymer concentration, flow rate ratio and microreactor dimension on the PMs size characteristics. The mixing process within the microfluidic reactors is further analyzed by computational modeling {{in order to understand the}} hydrodynamic process and its implication for the polymeric micells formation process. The results obtained show that besides the effect of the flow rate ratio, the chemical environment in which the aggregation takes place plays an important role in determining the dimensional characteristics of the produced polymeric micelles. It is demonstrated that microfluidic reactors provide a useful platform for the <b>continuous-flow</b> <b>production</b> of polymeric micelles with improved controllability, reproducibility, and homogeneity of the size characteristics...|$|E
30|$|Among {{the most}} {{commonly}} used alkaline catalysts in the biodiesel industry are potassium hydroxide (KOH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) flakes which are inexpensive, easy to handle in transportation and storage, and are preferred by small producers. Alkyl oxide solutions of sodium methoxide or potassium methoxide in methanol, which are now commercially available, are the preferred catalysts for large <b>continuous-flow</b> <b>production</b> processes. However, both NaOH and KOH catalysts cause separation and purification a difficult process due to their high solubility in the both biodiesel and glycerin [109, 156, 157]. Biodiesel with the best properties was obtained using sodium hydroxide as catalyst in many studies. On the other hand, many other studies achieved best results using potassium hydroxide [120]. Refaat used 500  mL reactor at a reaction temperature of 65 °C with a microwave power of 500 W controlled by microprocessor. A methanol/oil molar ratio of 6 : 1 was employed, and potassium hydroxide (1 %) was used as a catalyst. Barium hydroxide was also used a homogeneous catalyst. the range of homogeneous catalysts applied was between 0.1 and 5 % (Table  2) [132]. Slightly higher concentrations of KOH will be required compared to NaOH catalyst due to its higher molecular weight. For feedstock containing high free fatty acid content such as animal fats and used vegetable oils, KOH proved to be a better performer [120, 158]. Transesterification reaction depends on the type of oil and catalyst applied and the effects of catalysts vary with types of oils.|$|E
40|$|Research {{published}} by Corsi et al. (2008) has reported how linearized dsDNA encoding for the firefly luciferase gene can be {{contained within the}} inverse hexagonal phase of the phospholipid 1, 2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), whilst remaining transcriptionally active. The work presented herein builds upon the novel discovery reported by Corsi et al., by fully characterizing and then modifying the reported system to allow for batch, and then <b>continuous-flow,</b> <b>production</b> of mRNA from dsDNA-containing liquid crystalline phases, {{in the context of}} establishing proof of concept for a continuous-flow transcription-translation capable ‘semi-biotic’ device. To give {{a better understanding of the}} lipid-based method of template dsDNA containment for transcription, experiments were performed to assess the transcriptional activity and characterize the partitioning of nucleic acids (dsDNA and mRNA) in DOPE-based transcription assays; these experiments included varying the ionic, reagent concentration and incubation conditions. A number of experiments were also carried out investigating the effect of doping the liquid crystalline phase with the positively charged lipid species 1, 2 -dioleoyl- 3 -trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), and replacing DOPE with the unsaturated monoglyceride monoolein (MO). Investigations have shown that DOPE (95 %) :DOTAP (5 %) liquid crystalline phases were able to achieve similar levels of dsDNA partitioning as pure DOPE lipid buttons; however, these DOTAP-containing phases were transcriptionally inactive. Substitution of DOPE for monoolein did not yield comparable levels of dsDNA partitioning. A batch transcription protocol was developed as a logical progression from one-off transcription towards continuous-flow transcription from dsDNA-containing liquid crystalline phases. Individual liquid crystalline phases, preloaded with dsDNA, were subjected to multiple transcriptions in an effort to establish the maximum lifespan of the phase and the optimal batch transcription parameters. Polarizing light microscopy, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and mass spectrometry were used assess the effect upon the liquid crystalline phase of multiple cycles of batch transcription, whilst quantitative DNA gel electrophoresis was performed to assess the level of dsDNA partitioning over successive batch transcription assays from individual lipid phases. Investigations into batch transcription from dsDNA-containing DOPE liquid crystalline phases have shown that the partitioned dsDNA leaches out from within the phase during the course of successive transcription reactions. In order to assess the viability of a transcription-translation capable semi biotic device that utilizes lyotropic liquid crystalline phases, investigations were made into the suitability of the optimal batch transcription system when incorporated into a thermostatically controlled polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) continuous-flow transcription device. Finally, a critical comparison was made between the initially proposed mechanism of dsDNA containment using lipid based liquid crystalline phases and some of the recently reported alternative methods of dsDNA immobilization...|$|E
