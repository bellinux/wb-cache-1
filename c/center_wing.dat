5|$|A {{batch of}} 10 were {{produced}} and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines {{were joined by}} a <b>center</b> <b>wing</b> formed by two sections 6.15m (20ft) in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing 1,000kW (1,340hp) each. The total fuel capacity was 8,570L (2,260US gal). This was increased by adding of four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 glider or Me 321 for up to 10 hours at cruising speed. It could also remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned as heavy bombers carrying 1,800kg (3,970lb) of bombs and having a range of 4,000km (2,500mi). The ETC installations allowed for a further four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks to be installed.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{considered}} {{several possible}} causes for the structural breakup: structural failure and decompression, detonation of a high-energy explosive device, {{such as a}} missile warhead exploding either upon impact with the airplane, or just before impact, a bomb exploding inside the airplane, or a fuel-air explosion in the <b>center</b> <b>wing</b> fuel tank.|$|E

The SCR-720 {{was the same}} radar installation which was carried aboard the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, a considerably larger aircraft. The right-hand cockpit became the radar operator's position.

25|$|The XP-82 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Packard-built Rolls-Royce V-1650 Merlin engines. Initially, the left engine was a V-1650-23 with a gear {{reduction}} box to allow the left propeller to turn opposite to the right propeller, which was driven by the more conventional V-1650-25. In this arrangement both propellers would turn upward {{as they approached the}} <b>center</b> <b>wing,</b> which in theory would have allowed better single-engine control. This proved not to be the case when the aircraft refused to become airborne during its first flight attempt. After a month of work North American engineers finally discovered that rotating the propellers to meet in the center on their upward turn created sufficient drag to cancel out all lift from the <b>center</b> <b>wing</b> section, one quarter of the aircraft's total wing surface area. The engines and propellers were then exchanged, with their rotation meeting on the downward turn, and the problem was fully solved. The first XP-82 prototype (44-83886) was completed on 25 May 1945, and made the type's first successful flight on 26 June 1945. This aircraft was accepted by the Army Air Forces on 30 August 1945, whose officials were so impressed by the aircraft, while still in development, that they ordered the first production P-82Bs in March 1945, fully three months before its first flight.|$|E
25|$|Though the FQIS {{itself was}} {{designed}} to prevent danger by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of Flight 800's FQIS compensator showed damage {{similar to that of}} the compensator tube identified as the ignition source for the surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near Madrid in 1976. This was not considered proof of a source of ignition. Evidence of arcing was found in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring connecting to the <b>center</b> <b>wing</b> tank. Arcing signs were also seen on two wires sharing a cable raceway with FQIS wiring at station 955.|$|E

2500|$|Jack Northrop became {{involved}} in innovative all-wing aircraft designs in the late-1920s, with his first Flying Wing being built in the 1928–1930 time period. That first prototype, the 1929 Flying Wing X-216H, evolved from earlier design studies. The X-216H had twin rudders with a single horizontal stabilizer running between them; both rudders were connected by twin booms to the thick, all-wing blended fuselage. The aircraft had an open cockpit in the <b>center</b> <b>wing</b> section and single, rear-facing, pusher propeller connected to a piston engine blended into the all-wing shape. The X-216H was first test flown in 1929 with Edward Bellande at the controls; the aircraft displayed adequate performance and was noted for its unique all-metal stressed skin and multi-cellular construction. At about this same time, Jack Northrop became aware of Walter and Reimar Horten's prewar record-setting [...] "tailless" [...] flying wing glider designs being tested in Germany beginning in 1934.|$|E
