5|$|In 1881, Nielsen {{began to}} take his violin playing more seriously, {{studying}} privately under Carl Larsen, the sexton at Odense Cathedral. It is not known how much Nielsen composed during this period, but from his autobiography, it can be deduced that he wrote some trios and quartets for brass instruments, {{and that he had}} difficulty in <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that brass instruments were tuned in different keys. Following an introduction to Niels W. Gade, the director of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, by whom he was well received, Nielsen obtained his release from the military band at short notice, and studied at the Academy from the beginning of 1884.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fall}} of Thessalonica {{appeared}} imminent, Pope Honorius excommunicated Theodore, ordered an embargo on horses, troops, and supplies from the Adriatic ports, and sent letters to Constantinople urging assistance to Demetrius. Demetrius himself went to Italy to seek aid, being received by the Pope in Rome in March 1222 and by Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–50) soon after. A crusade was proclaimed against Theodore, and troops began to gather in Italy. In the meantime, the Latin Empire, now under Robert of Courtenay (r. 1221–28), was once more embroiled in warfare with Nicaea as it supported Laskaris' brothers in their challenge against the new Nicaean emperor, John III Doukas Vatatzes (r. 1222–54). The first detachments of the assembling crusade, under Count Oberto II of Biandrate, arrived at Thessalonica in summer 1222 and joined the de facto regent, Guy Pallavicini. Theodore now hastened his move against Thessalonica. After preliminary operations in late 1222, in early 1223 he laid siege to the city. Honorius excommunicated him again, and redoubled his effort to promote the crusade, which {{had come to a}} standstill in the meantime. At the Pope's urging, Venice and Emperor Frederick promised aid. Robert of Courtenay also pledged to assist, while Honorius called upon the Latin princes of southern Greece to join in the effort. The crusade finally assembled at Brindisi in March 1224. In his instructions to his legate, however, Honorius did not rule out the possibility of Theodore <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Crusaders. True to his word, in April 1224 Robert of Courtenay sent an army to besiege Serres. During the siege, the Latin generals learned of the disastrous defeat of the main Latin army at the hands of John III Doukas Vatatzes at the Battle of Poimanenon. They lifted the siege and hastened back to Constantinople, only to be intercepted by Theodore's men; most of the Latin army were killed or taken prisoner.|$|E

Colin spends weeks <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> news, but Guido stands by him and Colin {{eventually}} accepts his condition. Problems arise in Colin and Guido's relationship in 1989; Colin begins to believe that Guido is only staying with him out of pity. Colin decides to move to his brother's in Bristol. He opts not to tell Guido that he is going, but a surprise visit from Barry stalls his departure and Guido comes home to see Colin packed and ready to leave. Colin tells Guido that he needs some space and asks him to look after his flat while he sorts himself out. He then leaves Walford whilst his friends wave him goodbye.|$|E
25|$|During {{a battle}} against the body-stealing Ophidians and their {{gigantic}} snake-shaped techno-organic warship, the Doctor and Izzy encountered a brash and adventurous fish-woman called Destrii. While seemingly friendly and bonding with Izzy, Destrii was secretly on the run and she swapped bodies with Izzy to cover her escape; when Destrii was seemingly killed, Izzy seemed trapped within an alien body. The Doctor's next few journeys were spent trying to help her in this situation, both in <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> change and finding out what her new body's abilities were. Frida Kahlo helped Izzy mentally deal with the change, but the attempt at testing Izzy's abilities led her and the Doctor into a turbulent encounter with the humanised Daleks he had created in his second incarnation. Unable to prevent their tragic end – self-destructing to escape the machinations of the malevolent psychic Kata-Phobus -, {{the two of them}} were distracted and caught off-guard when Helioth and Hassana, two of the energy-beings called the Horde, abducted Izzy thinking she was Destrii.|$|E
25|$|In 1402–03, Maurice came to Sgouros' aid {{when the}} latter was besieged at Angelokastron {{by the forces of}} Carlo I Tocco. The attack, under Carlo's general Galasso Peccatore, was repulsed, but Sgouros died soon after, leaving his {{possessions}} to his son Paul Spata. In his campaigns against the Spatas, Tocco was supported by a rival Albanian clan to the Spatas, the Bua brothers Maurice and Dimo. In 1406, Carlo and the Bua brothers joined forces to raid and devastate Acarnania and the vicinity of Arta, but the city itself, stoutly defended by Maurice Spata, held out. At Angelokastron, however, Paul Spata, who lacked his father's ability, felt threatened by the Tocco advance and in 1406 called in Ottoman assistance. The Ottoman army, under Yusuf Beg, was defeated, however, and the Turks departed after <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Tocchi. As Maurice refused to come to his cousin's aid, Paul ceded Angelokastron to the Ottomans (only for Carlo Tocco to capture it within less than a year) and retired to Naupactus, which he sold to Venice in 1407–08.|$|E

500|$|Annals of the Western Shore has {{a number}} of themes common across the series, {{including}} power, responsibility, slavery, justice, and the place of women in society. Each of the novels also describes the coming of age of its protagonists, and features explorations of being enslaved to one's own power as well: as with Orrec in Gifts, Memer is initially afraid of her power to consult the Oracle. Memer's coming of age is explored partly in relation to her <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Oracle, a process scholars have referred to as an analog for sexual maturity.|$|E

Estañol recommended <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first group of revolutionaries, by agreeing to the principle of no re-election and a general amnesty, in order to prevent the second group from succeeding.

500|$|Livingstone has {{consistently}} rejected being defined under any particular ideological current of socialism. Recognising this, in 2000, the former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock asserted that Livingstone {{could only be}} defined as a [...] "Kennist". Livingstone's understanding of politics arises from his studies of animal behaviour and anthropology; rejecting the idea that the human species is naturally progressing (a view advocated by socialists like the Fabian Society), Livingstone instead took the view that human society is still <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> massive socio-economic changes that it experienced upon the development of agriculture during the Neolithic. Highlighting that a hunter-gatherer mode of subsistence is more natural to the human species, he believes that modern society has to adopt many hunter-gatherer values – namely mutual co-operation and emphasis on human relationships rather than consumerism – in order to survive.|$|E

500|$|The September 11, 2001 {{attacks are}} used as a motif {{representing}} a {{break with the past}} with Cayce's father, who disappears during the attacks, as the personification of the 20th century. Gibson viewed the attacks as a nodal point after which [...] "nothing is really the same". One reviewer commented that in [...] "Gibson's view, 9-11 was the end of history; after it we are without a history, careening toward an unknown future without the benefit of a past—our lives before 9-11 are now irrelevant." [...] Cayce's search for her father and Damien's excavation of the German bomber symbolize the historicist search for a method to interpret people's actions in the past. Coming to terms with her father's disappearance may be interpreted as a requiem for those lost to the 20th century, something that may have been influenced by Gibson <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> loss of his own father.|$|E
500|$|Literature scholar Tonia Payne {{has written}} that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{is an example of}} ecocriticism, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea that human beings are {{separate}} from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves human beings who live their entire lives on a ship in interstellar space, and who therefore have to create a new reality for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story [...] "Newton's Sleep". The inhabitants of Discovery become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still try to understand Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position {{as a part of a}} continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet. For others, this new reality takes the form of the religious beliefs of the cult of Bliss. These beliefs are portrayed as an understandable attempt to adjust to the reality of spaceflight. A review by Publishers Weekly identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the [...] "Birthday of the World" [...] collection, of characters <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> world they live in.|$|E
500|$|After the AIF was {{transferred}} to the European battlefield, the training system was greatly improved. Efforts were made at standardisation, with a formal training organisation and curriculum—consisting of 14 weeks basic training for infantrymen—being established. In Egypt, as the AIF was expanded in early 1916, each brigade established a training battalion. These formations were later sent to the United Kingdom and were absorbed into a large system of depots that was established on Salisbury Plain by each branch of the AIF including infantry, engineers, artillery, signals, medical and logistics. After completing their initial instruction at depots in Australia and the United Kingdom, soldiers were posted to in-theatre base depots where they received advanced training before being posted as reinforcements to operational units. Like the British Army, the AIF sought to rapidly pass on [...] "lessons learned" [...] as the war progressed, and these were widely transmitted through regularly updated training documents. The experience gained through combat also improved the skills of the surviving officers and men, and by 1918 the AIF was a very well trained and well led force. After <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conditions on the Western Front the Australians had played a part in the development of new combined arms tactics for offensive operations that occurred within the BEF, while in defence they employed patrolling, trench raids, and Peaceful Penetration tactics to dominate no man's land.|$|E

500|$|Marion Blute, in Contemporary Sociology, {{noted that}} it was rare for any book to be {{reviewed}} {{on the front page}} of the New York Times, or to receive [...] "the extremes of reaction" [...] seen for Sociobiology. She found that [...] "the clarity, breadth and richness of accurately rendered detail in this monograph is really quite breath-taking." [...] However, she objected to the claim that the book covered the biological basis of all social behaviour, as it did not cover what she called the [...] "epigenetic disciplines", the effects of the environment on the embryonic and later development of the individual including learning (nurture, not just nature). She called the gap [...] "unfortunate" [...] and pointed out that [...] "the development problem" [...] and the functioning of the human brain were the frontiers of research. She observed, citing Dobzhansky, that [...] "an evolutionary minded sociology which really appreciated the significance of sociocultural transmission along nongenetic lines would likely see society and culture in a very different way". Despite Wilson's neglect of [...] "epigenetic" [...] and social sciences, she urged sociologists to read [...] "this exceptionally fine book", noting that despite its length it should have been twice as long. She looked forward to seeing sociology <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> neo-Darwinian synthesis, something that was already under way, which (she argued) would enrich social theory, a much better result than the alternative possibility, a renewed waste of time on the nature-versus-nurture debate.|$|E
500|$|The Economist welcomed The Great Stagnation as [...] "an {{important}} [...] {{that will}} have a profound impact on the way people think about the last thirty years". It praised [...] "the trains of thought it suggests" [...] and [...] said the book merited [...] "a rigorous debate" [...] which should encourage different policy choices across the political spectrum. Matthew Yglesias described the book as a [...] "bravua performance from {{one of the most interesting}} thinkers out there". Though he said it was remarkably silent on intellectual property law and the implications for society of a world in which most of the increase in output comes from catch-up growth from poor countries. The Wall Street Journal described the book as Cowen's most impactful book due to the direction in which he leads the debate. [...] "What is exciting is to imagine students, economists, and scientists across the country reading the book, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> depth of our challenge and pursuing new ways of trying to 'fix' things or generally improve our lot." [...] "A small book but a big, worthwhile question", concluded The Economist. In the New York Times, David Brooks praised The Great Stagnation as [...] "the most debated non-fiction book so far this year", which Timothy Noah described as a great favor to the book's marketing though an exaggeration considering the discussion surrounding Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua.|$|E
