50|$|During the 1800s and 1900s, <b>clocks</b> <b>or</b> <b>watches</b> {{were carried}} around {{as a form}} of flaunting social status. They were also a way of instilling a sense of time {{regulation}} for work in the budding industrial market.|$|R
50|$|In horology, a {{mechanical}} <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch</b> is isochronous if it runs {{at the same}} rate regardless of changes in its drive force, so that it keeps correct time as its mainspring unwinds or chain length varies. Isochrony is important in timekeeping devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{reliability}} of an escapement {{depends on the}} quality of workmanship and the level of maintenance given. A poorly constructed or poorly maintained escapement will cause problems. The escapement must accurately convert the oscillations of the pendulum or balance wheel into rotation of the <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch</b> gear train, and it must deliver enough energy to the pendulum or balance wheel to maintain its oscillation.|$|R
50|$|In horology, a movement, {{also known}} as a caliber, is the {{mechanism}} of a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch,</b> as opposed to the case, which encloses and protects the movement, and the face which displays the time. The term originated with mechanical timepieces, whose clockwork movements are made of many moving parts. It is less frequently applied to modern electronic or quartz timepieces, where the word module is often used instead.|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of abstract models of physical systems {{is an important}} AI research area. I describe a program which can automatically construct such models for machines like mechanical <b>clocks</b> <b>or</b> <b>watches.</b> The program finds an appropriate set of state variables and determines how they change as time passes. The abstract model of the mechanical device {{may be used to}} numerically simulate its behavior. My program uses short, controlled simulations to identify repet itive behavior patterns which can be used for long-term behavior prediction. ...|$|R
50|$|A clockmaker is an artisan {{who makes}} and/or repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be {{employed}} by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. Clockmakers {{must be able}} to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make <b>clocks</b> <b>or</b> <b>watches.</b> The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery.|$|R
50|$|A <b>clock</b> face <b>or</b> dial is {{the part}} of an analog <b>clock</b> (<b>or</b> <b>watch)</b> that {{displays}} the time {{through the use of a}} fixed-numbered dial or dials and moving hands. In its most basic form, recognized throughout the world, the periphery of the dial is numbered 1 through 12 indicating the hours in a 12-hour cycle, and a short hour hand makes two revolutions in a day. A long minute hand makes one revolution every hour. The face may also include a second hand which makes one revolution per minute. The term is less commonly used for the time display on digital clocks and watches.|$|R
60|$|Force {{or power}} may be thus, as it were, stored up in a countless variety of ways, and {{reserved}} for future action; and, when finally released, the whole amount may {{be set free}} at once, so as to expend itself in a single impulse, as in case of the arrow or the bullet; {{or it may be}} partially restrained, so as to expend itself gradually, {{as in the case of}} a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch.</b> In either case the total amount expended will be precisely the same--namely, the exact equivalent of that which was placed in store.|$|R
2500|$|When testing urine for ketones, {{the sample}} {{needs to be}} as fresh as possible. [...] Ketones {{evaporate}} quickly, {{so there is a}} chance of getting a false negative test result if testing older urine. [...] The urine testing strip bottle has instructions and color charts to illustrate how the color on the strip will change given the level of ketones or glucose in the urine over 15 (ketonesKetostix) or 30 (glucoseKetodiastix) seconds. Reading the colors at those time intervals is important because the colors will continue to darken and a later reading will be an incorrect result. Timing with a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch</b> second hand instead of counting is more accurate.|$|R
50|$|A {{repeater}} is a complication in {{a mechanical}} <b>watch</b> <b>or</b> <b>clock</b> that audibly chimes the hours and often {{minutes at the}} press of a button. There are many types of repeater, from the simple repeater which merely strikes the number of hours, to the minute repeater which chimes the time down to the minute, using separate tones for hours, quarter hours, and minutes. They originated before widespread artificial illumination, to allow {{the time to be}} determined in the dark, and were also used by the visually impaired. Now they are mostly valued as expensive novelties by watch and clock enthusiasts. Repeaters {{should not be confused with}} striking <b>clocks</b> <b>or</b> <b>watches,</b> which do not strike on demand, but merely at regular intervals.|$|R
5000|$|Religious {{texts of}} the period make many more {{references}} to the irreversible passage of time, and artistic themes appeared at this time such as Vanitas, a reminder {{of death in the}} form of a still life, which always included a <b>watch,</b> <b>clock,</b> <b>or</b> some other timepiece. The relentless ticking of a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch,</b> and the slow but certain movement of its hands, functioned as a visible and audible memento mori. Clocks and sundials would be decorated with mottos such as ultima forsan ("perhaps the last" [...] hour) or vulnerant omnes, ultima necat ("they all wound, and the last kills"). Even today, clocks often carry the motto tempus fugit, [...] "time flies." [...] Mary, Queen of Scots was said to have owned a large watch made in the shape of a silver skull.|$|R
50|$|In Haydon’s home town, Hinsdale, Illinois {{the current}} {{supplied}} by the local utility company made clocks operate in an erratic way - gaining 10 minutes one day, losing 15 the next. It occurred to Haydon that it might just be possible to combine the principles of simple harmonic motion normally used in <b>clocks</b> <b>or</b> <b>watches</b> and still have the clock operate from {{the power of the}} local utility company, but independent of the inaccurate frequency control. He found that this could be done with a coil spring attached to an induction motor. This was the basis of Haydon’s first patent, No. 1,801,958 issued April 21, 1931, entitled “Reversible Single Phase Induction Motor”.|$|R
6000|$|It {{resulted}} from {{the nature of the}} measures which Alfred undertook to effect, that they brought upon him daily a vast amount of labor as such measures always involve a great deal of minute detail. Alfred could only accomplish this great mass of duty by means of the most unremitting industry, and the most systematic and exact division of time. There were no <b>clocks</b> <b>or</b> <b>watches</b> in those days, and yet it was very necessary to have some plan for keeping the time, in order that his business might go on regularly, and also that the movements and operations of his large household might proceed without confusion. Alfred invented a plan. It was as follows: ...|$|R

60|$|The {{next morning}} Malcolm sallied {{out into the}} town {{to see if he}} could find employment. There was, however, but one clockmaker in Pilsen, and the war had so injured his trade that he had {{discharged}} all his journeymen, for clocks were still comparatively rare luxuries, and were only to be seen in the houses of nobles and rich citizens. Knowing that Wallenstein was devoted to luxury and magnificence, always taking with him, except when making the most rapid marches, a long train of baggage and furniture, Malcolm thought it possible that he might obtain some employment in his apartments. He accordingly went boldly to the castle where the duke had established himself, and, asking for his steward, stated that he was a clockmaker from the workshop of the celebrated horologist, Master Jans Boerhoff, and could repair any <b>clocks</b> <b>or</b> <b>watches</b> that might be out of order.|$|R
50|$|The sleeve was {{designed}} by Gavin Fulton (Fultano Absenti 95) and Pete Mauder (Mauder) with photography by John Ross. The design features cogs wheels that could be inside a <b>clock,</b> <b>watch</b> <b>or</b> other contraption.|$|R
50|$|He was {{distinguished}} principally in his {{mastery and}} {{improvement of the}} clock and chronograph, above all of the marine chronometer, in which he carried forward the pioneering work of John Harrison. He took a different approach from that of Harrison, believing {{that the way to}} achieve seaworthiness was to detach the escapement from the balance. He also differed from Harrison regarding his temperature compensation method, which used the variation of the rotation radius of the balance by modifying the diameter of the balance through bi-metallic components, a method which would become a standard in chronometers. His technique for temperature compensation was highly efficient in that it worked without changing the length of the spiral balance spring, which he had discovered to be isochronous only at a precise given length (i.e. when frequency is independent of amplitude, so that a mechanical <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch</b> runs at the same rate regardless of changes in its drive force, so it keeps correct time as the mainspring unwinds).|$|R
5000|$|Watch {{movements}} are very standardized, and the wheel trains of most watches {{have the same}} parts. The wheel trains of clocks {{are a little more}} varied, with different numbers of wheels {{depending on the type of}} clock and how many hours the clock runs between windings (the [...] "going"). [...] However, the wheel trains of clocks and watches share the same terminology, and are similar enough that they can be described together. The large gears in timepieces are generally called wheels, the smaller gears they mesh with (large to small, large to small) are called pinions, and the shafts that the wheels and pinions are mounted on are called arbors. [...] The wheels are mounted between the plates of the movement, with the pivots rotating in holes in the plates. The pivot holes have semicircular depressions around them, called oil cups, to hold the oil in contact with the shaft by capillary action. There are several wheel trains in a typical <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The going {{train is}} the main gear train of the timepiece. It {{consists}} of the wheels that transmit {{the force of the}} timepiece's power source, the mainspring or weight, to the escapement to drive the pendulum or balance wheel. [...] The going train has two functions. First, it scales up the speed of rotation of the mainspring or weight pulley. This allows the use of a very strong, slow turning mainspring or heavy weight that will run the timepiece for days or weeks. Second, its gear ratios divide the rotation of the escape wheel into convenient time units of seconds, minutes, and hours, to turn the timepiece's hands. The going train wheels are the only ones under load in a timepiece, since they bear the constant torque of the mainspring which is applied to the escapement, so these wheels are the only ones that receive significant wear. [...] In watches and some high quality clocks their arbors have jewel bearings. The going train in a modern <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch</b> consists of: ...|$|R
5000|$|In horology, [...] "caliber" [...] {{refers to}} the {{specific}} internal mechanism of a <b>watch</b> <b>or</b> <b>clock,</b> {{also known as a}} movement. Although the term originally was only used to refer {{to the size of a}} movement, it is now used to designate a specific model (although the same caliber can be used in many different <b>watches</b> <b>or</b> <b>clocks).</b> Different <b>watch</b> manufacturers tend to use their own identification system to number their calibers.|$|R

Andrew Natsios, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, told The Boston Globe that Africans were incapable of following complicated, multi-drug AIDS treatment, which requires taking different pills at specified times of day, because many of them [...] "don't know what Western time is." [...] According to Natsios, [...] "Many people in Africa have never seen a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> a <b>watch</b> their entire lives, [...] [...] [...] they know morning, they know evening, they know the darkness at night." ...|$|R
50|$|A good {{assessment}} {{has both}} validity and reliability, plus the other quality attributes noted above {{for a specific}} context and purpose. In practice, an assessment is rarely totally valid or totally reliable. A ruler which is marked wrongly will always give the same (wrong) measurements. It is very reliable, but not very valid. Asking random individuals to tell the time without looking at a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch</b> is sometimes used {{as an example of}} an assessment which is valid, but not reliable. The answers will vary between individuals, but the average answer is probably close to the actual time. In many fields, such as medical research, educational testing, and psychology, there will often be a trade-off between reliability and validity. A history test written for high validity will have many essay and fill-in-the-blank questions. It will be a good measure of mastery of the subject, but difficult to score completely accurately. A history test written for high reliability will be entirely multiple choice. It isn't as good at measuring knowledge of history, but can easily be scored with great precision. We may generalize from this. The more reliable our estimate is of what we purport to measure, the less certain we are that we are actually measuring that aspect of attainment.|$|R
5000|$|Analog clocks usually use a clock face which {{indicates}} time using rotating pointers called [...] "hands" [...] {{on a fixed}} numbered dial or dials. The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world, has a short [...] "hour hand" [...] {{which indicates}} the hour on a circular dial of 12 hours, making two revolutions per day, and a longer [...] "minute hand" [...] which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a [...] "second hand" [...] which indicates the seconds in the current minute. The only other widely used clock face today is the 24 hour analog dial, because {{of the use of}} 24 hour time in military organizations and timetables. Before the modern clock face was standardized during the Industrial Revolution, many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours. During the French Revolution the French government tried to introduce a 10-hour clock, as part of their the decimal-based metric system of measurement, but it didn't catch on. An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch</b> striking 24 times uses more power).|$|R
5000|$|The bezel of a ring is a {{wider and}} usually thicker {{section of the}} hoop, which may contain a flat surface, usually with an {{engraved}} design, as in a signet ring, or a gem. [...] The ring is normally worn to display the bezel on the upper or outer side of the finger. The word may also refer to a bezel setting for a stone, which is a general term for a setting holding the stone in place using a raised surrounding for the stone with a lip encircling and overlapping {{the edges of the}} stone, thus holding it in place. [...] Modern bezel settings typically use a band of metal containing a groove and a flange (i.e. projecting lip) to hold a <b>watch</b> crystal <b>or</b> gemstone in its setting. This was the earliest method of setting gemstones into jewelry, in historic examples often made by leaving a hole or slot in the ring with a thin lip which was bent over once the stone was inserted, holding it in place. An extension of the word used in this sense can refer to a rotatable rim on a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch</b> used to indicate certain data such as elapsed time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{formulas}} {{shown in}} the paragraphs below allow {{the positions of the}} hour-lines to be calculated for various types of sundial. In some cases, the calculations are simple; in others they are extremely complicated. There is an alternative, simple method of finding the positions of the hour-lines which can be used for many types of sundial, and saves a lot of work in cases where the calculations are complex. This is an empirical procedure in which the position of the shadow of the gnomon of a real sundial is marked at hourly intervals. The equation of time {{must be taken into account}} to ensure that the positions of the hour-lines are independent of the time of year when they are marked. An easy way to do this is to set a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch</b> so it shows [...] "sundial time" [...] which is standard time, plus the equation of time on the day in question. The hour-lines on the sundial are marked to show the positions of the shadow of the style when this clock shows whole numbers of hours, and are labelled with these numbers of hours. For example, when the clock reads 5:00, the shadow of the style is marked, and labelled [...] "5" [...] (or [...] "V" [...] in Roman numerals). If the hour-lines are not all marked in a single day, the clock must be adjusted every day or two to take account of the variation of the equation of time.|$|R
6000|$|Meantime, if your honour were in London, {{you would}} see a great {{embankment}} rising high and dry out of the Thames on the Middlesex shore, from Westminster Bridge to Blackfriars. A really fine work, and really getting on. Moreover, a great system of drainage. Another really fine work, and likewise really getting on. Lastly, a muddle of railways in all directions possible and impossible, with no general public scheme, no general public supervision, enormous waste of money, no fixable responsibility, no accountability but under Lord Campbell's Act. I think of that accident in which I was preserved. Before the most furious and notable train in the four-and-twenty hours, {{the head of a}} gang of workmen takes up the rails. That train changes its time every day as the tide changes, and that head workman is not provided by the railway company with any <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch!</b> Lord Shaftesbury wrote to me to ask me what I thought of an obligation on railway companies to put strong walls to all bridges and viaducts. I told him, of course, that the force of such a shock would carry away anything that any company could set up, and I added: [...] "Ask the minister what he thinks about the votes of the railway interest in the House of Commons, and about his being afraid to lay a finger on it with an eye to his majority." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The vulgar, {{who take}} things {{according}} to their first appearance, [...] attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the [...] causes as make the latter often fail of their usual influence, [...] though they meet with no impediment to their operation. But [...] philosophers, observing that, almost {{in every part of}} nature, there [...] is contained a vast variety of springs and principles, which are [...] hid, by reason of their minuteness or remoteness, find that it is [...] at least possible the contrariety of events may not proceed from [...] any contingency in the cause, but from the secret operation of [...] contrary causes. This possibility is converted into certainty by [...] further observation, when they remark that, upon an exact scrutiny, [...] a contrariety of effects always betrays a contrariety of causes, [...] and proceeds from their mutual opposition. A peasant can give no [...] better reason for the stopping of any <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> <b>watch,</b> than to say [...] that it does not commonly go right. But an artist easily perceives [...] that the same force in the spring or pendulum has always the same [...] influence on the wheels; but fails of its usual effect, perhaps by [...] reason of a grain of dust, which puts a stop to the whole movement. [...] From the observation of several parallel instances, philosophers [...] form a maxim, that the connexion between all causes and effects is [...] equally necessary, and that its seeming uncertainty in some [...] instances proceeds from the secret opposition of contrary [...] causes."--(IV. pp. 101-2.) ...|$|R
5000|$|As a filmmaker, let me {{say that}} the luxury of {{creating}} a new cut for U.S. audiences was the opportunity to reshape it into something different than what I began with -- a chance one doesn't always get as a director and an undertaking much more meaningful than simply making something shorter or longer. The original version of THE GRANDMASTER is about 2 hours, 10 minutes. Why not 2 hours, 9 minutes or 2 hours, 11 minutes? To me, the structure of a movie is like a <b>clock</b> <b>or</b> a prized <b>watch</b> -- it's about precision and perfect balance.|$|R
