40|$|ABSTRACT The {{prevalence}} of deaths from lung cancer, other cancer, {{and all other}} causes was studied in workers and former workers at two factories (A and B) in the United Kingdom at which <b>chloromethyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> has been manufactured, at one since about 1948 and at the other since 1956. At factory A in South Wales 571 men were traced and at factory B in the north east of England 1196. A statistically significant excess of observed deaths from lung cancer but not other cancer compared with the number expected was found in factory A when the death rates for the population of Glamorgan were applied. The deaths from lung cancer at factory A were related to risk in terms of total exposure time, and average exposure rate and dosage. The degree of exposure {{was more important than}} the duration of exposure. There has so far been no demonstrable excess of deaths from lung cancer in employees working at factory A since the process was changed in 1972. In factory B the risk was low over the whole period, and there was no excess of lung or other cancers compared with the rates for the Tyneside conurbation.

40|$|Chemical {{cross-linking}} {{anion exchange}} series membranes were prepared from linear engineering plastics poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene oxide) (PPO) by conducting {{the processes of}} bromination and amination at both benzyl and aryl positions.

The ion exchange capacity, water content, membrane potential and transport number of membranes were studied. The {{results show that the}} membrane properties are significantly affected by the bromination processes: benzyl-substitution will enhance the ion exchange capacity and water content, while the aryl-substitution will decrease the water content with approximately unchanged ion exchange capacity.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{neutralization}} reactions take place in industrial chemistry, such as acids which react with bases to form salts and water. However, most of these salts have no commercial value and are discharged into the environment which will result in environment pollution. In light of this pollution, the ideal solution is to convert the salt and water back into acid and base by using a bipolar membrane treatment. A bipolar membrane is a polymeric layered structure composed of a cation ion-exchange layer joined in series to an anion ion-exchange layer. However, the preparation of bipolar membranes makes practically using these applications a crucial problem. the casting method has encountered a key problem which is a selection of anion exchange layer because of comparison with a cation exchange layer. Preparation of anion exchange layer is also conducted by chloromethylation and quaternary amination steps at last. In chloromethylation, <b>chloromethyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> used for producing an anion exchange layer is very harmful to human health and a carcinogen. Moreover, Polysulfone used as the started materials needed to be modified by sulfonation, chloromethlylation and quaternary amination.

In this work, we propose using a novel monomer "GMA-IDA " for preparing a bipolar membrane via a short-tim...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Recently the {{alkaline}} {{system for}} fuel cell enhance their presence because of possibility of no-precious-metal catalyst and low over potential at cathode reaction. The {{anion exchange membrane}} for alkaline membrane fuel cell should be a key technology {{in order to achieve}} the practical performance as fuel cells. Alkaline anion exchange membranes of high ionic conductivities are made from polysulfone by adding a chloromethyl pendant group to the polysulfone, follow by reacting the chloromethyl group with amine to form quarternary ammonium pendant groups which act as the counter ion for hydroxide anion. <b>Chloromethyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> N,N-dimethylformamide and methanol are commonly used as agent for providing excellent conversions, but they are now considered to be carcinogenic. To avoid the use of such hazardous materials, in our work we used paraformaldehyde, chlorotrimethylsilane, N-methylpyrrolidone and ethanol as agent for providing conversion. Approach: Polysulfone (PS) was chloromethylated using chlorotrimethylsilane as a chloromethylation reagent, resulting in the formation of Chloromethylated Polysulfone (CMPS). CMPS was converted to a quaternized form using trimethylamine and precipitated into ethanol. The powder was dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone, followed by aminated with a 25 wt% trimethylamine. Results: The resulting solution was cast onto a flat glass plate and dried in an oven. The membrane was immersed in KOH solution for 24 h to replace the Cl- anion in the polymer with OH -. Conclusion: The swelling behavior of polysulfone-based solid-state alkaline electrolyte membrane was closely related to the degree of water uptake (25 WU%, 7. 5 SD%) and the ion-exchange capacity was 1. 05 mmol g - 1, which is sufficient for electrolyte membranes used in alkaline fuel cells...|$|E
