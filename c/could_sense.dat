5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor stops to ask Emma if she <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> {{anything}} unusual about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift {{to any other}} place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E

The Murder of Lee Oswald uncovers, in the condensed black satire, complex links people only <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> but, then, couldn't put into words. Two pictures – made when it happened – who went against the grain of mainstream media and which today has a prophetic force. Bertrand Russell wrote appreciatively to Torsten Billman about these two grisaille woodcuts.|$|E

If a torpedo was still turning to get on course or had not stabilized its depth when the warhead armed, the exploder could see a magnetic field change and detonate. As the warhead approached the target, it <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> a change due to the ship's effect on the earth's magnetic field. That's a desired effect if the torpedo is set to run under the ship, but not a desirable effect when the torpedo is set to hit {{the side of the}} ship.|$|E

500|$|During the {{earliest}} days of the Boston Church, before the arrival of Mary and William Dyer, there was a single minister, the Reverend John Wilson. [...] In 1633, one of England's most noted Puritan clergymen, John Cotton, arrived in Boston, and quickly became the second minister (called [...] "teacher") in Boston's church. [...] In time, the Boston parishioners <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> a theological difference between Wilson and Cotton. [...] Anne Hutchinson, a theologically astute midwife who had the ear of many of the colony's women, became outspoken in support of Cotton, and condemned the theology of Wilson and most of the other ministers in the colony during gatherings, or conventicles, held at her house.|$|E

[...] Anne Hutchinson, a theologically astute midwife who had the ear of many of the colony's women, became outspoken during gatherings, or conventicles, held at her house.

500|$|The first sensors {{utilized}} {{by the program}} were Air-Delivered Seismic Intrusion Detector (ADSID), which had been developed from devices then in use in underground mapping for the oil industry. The device <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> vertical earth motion {{by the use of}} an internal geophone and could determine whether a man or a vehicle was in motion at a range of [...] and [...] respectively. The first acoustic sensors were developed from the U.S. Navy's Project Jezebel anti-submarine warfare sonobuoys, which recorded and processed sound by the utilization of an audio spectrum analyzer. The first model of seismic detectors (Phase I) outshone their contemporary acoustic types in {{the quality and quantity of}} the information they reported. The Phase I models of both the acoustic and seismic sensors were only available for operation in a continuous mode, which meant that under normal conditions, their lithium batteries would function for approximately 30 days.|$|E

500|$|Smith had [...] "an intimacy" [...] {{with the}} level design tools such that he <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> when the design met the game's {{technical}} restrictions, like the maximum possible size or number of characters for a room. He suggested the narrower skill tree with palpable effects, such as exchanging skills about weapon damage for more accessible weapons. The team adopted the cuts, having been encouraged by the recent milestone. Spector has said that had {{they waited for the}} beta to have made the same reductions (as per common practice), [...] "it would have been a disaster." [...] Spector's post-proto-mission strategy was to bring the rest of the missions to proto-mission functionality rather than perfecting the two existing proto-missions. He felt {{that this would be a}} more efficient use of staff time, even if it meant that the final product would be more [...] "bare-bones" [...] than brilliant. Almost all of their game systems besides the inventory and conversation schemes were rethought up through the end of the project.|$|E
500|$|Ken Williams {{had wanted}} Roberta {{to work on}} a Phantasmagoria sequel {{immediately}} after the success of the first game, but she could not do so due to her obligations to King's Quest VIII. Ken Williams felt the sequel was less successful because gamers <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> the absence of Roberta's style. [...] "It's as if a bestselling author had a book ghostwritten. Within a few pages, the fans would know they had been duped and feel disappointed, regardless {{of the quality of the}} work." [...] Ken Williams said a third game was not produced after A Puzzle of Flesh because of issues after Sierra was acquired by CUC International in 1996. Distribution was handled by Davidson & Associates, another CUC company, which primarily sold educational software. Williams said the company was uncomfortable with the violent content in Phantasmagoria and did not attempt sell the sequel aggressively as Sierra would have. He also claimed Jan Davidson, the wife of Chairman and CEO Bob Davidson, personally did not like the game and [...] "wanted it shut down". Due to these sales challenges, Williams said [...] "there was no reason to make a third Phantasmagoria".|$|E
500|$|On 1 December Sunderland beat Derby County 1–0. The defeat against Everton led to Craig Gordon {{being dropped}} from the side.

With the game looking to be heading towards a draw, Anthony Stokes scrambled to ball in to win the game. On 8 December Sunderland travelled to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea. Sunderland went behind in the 23rd minute through an Andriy Shevchenko goal. Chelsea won the game 2–0 after Liam Miller was sent off whilst giving a penalty away, which Frank Lampard scored. Sunderland played Aston Villa on 15 December, Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland ahead with a 10th-minute header. Villa midfielder Shaun Maloney equalised when he scored a from a 71st minute free kick. Sunderland could have won the game late on, but Danny Collins' header was ruled out by referee Steve Bennett for a foul. Roy Keane displayed his annoyance at Bennett saying [...] "It sums up (the referee's) day. He was giving everything against us and to say we're disappointed would be an unbelievable understatement.

500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. Those guys are always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one of those guys that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E
