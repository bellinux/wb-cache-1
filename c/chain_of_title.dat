Eventually, however, he decided to fight, reassuring {{the head of the}} company's U.S. division, Minoru Arakawa, that this was a sign that Nintendo had made it big. On May 6, Arakawa and Lincoln met with Coleco and Universal in Los Angeles. Hadl reiterated his stance that Donkey Kong infringed Universal's rights to King Kong. Lincoln countered that Nintendo had discovered many unlicensed uses of King Kongs name and characters and that Universal's trademark on these was less than 10 years old. In private, Greenberg tried to persuade Nintendo to sign a licensing agreement; he had not told them that he had already done so. By the end of the meeting, Hadl agreed to send a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to Nintendo regarding Universal's ownership of the King Kong name. When this failed to materialize in the next few weeks, Lincoln prodded Universal again. They responded with more demands for royalties.|$|E
25|$|Title {{insurance}} differs {{in several}} respects from {{other types of}} insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> and to detect known claims against or defects in the title to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. In the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, {{with the goal of}} increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.|$|E

Historically, the person who wanted to understand the title would hire an abstractor to write a property abstract showing the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> However, if the abstractor makes an error, the client may only be compensated if the attorney is negligent, subject to the limit of his financial responsibility (including his liability insurance). However, the willingness of these professionals to accept strict liability varies.|$|E

50|$|It is {{an unfortunate}} reality in Buenos Aires that many poor people {{are unable to}} fully realize their {{property}} rights because of irregularities in the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> their home's <b>title.</b> This not only impedes subsequent land transfers but also prevents poor people from using their homes as collateral for much-needed loans. Nearly 70% of the poor families in the Greater Buenos Aires area lack adequate legal titles to their homes because final mortgage payments are frequently not accompanied by a proper deed. Most often, the organizations responsible for granting deeds often go bankrupt or stop operating for other reasons.|$|R

5000|$|Real {{estate is}} one field where the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> has {{considerable}} significance. Various registration systems, {{such as the}} Torrens title system, {{have been developed to}} track the ownership of individual pieces of real property. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue title insurance based upon the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records. In other cases, the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> is established by an abstract of title, sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney. In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> despite the fact that clear <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed. Widespread lack of clarity in <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments. [...] US states have objected and even sued over this practice.|$|E

25|$|William Penn {{was asked}} to {{adjudicate}} the matter and he awarded 90% of the claim to Billinge and the remaining 10% and a cash settlement to Fenwick for his share. Fenwick was dissatisfied with Penn's judgement and refused {{to abide by the}} decision; essentially Fenwick had no assurance that a previously bankrupt man would convey ten percent of the net proceeds of the future venture since he had not even paid the adjudicated cash settlement. So Fenwick organized a colony of settlers and sailed to the Delaware Bay where he settled as Patroon on the eastern shore near the abandoned Swedish settlement of Fort Nya Elfsborg and set himself up as the local governor of the fifth Tenth (approximately 20% of the original Billinge property), issuing land patents and enforcing his own laws in defiance of Billinge and Penn. Billinge countered by suing Fenwick, causing uncertainty in the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> land <b>title.</b> The economic damages to those who controlled property within and near Salem caused many injured persons over the next decade to declare a long line of complaints and lawsuits in the colonial courts. To preserve Salem, its inhabitants and their property, Fenwick remained under arrest for months until copies of documents proving his claims were obtained from England. Fenwick ultimately proved the right of his claim in the court of Dominion Governor Andros, and returned to govern the Salem tenth by 1689. Salem remained as a settlement and continued growing.|$|R

5000|$|A deed that is recorded, {{but is not}} {{connected}} to the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> of the property, is called a wild deed. A wild deed does not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers cannot reasonably be expected to locate the deed while investigating the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to the property. Haupt has stated thatBecause title searching relies on the grantor/grantee indexes, it's possible that a deed won't be discovered {{even though it was}} recorded. [...] "Example: Atwood sells his land to Burns, but Burns does not record his deed. Burns later sells the land to Cooper, and Cooper records her deed. But because the previous deed (the deed from Atwood to Burns) was not recorded, Cooper's deed is outside the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> In a title search, someone looking up Atwood's name in the grantor index would find no indication that Atwood conveyed the property, and nothing would lead the searcher to Cooper's deed." [...] A deed that is outside the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> is called a wild deed. The general rule is that a subsequent purchaser is not held to have constructive notice of a wild deed. In the example, Cooper's title is unprotected against subsequent good faith purchasers. Suppose Atwood were to fraudulently sell the same property to another person, Dunn. A court would rule that Dunn has good title to the property, not Cooper.|$|E
