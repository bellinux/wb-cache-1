The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and sick children were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in the barracks had no electricity or running water, and food initially consisted of little more than <b>cornflour.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pavlova has a {{crisp and}} crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in {{contrast}} to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of <b>cornflour</b> {{is responsible for the}} marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the <b>cornflour</b> is just another egg white stabiliser in addition to the acid. The consistency also makes the pavlova significantly more fragile than meringue. Because the pavlova is notorious for deflating if exposed to cold air, when cooking is complete it is left in the oven to fully cool down before the oven door is opened.|$|E

25|$|Pavlova is made {{by beating}} egg whites (and {{sometimes}} salt) to a very stiff consistency before folding in caster sugar, vinegar or another acid (e.g. cream of tartar or lemon juice), <b>cornflour,</b> and sometimes vanilla essence, and slow-baking the mixture, similar to meringue.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{non-alcoholic drinks}} include Kissangua, a Southern Angola specialty, a {{traditional}} non-alcoholic drink made of <b>cornflour,</b> as {{been used in}} indigenous healing rituals. Soft drinks such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Mirinda, Sprite, and Fanta are also popular. While some soft-drinks are imported from South Africa, Namibia, Brazil, and Portugal, the Angolan soft-drink industry has grown, with Coca-Cola plants in Bom Jesus, Bengo, and Lubango opening since 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Fried {{fish was}} first brought to England by Western Sephardic Jews, and is {{considered}} {{the model for the}} fish element of the dish. Originally, Western Sephardic Jews settling in England in the 17th century would have prepared fried fish {{in a manner similar to}} Pescado frito, which is coated in a flour. Battered fish is first coated in flour then dipped into a batter consisting of flour mixed with liquid, usually water but sometimes beer. Some newer modifications to the recipe may have <b>cornflour</b> added, and instead of beer sometimes soda water is added. In 1860, the first fish and chip shop was opened in London by Joseph Malin who sold [...] "fish fried in the Jewish fashion".|$|E
2500|$|Funge (or funje, [...] ) and pirão (...) {{are very}} common dishes, and in poorer {{households}} often consumed at every meal. The dish is often eaten with fish, pork, chicken, or beans. Funge de bombo (...) , {{more common in}} northern Angola, is a paste or porridge of cassava (also called manioc or yuca), made from cassava flour. It is gelatinous in consistency and gray in color. Pirão, yellow in color and similar to polenta, is made from <b>cornflour</b> and {{is more common in}} the south. Fubá (...) is the term for the flour that is used to make either funge and pirão, also used to make angu, the Brazilian polenta. Both foods are described as bland but filling and are often eaten with sauces and juices or with gindungo (see below), a spicy condiment.|$|E
60|$|A {{cold and}} awful {{quietness}} fell on Sheila's heart. She stared fixedly at the tuft of dark hair, the only visible {{sign of her}} husband, on the pillow. Then, taking up the basin of cold <b>cornflour,</b> she left the room. In {{a quarter of an}} hour she reappeared carrying a tray, with ham and eggs and coffee and honey invitingly displayed. She laid it down.|$|E
60|$|He {{squeezed}} Lawford's hand. Then, with umbrella {{under his}} arm, his hat on his head, his spectacles readjusted, he hurried {{out of the}} room. Mrs Lawford followed him. For a few minutes Lawford sat motionless, with head bent a little, and eyes restlessly scanning the door. Then he rose abruptly, and in {{a quarter of an}} hour was in bed, alone with his slow thoughts: while a basin of <b>cornflour</b> stood untasted on a little table at his bedside, and a cheerful fire burned in the best visitors' room's tiny grate.|$|E
6000|$|Sheila broke down. 'Any {{one would}} think to hear you talk, that I was {{perfectly}} heartless. I told Ada to be most careful about the <b>cornflour.</b> And as for other ways out, it's a positively wicked thing {{to say to me}} when I'm nearly distracted with trouble and anxiety. What motive could you have had for loitering in an old cemetery? And in an east wind! It's useless for me to remain here, Arthur, to be accused of every horrible thing that comes into a morbid imagination. I will leave you, as you suggest, in peace.' ...|$|E
60|$|Then she too remembered Quain, {{and remembered}} {{also in the}} slowly paling dusk that the house would soon be stirring. She went out and noiselessly locked the door again. But it was useless to begin looking for Quain now--her husband had a good many dull books, most of them his 'eccentric' father's. What must the {{servants}} be thinking? and what was all that talk about a mysterious visitor? She would have to question Ada--diplomatically. She returned {{to her room and}} sat down in an arm-chair, and waited. In sheer weariness she fell into a doze, and woke at the sound of dustpan and broom. She rang the bell, and asked for hot water, tea, and a basin of <b>cornflour.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He refused {{steadily}} all medicine; {{he threw}} sago and <b>cornflour</b> overboard till the steward {{got tired of}} bringing it to him. He asked for paregoric. They sent him a big bottle; enough to poison a wilderness of babies. He kept it between his mattress and the deal lining of the ship's side; and nobody ever saw him take a dose. Donkin abused him to his face, jeered at him while he gasped; and the same day Wait would lend him a warm jersey. Once Donkin reviled him for half an hour; reproached him with the extra work his malingering gave to the watch; and ended by calling him [...] "a black-faced swine." [...] Under the spell of our accursed perversity we were horror-struck. But Jimmy positively seemed to revel in that abuse. It made him look cheerful--and Donkin {{had a pair of}} old sea boots thrown at him. [...] "Here, you East-end trash," [...] boomed Wait, [...] "you may have that." ...|$|E

Fermentation may take longer than two days, especially in cool climates. (Note: a warmed oven is an oven that has been heated {{for a few minutes and}} turned off.
