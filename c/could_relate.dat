5|$|For the new {{generation}} of students, producers auditioned over six hundred school-aged children in an attempt to provide characters to which the teenaged target-audience <b>could</b> <b>relate.</b> The decision to cast age-similar actors was purposeful to contrast the series from other shows of the same period such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek, which had cast actors in their twenties as teenagers.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India covered the song on her album, Dicen Que Soy which {{was produced by}} Sergio George and released as the album's first single. It was picked by George for India to cover as {{he felt it was}} something women <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to. India's version was included on the soundtrack for The 24 Hour Woman.|$|E
5|$|Varaha {{symbolizes the}} resurrection of the earth from a pralaya (dissolution of the universe) and the {{establishment}} of a new kalpa (aeon). Symbolism also attributes that evolution from water <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to the geological phenomenon of the tectonic age. It could also represent the rescue of earth from “false cults”.|$|E

5|$|Guitarist Kerry King {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the lyrics, taking a different approach from earlier recordings by exploring topics such as religion, murder, revenge and self-control. He limited the lyrics to realistic subject matter most <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to. The band experimented, recording most of the album in C# tuning, with three songs in drop B and two others with seven-string guitars in B♭. The album's release was delayed due to the explicit cover artwork which led to alternative slip covers in some retail outlets, difficulties during audio mixing and a change of distributor for the band's record label, American.|$|E
5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American {{culture is the}} central theme of the record, which takes a critical look at the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and traditional family values play in the glorification of violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view {{that the image of}} his crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the credibility of the Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he <b>could</b> <b>relate.</b> He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} create an RPG that would appeal to a wide {{audience}} unfamiliar with the genre, and video games in general, Horii {{wanted to create a}} new kind of RPG that did not rely on previous experience with the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPG, did not require hundreds of hours of rote fighting, and could appeal to any kind of gamer. To accomplish this he needed to simplify the system and have players associate themselves with the hero. Thus as the game progressed, the hero would become stronger, in contrast to games like Super Mario Bros. where the character Mario did not become progressively more powerful during the game. He wanted to build on Portopia and place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement. He developed a coming-of-age tale that audiences <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to and made use of RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is [...] "a {{confession}} on Grande's behalf admitting a special love for someone and how she can't formulate her strong feelings into words." [...] Regarding this matter, Grande said that she <b>could</b> <b>related</b> to the song's lyrics because she is [...] "so awkward and so flustered," [...] especially if it's towards {{the beginning of a}} relationship.|$|R
50|$|Until recently, it {{was assumed}} that any life on Mars would {{necessarily}} be a second genesis. But it is now understood that life could be transferred between planets on meteorites, so it is possible that life on Mars, if it exists, <b>could</b> be <b>related</b> to Earth life, or some of the life <b>could</b> be <b>related</b> to Earth life.|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} {{supporting}} characters was kept low to emphasize their individuality, and their personalities were left ambiguous {{to reinforce the}} desire for player immersion. The heroine Yuko Takao {{was intended to be}} a different type of character to previous main heroines, being a non-playable character from the beginning of story development. She was the only major non-playable character not to have her own Reason. The character of Lucifer designed was not a standard villain, but rather as a gentlemanly observer who sets tests for the player. To reflect his omnipotent status as God's opposite, he is portrayed in a number of forms, including a child and an old man. Alongside this, the staff wanted to portray demons not only as enemies but as characters the player <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to and grow attached to when inviting them to their party. One of the key elements for demon designs recycled from earlier games was bringing them into the game and making them as true as possible to the original design while fitting into the game's art style.|$|E
5|$|Babe hires Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) {{to work as}} her kitchen's {{assistant}} after Abi confides in Babe {{about her}} jealousy towards her sister, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), which she felt she <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to. Babe notices Abi's boyfriend, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), flirting with Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), so helps Abi to take revenge. Abi later reveals to a busy pub, including Ben and Paul, that she is pregnant, however it transpires Babe encouraged Abi to fake her pregnancy until she becomes pregnant. However, Ben suspects he has caught an STI from having casual sex, so Babe suggests that Abi has sex with a stranger and she has sex with Babe's relative, Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard), but does not become pregnant. Babe later discovers that Les Coker (Roger Sloman) is a crossdresser. During an argument between Ben and his father, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Babe pushes Abi into Ben and she falls so Babe rushes {{her out of the}} Vic, claiming to be taking her to the hospital. When they return, Abi tells her friends and family that she has miscarried. After Abi and Babe fall out, Babe writes a letter to Ben explaining the truth, and although it is intercepted by Ben's half-sister, Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper), Abi still inadvertently reveals the truth to Ben, ending their relationship.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists {{have found}} caves {{that have been}} sealed such as the Cueva de El Duende. It is {{possible}} that the desecration of caves could have been used as a symbol of conquest and political legitimacy. Another explanation <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to termination rituals that have often been seen in architectural construction.|$|E

25|$|John Tabois Tregellas (1792–1863) was a {{merchant}} at Truro, purser of Cornish mines, {{and author of}} many stories written in the local dialect of the county. (Walter Hawken Tregellas was his eldest son.) Tregellas was well known in Cornwall for his dialect knowledge; he <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> a conversation between a Redruth man and a St Agnes man keeping their dialects perfectly distinct.|$|E
25|$|His Japanese voice {{actor is}} Chihiro Suzuki who was chosen over Yasunori Matsumoto who also wanted the role. Suzuki {{had no idea}} of the game's setting or how Luke looked since there were no images. He was told to use Shibuya as an image. Luke's English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal. Lowenthal noted he <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to the {{character}} because of his selfish nature and comically noted he lacked Luke's development.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} this broader {{spectrum}} of activity of lamotrigine is unknown, but <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to actions of the drug on voltage-activated calcium channels. Lamotrigine blocks T-type calcium channels weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high-voltage–activated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine's broader clinical spectrum of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined.|$|E

25|$|Kirsty {{was created}} {{as part of}} the {{original}} core cast of the show, being a teenager so that young audiences <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to the show. Original producer Caterina De Nave credits storyline supervisor Jason Daniel as the man who created Kirsty. The character was set to debut in a storyline that saw Kirsty have a crush on teenager Stuart Neilson, only for Stuart to come out gay. However the producers pulled the storyline at the last minute and Stuart was instead written as heavily religious.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, there was a growing {{tendency}} to make explicit distinction between the condemned and the reader. The condemned was increasingly relegated to his social sphere; he was not seen as a sinner, someone to whom the audience <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to, but as someone who came from an intellectually and morally inferior class. By the 1760s it was common for the Ordinary to put emphasis on grammatical and orthographic errors of the condemned and to apologise for having as subjects such mean individuals. The Ordinary frequently made claims that the condemned were creatures deserving of pity, suggesting that common criminals lacked the moral and intellectual faculties of the readers and so emphasising the distance between the reader and the condemned.|$|E
25|$|Roh {{used this}} term to {{describe}} painting that signaled {{a return to}} realism after expressionism's extravagances, which sought to redesign objects to reveal the spirits of those objects. Magical realism, according to Roh, instead faithfully portrays the exterior of an object, {{and in doing so}} the spirit, or magic, of the object reveals itself. One <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> this exterior magic {{all the way back to}} the 15th century. Flemish painter Van Eyck (1395–1441) highlights the complexity of a natural landscape by creating illusions of continuous and unseen areas that recede into the background, leaving it to the viewer's imagination to fill in those gaps in the image: for instance, in a rolling landscape with river and hills. The magic is contained in the viewer's interpretation of those mysterious unseen or hidden parts of the image.|$|E

25|$|Historical {{consensus}} {{notes that}} irrespective of whether military {{duty in the}} France was productive or not, the time spent by the Vietnamese soldiers in France had a profound transformation on them in both the social and individual sense. Inside as well as outside the barracks, the Vietnamese servicemen were often treated more equitably than in their home country. They encountered intellectual thought not openly promulgated in Vietnam. They <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to Frenchmen, have relations with French women, and with other colonised peoples present in France. Furthermore, they could see that France too {{was in a state}} of change. As a result of their overseas service, at least some of the returning troops would attempt to rationalise the differences between their experiences in the two countries. Coupled with the differences in colonial and metropolitan discipline, this is postulated to have bred a more critical stance towards their superiors and a more critical attitude towards the colonial order.|$|E
25|$|Setsuna being a Kurd was an {{international}} decision by Sunrise. This was done as critique to Japan's apathy towards religion. Director Seiji Mizushima {{wanted to give}} viewers a close approach to the wars in the Middle East, believing the problem would not be solved in a long time. Mizushima aimed to make the viewers understand Setsuna's feelings {{as a result of}} living under war conditions. In regards to his personality, Mizushima wanted the series' protagonist that could not be related with the audience. This was done to contrast previous Gundam protagonists and appeal to young viewers. While he saw his past as difficult to understand he might look appealing as a result. The staff also wanted to create a character the audience <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to. Late in the series, Setsuna's Quanta system was introduced in order to convey his message that he wants war to end through communication rather than violence. This idea was explored once again in the movie where the plot was written so that nobody except Setsuna could end the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Midna has {{received}} mostly positive reception {{from both the}} video game press and the public {{for her role in}} Twilight Princess. Game Informer editor Andrew Reiner stated that she, along with Link's wolf transformation, had incredible effects on Twilight Princess gameplay. Fellow Game Informer editor Billy Berghammer stated that he loved Midna, describing her as a cool character due to how she messed with Link throughout the game. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that the supporting characters of Twilight Princess make up for Link's laconic nature, Midna more so than others. He described her as being acerbic and thoughtful, as well as an intricate character who moves the plot forward for her own means. While America's Intelligence Wire editor Dave Arey described her as intriguing, he felt that she could have been more so if Nintendo had developed her further. GamesRadar listed her as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that before Midna, the only characters they <b>could</b> <b>relate</b> to were Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon. RPGamer editor Matthew Rickert stated that he found nothing intriguing or likable about her, complaining about how much more plot time she receives in spite of this, arguing that she offers little help to Link and that it felt like she had replaced Zelda in Twilight Princess.|$|E

The narrative was received in perfect silence, both by the accused and by the audience, and also by She herself.
