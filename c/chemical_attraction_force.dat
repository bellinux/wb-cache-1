This paper focuses on how the spatial imbalance of industrial diversity contributes to the population change caused by inter-regional migration. This paper introduces a spatial interaction model for the Geographic Information System (GIS) -based simulation of the spatial interactions to evaluate the demographic <b>attraction</b> <b>force.</b> The proposed model adopts the notions of gravity, entropy, and virtual work. An industrial classification by profit level is introduced and its diversity is quantified with the entropy of information theory. The introduced model is applied to the cases of 207 regions in South Korea. Spatial interactions are simulated with an optimized model and their resultant <b>forces,</b> the demographic <b>attraction</b> <b>forces,</b> are compared with observed net migration for verification. The results show that the evaluated <b>attraction</b> <b>forces</b> from industrial diversity have a very significant, positive, and moderate relationship with net migration, while other conventional factors of industry, population, economy, and the job market do not. This paper concludes that the geographical quality of industrial diversity has positive and significant effects on population change by migration...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine a}} {{rarefied}} gas with inter-molecular attraction.

It is demonstrated that the instability occurs when the temperature T is lower than a certain threshold value T-s depending on the gas density. It is further shown that, even if T is only marginally lower than T-s, the instability generates clusters with density much higher than that of the gas. These results suggest that the instability should be interpreted as a gas-liquid phase transition, with T-s being the temperature of saturated vapor and the high-density clusters representing liquid droplets.
