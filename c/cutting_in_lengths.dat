50|$|Use of stem {{cuttings}} avoids high {{variability in}} terms of production and quality. Nevertheless, plants grown from cuttings {{are more susceptible to}} drought during the first years after planting. The caper bush is a difficult-to-root woody species, and successful propagation requires careful consideration of biotypes and seasonal and environmental parameters. Rootings up to 55% are possible when using one-year-old wood, depending on cutting harvest time and substrate used. Propagation from stem cuttings is the standard method for growing ‘Mallorquina’ and ‘Italiana’ in Spain, and ‘Nocella’ in the Aolian Islands, esp. Salina. Hardwood <b>cuttings</b> vary <b>in</b> <b>length</b> from 15 to 50 cm and diameter of the cuttings may range from 1.0 to 2.5 cm. Another possibility is to collect stems during February through the beginning of March, treat them with captan or captafol and stratify them outdoors or in a chamber at 3-4 °C, covered with sand or plastic. Moisture content and drainage should be carefully monitored and maintained until planting. Using semihardwood cuttings, collected and planted during August and September, low survival rates (under 30%) have been achieved. Softwood <b>cuttings</b> are prepared <b>in</b> April from 25- to 30-day shoots. Each cutting should contain at least two nodes and be six to 10 cm long. Basal or subterminal cuttings are more successful than terminal ones. Then, <b>cuttings</b> are planted <b>in</b> a greenhouse under a mist system with bottom heat; 150 to 200 cuttings/m2 may be planted.|$|R
5000|$|When {{cutting the}} tunnel, from Byrom Street eastwards and upwards to Edge Hill {{the work was}} {{difficult}} as care was needed not to disturb the buildings as above due to the shallow depth of the tunnel.

Demolition of buildings between Byrom Street and Fontenoy Street was needed to open out a box <b>cutting,</b> of [...] <b>in</b> <b>length</b> where two sidings were laid.

40|$|The {{effect of}} indole-butyric acid, both alone {{and with a}} low {{concentration}} of kinetin, on the rooting of rose <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> winter and summer, is presented in this paper. The experiments were conducted using 500 and 1000 mg/l IBA {{with or without the}} addition of 5 mg/l kinetin. The growth regulators were applied by dipping the base of a cutting for 5 s in an aqueous solution of these substances. Cuttings 5 - 6 cm <b>in</b> <b>length</b> were made from the mid-part of a stem of a rose grown in a greenhouse. The experiments were carried out using 'Queen of Bermuda' and 'Baccara' cuttings. The investigations showed that treating rose <b>cuttings</b> rooted <b>in</b> winter with an IBA solution had a significant promotive effect on the quantity of rooted cuttings, number of formed roots on the cutting, {{as well as on the}} length of the longest root. A distinctive increase in the number of breaking buds was also seen on the cuttings treated with IBA. The IBA solution applied to <b>cuttings</b> rooted <b>in</b> the summer significantly decreased the number of rooted cuttings and breaking buds. However, no significant influence on the number and length of formed roots was found. Addition of kinetin to the IBA solutions did not have any effect on the rooting of rose <b>cuttings</b> either <b>in</b> winter or summer...|$|R

40|$|Early bunch-stem {{necrosis}} (EBSN) is {{a physiological}} disorder which can severely affect fruit set in grapevines. Poor set due to EBSN {{has been responsible}} for up to 50 % crop losses in many New Zealand and Californian vineyards. The specific cause(s) of EBSN are unclear. Involved researchers presently acknowledge EBSN's correlation with site specific stress(es), with most maintaining that EBSN is the grapevines acclimation response to a reduced carbon status, with damage symptoms mediated through elevated rachis NH₄⁺ levels. The experiments reported here investigated the influence of NH₄NO₃, (NH₄) ₂SO₄, CaCl₂, ethephon, and α-ketoglutarate treatments on the leaf and opposing inflorescence of single node Cabernet Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera L.) cuttings. Results from these investigations concluded that: • Incubation of <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> ethephon concentrations of 0. 1 and 1 mM induced significant levels of EBSN. • Incubation of <b>cutting</b> <b>in</b> 10, 20, 30 mM NH₄NO₃, 5, 10, 15 mM (NH₄) ₂SO₄, and 10, 20, 30 mM CaCl₂ induced only 'EBSN-like symptoms'. • Incubation of <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> 0. 1, 1, and 10 mM α-ketoglutarate induced no significant reduction in EBSN or EBSN-like symptoms. Secondly ethylene production levels by excised grape inflorescences following NH₄NO₃, (NH₄) ₂SO₄, CaCl₂, ethephon, and α-ketoglutarate treatments were measured. Conclusions drawn from investigations were that: • Incubation of <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> 0. 1, 1, and 10 mM ethephon significantly increased ethylene production by excised grape inflorescences. • Incubation of <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> NH₄NO₃ or (NH₄) ₂SO₄ treatments did not significantly influence ethylene production by the excised inflorescence. • Incubation of <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> CaCl₂ treatments did not significantly influence ethylene production by the excised inflorescence. • Incubation of <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> 0. 1, 1, and 10 mM α-ketoglutarate treatments significantly increased ethylene production by excised grape inflorescences. The above conclusions clearly support the involvement of ethylene in the development of, and manifestations associated with, EBSN. The involvement of NH₄⁺, Ca²⁺ and α-ketoglutarate however remains unclear...|$|R

40|$|The {{changes in}} reserve {{carbohydrates}} (TNC) in Imperuta cylindrica var. koenigii following the <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> September and in October, respectively, were investigated. One rhizome cutting per pot was planted in June and grown {{under field conditions}} and cutting was conducted at 5 cm above soil surface on September 13 and October 17, respectively. Samples were taken at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 days after cutting and separated into foliage (leaves above cutting height), stubble and rhizome. Comparing the two cutting times, September <b>cutting</b> was higher <b>in</b> foliage regrowth and October <b>cutting</b> was higher <b>in</b> the recovery of rhizome+stubble dry weight. The maximum decrease in rhizome+stubble weight after cutting occurred at 12 days after <b>cutting</b> <b>in</b> September and at 16 days in October. Although TNC contents of rhizome and of stubble at <b>cutting</b> <b>in</b> October were higher than <b>in</b> September <b>cutting,</b> they decreased following cutting and could not recover to the levels at <b>cutting.</b> The changes <b>in</b> dry weight and TNC content following September cutting suggest that Imperata has such a characteristics that TNC is used preferentially to form rhizomes...|$|R
