ONs are operator-governed, coordinated extensions of the infrastructure and are created dynamically for a limited time [1]. In addition, an efficient way to relieve the <b>congested</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is offloading, i.e., the transfer of a proportion of the traffic to alternative non-problematic radio access networks (e.g., Wi-Fi access points, femtocells, other BSs, etc.).|$|E
40|$|The famous Mohring-Harwitz theorem states that, {{under certain}} {{technical}} conditions, {{the degree of}} self-financing of <b>congested</b> <b>infrastructure</b> {{is equal to the}} elasticity of the capacity cost function in the optimum, so that under neutral scale economies exact self-financing applies. Although the theorem has been proven to remain valid for various extensions of the basic set-up for which it was originally derived, it breaks down when the infrastructure is used by operators with market power when competing in Cournot fashion, the case in point often being oligopolistic airlines at a congested airport. This paper proposes a regulatory scheme, not involving lump-sum payments or budget constraints in the optimal pricing problem, that restores self-financing for <b>congested</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for this market form. What is more, under the proposed scheme, exact self-financing applies independent of the elasticity of the capacity cost function. The result remains true both for the case where operators treat the tolls parametrically, and for 'manipulable' 9 ̆d tolls, designed to account for the fact that operators with market power can be expected to be aware of, and exploit, the fact that toll are not truly parametric, but instead depend on their own behaviour...|$|E

30|$|Let us {{start with}} the {{situations}} in which resource distribution is irrelevant. Two kinds of attacks share this result: Denial of Service and VM-to-Hypervisor Attacks. The main reason why the distribution is irrelevant {{in case of a}} DoS attack has to do with how resources are used with virtualization and cloud computing. Since the physical resources are shared, an attacker, even by targeting one specific VM, may prevent the other co-located VMs from operating properly. In an even more difficult scenario, on-demand resource provisioning may lead to VM instance flooding, <b>congesting</b> the <b>infrastructure</b> of the cloud provider.|$|R
30|$|This article {{considers}} ONs as {{a solution}} to the problem of capacity expansion of <b>congested</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> In particular, as soon as a macro BS faces congestion issues, nearby femtocells are exploited in order to acquire a proportion of the BS’s terminals. Femtocells and terminals create an ON relieving the problematic BS. The complex optimization problem that raised is mathematically formulated and solved by two algorithms. The first one, namely the DRA can be utilized by the operators that prefer to serve as many terminals as possible by femtocells. The second one, namely the ERA, selects only the femtocells that are needed to cover specific terminals and assigns to the femtocells the minimum possible power-level. Therefore, this algorithm should be preferred by operators that need to achieve energy efficiency.|$|E

Moreover, exact self-financing applies in this scheme independent of the elasticity of the capacity cost function, and occurs for both parametric and “manipulable” congestion pricing...|$|E
30|$|As the Internet has {{penetrated}} everyday life, {{more and}} more users will demand high-quality services. However, the Internet was not designed to handle such heavy usage. Thus, networks need to be enhanced {{in order to deal}} with the increased traffic. In this study, the use of opportunistic networks (ONs) is studied. ONs are operator-governed, coordinated extensions of the infrastructure and are created dynamically for a limited time frame. The problem studied is the capacity extension of <b>congested</b> <b>infrastructure</b> via resource allocation to femtocells. More specifically, a macro base station (BS) is considered with deployed femtocells within its area. As soon as a problematic situation is discovered, the congested BS notifies the network management entity which will determine the solution method. In our case, a proportion of terminals that cause the congestion will be offloaded to the nearby femtocells relieving the macro BS. This is achieved through two approaches: a greedy algorithm that allocates the minimum possible power level to femtocells in order to acquire as much terminals as possible, and an energy-efficient algorithm that assigns the minimum possible power level to the femtocells that are required to cover specific terminals. Femtocells that are not needed are switched off.|$|E

40|$|Microscopic {{simulation}} of pedestrian traffic {{is an important}} and increasingly popular method to evaluate the performance of existing or proposed infrastructure. The social force model is a common model in simulations, describing the dynamics of pedestrian crowds given {{the goals of the}} simulated pedestrians encoded as their preferred velocities. The main focus of the literature has so far been how to choose the preferred velocities to produce realistic dynamic route choices for pedestrians moving through <b>congested</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> However, limited attention has been given the problem of choosing the preferred velocity to produce other behaviors, such as waiting, commonly occurring at, e. g., public transport interchange stations. We hypothesize that: (1) the inclusion of waiting pedestrians in a simulated scenario will significantly affect the level of service for passing pedestrians, and (2) the details of the waiting model affect the predicted level of service, that is, it is important to choose an appropriate model of waiting. We show that the treatment of waiting pedestrians {{have a significant impact on}} simulations of pedestrian traffic. We do this by introducing a series of extensions to the social force model to produce waiting behavior, and provide predictions of the model extensions that highlight their differences. We also present a sensitivity analysis and provide sufficient criteria for stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Sustainable {{growth and}} the {{commercial}} success of "Mainport Holland", located in one of Europe’s most densely populated areas, is threatened {{by a lack of}} available land, a <b>congested</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> and an increasingly complex social, economic and political reality. To deal with these threats mainports, such as the Port of Rotterdam, are reengineering their planning processes. Instead of making plans based on an extrapolation of current trends, the aim is now to find answers to what-if questions which are applied to concurrent scenarios. Mainport planning is like solving a large jigsaw puzzle, but unlike a jigsaw puzzle the pieces used to solve the puzzle are not available beforehand, and there is no single best solution. Solving the mainport planning puzzle is a difficult, lengthy, knowledge and information intensive, multi- actor process. The challenge is to support invoking the memory and the creativity of multiple actors, with different objectives, that are specialized in different fields of knowledge, and that work in different contexts, such that effective mainport planning can be conducted. Adhering to the concept of studios, suites and services as introduced by Keen and Sol (2007), we introduced the design of a Mainport Planning Suite (MPS), i. e. a suite of services to support the actors in a studio-based planning process and improve their effectiveness in mainport planning. Following a design science strategy, we designed our MPS in an iterative way. First we studied mainport planning in practice in two exploratory case studies. From the exploratory case studies we found that supporting mainport planning should be focused on visualizing the knowledge and information that is used and produced during a mainport planning process. Based on the principles of visualization found in literature, we constructed a framework that we used to identify technology building blocks and requirements to design and implement an MPS. Based on the identified requirements we chose to design our MPS as a suite of loosely coupled services that are provided by a web portal. The main services provided by our suite are Map, Sketchbook, Matchbox, and Aspect Explorer, which support analysis, design, evaluation and choice in mainport planning. These services are supplemented with a number of services that support the process of planning, e. g. action lists, decision lists and project information services. The MPS was evaluated in two evaluation sessions at the Port of Rotterdam. For each evaluation session a prototype was assembled from the MPS services. During the first evaluation session a team of area planners was invited to participate in a fictive studio-based area planning meeting supported by our suite. Not all functionality was available during first evaluation session; therefore a second evaluation session was organized in which we used structured walkthroughs of an improved prototype. Based on the outcomes of the evaluation sessions, it is our strong conviction that an MPS is potentially useful and usable to improve the effectiveness of studio-based mainport planning. Future research might focus on the integration of simulation models in an MPS, the extent to which an MPS can support the automatic reporting of planning outcomes, the design of an approach for using an MPS, {{and the extent to which}} an MPS can be used in spatial planning in general.

We use GASMOD, a strategic severallayer model of European gas supply, consisting of upstream natural gas producers, traders in each consuming European country (or region), and final demand. Our model results suggest rather modest changes in the overall supply situation of natural gas to Europe, indicating that current worries about energy supply security issues may be overrated. LNG will likely increase its share of European natural gas imports in the future, Russia will not dominate the European imports (~ share of 1 / 3), the Middle East {{will continue to be a}} rather modest supplier, the UK is successfully converting from being a natural gas exporter to become a transit node for LNG towards continental Europe, and <b>congested</b> pipeline <b>infrastructure,</b> and in some cases LNG terminals, will remain a feature of the European gas markets, but less than in the current situation.

40|$|Prior to the {{terrorist}} attack on September 11, the forces of economic decentralization in the broad New York metropolitan region were still ongoing, but at a less intense pace compared to the 1970 s and 1980 s. But the attacks directly destroyed 13. 4 {{million square feet of}} World Trade Center office space from the Lower Manhattan market, space that {{is not likely to be}} replaced in this decade. This inventory destruction, when combined with the sheer physical disruption to corporate operations and the traumatic human losses, is likely to cause renewed long-term decentralization in the region. A new locational strategy, particularly for the region’s major financial firms, appears to be emerging: the avoidance of excessive concentration of human and physical resources. This implies a regional decentralized framework that goes beyond the dispersion of back office functions to the segmentation of a firm’s higher-level activities. This is a different strategy of place, one of distributed workplaces on different power and telecommunication grids to ensure business continuity in the face of disaster. The suburban ring, Midtown Manhattan and select core locations such as Jersey City, should be the economic beneficiaries of this change, adding pressure on the suburban ring’s <b>congested</b> highway <b>infrastructure</b> as well as on the overburdened rail lines converging on Midtown Manhattan...|$|R
40|$|Adequate heading {{stability}} {{is crucial to}} the safe construction of any tunnel. Insufficient support will lead to ground movements which have the potential to cause damage to existing <b>infrastructure.</b> <b>Congested</b> urban environments have led to a requirement to minimise these tunnelling-induced deformations. Forepoling Umbrella Systems (FUS) have proved to be a beneficial soil reinforcement measure for controlling ground movements due to NATM tunnelling in urban areas. However, there is limited understanding of the influence of tunnel geometry and FUS parameters on its reinforcing efficiencies. A series of centrifuge tests has been conducted to investigate the benefits of FUS using different arrangements of steel pipes placed in a model tunnel heading at various depths. The results show the importance of the steel pipes near the tunnel spring-line and the embedded lengths on the reinforcing effects of forepoles. In addition, relative benefits of forepole location and embedded length are shown to vary as the soil cover above the tunnel changes...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{high-speed}} cargo vessel could soon be taking some of the burden from our roads. The Partial Air Cushion Supported Catamaran, or PACSCAT, is being developed {{with the aid of}} funding from the EU Growth programme. With rapid growth in freight logistics markets throughout Europe, and an already <b>congested</b> land-based <b>infrastructure,</b> expansion of waterborne modes is considered essential. It is expected that PACSCAT vessels will {{play a major role in}} achieving this goal. The high speed, low wash, variable draught vessel is designed for operations on the Rhine and Danube rivers. At a design speed of around 20 kt (37 km / hr), the vessel will be capable of making the 2, 200 km trip from Constanza to Passau in three days as opposed to the current journey time of seven days by barge, thus competing directly with road transport. The payload capacity will be in the order of 2000 t, which is equivalent to around 45 truckloads. The vessel draught can be adjusted from 2. 5 m to as low as 1. 5 m in order to cope with shallow conditions and air draught can be similarly altered to allow for bridge height limitations. The air cushion is contained between the sidehulls and end seals, and is generated by installed lift fans. This reduces the propulsion power requirements and the wash generated, which is especially important in operations along waterways. It will be designed to operate utilising existing berthing/loading facilities. This paper reports the results of the current EU funded project which is developin...|$|R
40|$|In 2012, as a cost-control {{measure and}} in {{response}} to local opposition in the San Francisco Bay Area, the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) adopted a "blended system" at the north and south bookends of the planned first phase of its high-speed rail line. In this blended operation, the high-speed rail line will share track and other infrastructure with commuter rail, intercity rail, and freight on the 50 - mile Peninsula Corridor in Northern California and on 50 miles of right-of-way between Burbank, Los Angeles, and Anaheim in Southern California. This thesis provides a critical review of the blended system and discusses the level of cooperation and coordination necessary between host railroads and the high-speed rail tenant operator. In Northern California, the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board's Caltrain commuter rail service between San Francisco and San Jose is experiencing record levels of ridership. This thesis explores the impact of both the electrification of the line and its extension into San Francisco's central business district on future ridership demand. With the California High-Speed Rail Authority competing spatially and temporally with Caltrain for access to high-revenue and high-cost infrastructure, we review different strategies for coordination and integration between the two agencies. In Southern California, the final form of the blended system is more nebulous than its northern counterpart. For {{the first few years of}} high-speed rail service, the Metrolink service operated by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority is expected to complement the high-speed rail system. However, since Metrolink operates on <b>congested</b> rail <b>infrastructure,</b> some of it owned by capacity-conscious freight railroads, there will exist the challenge of providing quality service and transfer opportunities for time-sensitive high-speed rail customers. The change to a blended system was a dramatic change of direction for the CHSRA; as a result, a new paradigm is needed for implementation of the system over the next 15 years. This thesis reviews the upcoming local design choices to be made on the local rail corridors and evaluates them from the perspective of the future statewide rail network. We find that the decisions made on the local blended corridor level will affect both the financial viability of the overall project and the quality of service experienced by customers across the entire California rail system. by Samuel J.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} technologies and the exponential growth of networks {{has made the}} area of information technology {{an integral part of}} our lives, where network security plays a vital role. One of the most serious threats in the current Internet is posed by distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which target the availability of the victim system. Such an attack is designed to exhaust a server's resources or <b>congest</b> a network's <b>infrastructure,</b> and therefore renders the victim incapable of providing services to its legitimate users or customers. To tackle the distributed nature of these attacks, a distributed and coordinated defence mechanism is necessary, where many defensive nodes, across different locations cooperate in order to stop or reduce the flood. This thesis investigates the applicability of distributed reinforcement learning to intrusion response, specifically, DDoS response. We propose a novel approach to respond to DDoS attacks called Multiagent Router Throttling. Multiagent Router Throttling provides an agent-based distributed response to the DDoS problem, where multiple reinforcement learning agents are installed on a set of routers and learn to rate-limit or throttle traffic towards a victim server. One of the novel characteristics of the proposed approach is that it has a decentralised architecture and provides a decentralised coordinated response to the DDoS problem, thus being resilient to the attacks themselves. Scalability constitutes a critical aspect of a defence system since a non-scalable mechanism will never be considered, let alone adopted, for wide deployment by a company or organisation. We propose Coordinated Team Learning (CTL) which is a novel design to the original Multiagent Router Throttling approach based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm, that uses task decomposition and coordinated team rewards. To better scale-up CTL is combined with a form of reward shaping. The scalability of the proposed system is successfully demonstrated in experiments involving up to 1000 reinforcement learning agents. The significant improvements on scalability and learning speed lay the foundations for a potential real-world deployment...|$|R
40|$|In Peru, {{the severe}} {{economic}} crisis aggravated during the “lost decade” of the 1980 s {{and the politics}} of neo-liberal structural adjustment applied thereupon since 1990, have had considerable socio-economic impacts. While the high levels of existing social inequalities are maintained, the population is confronted {{with a wide range of}} uncertainties regarding all aspects of their life. As employment conditions are characterised by informalisation and instability, a majority of the households finds it increasingly difficult to generate sufficient incomes. This results in deteriorating standards of living, status degradation and social disintegration. On the other hand, the downsizing and privatisation of the state has continuously weakened the capability of its institutions to provide with efficient services. The overall insecurities deriving from this situation are expressed most apparently in the fear of crime. Compared to other Latin American metropolises that have been transformed more profoundly since the 1990 s, the socio-spatial structure of Lima has shown less visible modifications. This can be described as a differentiation of existing patterns, rather than a fragmentation of the urban landscape. Furthermore, the unsustainable urban sprawl of the previous decades, mostly through the attachment of informal settlements on the periphery, has slowed down. This was principally due to the deceleration of population growth, the increasing scarcity of available land and the <b>congested</b> traffic <b>infrastructure.</b> The exposure to direct and indirect insecurities translates spatially into a more complex urban structure, which in the residential sector is exemplified by the proliferation of fortified enclaves. The spread of enclosed residential areas is a phenomenon observed throughout Latin America. However, in Lima, the process of residential enclave building differs from other Latin American metropolises in several aspects. In the Peruvian capital, subsequently and informally enclosed neighbourhoods are by far the most dominant type. Instead of the real-estate sector offering a product, the residents themselves, mostly organised through some form of local association, initiate the fortification process. Residential spaces are being appropriated, controlled and fortified through the implementation of a series of spatial interventions, including physical-personal, organisational-legal and symbolic-cultural measures. Street gates are the most prominent physical feature of spatial intervention. Due to its ex-post nature, the spatial reality created by the enclave building process is not static, but subject to continuous change over time. The actual security geography of an area is determined by the degree of local community cohesion, the available financial resources and the importance of security-related discourses. The process is characterised by its almost complete informality. Very few of the installed street barriers are authorised by the responsible authorities, although they constrain the access to public spaces and the right of free movement. An attempt by the metropolitan authority to regulate the chaotic security landscape in 2004 has not shown significant results so far. As a widespread feature, the fortification of residential areas appeared only until the end of the 1990 s. It is estimated that in 2005 the number of residential enclaves has reached approximately 300, with an estimated 400, 000 inhabitants, equalling five per cent of the total population. Apart from some denser, central areas, they are now spread all over the Lima metropolitan area. Nevertheless, concentrations can be distinguished in districts such as La Molina, Los Olivos, San Luis or the western part of Ate. In contrast to the situation in other Latin American metropolises, the enclave building process is to a greater extent crossing socio-economic boundaries. While fortified enclaves are still over-represented in wealthier areas, more than half are located either in neighbourhoods of lower middle or lower classes. The process of residential enclave building in Lima reproduces social inequalities. On the one hand, the residents dispose of unequal abilities to achieve satisfying security levels according to the average neighbourhood income. On the other hand, the security provision by the police correlates with socio-economic indicators, with lower income areas receiving insufficient policing...|$|R
