Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and <b>container</b> <b>type</b> cargo. In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and {{is home to the}} world's largest and fastest container cranes. Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the objects}} found in the Templo Mayor were offerings. Although many are of Mexica design, there are also {{abundant}} items from other peoples, brought in as tribute or through trade. [...] Sculptures, flint knives, vessels, beads and other sumptuary ornaments—as well as minerals, plants and animals of all types, {{and the remains of}} human sacrifice—were among the items deposited in offerings. All of these fulfilled a specific function within the offering, depending on the symbolism of each object. In excavations at the Templo Mayor, different types of offerings have been found and have been grouped by researchers in terms of Time (the period in which the offering was deposited); Space (the location of the offering within the structure); <b>Container</b> (<b>type</b> and dimensions of the receptacle containing the objects); internal distribution (placement of objects within the offering) and value of the items. The offerings were usually contained in cavities, in stone urns, and in boxes made of slabs. These are found under floors; in platforms, architectural bodies, stairways and in temples. These offerings were placed accompanied by complex rituals following set temporal, spatial and symbolic patterns, depending on the intention of the offering.|$|E

METHODS Cluster randomized trial in eight study sites (Venezuela, Mexico, Peru, Kenya, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Philippines), with each study area divided into 18 - 20 clusters (sectors or neighbourhoods) of approximately 50 - 100 households each. Using a baseline pupal-demographic survey, the most productive <b>container</b> <b>types</b> were identified which produced >= 55 % of all Ae. aegypti pupae. Clusters were then paired based on similar pupae per person indices. One cluster from each pair was randomly allocated to receive the targeted vector control intervention; the other received the 'blanket' (non-targeted) intervention attempting to reach all water holding containers. RESULTS The pupal-demographic baseline survey showed a large variation of productive <b>container</b> <b>types</b> across all study sites. In four sites the vector control interventions in both study arms were insecticidal {{and in the other}} four sites, non-insecticidal (environmental management and/or biological control methods). Both approaches were associated with a reduction of outcome indicators in the targeted and non-targeted intervention arm of the six study sites where the follow up study was conducted (PPI, Pupae per Person Index and BI, Breteau Index). Targeted interventions were as effective as non-targeted ones in terms of PPI. The direct costs per house reached were lower in targeted intervention clusters than in non-targeted intervention clusters with only one exception, where the targeted intervention was delivered through staff-intensive social mobilization. CONCLUSIONS Targeting only the most productive water <b>container</b> <b>types</b> (roughly half of all water holding <b>container</b> <b>types)</b> was as effective in lowering entomological indices as targeting all water holding containers at lower implementation costs. Further research is required to establish the most efficacious method or combination of methods for targeted dengue vector interventions...|$|R

40|$|Cdt is a <b>container</b> data <b>type</b> library that {{provides}} a uniform set of operations to manage dictionaries based on the common storage methods: list, stack, queue, set and ordered set. It is implemented on top of linked lists, hash tables and splay trees. Applications can dynamically change both object description and storage methods so that abstract operations can be exactly matched with run-time requirements to optimize performance. This paper briefly overviews Cdt and presents a performance study comparing it to other popular <b>container</b> data <b>type</b> packages. 1 Introduction A data structure to store objects is a <b>container</b> data <b>type</b> and an instance {{of it is a}} container or a dictionary. Common examples of <b>container</b> data <b>types</b> are: balanced and splay trees[1, 9, 10], skip lists[8], hash tables, stacks, queues and lists[2].

5000|$|There is an {{additional}} term [...] "hooklift container" [...] that {{is related to the}} common designation of the hoist gear on trucks used for roller containers to be called [...] "hook lift". This has influenced languages like Dutch where the truck is called haakarmvoertuig (hook arm vehicle) and the container being a haakarmbak (hook arm pod). These terms refer to the level arm that matches with the grip hook on the container to lift it from the ground.

50|$|Good design {{normally}} {{dictates that}} a file extension enables {{the user to}} derive which program will open the file from the file extension.

In contrast to that, some very general-purpose container types like AVI (.avi) and QuickTime (.mov) can contain video and audio in almost any format, and have file extensions named after the <b>container</b> <b>type,</b> making it very hard for the end user to use the file extension to derive which codec or program to use to play the files.|$|E
40|$|I {{present a}} datatype-generic {{treatment}} of recursive <b>container</b> <b>types</b> whose elements {{are guaranteed to}} be stored in increasing order, with the ordering invariant rolled out systematically. Intervals, lists and binary search trees are instances of the generic treatment. On the journey to this treatment, I report a variety of failed experiments and the transferable learning experiences they triggered. I demonstrate that a total element ordering is enough to deliver insertion and flattening algorithms, and show that (with care about the formulation of the types) the implementations remain as usual. Agda's instance arguments and pattern synonyms maximize the proof search done by the typechecker and minimize the appearance of proofs in program text, often eradicating them entirely. Generalizing to indexed recursive <b>container</b> <b>types,</b> invariants such as size and balance can be expressed in addition to ordering. By way of example, I implement insertion and deletion for 2 - 3 trees, ensuring both order and balance by the discipline of type checking...|$|R
