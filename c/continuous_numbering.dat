40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we study}} {{the number of}} tilings of the {{hyperbolic}} plane that can be constructed, starting from a single pentagonal tile, the only permitted transformations on the basic tile being the replication by displacement {{along the lines of}} the pentagrid. We obtain that there is no such tiling with five colours, that there are exactly two of them with four colours and a single trivial tiling with one colour. For three colours, the number of solutions depends of the assortment of the colours. For half of them, there is a <b>continuous</b> <b>number</b> of such tilings, for one of them there are four solutions, for the two other ones, there is no such tiling. For two colours, there is always a <b>continuous</b> <b>number</b> of such tilings. By contrast, there is no such analog in the euclidean plane with the similar constraints...|$|R

50|$|After the {{discovery}} of portions of the Odes of Solomon in Pistis Sophia, scholars searched to find more complete copies of these intriguing texts. In 1909, James Rendel Harris discovered a pile of forgotten leaves from a Syriac manuscript lying on a shelf in his study. Unfortunately, all he could recall was that {{they came from the}} 'neighbourhood of the Tigris'. The manuscript (Cod. Syr. 9 in the John Rylands Library) is the most complete of the extant texts of the Odes. The manuscript begins with the second strophe of the first verse of Ode 3 (the first two odes have been lost). The manuscript gives the entire corpus of the Odes of Solomon through to the end of Ode 42. Then the Psalms of Solomon (earlier Jewish religious poetry that is often bound with the later Odes) follow, until the beginning of Psalm 17:38 {{and the end of the}} manuscript has been lost. However, the Harris manuscript is a late copy — certainly no earlier than the 15th century.In 1912, F. C. Burkitt discovered an older manuscript of the Odes of Solomon in the British Museum (BM Add. 14538). The Codex Nitriensis came from the Monastery of the Syrian in Wadi El Natrun, sixty miles west of Cairo. It presents Ode 17:7b to the end of Ode 42, followed by the Psalms of Solomon in one <b>continuous</b> <b>numbering.</b> Nitriensis is written in far denser script than the Harris manuscript, which often makes it illegible. However, Nitriensis is earlier than Harris by about five centuries (although Mingana dated it to the 13th century).|$|E

40|$|To {{correctly}} predict reactor {{behavior during}} cycle operations, {{the evolution of}} nuclide number densities throughout the core must be accurately modeled. The time-varying spatial distribution of nuclide number densities is typically resolved by discretizing the Monte Carlo geometry into smaller cells over which number densities {{are assumed to be}} spatially invariant. The nuclide number densities in these smaller cells are integrated through time using reaction rate tallies on the same discretized geometry. However, detailed distributions of nuclide number densities in a full three dimensional simulation can require a prohibitive amount of tallies, and the spatial discretization of the base geometry makes coupling to external multiphysics tools difficult. In this paper a method for solving for spatially <b>continuous</b> <b>number</b> density distributions during depletion calculations will be described. The spatially <b>continuous</b> <b>number</b> densities can be used in the transport method proposed by Brown and Martin which allows for transporting neutrons through a material with continuously varying properties such as temperature and nuclide number densities. Coupled with the ability of Functional Expansion Tallies (FETs) [2] to represent tallied quantities as continuous functions, it is possible to both solve for and make use of spatially <b>continuous</b> nuclide <b>number</b> densities. The need for this capability was alluded to by Brown et. al., but no solution has yet been proposed. With a continuous depletion method, recent work which utilized FETs and continuous material tracking to incorporate multiphysics feedback in Monte Carlo simulations can be extended to simulations that include depletion analysis.
