40|$|BACKGROUND: Many hysterectomies are now {{performed}} by a laparoscopically assisted vaginal technique. This procedure is controversial, partly because of concern about cost. We studied hospital <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> for the procedure as compared with those for total abdominal hysterectomy and total vaginal hysterectomy in clinically similar groups of patients. METHODS: From hospital-discharge data and patients' charts, we identified hysterectomies performed in 1993 and 1994 by 96 surgeons at a community teaching hospital to treat benign conditions. The patients were grouped according to the surgical procedures performed {{in conjunction with the}} hysterectomy. Data on hospital charges and cost-to-charge ratios for 64 hospital cost centers were used to assess <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> for specific resources, {{as well as for the}} hospitalization overall. RESULTS: Of 1049 patients studied, 26 percent underwent laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, 54 percent underwent abdominal hysterectomy, and 20 percent underwent vaginal hysterectomy. The average hospital stays were 2. 6, 3. 9, and 2. 9 days, respectively, and the mean total charges (facility charges plus professional fees) for the hospitalizations were $ 6, 116, $ 5, 084, and $ 4, 221 (P< 0. 001 for the comparison of the laparoscopic technique with both other techniques). The mean facility costs were $ 4, 914, $ 3, 954, and $ 3, 116, respectively (P< 0. 001 for the same comparison), with similar findings in all subgroups. The higher <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> for laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy were due to higher supply costs, particularly when disposable supplies were used, and to longer operating-room time. CONCLUSIONS: Despite shorter hospital stays, in-hospital <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> for laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy are higher than for either alternative procedure, because of the disposable supplies that are typically used and the longer operating-room time...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe national trends, hospital <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> of inpatient surgical treatment for female fecal incontinence in the United States. Study Design We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1998 to 2003 to identify women who underwent surgery for fecal incontinence using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision-CM coding. We examined national trends in procedures, patient demographics, outcomes, hospital <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b> Multiple linear regression was used to identify variables associated with increased costs. Results: A total of 21, 547 women underwent inpatient surgery for fecal incontinence during the study period. This number has remained stable, with 3423 procedures in 1998 and 3509 procedures in 2003. The overall risk of complications was 15. 4 % and the risk of death was 0. 02 %, which remained stable during the study period. Total charges increased from $ 34 million in 1998 to $ 57. 5 million in 2003, translating to a total cost of $ 24. 5 million in 2003. Variables associated with increased costs included number of procedures per admission, length of stay, patient age, and race (P <. 05).

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{perioperative}} {{outcomes of}} open surgical and endovascular repair of intact thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) {{during the last}} 3 months of 2005 were compared using a national administrative database. MethodsThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients undergoing open aneurysm repair (OAR) or endovascular TAA repair (TEVAR) from October 1 to December 31, 2005. Patient demographic data, length of stay, hospital charges, patient disposition, and mortality were examined. Where appropriate, univariate tests of association used the χ 2 test, and multiple logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} determine predictors of in-hospital mortality, complications, and discharge status. ResultsA total of 1030 patients underwent open TAA repair and 267 underwent TEVAR. There {{was no significant difference in}} mortality between OAR and TEVAR (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1. 2; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 73 - 2. 12), although OAR patients were more likely to have cardiac, respiratory, and hemorrhagic complications. Patients undergoing TEVAR were more likely to be discharged to home (adjusted OR, 6. 37; 95 % CI, 2. 93 - 13. 70) and had a decreased length of stay (5. 7 days vs 9. 9 days; P =. 0015). The differences in hospital <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> were not significant. ConclusionAlthough further study is warranted, this study of a national sample suggests that endovascular TAA repair is safe in the short-term, associated with fewer cardiac, respiratory, and hemorrhagic complications, and requires a shorter hospital stay...|$|E

There is significant evidence in literature indicating the better quality assistance SU provide in the treatment of neurological acute disease, with significant improvements in mortality and disability, when the therapeutic intervention (thrombolysis) is carried out within 3 hours after the onset of symptoms. Two are the aims of the present study: to evaluate the economic impact of both the start-up of Stroke Units in the Campania Region and the use of thrombolytic therapy for all treatable population. In the first case, the authors assume <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> on the national health service in absence of SU, rather than in the presence of these: the analysis compares the two alternatives to identify the most affordable one. Moreover, the authors try to estimate the potential savings achievable through the use of thrombolytic therapy: savings resulting from the difference between the number of cases treated in 2009 against the targeted population. By the results of the anticipate analysis, the global economic advantage for the Regional Banks is constituted by the sum of the savings hypothesized in two considered hypothesis. In the synthesis, the activation of SU and trombolytic treatment for all people whit eligibility criteria, may be considered health policy strategies extremely convenient for economic and social impact without causing high sacrifices for the Regional Banks...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{conducted}} {{this study}} to estimate the excessive hospital admission among people with diabetes and the associated economic burden in the USA. MethodsThe study {{was based on the}} 2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a nationally representative probability sample conducted annually by the Agency of Health Research and Quality. Nearly 8 million records were sampled from over 1000 community hospitals in the 2005 NIS. ResultsExcluding childbirth-related admissions, the estimated US hospitalizations numbered approximately 30. 8 million; individuals with diabetes accounted for over 6. 4 million (20. 9 %) of these admissions. For every 1000 individuals without diabetes, with type 1 diabetes, and with type 2 diabetes, the numbers of hospitalizations were 89, 418, and 303, respectively. The rates of hospitalization increased greatly by the presence of diabetes for all age groups and sex. During 2005, the national bill of hospital <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> for individuals with diabetes exceeded US$ 171 billion and US$ 90 billion, respectively. If the prevalence of diabetes increases to 7. 5 % from 7. 0 %, the total number of hospitalizations made by individuals with diabetes will be 7. 5 million in 2015. ConclusionsAlthough approximately 7 % of the population had diabetes in the USA, nearly 20. 9 % of hospitalizations were made by individuals with this condition. Due to the excessive hospitalizations incurred by patients with diabetes, a small {{increase in the number of}} people with diabetes will amplify the number of hospitalizations.

40|$|Discussions on {{environmental}} conditions often assume that urbanisation {{contributes to the}} degradation of the environment. However, urbanisation per se is not detrimental to the environment. Concentrations of population and economic activities through urbanisation offer opportunities in providing environmental infrastructure and health services costeffectively, because of economies of scale. It also provides opportunities to effectively internalise environmental costs; because concentration of economic activities reduces user <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> of tax collection, enforcement, and wastes management, which are essential to environmental protection. Nevertheless, while providing opportunities the process of urbanisation also generates environmental pressures. A nation that is unable to utilise the opportunities and alleviate the pressures through integrated environmental, economic and physical planning finds that mismanaged urbanisation can pose enormous environmental and economic problems that become increasingly difficult to solve with time. Unfortunately, Pakistan {{is one of the}} countries which have not managed the process of urbanisation effectively. This paper, after tracing the urbanisation trends in Pakistan, discusses the existing and emerging environmental impacts and risks. The country is at the stage of risk transition where modern risks caused by industrial and traffic pollution, such as chemicals, heavy metals and noise, combine with the traditional risks such as bacteriological and parasitic infections caused by inadequate infrastructure facilities particularly water supply and sanitation. The paper also analyses the responses to urban environmental problems in terms of approaches to sustainable urban development. Finally, it outlines the holistic policy directions to environmentally sound and sustainable urban development, including institutional, regulatory, economic and participatory measures. ...|$|E

If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. Summary This amendment proposes to clarify the intent of the Market Rule and accounting treatment for units operating in segregated mode of operation. This amendment is necessary to: (a) ensure units operating in segregated mode of operation are treated consistently as export from Ontario, and pay all the <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> assigned to Export transactions; and (b) ensure units operating in segregated mode of operation are not paid CMSC payments or IOG payments when the same entity also is exporting or importing into Ontario (creating an implied wheel through transaction). This amendment proposal is deemed to be urgent as it meets the following statutory criteria: • “avoid, reduce the risk of or mitigate the effects of an unintended adverse effect of a market rule” (section 34. 1. 4 of the Electricity Act, 1998). The existing market rules regarding Segregated Mode of Operation, CMSC and IOG payments may result in the adverse impact of avoiding export charges, plus creating CMSC and/or IOG payments that are not consistent with the intent of both CMSC and IOG payments.

40|$|Abstract. By 1983, {{four states}} had {{received}} waivers from the Health Care Fi-nancing Administration and adopted experimental reimbursement programs covering all third-party payers. In general, these programs {{were designed to}} moderate cost growth {{as well as to}} promote a number of broader distributive objectives. Among the concerns for equity were financing uncompensated care and spreading the costs across a 11 payers, reducing the differentia 1 between hospital <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs,</b> and rejuvenating fiscally distressed hospitals. These diverse goals represent a fundamental shift in the role of state rate setting; as a result, broader outcome measures are required to determine their overall impact. The New York Prospective Hospital Reimburse-ment Methodology (NYPHRM) is evaluated in this broader context. The NYPHRM successfully channeled revenues to fiscally blighted hospitals, increasing the volume of care to the uninsured while maintaining cost growth at national levels. According to this broader set of outcome measures, the NYPHRM would be viewed as a policy success. By 1983, four states had adopted all-payer rate-setting programs designed to limit cost shifting, finance uncompensated care, and reduce hospital cost growth. Maryland foreshadowed this new breed of rate-setting programs when it initiated its all-payer system in 1977. In response to mounting payment differentials be-tween charge and cost payers, increased fiscal distress among inner-city hospitals serving the uninsured, and a burgeoning volume of uncompensated care, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New York followed Maryland’s lead in the early 1980 s. Despite this early enthusiasm for all-payer rate setting, only Maryland and New Jersey have retained an all-payer approach, although the current rate-setting programs in New York and Massachusetts contain goals and a regulatory design similar to their previous all-payer systems.

40|$|The {{views of}} {{hospital}} administrators, doctors and payers on cost-efficiency in surgery {{do not necessarily}} coincide. The difference between <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> the particularities of the financing mechanisms may induce situations in which savings for the {{society as a whole}} result in financial loss for the hospital. Examples are in the use of stapling devices, in ambulatory surgery, in endoscopic surgery: they all result in better quality of care and decreasing health care cost for society; they often induce, however, a not compensated increase in hospital <b>costs.</b> Surgeons <b>and</b> administrators can find each other in a common concern for optimizing efficiency.

40|$|Although malaria {{has been}} {{eliminated}} from the US since the early 1950 s, about 1, 500 cases of malaria are reported in the US every year. Few studies have comprehensively quantified the disease and economic burden of malaria in the US, and the domestic impact has not been well described. Epidemiological study of malaria using hospital data has rarely been explored, and can supplement the findings from current nationwide surveillance system data to elucidate the malaria disease and economic burden. Identification of predictors of increased costs and severe malaria {{may be useful in}} developing targeted interventions. Discharge records for malaria-related hospitalizations from the 2000 - 2012 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) were examined. In chapter 1, the disease burden was quantified by examining the frequencies and population rates of malaria-related hospitalization by demographics, infecting species, clinical, financial, institutional, geographic, and seasonal characteristics. Trends over the period in the counts of malaria cases by different patient characteristics were assessed using negative binomial regression. In chapter 2, the economic burden was quantified by examining the mean and total hospital days, hospital charges, and hospital costs for malaria-related hospitalizations by demographics, species, clinical, financial, geographic, and institutional characteristics. Trends and potential predictors for hospital <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> were identified using linear regression. Trends and potential predictors for length of stay were identified using negative binomial regression. In chapter 3, a subset analysis on severe malaria cases was conducted, and the frequencies and population rates of severe malaria-related hospitalizations by demographics, species, clinical, financial, geographic, and institutional characteristics were examined. Trends in the rates of severe malaria hospitalizations over the study period were assessed by negative binomial regression. Multiple logistic regression models were used to identify potential predictors for severe disease (cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress [ARDS], severe anemia, renal failure, or jaundice) and death among those with malaria-related hospitalizations. From 2000 - 2012, there were an estimated 19, 189 malaria-related hospitalizations (4. 95 per 1 million population) in the US, including 147 in-hospital deaths and 3, 888 severe malaria cases. On average, malaria patients were hospitalized for 4. 39 days with charges of $ 25, 116. From 2000 - 2012, malaria-related hospitalizations accounted for 84, 213 hospital days, $ 151, 825, 389 in total hospital costs, and $ 470, 102, 584 in total charges. The most frequent malaria complication was renal failure (40. 5 %), followed by severe anemia (34. 6 %), ARDS (19. 9 %), cerebral malaria (18. 7 %), and jaundice (15. 4 %). P. falciparum accounted for the majority of malaria- and severe malaria-related hospitalizations. Malaria-related hospitalizations occurred disproportionately among patients who were male, Black, or aged 25 - 44 years. After controlling for potential confounders, older age was associated with higher odds of severe malaria, ARDS, severe anemia, and renal failure. Males had higher odds of developing renal failure and jaundice, while females had higher odds of developing severe anemia and ARDS. HIV infection was associated with increased odds of severe malaria. Having severe malaria was associated with a longer length of stay. Older age, severe malaria, HIV infection, and longer lengths of stay were associated with higher <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b> Mean charges increased significantly over the study period. Patients with a malaria diagnosis were more often hospitalized in the Middle Atlantic and South Atlantic census divisions, urban teaching, private not-for-profit, and large bed size hospitals. Malaria patients who were self-payers or had Medicaid were at increased odds of having renal failure, compared to those with Medicare.

The study helps to put national data on the cost-burden of cerebrovascular disease into perspective at the community level. It is thought that such data may prove useful in planning and evaluation of intervention programs and more coordinated approaches to care. All hospitals, nursing homes, extended care facilities, and noninstitutional sources of care (home health and rehabilitation agencies) that were identified as providing services to CVD patients were {{invited to participate in the}} study, and a sample of such cases was selected from each participating facility. The billing records for these cases were then reviewed and analyzed to determine charges by category of service and sources of reimbursement. At government institutions, per diem rates were used to determine costs. Total charges for care of the CVD patients amounted to $ 6, 070, 000. Hospital care generated the major charge, amounting to $ 5, 159, 000 (85 percent of the total charges) during the study year. Nursing home care charges totaled $ 391, 000 (6. 5 percent), extended care services $ 373, 000 (6. 1 percent), and home health care and noninstitutional rehabilitation services $ 147, 000 (2. 4 percent). Analysis of the data according to type of service revealed that only a small percentage of the care dollar was spent for rehabilitation services. The greatest amounts were spent for room and board in institutional facilities and for drugs, diagnostic services, and miscellaneous other services in hospitals. Average expenditures per CVD case for rehabilitation services in institutions were highest in extended care facilities, being much lower in hospitals and negligible in nursing homes. Average expenditures for care by noninstitutional health service agencies were highest for home aide services, followed by nursing and rehabilitation services...|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between air leaks, LOS, and financial outcomes among discharges following lung resections. Materials and methods: The Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file for fiscal year 2012 was utilized to identify inpatient hospital discharges that recorded International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 9) procedure codes for lobectomy, segmentectomy, and lung volume reduction surgery (n= 21, 717). Discharges coded with postoperative air leaks (ICD- 9 -CM codes 512. 2 and 512. 84) were defined as the air leak diagnosis group (n= 2, 947), then subcategorized by LOS: 1) < 7 days; 2) 7 – 10 days; and 3) ≥ 11 days. Median hospital charges, costs, payments, and payment-to-cost ratios were compared between non-air leak and air leak groups, and across LOS subcategories. Results: For identified patients, hospital charges, costs, and payments were significantly greater among patients with air leak diagnoses compared to patients without (P< 0. 001). Hospital <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> increased substantially with prolonged LOS, but were not matched by a proportionate increase in hospital payments. Patients with LOS < 7, 7 – 10, and ≥ 11 days had median hospital charges of US $ 57, 129, $ 73, 572, and $ 115, 623, and costs of $ 17, 594, $ 21, 711, and $ 33, 786, respectively. Hospital payment increases were substantially lower at $ 16, 494, $ 16, 307, and $ 19, 337, respectively. The payment-to-cost ratio significantly lowered with each LOS increase (P< 0. 001). Higher inpatient hospital mortality was observed among the LOS ≥ 11 days subgroup compared with the LOS < 11 days subgroup (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Patients who develop prolonged air leaks after lobectomy, segmentectomy, or lung volume reduction surgery have the best clinical and financial outcomes. Hospitals experience markedly lower payment-to-cost ratios as LOS increases. Interventions minimizing air leak or allowing outpatient management will improve financial performance and hospital margins for lung surgery.

40|$|Purpose: High-dose {{chemotherapy}} (HDC) with peripheral-blood {{progenitor cell}} (PBPC) and autologous bone marrow (ABM) transplant (T) has documented survival benefits for relapsed Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Treatment {{costs associated with}} HDC and its supportive care have restricted its use {{both on and off}} clinical trial. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT resulted in faster recovery of bone marrow function, with less hospitalization and supportive care than ABMT. This study was undertaken to analyze the costs of the two strategies using prospectively collected data from a randomized clinical trial that compared filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT versus ABMT. Patients and Methods: Clinical results and resource utilization from a randomized clinical trial that compared filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT versus ABMT following carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) HDC for HD and NHL are presented. The trial was performed in six centers in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. Resource utilization data were used to project costs and Massey Cancer Center (MCC) in the United States incurred the cost of treating the cohort. Costs were projected to the United Stares, because the economic implications to United States centers are significant, costs of care vary markedly among countries but resource utilization on this trial did not, and a randomized trial is unlikely to be performed in the United States. Results: Fifty-eight patients with relapsed HD or NHL underwent HDC with BEAM. The PBPCT and ABMT groups had similar short-term survival after BEAM. PBPCT patients had a shorter hospitalization (median, 17 v 23 days; P =. 002), neutrophil recovery (11 v 14 days; P =. 005), platelet recovery to {{greater than or equal to}} 20 x 10 (9) /L (16 v 23 days; P=. 02), and days of platelet transfusions (6 v 10; P <. 001). Estimated costs were $ 8, 531 for ABM harvest and $ 5, 760 for PBPC collection, including filgrastim mobilization. The total estimated average cost was $ 59, 314 for each ABMT patient versus $ 45, 792 for each PBPCT patient. Cost savings of $ 13, 521 (23 %) were due to shorter hospitalizations with less supportive care. Conclusion: PBPCT is as safe and more effective than ABMT for HD and NHL in the short term. PBPCT represents a significant cost savings due to lower autograft collection costs, shorter hospital stays, and less supportive care. The savings exceed the costs for filgrastim mobilization and PBPC collection. Actual savings will vary depending on local practice patterns, <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b> (C) 1997 by American Society of Clinical Oncology...|$|E
40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease is {{probably}} the most important livestock disease in {{the world in terms of}} economic impact. Of all the vesicular diseases prevalent in India, FMD remains the greatest and most feared scourge. In Chazhoor Panchayat, 62 animals were affected with FMD, out of which 28 were vaccinated. The economic loss was calculated taking into consideration milk loss, losses due to abortion <b>and</b> treatment <b>charges.</b> The total economic loss was calculated as Rs 313900 /- out of which loss in milk production accounted for 80. 68 %. Cost of milk was calculated at the rate of Rs. 12 / litre, to assess the economic loss. Treatment <b>cost</b> includes vehicle <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> of medicine. An average loss of 8 hrs/ day / animal was calculated. Vaccination cost of Rs. 5 / animal was also considered. Towards the nursing of animal and disinfection of shed, loss of manpower of 2 -hrs / animals for 5 days was calculated. key words:- FMD, economic impact, production loss, manpower, Chazhoor Panchayat...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{financial performance}} of freestanding ambulatory surgery centres (ASCs) and hospital-based outpatient departments (HOPDs). Patient-level ambulatory surgery data (1997 - 2004) {{for the state}} of Florida were assembled and analysed. We used a pooled, cross-sectional design. We applied multiple regression models to study pricing differences for freestanding ASCs <b>and</b> HOPDs. Substantial <b>charge</b> differences exist for patients undergoing the most common outpatient procedures, and that these differentials are in favour of freestanding ASCs over HOPDs in the majority of studied procedures. These differences in charges are large enough to presume that they may translate into similar difference in actual costs. Although previous research does not show a clear 'winner' (neither ASCs nor HOPDs) in terms of quality outcomes, healthcare policymakers, payers, and patients may be led to look more carefully at <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> data in their contracting processes, or choosing a certain provider of outpatient services. ambulatory surgery centres, ASCs, hospital outpatient departments, HOPDs, financial performance, total charges, healthcare service providers, USA, United States, quality outcomes, contracting processes,...|$|R
