5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about {{upcoming}} military campaigns {{to the point of}} thinking {{the end of the war}} could be near if a string of victories <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.|$|E
5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> to death, those who assaulted an older brother <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E

John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in time for him to take possession before setting out on his last expedition.|$|E
5|$|Despite the warlike {{customs of}} the Vikings, {{there was an}} element of fear {{surrounding}} death and what belonged to it. If the deceased was a revenant or draugr, such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it was interpreted {{as a sign that}} additional family members would die. It was first and foremost in times of starvation, when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes, that rumours about revenants began to flourish. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person had to die anew; a stake <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, Welensky was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He had earlier wanted an amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia with a constitution similar to that of Southern Rhodesia (that had granted responsible government to the white Rhodesians). After the British Government rejected this idea, he set about the creation of a federation, and against his judgement, the small colony of Nyasaland was included. His main wish for amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so the complementary economic strengths of the Rhodesias <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> to best use.

5|$|The Coronation Bandstand {{was built}} by the cliff edge in 1903, {{at a cost of}} £350, to {{celebrate}} the coronation of King Edward VII. The following year, a group of French Ursuline nuns, who were banned from teaching in France, fled with some of their pupils to Westgate-on-Sea and established the Ursuline Convent School, which in 1995 was re-established as Ursuline College. In 1910, a Swiss-Gothic styled town hall was built. However, it was soon decided that the building <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> to better use, and in 1912, it was transformed into the Town Hall Cinema.

However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds.

5|$|George {{wakes up}} the next morning on the river bank, and finds a treehouse {{belonging}} to a Christian missionary named Father Hubert. Hubert has been nursing Nico back to health, but she has suffered a snakebite and requires special medicine. He takes George to the local Mayan village, as he believes the village Shaman will be able to help. George shows his Mayan stone to the shaman, who explains that, hundreds of years ago, Mayan shamans had trapped the god Tezcatlipoca inside a mirror. However, he was so powerful that he would inevitably escape, so they created three stones that contained the power to keep him imprisoned. Before they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> in place, they were stolen by explorers: one by a Spanish pirate named Captain Ketch, who hid it in the Caribbean; one by an English ship, which took it to England; and one by Spanish explorers, who took it back to Spain. The third of these stones was in Nico's and George's possession. George returns to the treehouse and cures Nico with medicine from the shaman. Shortly thereafter, the two separate to find the two remaining stones.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the {{management}} of Braathens SAFE decided that it needed larger aircraft if the company was to stay competitive on charter flights. Larger aircraft <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> into service on the main services from Oslo, Gothenburg and Stockholm, while the 737s {{could be used to}} smaller destination and from other cities. On 25 February 1980, the company announced that it had ordered two Boeing 767-200 planes, with an option for two addition craft. The cost of the two firm orders was about NOK500 million. This would allow the aircraft to be used for both domestic scheduled flights and for charter, and was configured with 242 seats. This was less than charter-only airlines, for instance Britannia had their planes configured with 273 seats. Braathens SAFE's planes were delivered on 23 March and in November 1984. The following year showed increasing charter traffic, although it only made up 25% of the company's revenue. The company had considered the smaller Boeing 757, but did not have sufficient range. Also the Airbus A310 was close to being chosen.|$|E
5|$|The Southwest Pacific {{was not a}} {{promising}} theater of war for the strategic bomber. The bombers of the day {{did not have the}} range to reach Japan from Australia, and there were no typical strategic targets in the theater other than a few oil refineries. This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney, an attack aviator, and Walker, the bomber advocate. The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers. With sufficient mass, so the theory went, bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs, and do so from above the effective range of the ship's anti-aircraft fire. However the theoretical mass required was two orders of magnitude greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific. A dozen or so bombers was the most that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> together, owing to the small number of aircraft in the theater and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable. The results were therefore generally ineffective, and operations incurred heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} assets, the team reused very little from the {{previous}} two games, choosing to build {{a large proportion of}} the game from the ground up, especially when it came to the overworld design and NPC behaviors. The Crystal Tools engine, used in the last two XIII games, required a major overhaul as it was not designed for open-world games. In contrast to the previous games, a lot of the game's cutscenes were created while the game was still in development, meaning many placeholder objects and models had to be used until the final assets <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> in place. The team also had to thoroughly check Lightning's various outfits and weapons, to ensure that there were no mistakes in cutscenes with the weapons going through the scenery, and that the character's underwear remained concealed during active battles even for her more revealing outfits. Because the team was mostly using new assets to create the game, the various continents took longer to create than the environments in XIII-2, and story scenes sometimes needed to be redone as the game's overall plot had yet to be finalized when development began. The voice actors, in contrast to the normal procedure doing their performances first and those being used to create the game characters' facial expressions, recorded their lines for the characters well after the various cutscenes had been created.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{establishing}} his Hartford factory, Colt set out {{to establish}} a factory in Europe and chose London. He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park, London and ingratiated himself by presenting cased engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain's Master General of the Ordnance. At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns. As the world's leading proponent of mass production techniques, Colt went on to deliver a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in London. The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Silver Telford Medal. With help from ICE secretary, Charles Manby, Colt established his London operation near Vauxhall Bridge on the Thames River and began production on January 1, 1853. On {{a tour of the}} factory, Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he recorded his favorable comments of Colt's revolvers in an 1852 edition of Household Words. The factory's machines mass-produced its parts that were completely interchangeable and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> together on assembly lines using standardized patterns and gauges by unskilled labor as opposed to England's top gun makers making each part by hand. Colt's London factory remained in operation for only four years. Unwilling to alter his open-top single-action design for the solid frame double-action revolver that the British asked for; Colt scarcely sold 23,000 revolvers to the British Army and Navy. In 1856 he closed the London plant and had the machinery, tooling, and unfinished guns shipped to Hartford.|$|E
