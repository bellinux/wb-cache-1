50|$|The terms double-top, sandwich-top, and composite-top all {{refer to}} a {{relatively}} new way to construct the soundboard of a guitar, developed by Matthias Dammann in Germany in the late 1980s. Other luthiers such as Robert Ruck, Fritz Mueller, Jim Redgate, Michel Bruck, Boguslaw Teryks and Gernot Wagner have since adopted the method. A double top usually consists of a material called Nomex sandwiched by two thin sheets of tonewood. A flame resistant meta-aramid (a polymer used to make synthetic fiber) material, Nomex was originally designed by DuPont Chemical Co. in the 1960s as a lightweight material {{for use in the}} aviation industry. Luthiers use the honeycomb sheet (<b>calendered</b> <b>paper)</b> version of the product: the low mass, strength, and ease of shaping make it ideally suited for guitar soundboards. Though the construction of a double top significantly differs from the traditional soundboard, a double top guitar often looks just like a traditional guitar. A thin soundboard is often incorporated and used to obtain the most vibration and to allow for optimal sound.|$|E
40|$|E 2017 : 100, Holmen Paper is {{a company}} in the forest {{industry}} group Holmen which specializes in the areas forest and energy. At Holmen Paper Braviken, where the project has taken place, magazine paper, book paper, catalog paper and newspaper is being produced. The product development often occurs in discussion with customers and the increased demand for super <b>calendered</b> <b>paper</b> has led to Holmen recently invest- ing in a new calender for one of their paper machines. In the new calender, {{there has been a}} problem with the changing of the rolls being too long which leads to a longer stop time. Therefore, the aim of this project is to bring forth suggestions of measures for how Holmen should work to reduce their time for changing the rolls. These measures should be quantifiable in time and money. The course of action for the project has been two case studies. The first were time studies of the change of rolls which were later analyzed based on the SMED-method. The second case study were interviews where all the staff with some sort of relation to the change of rolls were interviewed. The two case studies along with a present state description then resulted in a present state analysis where the results were presented. The results, based on the present state analysis, show that the problems that exist are closely related to the organizational work. Since several different units are in- volved, one {{has not been able to}} come up with a structured way of working with improvements. There are also several factors that collide between different work and that there are people with key competences which counteracts a stable system. To create a stable system, a standardized work has been developed for rotation of the work and to decrease the need for key competences. In the work method, there is also a step which is now being performed during the change of roll but which could just as easily be prepared in advance. It is recommended that this step is prepared in advance because it would decrease the time for the change of rolls...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} the printed screen {{elements}} made by the application of two types of offset rubber blankets (ORB) have been investigated in this work. The force in the contact zone between the offset cylinder (ORB) and the printing cylinder (printing substrate) is decisive for making the prints. With the different structure of ORB the different deformation zone is created, which results in forming the different sizes of the screen elements. The printing substrate has also influence, {{and because of that}} 5 characteristic papers (fine art paper gloss, fine art paper mat, offset <b>paper,</b> <b>calendered</b> offset <b>paper</b> and recycled paper) have been analyzed. The results show that on the tested printing substrates, the both ORBs form the greatest dot gains in the following order: offset <b>paper,</b> recycled <b>paper,</b> <b>calendered</b> offset <b>paper,</b> fine art paper mat and fine art paper gloss.

50|$|Sometimes visual {{examination}} {{is not sufficient}} to distinguish parchment from certain types of highly <b>calendered</b> <b>papers.</b> Misidentification of these materials can lead to inappropriate preservation methods or conservation treatments. Analytical testing, which involves removing a small piece of parchment, can be done by or under the supervision of a professional conservator-restorer to ensure positive identification. One type of analytical testing involves examining the parchment specimen under a light microscope or scanning electron microscopy. A simple flame test can also be done on the parchment specimen; true parchment will emit the meaty smell of burned protein, while other look-alike materials will smell like paper or wood.|$|R

25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner, which, {{by means of an}} auger, forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the refiner, the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar to}} <b>calendering</b> <b>paper</b> or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|R

40|$|Many {{mechanical}} systems {{are designed to}} operate at a certain nominal speed. The energy source realizing this kind of steady state motion usually is sufficiently large to maintain the operating conditions, independently {{of the state of}} the system. In several applications, work is not only done to maintain the steady state operation but energy may be misrouted, yielding unwanted vibrations of the system. A popular example is a rotor running at a constant speed, where inner damping may transfer energy originating from the rotation to bending vibrations with increasing amplitudes. Another form of this effect are friction-induced vibrations. In this context the friction forces transfer energy into the vibrations of the system. Technical examples are squealing disk brakes and vibrations of <b>paper</b> <b>calender</b> stacks. In many cases the systems can be described by linear (partial) differential equations with constant coefficients and the energy input is reflected in eigenvalues with positive real part resulting in self-excited vibrations. These vibrations usually interfere with the intended function of the system. A possible countermeasure is the appropriate control of the systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLaser {{technology}} {{has been used in}} industrial processes for several decades. The most advanced development and implementation took place in laser welding and cutting of metals in automotive and ship building industries. However, there is high potential to apply laser processing to other materials in various industrial fields. One of these potential fields could be paper industry to fulfill the demand for high quality, fast and reliable cutting technology. Difficulties in industrial application of laser cutting for paper industry are associated to lack of basic information, awareness of technology and its application possibilities. Nowadays possibilities of using laser cutting for paper materials are widened and high automation level of equipment has made this technology more interesting for manufacturing processes. Promising area of laser cutting application at paper making machines is longitudinal cutting of paper web (edge trimming). There are few locations at a paper making machine where edge trimming is usually done: wet press section, <b>calender</b> or rewinder. <b>Paper</b> web is characterized with different moisture content at different points of the paper making machine.

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the <b>calendering</b> of <b>paper</b> which {{incorporates}} relationships for both roll local thermal deformation and the stress-strain behaviour of paper in and after the nip was developed, validated, then used to demonstrate its application to model predictive control of calendering. The experimental determination of the stress-strain behaviour of paper included documenting the effect of initial temperature and moisture content as well as process parameters, and was expressed as the in-nip calendering equation. The rheological behaviour of commercial newsprint made from thermomechanical pulp {{was found to be}} a strong nonlinear function of temperature and moisture content over the wide range of 20 to 80 °C and 1 to 14 % moisture. A simplified model for the transient local deformation of a calender roll in response to a local cross-machine (CD) control action was determined and validated against the previous complete numerical analysis solution for a variety of roll designs and thermal boundary conditions. This model, appropriate for use in real-time control, was shown to be effective in seeking a compromise between the conflicting CD control objectives of large roll deformation, fine CD resolution and fast control response time. From the above two elements a dynamic {{model of the}} calendering process was developed by appropriate combination of the model of transient local calender roll deformation with the in-nip calendering equation used to estimate, at a specific CD position, in-nip strain from permanent strain. Use of the model shows that paper response to a control action is highly sensitive to local nip load and to temperature and moisture content of the paper. After validation with published measurements on an industrial calender, the effectiveness of this model for minimizing thickness nonuniformity in the CD dimension through implementation of model predictive control of calendering was demonstrated. For a multi-roll calender stack of industrial specifications this demonstration showed an impressive reduction in CD control response time through use of multi-step control action. This model opens the prospect of a significant industrial innovation through the introduction of model predictive control to the difficult problem of CD control of calendering...|$|R
40|$|Calendering of coated and {{uncoated}} paper {{is widely used}} to enhance optical properties such as gloss and print quality. The aim of this thesis is to characterize coatings and prints, and to validate models using experimental results from optical measurements of physical samples. <b>Calendering</b> of coated <b>paper</b> often leads to a brightness decrease. The mechanism for this is not altogether clear. One common {{explanation is that the}} porosity of the coating layer decreases and hence the scattering decreases. By comparing simulated and measured results it was shown that modifications of the surface properties account for the brightness decrease of ground calcium carbonate coated substrates with calendering. Monte Carlo light scattering simulations, taking into account the measured decrease of surface microroughness and increased effective refractive index, showed that surface modifications accounted for most of the observed brightness decrease of the ground calcium carbonate coated substrate, whereas the bulk scattering and absorption coefficients were not affected by calendering. It was also shown that the scattering coefficient is significantly dependent on the coat weight whereas the physical absorption coefficient is not. The penetration of ink in the z-direction of a substrate influences the quality of the print. The ink penetration affects print density, mottling and dot gain, common print effects that influence the preference of consumers. The pressure in the printing nip and the porosity of the substrate both affect the amount of ink that is pressed into the porous structure of a coating layer during printing. By printing pilot coated paperboard with different coating porosity and measuring the resulting optical properties of the prints, a basis for simulations of the different layers, that is to say the coating, the print and the mixed layer in between, was created. Results show that ink distribution is strongly affected by the roughness of the substrate. Fibres and fibre flocks underneath the two coating layers created an unevenly distributed coating thickness that affected the print quality. Differences in pore size and pore size distribution also affected the behaviour of the ink. A coating layer of broad pigment particle size distribution resulted in a relatively low print density, in comparison to coatings of narrowly distributed particle sizes. Comparison of dot gain showed that the coating layer of a narrow particle size distribution had a relatively low dot gain compared to others. In this work, these results are explained by the differences in ink distributions on and in the coating layers...|$|R
