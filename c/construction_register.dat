40|$|Atomicity (or linearizability) is a {{commonly}} used consistency criterion for distributed services and objects. Although atomic object implementations are abundant, proving that algorithms achieve atomicity {{has turned out}} to be a challenging problem. In this paper, we initiate the study of systematic ways of verifying distributed implementations of atomic objects, beginning with read/write objects (registers). Our general approach is to replace the existing operational reasoning about events and partial orders with assertional reasoning about invariants and simulation relations. To this end, we define an abstract state machine that captures the atomicity property and prove correctness of the object implementations by establishing a simulation mapping between the implementation and the specification automata. We demonstrate the generality of our specification by showing that it is implemented by three different read/write <b>register</b> <b>constructions</b> (the message-passing <b>register</b> emulation of Attiya, Bar-Noy and Dolev, its optimized version based on real time, and the shared memory <b>register</b> <b>construction</b> of Vitanyi and Awerbuch), and by a general atomic object implementation based on the Lamport’s replicated state machine algorithm...|$|R

In Sri Lankan condition, the need for efficient management is more urgent than ever before. In fact, inefficient construction management has contributed to long drawn-out projects in the past with inflated costs and delayed utilization. Professional construction project management input is a mandatory requirement for successful project completion and one tool the project manager can effectively used to manage the project is dedicated project management software. This study report, research in to the application of dedicated project management software in construction management by building contractors in Sri Lanka. The focus {{of this research was}} to gather industry experience in the use and application of construction management software and to assess the difficulties face & benefits realised by the industry.
