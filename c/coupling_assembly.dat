50|$|A torque {{converter}} differs from a fluid coupling, {{in that it}} provides a variable amount of torque multiplication at low engine speeds, increasing breakaway acceleration. A fluid coupling works well when both the impeller and turbine are rotating at similar speeds, {{but it is very}} inefficient at initial acceleration, where rotational speeds are very different. This torque multiplication is accomplished with a third member in the <b>coupling</b> <b>assembly</b> known as the stator, which acts to modify the fluid flow depending on the relative rotational speeds of the impeller and turbine. The stator itself does not rotate, but its vanes are so shaped that when the impeller (which is driven by the engine) is rotating at a high speed and the turbine (which receives the transmitted power) is spinning at a low speed, the fluid flow hits the vanes of the turbine in a way that multiplies the torque being applied. This causes the turbine to begin spinning faster as the vehicle accelerates (ideally), and as the relative rotational speeds equalize, the torque multiplication diminishes. Once the impeller and turbine are rotating within 10% of each other's speed, the stator ceases to function and the {{torque converter}} acts as a simple fluid coupling.|$|E

On some simple models we show that the additive effects of pulses on the state of Integrate and Fire oscillators are sufficient for the synchronization of the relaxations of all the oscillators. This synchronization occurs in two forms depending on the system: either the oscillators evolve ``en bloc'' at the same phase and therefore relax together or the oscillators do not remain in phase but their relaxations occur always in stable avalanches. We prove that synchronization can occur independently of the convexity or concavity of the oscillators evolution function. Furthermore the presence of disorder, up to some level, is not only compatible with synchronization, but removes some possible degeneracy of identical systems and allows new mechanisms towards this state.

40|$|While the {{demonstrated}} {{power conversion}} efficiency of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) now exceeds 10 %, new design rules are required to tailor interfaces {{at the molecular level}} for optimal exciton dissociation and charge transport in higher efficiency devices. We show that molecular shape-complementarity between donors and acceptors can drive performance in OPV devices. Using core hole clock (CHC) X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT), we compare the electronic <b>coupling,</b> <b>assembly,</b> and charge transfer rates at the interface between C- 60 acceptors and flat- or contorted-hexabenzocorone (HBC) donors. The HBC donors have similar optoelectronic properties but differ in molecular contortion and shape matching to the fullerene acceptors. We show that shape-complementarity drives self-assembly of an intermixed morphology with a donor/acceptor (D/A) ball-and-socket interface, which enables faster electron transfer from HBC to C- 60. The supramolecular assembly and faster electron transfer rates in the shape complementary heterojunction lead to a larger active volume and enhanced exciton dissociation rate.

40|$|ABSTRACT In this report, {{we examine}} how the cell can {{selectively}} stabilize anchored filaments and suppress spontaneous filament assembly. Because microtubules and actin filaments have an organized distribution in cells, the cell must have a mechanism for suppressing spontaneous and random polymerization.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report on}} {{bottom-up}} assembly routes for fabricating plasmonic structures and metamaterials composed of colloidal {{gold and silver}} nanostructures, such as nanoparticles (“metatoms”) and shape-controlled nanocrystals. Owing to their well-controlled sizes/shapes, facile surface functionalization, and excellent plasmonic properties in the visible and near-infrared regions, these nanoparticles and nanocrystals are excellent building blocks of plasmonic structures and metamaterials for optical applications. Recently, we have utilized two kinds of bottom-up techniques (i. e., multiple-probe-based nanomanipulation and layer-by-layer self-assembly) to fabricate strongly coupled plasmonic dimers, one-dimensional (1 D) chains, and large-scale two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2 D/ 3 D) nanoparticle supercrystals.

The limited catalytic efficiency of Rubisco has sparked extensive efforts to re-engineer the enzyme {{with the goal of}} enhancing agricultural productivity.

RbcL monomers remain partially unstable and retain high affinity for GroEL until captured by RbcX(2).

40|$|The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) {{is being}} {{developed}} for the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) program with a scheduled launch on the first post meridian (PM-i) platform in the year 2000. AIRS {{is designed to provide}} both new and more accurate data about the atmosphere, land and oceans for application to climate studies and weather prediction. Among the important parameters to be derived from AIRS observations are atmospheric temperature profiles with an average accuracy of 1 K in 1 kilometer (km) layers in the troposphere and surface temperatures with an average accuracy of 0. 5 K. The AIRS measurement technique is based on very sensitive passive infrared remote sensing using a precisely calibrated, high spectral resolution grating spectrometer operating in the 3. 7 im- 15. 4 im region. The instrument utilizes a cryogenically cooled infrared spectrometer that uses a pair of pulse tube cryocoolers operating at 55 K to cool the HgCdTe focal plane detectors to 58 K. The instrument also has cryoradiators operating at 190 K and 150 K to cool the spectrometer's optical bench to 155 K.

40|$|An {{endeavor}} {{was conducted}} to explore the design and development of a two-axis linear reluctance actuator {{for use as a}} part of a nano-positioner with the application of serving as a small scale kinematic <b>coupling</b> <b>assembly</b> station. This nano-positioner is designed to be able to accurately and repeatable provide precise motion control of small objects with a resolution on the nanometer scale. This device uses a novel monolithic flexure (Hexflex) that enables it be repeatable to a few nanometers and also very inexpensive to manufacture. The reluctance actuator will provide the force necessary to actuate the positioning system. This actuator type was compared to other actuator types to verify its feasibility and relevance for this application. The actuator operates based off of the reluctance principle used in magnetic circuits and its application as a two-axis actuator is a new and unexplored technology. It will be designed using solid modeling software and magnetic circuit theory, constructed, and tested as a part of the thesis project. Several design iterations were conducted yielding valuable design, manufacturing, and assembly knowledge and insight. Ultimately the actuator did not function properly and consequently did not meet the performance criterion necessary to be incorporated into the nanopositioner system. Due to a correlation disparity between the governing model and the manufactured device, the actuator did not function as predicted and was unusable. Furthermore, after efforts to remedy the problems, the conclusion was reached that the necessary changes would result in the use of this actuator being unfeasible for this application. However, the insight and designs produced from this research has the potential to aid in the further development of this reluctance actuator technology. by Howard J. Liles. Thesis (S. B.)

The object of this thesis is to investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, the free and forced vibrations of wind turbine tower assemblies, using model order reduction techniques. This approach reduces the number of degrees-of- freedom of the system rendering the dynamic analysis more computationally efficient. First, discrete, distributed parameter and finite element models are proposed in order to obtain the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the individual components of the wind turbine tower, as well as a coupled tower and blades assembly. Next, the forced vibration response of all individual and <b>coupled</b> <b>assemblies</b> is modelled in the time domain with both classical and non-classical damping. A gust response factor design methodology is also proposed using a two degree-of-freedom coupled tower and blades assembly.
