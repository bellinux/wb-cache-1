2500|$|There {{are several}} {{policies}} dealing with homelessness. In 1980 the government {{decided to start}} sending funding to people that are homeless, {{but it was not}} until 1984 that shelters were built to accommodate and feed them. As it was shown though seventy percent required homeless people to attend a religious ceremony and spend only a couple of nights there. In the 1987 McKinney Act the problem with homelessness became known as a huge social problem. Later on, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-110) amended the program explicitly to prohibit states that receive McKinney-Vento funds from segregating homeless students from non-homeless students, except for short periods of time for health and safety emergencies or to provide temporary, special, supplementary services. The Chronic Homelessness Initiative. The George W. Bush Administration established a national goal of ending chronic homelessness in ten years, by 2012. The idea of a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness began as a part of a 10-year plan to end homelessness in general adopted by the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) in 2000. The following year, then-Secretary Martinez announced HUD's commitment to ending chronic homelessness at the NAEH annual conference. In 2002, as a part of his FY2003 budget, President Bush made [...] "ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective." [...] The bi-partisan, congressionally mandated, Millennial Housing Commission, in its Report to Congress in 2002, included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years among its principal recommendations. By 2003, the Interagency Council on Homelessness had been re-engaged and charged with pursuing the President's 10-year plan. The Administration has recently undertaken some collaborative efforts to reach its goal of ending chronic homelessness in 10 years. On October 1, 2003, the Administration announced the award of over $48 million in grants aimed at serving the needs of the chronically homeless through two initiatives. The [...] "Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing" [...] initiative was a collaborative grant offered jointly by HUD and the Department of Labor (DOL). The initiative offered $10 million from HUD and $3.5 million from DOL to help the chronically homeless in five communities gain access to employment and permanent housing. Section 8 is the <b>core</b> <b>housing</b> program that helps extremely low-income families accommodate the gap between their incomes below 30 percent of the median income for each community. The government assists homeless families by awarding grants and vouchers. Vouchers are available to the families who are most needy and they are used to pay for housing found in the private market. Currently there are policy changes in who receives vouchers and there will be a reduction in the number of vouchers granted to the population of people that are homeless [...]|$|E

5000|$|Housing {{affordability}} has {{and continues}} to be the top priority housing issue Vancouverites must resolve. In 1996, a study published by BC Housing revealed that 25% of renter households in Vancouver pay 50% or more of their incomes to rent. The <b>core</b> <b>housing</b> need model, developed by the CMHC, uses a threshold of households spending at least 30% of their income on shelter costs to illuminate households experiencing acute housing affordability needs. “Moving from the 30% shelter cost-to-income ratio (STIR) used in the <b>core</b> <b>housing</b> need model, to a 50% threshold, typically reduces the number of households identified by more than half." [...] In 2001, Statistics Canada published a study using both the 30% and 50% thresholds to identify renters and homeowners facing unaffordable housing costs in Metro Vancouver. This study revealed that 8.1% of homeowners and 27.8% of renters exceeded the 30% threshold, while 4.0% of homeowners and 10.8% of renters exceeded the 50% threshold. More in depth still, this study also found that 18.5% of immigrants living in Vancouver exceeded the 30% threshold and 8.0% exceed the 50% threshold. Only 11.3% and 4.8% of Canadian born households exceeded the 30% and 50% thresholds, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Housing is a {{critical}} issue in Asian countries that are industrializing and growing their populations. Trends in developer driven construction point to a Western model that favors a coarse urban fabric of high-rise towers and large blocks in order to efficiently house {{as many people as}} possible. New towns are built rapidly in the span of three to five years that dramatically alter the urban fabric. Many of these new towns are significantly out of scale with the surrounding existing urban fabric. In contrast to the developer driven high-rise nature of the Taiwan housing market, this housing strategy takes cues from existing conditions of urban alleyways and architectural add-ons to foster the close-knit interactions of traditional dense urban communities. As a result, this low-rise, high-density proposal allows for a diversity of streetscapes. The flexible framework that this thesis proposes hinges on the inevitable change of multigenerational family needs. The basic needs of the <b>core</b> <b>house</b> are determined by looking at the spatial needs of a nuclear family. The expansion and add-on to the <b>core</b> <b>house</b> is determined by projecting the needs of an extended family. The regularity and uniformity of the narrow lots allow for combinations of properties that can accommodate combinations of families. Through this lens of multigenerational housing, the project proposes a spatially diverse and socially dynamic community {{as an alternative to the}} government plan of towers and super blocks...|$|R
