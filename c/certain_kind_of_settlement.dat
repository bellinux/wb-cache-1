40|$|This Article {{introduces}} {{the idea of}} judicial departmentalism and argues for its superiority to judicial supremacy. Judicial supremacy {{is the idea that}} the Constitution means for everybody what the Supreme Court says it means in deciding a case. Judicial departmentalism, by contrast, is the idea that the Constitution means in the judicial department what the Supreme Court says it means in deciding a case. Within the judicial department, the law of judgments, the law of remedies, and the law of precedent combine to enable resolutions by the judicial department to achieve <b>certain</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlements.</b> Judicial departmentalism holds that these three bodies of law provide the exclusive ways in which constitutional adjudication gives rise directly to binding constitutional law. This Article argues that our Justices should be judicial departmentalists rather than judicial supremacists...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something {{it is like to}} be a <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> creature from that of there being something it is like to have a <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what {{it is like to be}} a <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it is like to have <b>certain</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> experience, it does not follow that there is anything it is like to be a <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it is like to be an F is recommended...|$|R
