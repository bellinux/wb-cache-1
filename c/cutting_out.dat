The story was adapted by Harvey F. Pollard, Thew and A. P. Younger, with titles by Walter Anthony. It starred James B.

5|$|Critics {{praised the}} manga for its {{creativity}} and {{described it as}} a quintessential shōjo manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the Seiun Award for Best Manga in 2001. The anime television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers. The artwork in the anime was also a focus of attention, described as above average for a late-1990s TV series, and Sakura's magic-casting scenes were complimented for being nearly unique because of the regular costume changes. The anime television series won the Animage Grand Prix award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of Cardcaptors, however, was heavily panned by critics for <b>cutting</b> <b>out</b> character backgrounds essential to understanding the plot.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy surgery may be {{an option}} for people with focal {{seizures}} that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial {{of two or three}} medications. The goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include <b>cutting</b> <b>out</b> the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.|$|E
5|$|MacBride {{entered the}} navy after serving on {{merchant}} vessels and distinguished {{himself in a}} number of actions during the Seven Years' War, including <b>cutting</b> <b>out</b> a privateer, which secured him the rank of post-captain {{by the end of the}} conflict. He was instrumental in establishing and securing a British settlement on the Falkland Islands in the years of peace which followed, and also performed service to the Royal Family by transporting the King's sister, Caroline Matilda. Still in active service by the outbreak of war with the American colonies, MacBride took command of a ship of the line and saw action in engagements under Keppel and Rodney. He was also active against privateers, capturing the Comte d'Artois in a heated battle off the Irish coast. Further service followed with Parker's fleet against the Dutch and with Barrington in the Channel.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without <b>cutting</b> <b>out</b> physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E

5|$|The fan crest {{was later}} {{developed}} by <b>cutting</b> <b>out</b> the figure displayed on it, {{to form a}} metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather or paper over a wooden or wire framework, and were typically {{in the form of}} an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer's head down.|$|E
5|$|The storyline of {{the game}} {{was based on the}} final novel in Nishitani's trilogy, Tensei no Shuuen, {{although}} taking its title from the first novel, Megami Tensei. Nishitani was deeply involved in planning the game, contributing suggestions and advice for the project. According to Okada, a major issue during development was faithfully following the novel's plot due to the limited hardware space on the Famicom cartridge, together with the necessity of creating a compelling gameplay experience. With this in mind, the team picked out key parts the novel's plot to include in the game while <b>cutting</b> <b>out</b> non-essential elements. One element that was not included was the questionable morality of the main protagonist, which was a prominent feature in the novels. Suzuki later commented that it was only because they were working with Namco, which included mature character designs and the heavy use of religion in its narrative, that the game was ever released. The Cerberus demon, which would become a recurring feature in later Megami Tensei games, was a homage to the narrative of Nishitani's trilogy, at the same time emulating the trend for games to have a marketable mascot or character.|$|E
5|$|Lou coerces Nina into a {{date and}} threatens {{to end his}} {{business}} with her unless she has sex with him, knowing her job depends on his footage; she reluctantly agrees. The next day he turns down a business offer from Loder, who beats him to an important plane crash story later that night. Nina berates Lou to get better footage and keep his end of their bargain. In retaliation, Lou sabotages Joe's van; when it crashes, Joe is severely injured and Lou records the aftermath. Later, Lou and Rick arrive before the police {{at the site of}} a home invasion in an affluent neighborhood. Lou records footage of the gunmen leaving in their SUV and of the victims in the house. The news staff fret over the ethics of the footage but Nina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Lou demands public credit and more money. Police detective Frontieri (Michael Hyatt) questions Lou about his connection to the home invasion. He gives her edited footage of the home invasion, <b>cutting</b> <b>out</b> the parts with the gunmen. That night, he and Rick track down the gunmen; Lou plans to follow them to a more crowded public area, then call the police and record the ensuing confrontation. Alarmed, Rick demands half the money Lou stands to make, threatening to tell the police about Lou's crimes; Lou agrees.|$|E

A single electric pole in northern Cebu caught fire during the storm, <b>cutting</b> <b>out</b> power to eight peripheral towns. Downtown Tacloban also suffered a blackout. Off of Boracay, a boat operator was killed after their ship capsized. Another 67ships, {{which consisted of}} speedboats and ferries, sunk during the storm's passage. Buildings were unroofed and trees were torn apart on the island, littering its beaches with debris. A barge was forced by large waves into the pier at San Agustin, Romblon, resulting in the spilling of 25,000L (6,600gal) of diesel fuel. Two children were killed in Tacloban and Capiz {{as a result of}} falling trees; an additional three people in Capiz were feared to have drowned due to floods. Two thousand people became stranded after the Philippine Coast Guard cancelled the operation of 43ferry services. Similarly, 8,000people became stranded at seaports after the coast guard barred vessels from sailing. Extensive damage occurred in Occidental Mindoro, where 422homes were destroyed and an additional 1,421damaged. Rough seas caused the outriggers on a ferry between Batangas and Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro to break apart, causing the ship to begin disintegrating offshore. However, the 104passengers and crew on board were able to escape and were later rescued. Further north in southern Luzon, roads and bridges were rendered impassable after sustaining damage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Carrick for the second season in a row was a shock starter at Wembley for the 2011 FA Community Shield. After {{initially}} being ruled out through injury by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the pre-match build up, Carrick was named in the starting eleven for the game on 7 August 2011. In the first half, United fell behind to a Joleon Lescott header and a long range Edin Džeko strike to trail 2–0 at half time. Carrick was then substituted at the interval and replaced by youngster Tom Cleverley. However United went on to turn the game around and prevail 3–2 winners. The day after the Shield match, Carrick pulled out of England's friendly match against the Netherlands to rest a niggling injury. He was replaced in the squad by Tom Cleverley. On 18 December, Carrick scored his first goal for United for 70 games when he advanced from his own half of the pitch after <b>cutting</b> <b>out</b> Joey Barton's square ball, past a couple of defenders and firing low past the keeper. He eventually won the Man of the Match award. On 4 January 2012, Carrick played his 250th match for Manchester United in all competitions in a 3–0 away defeat to Newcastle United. He celebrated his Jubilee in a 3–2 away victory against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup third round. On 14 January 2012, Carrick scored for United in a 3–0 home win against Bolton. In the 83rd minute, Carrick notched his first goal at Old Trafford since January 2010. He curled a left-footed effort past Ádám Bogdán into the bottom corner. On 16 February 2012, in a Europa League 2–0 away win against Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena, Carrick played his 500th match in all competitions. Carrick also showed his class when he thundered a shot from 30 yards against the post in a 2–0 win against QPR on 8 April.|$|E
