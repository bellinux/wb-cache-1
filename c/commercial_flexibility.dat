40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that a multi-service packet network might be achieved by adding classification and scheduling to routers, but not policing. Instead, a lightweight, packet-granularity charging system is presented that emulates a highly open policing function and is completely separated from the data path. A high proportion of charging operations runs on customer systems to achieve this, the proportion being configurable per-customer. Functions dispersible to customers include not only metering, accounting and billing but also per-packet or per-flow policing and admission control. Lower cost is achieved through simplicity without sacrificing <b>commercial</b> <b>flexibility</b> or security. Inter-provider charging, multicast charging and open bundling of network charges with those for higher class services are all catered for within the same, simple design.

40|$|The Australian and Japanese Governments {{have both}} {{introduced}} a tax consolidation regime effective fiscal year 2002103. The two regimes have many similarities. In particular, they both mandate 100 per cent ownership as the threshold for consolidation, consolidation is voluntary but if elected all eligible companies must consolidate, and intra-group transactions are largely ignored. The regimes {{have been held}} out as reducing both tax liabilities and compliance costs, removing double taxation, enhancing corporate restructuring, and providing greater <b>commercial</b> <b>flexibility</b> and competitiveness. However, the Australian corporate sector remains cautious, primarily because of concerns over the compliance {{costs associated with the}} transition to the new regime and the potential loss of existing tax credits and losses.

30|$|To date, varying {{methods were}} {{reported}} to fabricate ZnO nanostructures, for example, vapor-phase transport, metalorganic chemical-vapor deposition, laser ablation, thermal decomposition, a template-directed method, and chemical synthesis have been engaged to produce ZnO hexagram whiskers, quantum dots, nanorods, nanowires, etc. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. These ZnO nanostructures are generally fabricated under complex process control, high reaction temperatures, long reaction times, expensive chemicals, and a specific method for specific nanostructures [3, 4, 5]. Among these methods, electrochemical synthesis is favored by many due to its simplicity, low-temperature operation process, viability of <b>commercial</b> production, <b>flexibility,</b> and relatively low cost. Anodizing is a well-known route to synthesize low-dimensional self-organized structures. As it was discussed previously, the antibacterial effect of ZnO nanoparticles was extensively studied. On the other hand, many works have been done on the anodizing of zinc foil. But up to our knowledge, there are no reports on the antibacterial properties of anodized ZnO structures in the literature.

40|$|Real-time {{systems design}} {{involves}} many important choices, {{including that of}} the processor. The fastest processors achieve performance by utilizing architectural features that make them unpredictable, leading to difficulties proving offline that application process deadlines will be met, in the worst-case. Utilizing slower, more predictable processors, may not provide sufficient instruction throughput to execute all required application processes. This exposes a key trade-off in processor selection for real-time systems: predictability versus instruction throughput. This paper proposes MCGREP, a novel CPU architecture that combines predictability, high instruction throughput and flexibility. MCGREP is entirely microprogrammed, with multiple execution units. Basic operation involves implementation of a conventional set of CPU instructions in microcode - MCGREP then executes object code suitably compiled. Advanced operation allows the application to dynamically load new microcode, enabling new application specific instructions to increase overall performance. MCGREP is implemented upon reconfigurable logic (FPGA) - an increasingly important platform for the embedded RTS. Custom microcode configurations for new instructions are generated from C source. MCGREP is shown to have performance comparable to two popular FPGA softcore CPUs (OpenRISC and Microblaze, the latter a <b>commercial</b> product). <b>Flexibility</b> is demonstrated by implementing an existing instruction set (OpenRISC) in microcode, with application-specific instructions to improve overall performance.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} system we are developing to support legacy and commercial {{applications in the}} DISCWorld [haw 98] distributed computing environment. Distributed high-performance computing systems, {{often referred to as}} metacomputing [cat 92] systems, present many challenges not only in their design and implementation, but in the harnessing of the resultant collective resource. Supporting legacy and commercial applications not specifically designed for use in a given metacomputing system is one such challenge. The DISCWorld File System, or DWorFS, which we are developing, provides a standard file system interface to an heterogeneous collection of distributed and/or hierarchical storage resources. DWorFS embeds a storage service Application Programming Interface (API) into the standard file system interface. This allows users of legacy and <b>commercial</b> applications more <b>flexibility</b> and higher performance in the use of their applications, without requiring the modification of their often unavailable source code to use custom storage service APIs. ...|$|R

FlexBox field data has begun shedding light on relationships between ambient temperature and load energy consumption, load and building envelope energy efficiency challenges, latency communication network challenges, and opportunities to engage existing demand-side user behavioral patterns.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic {{computable general equilibrium}} model in which optimizing agents evade taxes by operating in the underground economy. The cost to firms of evading taxes is that they find themselves subject to credit rationing from banks. Our model simulations show that {{in the absence of}} budgetary flexibility to adjust expenditures, raising tax rates too high drives firms into the underground economy, thereby reducing the tax base. Aggregate investment in the economy is lowered because of credit rationing. Taxes that are too low eliminate the underground economy, but result in unsustainable budget and trade deficits. Thus, the optimal rate of taxation, from a macroeconomic point of view, may lead to some underground activity.

40|$|AbstractAmong the {{advanced}} electronic devices, flexible organic electronic devices with rapid development {{are the most}} promising technologies to customers and industries. Organic thin films accommodate low-cost fabrication and can exploit diverse molecules in inexpensive plastic light emitting diodes, plastic solar cells, and even plastic lasers. These properties may ultimately enable organic materials for practical applications in industry. However, the stability of organic electronic devices still remains a big challenge, {{because of the difficulty}} in fabricating <b>commercial</b> products with <b>flexibility.</b> These organic materials can be protected using substrates and barriers such as glass and metal; however, this results in a rigid device and does not satisfy the applications demanding flexible devices. Plastic substrates and transparent flexible encapsulation barriers are other possible alternatives; however, these offer little protection to oxygen and water, thus rapidly degrading the devices. Thin-film encapsulation (TFE) technology is most effective in preventing water vapor and oxygen permeation into the flexible devices. Because of these (and other) reasons, there has been an intense interest in developing transparent barrier materials with much lower permeabilities, and their market is expected to reach over $ 550 million by 2025. In this study, the degradation mechanism of organic electronic devices is reviewed. To increase the stability of devices in air, several TFE technologies were applied to provide efficient barrier performance. In this review, the degradation mechanism of organic electronic devices, permeation rate measurement, traditional encapsulation technologies, and TFE technologies are presented...|$|R
