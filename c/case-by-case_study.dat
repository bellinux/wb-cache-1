This contribution serves as an introduction and overview of FIB-SEM tomography applied to porous materials. Using two different porous Earth materials, a diatomite specimen, and an experimentally produced amorphous silica layer on olivine, we discuss the experimental setup of FIB-SEM tomography. We then focus on image processing procedures, including image alignment, correction, and segmentation to finally result in a three-dimensional, quantified pore network representation of the two example materials. To each image processing step we consider potential issues, such as imaging the back of pore walls, and the generation of image artefacts {{through the application of}} processing algorithms. We conclude that there is no single image processing recipe; processing steps need to be decided on a <b>case-by-case</b> <b>study...</b>|$|E

Since their original definitions are based on rather different ideas, proving general properties of them all would seem to require a <b>case-by-case</b> <b>study.</b> However, the use of their axiomatizations allows a uniform treatment that might produce general proofs of those properties. Recently Aceto, Fokkink and Ingólfsdóttir have presented a very interesting result: for any process preorder coarser than the ready simulation in the linear time-branching time spectrum they show how to get an axiomatization of the induced equivalence. Unfortunately, their proof is not uniform and requires a case-by-case analysis. Following the algebraic approach suggested above, in this paper we present a much simpler proof of that result which, in addition, is more general and totally uniform, so that it does not need to consider one by one the different semantics in the spectrum...|$|E

40|$|Mounting of lenses in opto-mechanical {{assemblies}} {{can create}} surface figure errors and refractive index changes through thermal and pre-load stresses. As lenses and barrels change in size under temperature changes, the optical performance degrades due to stress and surface deformations. Currently {{there is no}} way of determining the effect of these mechanical perturbations on the system wavefront without performing tedious finite element analysis. Most in-depth opto-mechanical analyses involve <b>case-by-case</b> <b>studies</b> with specific designs while previous general studies fail to take into account the complex geometries. The assumptions made by previous general studies ignore the effects of lens shape. These omissions can have a large effect on the stiffness, stress and surface figure error.

By parametrizing the model, a simple analysis can be executed for approximating the environmental-mechanical effects on optical performance. This eliminates the time it takes for an opto-mechanical design to be iterated for an optical or mechanical engineer. This tool could be used for early opto-mechanical design or for finite element analysis verification. The parametric model allows the exploration of the broader design study without confining it to a local design space...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{development}} and use of genetically mod-ified plants (GMPs) has been a topic of considerable public debate in recent years. GMPs hold great promise for improving agricultural output, but the potential for unwanted effects of GMP use is still not fully understood. The majority of studies addressing potential risks of GMP cultivation have addressed only aboveground effects. However, recent methodological advances in soil micro-bial ecology have allowed research focus to move underground to try to gain knowledge of GMP-driven effects on the microbial communities and processes in soil that are essential to key terrestrial ecosystem functions. This review gives an overview of the research performed to date on this timely topic, highlighting a number of case studies. Although such research has advanced our under-standing of this topic, a number of knowledge gaps still prevent full interpretation of results, as highlighted by the failure of most studies to assign a definitively negative, positive or neutral effect to GMP introduction. Based upon our accumulating, yet incomplete, understanding of soil microbes and processes, we propose a synthesis for the <b>case-by-case</b> <b>study</b> of GMP effects, incorporating assessment of the potential plant/ecosystem interactions, accessible and relevant indicators, and tests for unfore-seen effects...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the power}} of {{sequencing}} and of emerging high-throughput technologies to collect data rapidly, the definitive functional characterization of unknown genes still requires biochemical and genetic analysis in <b>case-by-case</b> <b>studies.</b> This often involves the deletion of target genes and phenotypic characterization of the deletants. We describe here modifications of an existing deletion method which facilitates the deletion process and enables convenient analysis of the expression properties of the target gene by replacing it with an FRT-lacZ-aph-Plac-FRT cassette. The lacZ gene specifically reports {{the activity of the}} deleted gene and therefore allows the determination of the conditions under which it is actively expressed. The aph gene, encoding resistance to kanamycin, provides a selectable means of transducing a deleted locus between strains so that the deletion can be combined with other relevant mutations. The lac promoter helps to overcome possible polar effects on downstream genes within an operon. Because the cassette is flanked by two directly repeated FRT sites, the cassette can be excised by the Flp recombinase provided in trans. Removing the cassette leaves an in-frame deletion with a short scar which should not interfere with downstream expression. Replacements of yacF, yacG, yacH, yacK (cueO), yacL, ruvA, ruvB, yabB, and yabC made with the cassette were used to verify its properties...|$|R

Although some alien species can constitute real threats to native species or habitats, <b>case-by-case</b> <b>studies</b> are needed to explore their context-dependent impacts. Some species introduced by human beings are indeed destructive, for instance, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the Great Lakes, while in other places they can increase biodiversity (the honeysuckle, for instance, favors native bird species in Pennsylvania; Davis et al. 2011). It is also possible for native species to have similar devastating effects (Valéry et al. 2009). Because {{it is impossible to}} return to past ecosystems that have been increasingly transformed by a plethora of irreversible drivers of change (climate change, nitrogen eutrophication, increased urbanization, and other land-use changes), there has been an increased push to acknowledge ‘novel ecosystems’ (Chapin and Starfield 1997), which are composed of new combinations of species under new abiotic conditions. Therefore, many authors advocate for adaptive ecosystem management, focusing on the resilience of desirable states, rather than targeting the often-impossible eradication of undesirable species (for example, Seastedt et al. 2008).|$|R
30|$|Seppänen and Väliverronen (2003) {{advocated}} using <b>case-by-case</b> <b>studies</b> {{to allow}} the viewer deduce causes, consequences and potential remedies of environmental change. It {{is clear that the}} presentation of biodiversity can benefit from such an approach, given that the multiple meanings and components of biodiversity may overwhelm people and reinforce a decontextualization and disconnect of them with these issues. In this paper, beta diversity has been chosen as one aspect of biodiversity, which specifically assesses the difference in assemblage structure of plant and animals between habitats in a region. As is the case with the broader concept of biodiversity, beta diversity has become an umbrella term in the ecological sciences, mainly because of the different approaches ecologists have developed for quantifying compositional heterogeneity between habitats (Tuomisto 2010). Many of these approaches not only allow for analyzing species presence-absences across sites, but also explicitly account for the abundances of these species for research questions where community evenness is relevant (Anderson et al. 2011). The use of beta diversity as an umbrella concept is deemed suitable for communicating the concept because the specifics of scientific quantification approaches are irrelevant for the purpose to increase laypeople’s awareness and knowledge about its meaning. For simplicity, and to facilitate the layman’s learning process, this study has focused on how the sets of species vary across sites.|$|R

The effects of combined pressure (0. 1 to 1, 400 MPa) and temperature (70 to 120 °C) treatments were determined for these spores. A process employing isothermal holding times was established to distinguish pressure from temperature effects. An increase in pressure (600 to 1, 400 MPa) {{and an increase in}} temperature (90 to 110 °C) accelerated the inactivation of C. botulinum spores. However, incubation at 100 °C, 110 °C, or 120 °C with ambient pressure resulted in faster spore reduction than treatment with 600 or 800 MPa at the same temperature. This pressure-mediated spore protection was also observed at 120 °C and 800, 1, 000, or 1, 200 MPa with the more heat-tolerant B. amyloliquefaciens TMW 2. 479 spores. Inactivation curves for both strains showed a pronounced pressure-dependent tailing, which indicates that {{a small fraction of the}} spore populations survives conditions of up to 120 °C and 1. 4 GPa in isothermal treatments.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between financial development and agriculture growth employing Cobb-Douglas function by incorporating financial development as an important factor of production over the period 1971 - 2011. Design/methodology/approach – The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration with structural breaks is applied to examine long run relationship between the variables. The direction of causality is detected by vector error correction method (VECM) Granger causality test and robustness of causality analysis is tested through innovative accounting approach (IAA). Findings – The empirical analysis confirmed that the series are cointegrated for long run relationship between agriculture growth, financial development, capital and labor. The results indicated that financial development has positive effect on agricultural growth. This implies that financial development plays a significant role in stemming agricultural production and hence agricultural growth. Both capital and labour in the agriculture sector also add to agricultural growth. The Granger causality analysis revealed bidirectional causality between agricultural growth and financial development. The robustness of these results is confirmed by innovative accounting approach (IAA).

40|$|We explore {{two methods}} aimed at {{alleviating}} two difficulties in Lattice QCD: statistical noise and data storage. The first method intends {{to improve the}} signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in three-point correlators, by extending previous work by Detmold and Endres. We test the method in the measurement of two observables: the nucleonic axial charge, and a matrix element computation related to the electromagnetic form factor of the rho meson. Only {{in the case of}} the rho we see a very slight improvement. We conclude that, in general, a <b>case-by-case</b> <b>study</b> would be needed to determine the effectiveness of the S/N optimization. The second method that we study aims to improve data compression of gauge fields. It consists in generating a set of matrices distributed roughly uniformly along the group manifold, and constructing fine lattices around each of these matrices. We show that this compression can indeed provide better performance for SU(2) and SU(3) than the Lie algebra compression, but the improvement is not very significant. Nevertheless, we show that it is fairly close to the best compression one could hope to achieve with this type of method. We find that the compression procedure is very costly, which makes it currently impractical for machine precision- compression. We conclude that studies must be done to determine if it can be improved by using additional information from the gauge fields. by Andres Rios Tascon. Thesis: S.

40|$|International audienceGalactic {{cosmic rays}} are {{believed}} to be accelerated at supernova remnant shocks. Though very popular and robust, this conjecture still needs a conclusive proof. The strongest support to this idea is probably the fact that supernova remnants are observed in gamma-rays, which are indeed expected {{as the result of the}} hadronic interactions between the cosmic rays accelerated at the shock and the ambient gas. However, also leptonic processes can, in most cases, explain the observed gamma-ray emission. This implies that the detections in gamma-rays do not necessarily mean that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic ray protons. To overcome this degeneracy, the multiwavelength emission (from radio to gamma-rays) from individual supernova remnants has been studied and in a few cases it has been possible to ascribe the gamma-ray emission to one of the two processes (hadronic or leptonic). Here, we adopt a different approach and, instead of a <b>case-by-case</b> <b>study</b> we aim for a population study and we compute the number of supernova remnants which are expected to be seen in TeV gamma-rays above a given flux under the assumption that these objects indeed are the sources of cosmic rays. The predictions found here match well with current observational results, thus providing a novel consistency check for the supernova remnant paradigm for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. Moreover, hints are presented for the fact that particle spectra significantly steeper than E- 2 are produced at supernova remnants. Finally, we expect that several of the supernova remnants detected by HESS in the survey of the Galactic plane should exhibit a gamma-ray emission dominated by hadronic processes (i. e. neutral-pion decay). The fraction of the detected remnants for which the leptonic emission dominates over the hadronic one depends on the assumed values of the physical parameters (especially the magnetic field strength at the shock) and can be as high as roughly a half...|$|E
40|$|This reports {{describes}} a novel method based on polynomial algebra techniques {{which aims to}} determine the transverse position of N current wires perpendicular to a plane in which the induced 2 D magnetic field map shall exhibit a given multipole expansion at one or several specified locations. Rather than a <b>case-by-case</b> comparative <b>study</b> of the method with other existing ones, we will insist {{on the details of}} the method itself and then illustrate its potential to the design of many magnet classes, from very pure 2 n-pole magnets to more exotic components producing a magnetic field with more complex characteristics, such as FFAG magnets, mass-less septa or magnetic collimators...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are gaining {{credibility in the}} scientific community because of their duality as a conservation and fishery management tool, but sometimes the actual effects of an MPA fall short of the expected outcomes. <b>Case-by-case</b> <b>studies</b> are needed to understand what works and what doesn’t and this understanding can then be applied to decision making and adaptive management. The galjoen (Coracinus capensis), a surf zone teleost endemic to South Africa, is a popular fish for recreational shore anglers and as such the population has declined to dangerously low levels. Marine reserves were established around Cape Point to try and counteract this decline. This study aimed to determine whether these reserves are having a positive effect on galjoen mortality, density and size. A controlled shore angling program has been running on the Cape Peninsula since 1986 in which anglers use a standardised fishing technique. The anglers record the length of their fishing trip as well as the fork length of the fish they catch. Two sites located in near proximity to each other, one in a reserve and one in an exploited area, were chosen from the data set to compare. This avoided the conflicting problem of major habitat differences. General linear models (GLMs) were used to isolate the effect of area on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) as well as fork length, and a negative log-likelihood function was used to estimate the mortality rate and sex ratio for each area. CPUE increased significantly from of 1. 02 ± 0. 81 galjoen. angler- 1. hour- 1 in th...|$|R
25|$|It’s {{thought that}} X-inactivation skewing could {{be caused by}} issues in the {{mechanism}} that causes inactivation, or by issues in the chromosome itself. However, the link between phenotype and skewing is still being questioned, and should be examined on a <b>case-by-case</b> basis. A <b>study</b> looking at both symptomatic and asymptomatic females who were heterozygous for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD) found no apparent link between transcript expression and skewed X-Inactivation. The study suggests that both mechanisms are independently regulated, {{and there are other}} unknown factors at play.|$|R
