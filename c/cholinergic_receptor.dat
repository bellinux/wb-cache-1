40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the microscopic visualization of <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> in the rat and human brain. The <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> are well {{represented in the}} human brain with highly diversified regional distributions. Both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors are families of several different receptor proteins. The chapter reviews the advances {{of the distribution of}} the <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> in the human brain. The pharmacological and autoradiographical techniques are used to examine the anatomical and microscopical localization of <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> and their alterations in the human brain. The heterogeneity of these receptors is much larger than previously suspected. Both nicotinic receptor (nAChRs) and muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> (mAChRs) are involved in several diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). These results strongly support an involvement of the different <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> in the function of specific brain areas. It is necessary to establish the cellular localization of these receptors in the human brain. For that, the development of more selective ligands, of probes for the visualization of the messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for the different receptor subtypes and of antibodies, specific for the different receptor proteins, are necessary. All these tools should provide the ways to clarify the distribution, localization, and modification of <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> at the cellular level...|$|R

Male Wistar rats of 2 months (young), 12 months (adult) and 27 months (old) of age were examined. Radioligand binding analysis revealed a significant decrease of the density of muscarinic M 1 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> with increasing age and no change in muscarinic M 2 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors.</b> Autoradiographic evaluation {{of the number of}} silver grains developed within the cell body of pyramidal neurons of the CA 1 and CA 3 fields revealed a decrease of muscarinic M 1 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> in the 27 -month-old rats in comparison with younger cohorts and no changes in muscarinic M 2 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors.</b> These findings suggest that the reduction of muscarinic M 1 sites noticed between rats of 2 - and 12 -months of age using radioligand binding techniques is probably dependent on the loss of hippocampal neurons rather than on the reduction of receptor density per neuron. Our data also indicate that appropriate morphological techniques associated with quantitative analysis may be useful in assessing age-dependent {{changes in the}} expression of neurotransmitter receptors by specific neuronal populations.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate age-dependent changes of muscarcinic M 1 and M 2 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> in the rat hippocampus using radioreceptor assay and autoradiographic techniques with [3 H]pirenzepine and [3 H]AF-DX 116 as ligands. The analysis was performed on 2 -, 12 - and 27 -month-old male Wistar rats, considered young, adult and old, respectively. Moreover, the influence of a 6 -month treatment with choline alphoscerate on the density and pattern of M 1 and M 2 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> was assessed. Choline alphoscerate (L-alpha-glyceryl phosphorylcholine) is a precursor in the biosynthesis of several brain phospholipids which increases the availability of acetylcholine in various tissues. Muscarinic M 1 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> were significantly decreased with increasing age whereas M 2 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> did not show changes. Choline alphoscerate treatment countered, in part, the loss of muscarinic M 1 receptor sites in old rats. Light microscope autoradiography revealed a loss of silver grains developed after exposure of sections of hippocampus to [3 H]pirenzepine in the stratum oriens of CA 1 and CA 3 fields in rats of 12 and 27 months in comparison with young animals. Choline alphoscerate restored, in part, the decrease of silver grains noted in old rats. Quantitative analysis of the density of silver grains developed in the cell body of pyramidal neurons of CA 1 and CA 3 fields processed for the demonstration of muscarinic M 1 receptor sites revealed a decrease of these grains in rats of 27 months in comparison with younger cohorts. These findings suggest that the reduction in muscarinic M 1 sites noticeable between 2 - and 12 -month rats is probably dependent on the loss of nerve cells and/or terminals in these hippocampal fields rather than to a reduction of their density per neuron. Treatment with choline alphoscerate increased the expression of muscarinic M 1 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> within the cell body of pyramidal neurons of CA 1 and CA 3 fields compared to age-matched control old rats. Consistent with radioreceptor assay data, no changes in the density of muscarinic M 2 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> in the animal groups examined were demonstrated by light microscope autoradiography. The possible pharmacological relevance of the increased expression of muscarinic M 1 <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> elicited by choline alphoscerate in the hippocampus of aged rats is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of microinjections of acetylcholine (a cholinergic agonist), physostigmine (a cholinesterase inhibitor), atropine (an antagonist of muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors)</b> and hexamethonium (an antagonist of nicotinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors)</b> into the parafascicular nucleus of thalamus on the acute corneal nociception in rats. Acute corneal nociception was induced by putting a drop of 5 M NaCl solution onto the corneal surface of the eye {{and the number of}} eye wipes was counted during the first 30 s. Both acetylcholine and physostigmine at the same doses of 0. 5, 1 and 2 Î¼g significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced the number of eye wipes. The intensity of corneal nociception was not changed when atropine and hexamethonium were used alone. Atropine (4 Î¼g), but not hexamethonium (4 Î¼g) significantly (P < 0. 05) prevented acetylcholine (2 Î¼g) - and physostigmine (2 Î¼g) -induced antinociceptive effects. The results indicated that {{at the level of the}} parafascicular nucleus of thalamus, the muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> might be involved in the antinociceptive effects of acetylcholine and physostigmine...|$|R

50|$|Solifenacin is a {{competitive}} <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist, selective for the M3 receptor subtype.

50|$|The main {{mechanism}} of action for anatoxin-a(S) is by irreversibly inhibiting the active site of acetylcholinesterase leading to excess acetylcholine in the parasympathetic and peripheral nervous systems; inducing poisoning via nicotinic and muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptor</b> stimulation. Treatment of afflicted case by atropine has attested to suppress the muscarinic mediated toxicity; which prevents the namesake salivation that similarly reacts to prevent the toxin's other poisoning symptoms which include lacrimation, urinary incontinence and defecation. Atropine will not, however, counter another {{mechanism of}} the compounds toxicity as it also mediates a nicotinic adverse toxicity affecting muscle tremors, fasciculation, convulsions and respiratory failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cholinergic</b> <b>{{receptor}},</b> nicotinic, alpha 6, {{also known}} as nAChRÎ±6, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CHRNA6 gene.

Neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing Î±6 subunits are expressed on dopamine-releasing neurons in the midbrain, and dopamine release following activation of these neurons {{is thought to be}} involved in the addictive properties of nicotine. Due to their selective localisation on dopaminergic neurons, Î±6-containing nACh receptors have also been suggested as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

50|$|All {{currently}} known {{activity of}} the olivocochlear system is via a nicotinic class neurotransmitter receptor complex that is coupled with a calcium-activated potassium channel. Together, these systems generate an unusual synaptic response to stimulation from the brain. The olivocochlear synaptic terminals contain various neurotransmitters and neuroactive peptides. The major neurotransmitter employed by the olivocochlear system is acetylcholine (ACh), although gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is also localized in the terminals. ACh release from the olivocochlear terminals activates an evolutionarily ancient <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptor</b> complex composed of the nicotinic alpha9 and alpha10 subunits. While these subunits create a ligand-gated ion channel that is especially permeable to calcium and monovalent cations the cellular response of the outer hair cells to ACh activation is hyperpolarizing, rather than the expected depolarizing response. This comes about due to the rapid activation of an associated potassium channel. This channel, the apamin sensitive, small conductance SK2 potassium channel, is activated by calcium that is likely released into the cytoplasm via calcium-induced calcium release from calcium stores within the subsynaptic cisternae {{as a response to}} incoming calcium from the nicotinic complex. However, it has not been ruled out that some incoming calcium through the nicotinic alpha9alpha10 channel may also directly activate the SK channel. Electrophysiological responses recorded from outer hair cells following ACh stimulation therefore show a small inward current (carried largely by incoming calcium via the acetylcholine receptor) that is immediately followed by a large outward current, the potassium current, that hyperpolarizes the outer hair cell.|$|E
40|$|A {{protocol}} for predicting full agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist profiles of compounds with M 2 muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptor</b> activity was developed using radioligand binding assay techniques with [3 H]-N-methyl scopolamine (NMS) and [3 H]-Oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) as radioligands. Full muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptor</b> agonists such as muscarine and oxotremorine-M expressed a high agonist index (> 3000 for M 1 muscarinic cholinergic receptors and > 900 for M 2 muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptor),</b> whereas muscarinic receptor antagonists (selective or non-selective) for different receptor subtypes gave a low (0. 5 - 10) agonist index.

40|$|Interactions between noradrenergic and <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptor</b> {{signaling}} may {{be important}} in some forms of learning.

Pharmacological and genetic manipulations have indicated that the cholinergic and dopaminergic system in the striatum modulate each otherâs function. In addition to modulating the dopaminergic system, nicotinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> facilitate GABA release, whereas muscarinic receptors attenuate GABA release. The striatal cholinergic system has also been implicated in various cognitive functions including procedural learning and intradimensional set shifting. Together, these data indicate that the cholinergic system in the striatum is involved in a diverse set of cognitive functions through interactions with other neurotransmitter systems including the dopaminergic and GABAergic systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{profile and}} the anatomical localization of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> of the vasa nervorum were studied in sections of sciatic nerve using radioreceptor binding and light microscope autoradiography techniques. Sprague-Dawley rats of 4 and 24 {{months of age}} were used. [3 H]Dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and [3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were used to label beta-adrenergic and muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors,</b> respectively. The ligands were bound to sections of rat sciatic nerve {{in a manner consistent}} with the labelling of beta-adrenergic or muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> in the 2 age groups investigated. The dissociation constant (Kd) values (about 1. 37 nM for [3 H]DHA and 0. 75 nM for [3 H]QNB) did not significantly change between 4 - and 24 -month-old rats. The maximum concentration of binding sites (Bmax) for [3 H]DHA was decreased by about 35 % in 24 in comparison with 4 -month-old rats. The Bmax value for [3 H]QNB was reduced by about 50 % in the aged rats. Light microscope autoradiography revealed the development of specific silver grains in the medial layer of epineurial and perineurial arteries in sections of sciatic nerve exposed either to [3 H]DHA or [3 H]QNB. The number of silver grains developed in epineurial and perineurial arteries of rats of 24 months is significantly lower than in animals of 4 months. The above results suggest the occurrence of an age-dependent loss in the density of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> of vasa nervorum. Vasa nervorum are the blood vessels which supply peripheral nerve trunks. They are constituted by outer (epineurial) and inner (perineurial) arteries and veins as well as by a capillary (endoneurial) plexus. Vasa nervorum are innervated by both sympathetic and non-sympathetic nerves which probably play a role in the pathogenesis of some neuropathies. Several different neurotransmitter containing nerve fibres have been identified in the vasa nervorum perivascular plexuses. However, no information is so far available concerning the neurotransmitter receptors of vasa nervorum. Moreover, although the occurrence of age-dependent changes in peripheral nerve morphology and function is well documented, very few reports were centered on the age-dependent changes of the vasa nervorum. The aims of the present study were to characterize pharmacologically and to localize anatomically the beta-adrenergic and muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors</b> in the rat vasa nervorum. Moreover, the effect of ageing on the density and pattern of these receptors was investigated...|$|R
40|$|We have {{reported}} previously that human keratinocytes synthesize and secrete acetylcholine and that muscarinic cholinergic drugs have effects on keratinocyte proliferation, adhesion, and migration. This study defines {{the location of}} muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human epidermis and describes some pharmacologic and molecular properties of these receptors. Confocal microscopy employing the anti-muscarinic receptor monoclonal antibody M 35 visualized the receptors in the intercellular areas of normal human epidermis. Using immunoelectron microscopy, the receptors appeared to {{be attached to the}} keratinocyte plasma membranes. Functional, high-density (Bmax = 8. 3 nmol/ 2 Ã 106 cells) and high-affinity (Kd = 21. 5 nM) muscarinic receptors were demonstrated by saturable binding of the reversible radioligand [3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to the surfaces of freshly isolated epidermal cells at 0 Â°C. Receptor proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis. An apparent isoelectric point of pH 4. 3 was determined in immunoblots of sodium-cholate-solubilized receptors separated on isoelectric-focusing gels. Three protein bands, two at approximately 60 kDa and one at 95 kDa, were visualized in immunoblots of membrane-bound or solubilized receptors separated by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The covalent, irreversible ligand [33 H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard confirmed these results. Thus, human keratinocytes express a heterogeneous population of muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors.</b> Because human keratinocytes also express nicotinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors,</b> endogenously secreted acetylcholine may control different biologic processes in these cells by activating different types of their <b>cholinergic</b> <b>receptors...</b>|$|R
