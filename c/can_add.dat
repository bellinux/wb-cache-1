5|$|As of {{the date}} above, 12 players have left the club with 24 career appearances; Bobby Warrender, Fred Marlow, Brad Halliday, Bradley Fewster, Tom Mitchell, John Hammerton, Liam George, Jamie Price, Nick Pope, Richard Tindale, Phil Taylor and Byron Webster. The list {{includes}} 16 players who are still contracted to the club, and so <b>can</b> <b>add</b> to their totals.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the date}} above, no player has left the club with 99 career appearances; four – John Stone, Barry Lyons, Gary Bull and Malcolm Comrie – {{finished}} on 98. The list includes seven players who are still contracted to the club, and so <b>can</b> <b>add</b> to their totals.|$|E
5|$|Home {{is a new}} app {{that allows}} users to manage {{appliances}} compatible with HomeKit, Apple's API for home automation. In the app, users <b>can</b> <b>add</b> compatible HomeKit accessories, such as locks, lights, and thermostats, and then directly control the appliances through the app.|$|E
5000|$|To enhance {{clearing}} {{dimethyl sulfoxide}} <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to the slide. To make the fungi {{easier to see}} lactophenol cotton blue stain <b>can</b> be <b>added.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shoulders {{are shown}} with a {{horizontal}} line. Small arrows <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to show shoulder and torso movement. Arms and even legs <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> if necessary.|$|R
50|$|From the linearized Hamiltonian one <b>can,</b> <b>adding</b> {{dissipation}} {{and noise}} terms to the Heisenberg equations of motion, derive the so-called linearized quantum Langevin equations, which govern {{the dynamics of}} the optomechanical system.|$|R
5|$|Revelations: The Demon Slayer, Last Bible II, and Last Bible III are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} which all have similar gameplay. Players explore the game world and fight {{various types of}} monsters. During battles, players choose commands for their characters to do from a menu. Players can attack with both physical attacks and magic spells; different kinds of magic are effective against different types of monsters. Characters in players' party learn new spells {{throughout the course of}} the game. By defeating monsters, players gain experience points and money. As characters gain more experience points, players get access to points which he or she <b>can</b> <b>add</b> to the characters' attributes; for instance, players <b>can</b> <b>add</b> points to a character's speed attribute, which allows that character to move earlier during battles. Players can use money that they've earned through battles to buy armor, weapons, and items, in shops found throughout the game world.|$|E
5|$|The Nahuatl {{languages}} are agglutinative, polysynthetic languages that make {{extensive use of}} compounding, incorporation and derivation. That is, they <b>can</b> <b>add</b> many different prefixes and suffixes to a root until very long words are formed, and a single word can constitute an entire sentence.|$|E
5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one <b>can</b> <b>add</b> either an edge connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting that tree to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are exactly the pseudoforests in which every component is a 1-tree.|$|E
50|$|Features <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> {{using the}} public API, or by adding custom JavaBeans which <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to reports. User defined {{functions}} (UDF) extend the formula {{features of the}} embedded formula calculation routines.|$|R
50|$|Direct-attached storage, or DAS, are {{storage units}} that <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to a NAS {{solution}} via Daisy-Chaining technology {{to increase the}} NAS' storage volume. A maximum of 4 DAS units <b>can</b> be <b>added.</b>|$|R
500|$|... where [...] is arbitrary. Since the {{solution}} is not unique from mathematical perspective, to {{the solution}} <b>can</b> <b>added</b> any one of an infinite set of eigenfunctions as shown by Stewartson and Paul A. Libby.|$|R
5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas <b>can</b> <b>add</b> the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Decimal {{fractions}} can {{be added}} by a simple modification of the above process. One aligns two decimal fractions above each other, with the decimal point in the same location. If necessary, one <b>can</b> <b>add</b> trailing zeros to a shorter decimal {{to make it the}} same length as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as above, except the decimal point is placed in the answer, exactly where it was placed in the summands.|$|E
5|$|Some Scout Groups offer special Scouting {{programmes}} called Air Scouts and Sea Scouts. Both programmes {{follow the}} same core programme in all sections but <b>can</b> <b>add</b> more aeronautical or nautical emphasis depending on the programme, with some Groups choosing to be recognised by the Royal Air Force or Royal Navy. In the United Kingdom there are approximately 400 Sea Scout Groups, of which about 25% (101 Groups) are Royal Navy recognised, whilst of 117 Air Scout Groups, 43 are recognised by the RAF.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the water}} level is used often, dye <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to the water {{to make it easier}} to see. If {{the water level}} is used {{outdoors}} in winter, antifreeze <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to the water.|$|R
5000|$|For an {{existing}} meld of 3♥-4♥-5♥-6♥, another card of 2♥ or 7♥ <b>can</b> be <b>added,</b> thereby continuing the run in either direction. For {{an existing}} meld of 8♥-8♥-8♣-8♠, another card of 8♠ or 8♦ <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to the set.|$|R
50|$|Oral agents {{adequate}} for polymicrobial oral infections include the combinations of amoxicillin plus clavulanate, clindamycin and metronidazole plus a macrolide. Penicillin <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to metronidazole in the treating dental and intracranial infections to cover Actinomyces spp., microaerophilic streptococci, and Arachnia spp. A macrolide <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to metronidazole in treating upper respiratory infections to cover S. aureus and aerobic streptococci. Penicillin <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to clindamycin to supplement its coverage against Peptostreptococcus spp. and other Gram-positive anaerobic organisms.|$|R
5|$|To {{offset the}} {{difficulty}} of having things forbidden for use, {{there are certain things}} that are recommended by the Judges, and therefore grant Judge Points if used. Judge Points (JP) are used to carry out combos with nearby allies or to summon a Totema. JP are also received upon knocking out an opponent. Later in the game, the player gains the ability to use law cards, which <b>can</b> <b>add</b> laws, and anti-law cards, which can nullify laws that are already in effect.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder <b>can</b> <b>add</b> the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Between levels, the Kid {{visits the}} Bastion, where the player can use fragments—the game's form of currency—that they have accrued to buy {{materials}} and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they <b>can</b> <b>add</b> {{one of six}} structures to the Bastion, such as a shrine, an armory, or a distillery, and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the distillery lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the enemies to become stronger and giving the player increased experience points and currency. Experience points are {{used to determine the}} Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{elements}} <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> {{between the}} tense-marker and the verb-stem, such as aspect-markers and object-markers. So {{for example the}} object-marker -mu- [...] "him" [...] or [...] "her" [...] <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> {{to any of the}} above verbs: nd-a-mú-thandiza [...] "I have helped him".|$|R
50|$|Digital items <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to a SimpleDL digital {{collection}} through standard web browsers {{and standard}} web interfaces. Items <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> {{one at a}} time or in batches. The digital collections reside on a SimpleDL Server, either installed locally or on an SimpleDL-hosted server.|$|R
50|$|To add an {{additional}} dependent variable, isolines {{that are a}} function of the two independent variables <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> within the carpet to create a contour plot in the carpet domain. Contours <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to cheater plots as well as to true carpet plots.|$|R
5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they <b>can</b> <b>add</b> their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{was also}} {{developed}} during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. Thermite welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed. At first, oxyfuel welding {{was one of the}} more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as advances in metal coverings (known as flux) were made. Flux covering the electrode primarily shields the base material from impurities, but also stabilizes the arc and <b>can</b> <b>add</b> alloying components to the weld metal.|$|E
5|$|Barring Link's {{progress}} are creatures he must {{battle to}} locate the entrances to nine underground dungeons. Each dungeon is a unique, maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages, and guarded by monsters different from those found on the surface. Dungeons also contain useful items which Link <b>can</b> <b>add</b> to his arsenal, such as a boomerang for retrieving distant items and stunning enemies, and a recorder with magical properties. Link must successfully navigate through {{each of the first}} eight dungeons to obtain all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom. Once he has completed the artifact, he can enter the ninth dungeon to rescue Zelda. Apart from this exception, the order of completing dungeons is somewhat left to the player, although they steadily increase in difficulty and some of them can only be reached or completed using items gained in a previous one. In addition, the entrances of the three highest-level dungeons are hidden. Link can freely wander the overworld, finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game. For example, it is possible to reach the final boss of the game without ever receiving the first sword.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{elements}} <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> {{between the}} tense-marker and the verb-stem, such as aspect-markers and object-markers.

50|$|Catalog - The Catalog is a {{repository}} of objects that <b>can</b> be <b>added</b> to your project. For example: Text fields, Buttons, Question Objects, Rectangles, Navigation Controls. You <b>can</b> even <b>add</b> your own objects to the catalog {{so that they can}} be used later in different projects.|$|R
