40|$|Introduction: The optimal {{treatment}} for inferior pole patella avulsion fractures has still been {{a topic of}} debate. The options include (a) internal fixation of the pole fragment and (b) resection of the avulsed fragment and repair of the patellar ligament to the patella. We present the comparative outcomes for patients with displaced inferior pole patella treated by resection and transosseous Ethibond® Krackow suture repair of patellar ligament with open reduction and internal fixation with modified tension band wiring and <b>circumferential</b> <b>wiring.</b> Methods: During a three year period between August 2013 and September 2016, twenty consecutive patients with distal pole fractures of the patella were prospectively enrolled in this study. These patients {{were divided into two}} groups. Group-T patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with modified tension band wire and  group-R patients by resection of the avulsed fragment and reattachment of the patellar ligament to the patella with # 5 Ethibond®. Data entry and analysis was done by using SPSS version 20. Anatomical and functional outcome were compared. Results: Consecutive 20 patients were treated either with resection lower patellar pole (n= 10) or with open reduction internal fixation with tension band wiring (n= 10). Demographics were matched in two groups. Group-T required a longer hospital stay (U= 13. 5, p= 0. 005). Complications were seen more often in Goup-T compared to Group-R (p= 0. 005). Group-R had better scores (Bostman score U= 6, p= 0. 001; SFMA U= 7. 5, p= 0. 001) and range of movement (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Resection of the avulsed fragment and reattachment of the patellar ligament to the patella had better outcome according to the Bostman and SFMA dysfunction score, shorter hospital stay, and less complications as compared to open reduction and internal fixation with tension band wire and <b>circumferential</b> <b>wiring...</b>|$|E
40|$|In 1977 Robicsek 1 {{described}} {{a method of}} sternal closure that involved a double wire {{on each side of}} the sternum, with appropriate <b>circumferential</b> <b>wires.</b> Shortly thereafter, we modified that procedure, as shown in Figure 1. Only one wire is used {{on each side of the}} sternum, and fewer <b>circumferential</b> <b>wires</b> are needed. This type of sternal closure can be performed as rapidly as the usual closure of simple <b>circumferential</b> <b>wire</b> sutures and is much more secure, because the <b>circumferential</b> <b>wires</b> cannot cut through the parasternal wire. After using this method in about 100 patients with either poor sternal bone or chronic lung disease, we have encountered no subsequent sternal separation...|$|R

In this procedure, the starting strip is given a corrugated profile in a longitudinal direction. This profile strip is then wound helically and the overlapping coils are tightly welded along the helical seam. After corrugation, the hose may be equipped with a braided sheath (see below). In this case, the hose then passes through a braiding machine that has <b>circumferential</b> <b>wire</b> coil holders, or so-called bobbins.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{problem of}} how best to treat a pa-tient with {{instability}} of the atlanto-axial complex is still somewhat controversial. In this follow-up study of fifty-nine patients, nineteen were treated by a plaster jacket and brace; eleven, by single midline wiring and onlay bone grafts; and thirty, by four <b>circumferential</b> <b>wires</b> around the posterior elements of the axis and atlas with two bone grafts wedged between these ele-ments on each side according to the method described by Brooks and Jenkins. (One patient had both types of fusion.) Although direct comparison {{of the results of}} treatment in the three groups was not possible because of the many variables that may have influenced the re sults, the incidence of solid fusion was distinctly higher after the Brooks fusions despite less postoperative im...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveSubtrochanteric femoral {{fractures}} are severe injuries. Although many {{treatment methods}} have been developed, controversy exists regarding the optimal management of these fractures. This study evaluated the clinical outcome of subtrochanteric femoral fractures fixed with long proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA-long). MethodsBetween October 2006 and February 2008, 25 patients with traumatic subtrochanteric fractures of the femur were treated with PFNA-long. Closed reduction and fixation were performed in 20 cases. In the remaining 5 cases, closed reduction was difficult, so limited open reduction was performed, with bone grafting in 4 cases and <b>circumferential</b> <b>wiring</b> in 4 cases. ResultsThe average follow-up time was 16. 1 months. All subtrochanteric femoral fractures healed uneventfully except one case of delayed union. The mean union time was 26. 2 weeks. Technical difficulties with nail insertion were encountered in 3 cases. No implant failure was observed. ConclusionPFNA-long is effective in treatment of subtrochanteric femoral fractures, with {{a high rate of}} bone union, minor soft tissue damage, early return to functional exercise and few implant-related complications...|$|E
40|$|Background : Osteoporotic {{fractures}} {{often occur}} at sites rich in cancellous bone. However, most animal models of fracture healing {{have been established}} using cortical bones, and the fracture healing process in cancellous bone has not been reported. Methods : Seven-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent ovariectomy (OVX). All rats underwent complete mid-sagittal osteotomy of the proximal tibia and were divided into a wiring group and a non-wiring group (n= 14 each). Rats were sacrificed at 2 and 4 weeks after osteotomy, and bone histomorphometry was performed to evaluate the percentage of cancellous bone union and fibrous union. Results : The percentage of bone union was significantly higher in the wiring group than in the non-wiring group (p= 0. 004) at 2 weeks after osteotomy. There was also {{no significant difference between}} the wiring and non-wiring groups at 2 and 4 weeks after osteotomy regarding the percentage of fibrous union (2 w : P= 0. 062, 4 w : P= 0. 063). Conclusions : The <b>circumferential</b> <b>wiring</b> technique improved cancellous bone union at the osteotomy site of the proximal tibia in the ovariectomized rats. The wiring may improve cancellous bone union by improving contact at the bone-to-bone interface and reducing the interposition of fibrous tissue...|$|E
40|$|A {{tungsten}} {{alloy wire}} reinforced high temperature alloy composite {{is being developed}} for potential application as a hollow turbine blade for advanced rocket engine turbopumps. The W- 24 Re-HfC alloy wire used for these composite blades provides an excellent balance of strength and wire ductility. Preliminary fabrication, specimen design, and characterization studies were conducted by using commercially available W 218 tungsten wire {{in place of the}} W- 24 Re-Hfc wire. Subsequently, two-ply, 50 vol pct composite panels using the W- 24 Re-HfC wire were fabricated. Tensile tests and metallographic studies were performed to determine the material viability. Tensile strengths of a Waspaloy matrix composite at 870 C were 90 pct of the value expected from rule-of-mixtures calculations. During processing of this Waspaloy matrix composite, a brittle phase was formed at the wire/matrix interface. <b>Circumferential</b> <b>wire</b> cracks were found in this phase. Wire coating and process evaluation efforts were performed in an attempt to solve the reaction problem. Although problems were encountered in this study, wire reinforced high temperature alloy composites continue to show promise for turbopump turbine blade material improvement...|$|R

Case Presentation: A 65 -year-old lady with right patella fracture was treated with open reduction and cerclage wiring. An iatrogenic split fracture was noted during tension of the cerclage wire and was successfully managed by screw fixation of the split fracture. Conclusions: Split fracture is a rare complication of <b>circumferential</b> cerclage <b>wiring</b> of patellar fracture.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} (3 D) {{finite element}} analysis (FEA) allows the mechanical integrity of complex structures to be estimated with some confidence. This research is concerned with extending an existing parallel FEA code. This code has been run on up to 16 processors on Durham University’s high performance computing (HPC) cluster and two different parallel linear solvers have been compared. A key feature of the work has been to develop tools for structural analyses. An automatic mesh refinement program has been written, the Zienkiewicz and Zhu error estimator has been coded for 3 D hexahedral meshes and post processing techniques {{have been used to}} calculate and visualise principal stress data and peak stress criteria. This project also reports on three peak stress envelopes used to assess the condition of a concrete sub-structure. The development of this parallel code has enabled the deformation behaviour of a key component of a nuclear rector vessel to be determined. The BCU is a prestressed cylindrical concrete vessel (depth of 1. 73 m and diameter of 3. 37 m) sealing the top of a boilers housed within the walls of the reactor. In recent years possible problems have been identified at the Hartlepool and Heysham I Advance Gas-Cooled nuclear reactors (AGR) with respect to the structural condition of the BCU (in particular the condition of the prestressed <b>circumferential</b> <b>wires</b> designed to maintain the BCU in a state of compression). This problem provides an interesting case study for this project. Four different BCU meshes have been used containing either 40201 or 321608 elements (the elements are either 8 or 20 -noded hexahedral elements). Three different load cases have been used to model the BCU. The results of the analyses confirm that the circumferential pre-stressing is vital {{in order to keep the}} BCU is a state of compression and operating under safe working conditions. These results have been confirmed using principal stress plots and three different peak stress envelopes. The results show that when the pre-stressing is released approximately one quarter of the elements contain stresses at Gauss points which exceed the peak strength of the concrete. This suggests that under these extreme conditions the BCU’s structural integrity has been severely compromised, concrete rupture is possible and the nuclear reactor is no-longer safe to operate. ...|$|R

This calculated gap coincides with the measured transition of 1. 4 {+-} 0. 4 mm between the observed regimes of slow and rapid improvement in power output with decreasing gap. In the plasma shell regime, x-ray powers in excess of a factor of three over that generated in the plasma-wire region are measured...|$|R
