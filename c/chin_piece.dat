25|$|Despite not forcing {{anything}} {{into the}} mouth, mouth corsets are usually {{very effective in}} gagging the victim. This {{is due to the}} fact that the <b>chin</b> <b>piece</b> prevents the wearer from opening their mouth and dislodging the gag, and the lacing at the back of the corset holds the gag tightly against the mouth, making a very effective seal. In addition, it compresses the wearer's cheeks.|$|E

40|$|Pygmy {{grasshoppers}} or pygmy locusts, are {{so called}} {{because of their}} small size. As a group, they contain some of the smallest members of the Orthoptera; with overall length usually not surpassing 20 mm. Worldwide there are about 200 genera and 1000 species, with most of these occurring in tropical regions of the world, where they can take on very elaborate forms. While tetrigids occur in every ecozone of the world except the artic and antartic regions, most species have localized distributions and do not occur worldwide. In the U. S., there are only 6 genera, and 23 species. Florida has a rich tetrigid fauna for the U. S., with all 6 genera, and 13 species occurring there. Of these, the two most common are, Tettigidea lateralis (Say), and Parattetix mexicanus (Saussure). Members of the Tetrigidae can easily be distinguished from other Orthoptera by several external characters. They have an elongated pronotum covering the entire abdomen {{and most of the}} hind wings. They have a tarsal formula of 2 - 2 - 3, and the prosternum is projected forward into a <b>chin</b> <b>piece</b> or sternomentum, which partially covers the mouthparts. Very little genitalia work has been done in this group and external morphology is the principle means of identifying tetrigids. Characters of the head and face, such as the frontal costa, fastigium, and extent to which the eyes protrude, are used for determining species. Some pronotal characters that are used include texture, shape, and the median and lateral carina. Several characters on the appendages have also been used. Despite the simplicity of the characters used, tetrigids are a very difficult group to identify to species. The difficulties are caused chiefly by dimorphism and polymorphism in prontal length and surface. Many of the characters used in identification are so varied that the definitions of a particular morphological state can become melded and one is forced to make a decision on a character that is intermediate between the two described in a couplet. Complicating matters is the tendency for many tetrigids to be highly polychromatic, which eliminates using color as a diagnostic tool...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{surgical}} chin augmentation {{uses the}} lower prominence of the mandible as the [...] "implant." [...] Known as a sliding genioplasty, the procedure involves cutting a horseshoe-shaped piece of bone {{from the lower}} border of the mandible known as an osteotomy. For <b>chin</b> augmentation, the <b>piece</b> of bone is advanced forward to increase to projection of the <b>chin.</b> The <b>piece</b> can also be recessed backward for a chin reduction. The new position is held in place with a titanium step plate using titanium screws. The bone segment can also be fixated with 26 or 27 gauge wires and IMF (wiring the jaw shut) for 3-4weeks. This type of surgery is usually performed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or a plastic surgeon.|$|R
60|$|As {{my kitchen}} and parlour {{were not very}} far distant, I one day went in to {{purchase}} some chickens from a person I heard offering them for sale. It was a little, rather stout-looking woman, {{who seemed to be}} between seventy and eighty years of age; she was almost covered with a tartan plaid, and her cap had over it a black silk hood, tied under the <b>chin,</b> a <b>piece</b> of dress still much in use among elderly women of that rank of life in Scotland; her eyes were dark, and remarkably lively and intelligent; I entered into conversation with her, and began by asking how she maintained herself, etc.|$|R
60|$|Now {{they stood}} by the open door, Martin, a helmet from the walls upon his head, tied beneath his <b>chin</b> with a <b>piece</b> of rope {{because it was too}} small for him, the great sword Silence lifted ready to strike, and Foy behind {{gripping}} the long pike with both hands. Below them from the gathered mob of soldiers came a confused clamour, then a voice called out an order and they heard footsteps on the stair.|$|R
6000|$|The {{friends had}} a social [...] "cup o' tea" [...] upstairs, which Polly {{considered}} {{the height of}} luxury, and then each took a mirror and proceeded to prink to her heart's content. The earnestness with which Polly made her toilet that night was delightful to behold. Feeling in a daring mood, she released her pretty hair from the braids in which she usually wore it and permitted the curls to display themselves in all their brown abundance, especially several dangerous little ones about the temples and forehead. The putting on of the rescued collar and cuffs was a task which absorbed her whole mind. So was the settling of a minute bit of court-plaster just {{to the left of}} the dimple in her <b>chin,</b> an unusual <b>piece</b> of coquetry in which Polly would not have indulged, if an almost invisible scratch had not given her an excuse for doing it. The white, down-trimmed cloak, with certain imposing ornaments on the hood, was assumed with becoming gravity and draped with much advancing and retreating before the glass, as its wearer practised the true Boston gait, elbows back, shoulders forward, a bend and a slide, occasionally varied by a slight skip. But when that bonnet went on, Polly actually held her breath till it was safely landed and the pink rose bloomed above the smooth waves of hair with what Fanny called [...] "a ravishing effect." [...] At this successful stage of affairs Polly found it impossible to resist the loan of a pair of gold bands for the wrists and Fanny's white fan with the little mirror in the middle.|$|R
