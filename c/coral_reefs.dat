5|$|A major {{scientific}} {{controversy over}} the origin of <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> {{took place in the}} late 19th Century, between supporters of Darwin's theory (such as the American geologist James Dwight Dana, who early in his career had seen <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> in Hawaii and Fiji during the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition), and those who supported a rival theory put forward by the Scottish oceanographer John Murray, who participated in the 1872–76 Challenger expedition. Murray's theory challenged Darwin's notion of subsidence, proposing instead that <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> formed when accumulating mounds of calcareous marine sediments reached the shallow depths that could support the growth of corals. Amongst Murray's supporters was the independently wealthy American scientist Alexander Agassiz, who financed and undertook several expeditions to the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian Ocean regions to examine <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> in search of evidence to support Murray's theory, and to discredit Darwin.|$|E

5|$|The Structure and Distribution of <b>Coral</b> <b>Reefs,</b> Being {{the first}} part of the geology of the voyage of the Beagle, under the command of Capt. Fitzroy, R.N. during the years 1832 to 1836, was {{published}} in 1842 as Charles Darwin's first monograph, and set out his theory of the formation of <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> and atolls. He conceived of the idea during the voyage of the Beagle while still in South America, before he had seen a coral island, and wrote it out as HMS Beagle crossed the Pacific Ocean, completing his draft by November 1835. At the time there was great scientific interest in the way that <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> formed, and Captain Robert FitzRoy's orders from the Admiralty included the investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of the voyage. FitzRoy chose to survey the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean. The results supported Darwin's theory that the various types of <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> and atolls could be explained by uplift and subsidence of vast areas of the Earth's crust under the oceans.|$|E

5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical <b>coral</b> <b>reefs.</b> They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day.

5|$|<b>Coral</b> <b>reefs</b> {{are some}} of the most biodiverse {{habitats}} on earth supporting large numbers of species, not just of corals but also of fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, and many of these fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, <b>coral</b> <b>reefs</b> are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places of various sizes to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of pelagic fish, and they influence the productivity of the ocean for miles around. Anthazoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed by outside factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in the reefs.|$|E

40|$|The <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> {{damage in}} Probolinggo region was {{expected}} to be caused by several factors. The first one comes from its society that exploits fishery by using cyanide toxin and bomb. The second one goes to the extraction of <b>coral</b> <b>reef,</b> which is used as decoration or construction materials. The other factor is likely caused by the existence of large industry on the seashore, such as Electric Steam Power Plant (PLTU) Paiton and others alike. Related to the development of <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> ecosystem, availability of an accurate data is crucially needed to support the manner of future policy, so the research of <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> coverage percentage needs to be conducted continuously. The aim of this research is to collect biological data of <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> and to identify <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> coverage percentage in the effort of constructing <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> condition basic data on Binor, Paiton, and Probolinggo regency seashore. The method used in this research is Line Intercept Transect (LIT) method. LIT method is a method that used to decide benthic community on <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> based on percentage growth, and to take note of benthic quantity along transect line. Percentage of living coral coverage in 3 meters depth on this Binor Paiton seashore that may be categorized in a good condition is 57, 65 %. While the rest are dead coral that is only 1, 45 %, other life form in 23, 2 %, and non-life form in 17, 7 %. A good condition of <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> is caused by <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> transplantation on the seashore, so this <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> is dominated by Acropora Branching. On the other hand, Mortality Index (IM) of <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> resulted in 24, 5 %. The result from observation and calculation of <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> is dominated by Hard Coral in Acropora Branching (ACB) with <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> coverage percentage of 39 %, Coral Massive (CM) with <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> coverage percentage of 2, 85 %, Coral Foliose (CF) with <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> coverage percentage of 1, 6 %, and Coral Mushroom (CRM) with <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> coverage percentage of 8, 5 %. Observation in 10 meters depth resulted in <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> coverage percentage of 63, 33 %. 75 % of living coral found on this 10 meters depth are dominated by Acropora branching coral, while the rest 25, 21 % are filled by Acropora tabulate coral and non-Acropora coral in the life form of branching, massive, sub-massive, foliose, and mushroom, where coral Mortality Index (IM) reached 28, 5 %. The high number of <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> coverage percentage on Paiton is caused by successful coral transplantation and low activity of society in this location. The domination of large size Acropora branching coral were estimated comes from a few types, showing that coral resulted from transplantation has grown large and form a complex 3 dimension structure that is suitable for the life form of fish and living benthic...|$|R
