Our concept is novel tissue reconstruction not from single cells but from <b>cell</b> <b>sheets.</b> In order to prepare <b>cell</b> <b>sheets,</b> temperature-responsive culture dishes are utilized. Since temperature-responsive polymers are covalently grafted on the dishes, various types of cells adhere and proliferate on them at 37 °C, but are spontaneously detached only by reducing temperature below 32 °C without any need for proteolytic enzyme. All the confluent cells are noninvasively harvested as a single contiguous <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> with intact cell-cell junctions and deposited extracellular matrix.

In this study a novel polyelectrolyte-based {{platform for the}} engineering and controllable detachment of human mesenchymal stem <b>cell</b> (MSC) <b>sheets</b> is presented. Thin films obtained by layer-by-layer deposition of cationic poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and anionic poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) polyelectrolytes on conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes allowed for the fast formation of viable sheets from human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PD-MSCs).

Both electrochemically-induced local pH lowering and global decrease of the environmental pH allowed for a rapid detachment of intact stem <b>cell</b> <b>sheets.</b> The recovered stem <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> remained viable and maintained their capacity to differentiate toward the adipogenic and osteogenic lineages.

Based on our hypothesis that suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signal enhances hepatic differentiation of human MSCs, we developed human mesenchymal stem cell-engineered hepatic <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> {{by a small}} molecule compound. Screening of 10 small molecule compounds was performed by WST assay, TCF reporter assay, and albumin mRNA expression. Consequently, hexachlorophene suppressed TCF reporter activity in time- and concentration-dependent manner. Hexachlorophene rapidly induced hepatic differentiation of human MSCs judging from expression of liver-specific genes and proteins, PAS staining, and urea production. The effect of orthotopic transplantation of human mesenchymal stem cell-engineered hepatic <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> against acute liver injury was examined in one-layered to three-layered <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> system.

This strategy combined osteoblast impregnated in the bone compartment and multiple periodontal ligament (PDL) <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> on the electrospun membrane. After 21 days in culture the osteoblasts deposited mineralized matrix in the bone compartment and the <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> formed of a PDL-like tissue. The scaffolds were placed onto a dentin block and implanted in a rodent subcutaneous model for 8 weeks. In the bone compartment a more intense alkaline phosphatase staining was observed with higher bone density as shown by lCT, when the scaffold contained osteoblasts. A thin mineralized cementum- like tissue was deposited on the dentin surface for the groups with multiple PDL <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> (as observed by H&E and Azan staining). These groups showed a better attachment of PDL-like tissues onto the dentin block compared with the scaffold without <b>cell</b> <b>sheets.</b> Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of cementum protein 1 (CEMP 1), a specific marker for cementum, at the interface between PDL and the dentine blocks.

40|$|Background and Objective: The {{transplantation}} of <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> of mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) {{is expected to}} be the next generation of periodontal regenerative therapy. An adequate method of multilayering MSCs has yet to be established. When <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> proliferate, they usually contract and detach from culture dishes and then the proliferation of cells in the contracted areas is arrested. ROCK-mediated contractile force causes cell contraction. Although multilayer formation medium (MFM) stimulated the proliferation of growth-arrested confluent MSCs, MSCs detached from the culture dish. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 on the proliferation and detachment of confluent MSCs, and examined the ability of cells to differentiate within the <b>cell</b> <b>sheets.</b> Material and Methods: Confluent MSCs were cultured in MFM containing transforming growth factor-β 1, ascorbic acid and fetal bovine serum either with or without Y- 27632. Cell proliferation was examined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays and total DNA measurement. Sheet contractions were examined by light microscopy and stereomicroscopy. Multilayer formations and focal adhesion assembly were observed with confocal microscopy. Characteristic of cells were examined by flow cytometric analysis. Osteoblast lineage differentiation was observed with alkaline phosphatase and alizarin red S staining. Adipocyte lineage differentiation was observed with oil red O staining. Results: The addition of Y- 27632 to MFM prevented the <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> from detaching and did not inhibit MSC growth. The cell numbers cultured with MFM/Y- 27632 were significantly higher than that obtained with MFM-only on day 4. <b>Cell</b> <b>sheets</b> detached from the culture dish on day 4, and the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in the detached area decreased. Cells in the <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> had similar characteristics to primary MSCs, and differentiated into osteoblast and adipocyte lineages. Conclusion: Y- 27632 both prevented the MSC sheets from detaching and maintained the multilayered proliferation of confluent MSCs by MFM, and then <b>cells</b> in the <b>sheets</b> had differentiation potency. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 609 号 学位授与年月日:平成 25 年 8 月 7 日Author: Kouhei Nakamura, Atsutoshi Yoshimura, Takashi Kaneko, Kayo Sato, Yoshitaka HaraCitation: Journal of Periodontal Research, 49 (3), pp. 363 - 370; 201...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{regenerative}} medicine {{has been proposed}} as a new therapy for repairing damaged heart. In direct transplantation of dissociated cells, {{it is difficult to}} control shape, size and location of the transplanted grafts. To solve these problems, further advanced therapies to transplant bioengineered 3 -dimensional (3 -D) myocardial tissue have been investigated. In contrast to popular approach seeding cells onto 3 -D biodegradable scaffolds, we have developed novel technology "cell sheet engineering" that layers <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> to reconstruct 3 -D tissues. By using this technology, neonatal rat cardiomyocyte sheets were successfully layered and electrically communicative pulsatile 3 -D myocardial tissues have been engineered.

40|$|Periodontitis is an {{infectious}} and inflammatory oral disease, which damages the tooth supporting structures {{and is one}} of the major causes of tooth loss in adults. Thus, periodontal diseases hinder the patient’s quality of life in terms of oral health and functions leading to significant socio-economic outbreak worldwide. Since the periodontium has extremely limited and restricted capability for self-renewal, conventional treatments have not been influential in creating significant outcomes. These limitations have opened pathways for searching new approaches for periodontal regeneration. In recent years, periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) have been considered to be the promising cell source for periodontal regeneration in cell-based tissue engineering approaches. PDLSCs have been experimentally used for the regeneration of periodontal tissues and eventually demonstrated significant results in general. <b>Cell</b> <b>sheet</b> technology steps into tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as a novel approach by overcoming many drawbacks coupled with traditional tissue engineering methods. Using this approach, cells could be harvested as an intact <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> by adjusting the dish surface temperature. In this study, PDLSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to create three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs to assess the periodontal regeneration potential in vitro and in vivo. PDLSCs were characterized for their “stemness” and multilineage differentiation potentials. PDLSCs and HUVECs were used to create 3 -D <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs and unraveled the synergistic effects in different ratios of these cells. The present study suggested that co-culture groups exhibited higher level of osteo/odontogenic gene expressions compared to monoculture <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> groups. Moreover, vessel-like structures were observed in a <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> assembly in vitro. Further studies would be necessary to evaluate the exact parameters required for the development of such vessel-like structures and angiogenesis in 3 -D <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs in vitro. In vivo assessment of tooth-root coated with three different combinations of triple-layered <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> groups (PDLSCs-PDLSCs-PDLSCs, PDLSCs-HUVECs-PDLSCs and Co-culture group) showed periodontal ligament like tissue regeneration around implanted roots compared with control groups. Positive immunohistochemical staining for periostin and bone sialoprotein further confirmed periodontal regeneration, cementogenesis, and osteogenesis in <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> groups. Immunohistochemistry for human mitochondrial antibody was used to verify the cells of human origin. Vessel-like structures were observed in periodontal compartment of transplanted <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> groups (PDLSCs-HUVECs-PDLSCs and co-culture) facilitating the successful integration of host vasculature with transplanted <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs. In summary, the results suggested that HUVECs enhanced the osteo/odontogenic potentials of PDLSCs in 3 -D <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> model with formation of rudimentary vessel-like structures in vitro. Furthermore, following the transplantation of these <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs with tooth roots into the subcutaneous space of immunodeficient mice, periodontal ligament like tissues were observed around transplanted constructs with the positive sign of cementogenesis and osteogenesis. In translational terms, current accumulated data would be a preliminary foundation for future studies and this novel 3 -D PDLSCs-HUVECs cell sheet-based approach may be potentially beneficial and thus encourage for future periodontal regenerative therapy. It is evidently proven that the use of above approach might unleash the potential beyond the stipulated and conventional frameworks of dentistry. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

For cell-sheet engineering, one major obstacle to sheet function is that cell sheets in suspension are fragile and, over time, will contract. While the role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining the structure and adhesion of cells cultured on a rigid substrate is well-characterized, a systematic examination of the role played by different components of the cytoskeleton in regulating <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> contraction and cohesion {{in the absence of a}} substrate has been lacking. Results: In this study, keratinocytes were cultured until confluent and cell sheets were generated using dispase to remove the influence of the substrate. The effects of disrupting actin, microtubules or intermediate filaments on cell-cell interactions were assessed by measuring <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> cohesion and contraction. Keratin intermediate filament disruption caused comparable effects on <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> cohesion and contraction, when compared to actin or microtubule disruption. Interfering with actomyosin contraction demonstrated that interfering with cell contraction can also diminish cell cohesion.

In the invivo study, the rats received one of three possible ACL reconstruction treatments; 1) a tendon graft wrapped in an ACL-derived CD 34 + <b>cell</b> <b>sheet,</b> 2) a tendon graft and ACL-derived CD 34 + cell injection, or 3) the control group that received just the tendon graft.

It was found that confluent aligned cell sheets could grow on uniaxially-aligned and crisscrossed nanofiber arrays with extremely low fiber densities. The porosity of the nanofiber sheets was sufficient to allow aligned linear myotube formation from differentiated myoblasts {{on both sides of}} the nanofiber sheets, in spite of single-side cell seeding. The nanofiber content of the composite cell sheets is minimized to reduce the hindrance to cell migration, cell-cell contacts, mass transport, as well as the foreign body response or inflammatory response associated with the biomaterial. Even at extremely low densities, the nanofiber component significantly enhanced the stability and mechanical properties of the composite cell sheets. In addition, the aligned nanofiber arrays imparted excellent handling properties to the composite cell sheets, which allowed easy processing into more complex, thick 3 D structures of higher hierarchy. Aligned nanofiber array-based composite <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> engineering combines several advantages of material-free <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> engineering and polymer scaffold-based <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> engineering; and it represents a new direction in aligned <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> engineering for a multitude of tissue engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{prepared}} a <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> by using collagenase treatment to digest salmon atelocollagen fibrillar gel (SAC gel) on which human periodontal ligament (HPDL) cells had been cultured. The SAC gel {{was found to}} be digested completely within 2 h at a concentration of 50 U of collagenase per mg of collagen. The SAC gel on which HPDL cells were cultured for 10 d was treated with collagenase, resulting in the formation of a detached and shrunken <b>cell</b> <b>sheet.</b> Immunostaining results showed that the cytoskeleton and fibronectin matrix level of the <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> were maintained after collagenase treatment. In addition, collagenase treatment had almost no effect on the activities of HPDL cells...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>sheet</b> {{technology}} is a new strategy in tissue engineering which could be possible to implant into the body without a scaffold. In order to get an integrated <b>cell</b> <b>sheet,</b> a light-induced method via UV 365 is used for <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> detachment from culture dishes. In this study, we investigated the possibility of cell detachment and growth efficiency on TiO 2 nanodot films with RGD immobilization on light-induced <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> technology. Mouse calvaria-derived, preosteoblastic (MC 3 T 3 -E 1) cells were cultured on TiO 2 nanodot films with (TR) or without (TN) RGD immobilization. After cells were cultured with or without 5. 5 [*]mW/cm 2 UV 365 illumination, cell morphology, cell viability, osteogenesis related RNA and protein expression, and cell detachment ability were compared, respectively. Light-induced cell detachment was possible when cells were cultured on TR samples. Also, cells cultured on TR samples showed better cell viability, alongside higher protein and RNA expression than on TN samples. This study provides a new biomaterial for light-induced cell/cell sheet harvesting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Collective {{motion of}} <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> {{plays a role}} not only in {{development}} and repair, but also in devastating diseases such as cancer. However, unlike single-cell motility, collective motion of <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> involves complex cell-cell communication during migration; therefore, its mechanism is largely unknown. To elucidate propagation of signaling transduced by cell-cell interaction, we designed a hydrogel substrate that can cause local mechanical stretching of <b>cell</b> <b>sheets.</b> Poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAAm) hydrogel is a temperature-responsive polymer gel whose volume changes isotropically in response to temperature changes below 37 °C. We designed a combined hydrogel substrate consisting of collagen-immobilized PNIPAAm as the local stimulation side and polyacrylamide (PAAm) as the non-stimulation side to assess propagation of mechanical transduction. Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells adhered to the collagen-immobilized PNIPAAm gel increased it area and were flattened as the gel swelled with temperature decrease. E-cadherin in these cells became undetectable in some domains, and actin stress fibers were more clearly observed at the cell base. In contrast, E-cadherin in cells adhered to the collagen-immobilized PAAm side was equally stained as that in cells adhered to th...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{troublesome}} complications is intraoperative or prolonged air leakage from the lung. Advances in surgical techniques, {{including the use of}} stapling devices, have minimized but not abolished such complications. Lung parenchymal defects are difficult to suture often both damages the normal lung and fails to stop the air leakage. Current methods including the use of various sealants, are ineffective in the closure of intraoperative air leaks, resulting in a increased patient morbidity, delayed removal of thoracic tubes, and prolonged hospitalization. We present the development of a novel lung air leak sealant using tissue engineered <b>cell</b> <b>sheets.</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>sheets</b> immediately and permanently seal air leaks in a dynamic function that allows for the extensive tissue contraction and expansion involved in respiration, with no postoperative recurrences. Moreover, we demonstrate that host mesothelial cells can migrate to cover the transplanted <b>cells</b> <b>sheets,</b> thereby confirming excellent biocompatibility and integration with host tissues. Finally, we show the use of skin fibroblasts as an effective autologous cell source that can be easily applied. This study shows for the first time, the development of an immediate and permanent lung air leak sealant, suitable for future clinical applications...|$|R
