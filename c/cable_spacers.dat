5000|$|Cable {{flexibility}} {{is an important}} consideration in designing a cable railing. The old UBC (Uniform Building Code) and newer ICC (IBC and IRC) [...] codes state that a 4‚Äù sphere shall not pass through any portion of a barrier on a guardrail. In a horizontal or vertical cable rail, the cables, once tensioned must be rigid enough to prevent a 4-inch sphere passing through it. Factors influencing this rigidity are: the tension of the cable, intermediate posts (or <b>cable</b> <b>spacers)</b> spacing, {{the diameter of the}} cable, top rail cap material and the cable to cable spacing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Surface {{tracking}} {{is one of}} {{the causes}} that degraded the property of <b>cable</b> <b>spacer.</b> This research investigates about the mechanical stress and surface tracking performance of 22 kV <b>cable</b> <b>spacer.</b> Sample were tested according to the surface tracking under IEC 60587 standard under modified condition by and addition of the mechanical weight on the surface of pure epoxy resin sample. The mechanical load use were 0 kg and increase from 5 kg until 15 kg. The results showed that mechanical stress has affected the surface degradation of an insulation performance when the mechanical load is increased combined with high electrical field...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an approximate method for calculation of electrodynamic resistance parameters of a flexible bus-bar with bundled phases. Comparison of the approximate calculation results {{with the computer}} calculations using a FAZA software tool has been given in the paper. An evaluation of permissible aerial <b>cable</b> <b>spacer</b> compression forces for designed modern standard distribution substations of 330 and 550 kV has been provided in the paper. The paper proposes an algorithm for determination of dynamics parameters in a bundled phase with due account of influence pertaining to viscoelastic characteristics of damping spacers. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{identical}} single aperture 1 -metre superconducting dipoles {{have been}} built in collaboration with HMA Power Systems and tested at CERN. The 87. 8 mm aperture magnets feature a single layer coil wound using LHC main dipole outer layer <b>cable,</b> phenolic <b>spacer</b> type collars, and a keyed two part structural iron yoke. The magnets are designed as models of the D 1 separation dipole in the LHC experimental insertions, whose nominal field is 4. 5 T at 4. 5 K. In this report we present the test results of the two magnet at 4. 3 K and 1. 9 K. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- An {{excellent}} {{option to}} the utilities {{has been the}} utilisation of covered cable fixed to the insulator or to the line spacer. However, distribution lines located near the coast are often exposed to marine pollution and then the superficial resistance of the polymeric material can be reduced and leakage current can flow on the polymeric surface. This paper shows the results of investigation considering covered <b>cable</b> and line <b>spacers.</b> By testing the polymeric material, the behaviour of the leakage current {{and the evolution of}} degradation were analysed, aiming the on-line monitoring of the leakage current of line spacers...|$|R
40|$|Effects of ice-shedding-induced <b>cable</b> {{vibration}} on <b>spacer</b> dampers are {{studied by}} applying a dynamic model. The model {{is based on}} the authors' recent development, which is improved here by applying spacer properties obtained experimentally. The model simulates cable vibration and bundle rotation at mid-span, where the spacer is attached to the cables, as well as the spacer deformation and forces acting on the spacer during the vibration of twin, triple and quad conductor bundles. Ice accumulation on a spacer may change the latter's elastic and damping properties, whose influence on the vibration is considered in the model together with the effect of varying cable properties. Simulation results show how the risk of bundle collapse and the load on the spacer is reduced when the number of subconductors in the bundle is increased. The model also predicts that the most important property which can reduce forces acting on the spacer during vibration is spacer damping, whereas the bundle rotation is affected to the greatest extent by cable damping...|$|R
40|$|Apparatus for {{sensing the}} {{magnitude}} of a load on a cable as the cable is employed to support the load includes a beam structure clamped to the cable so that a length of the cable lies along the beam structure. A spacer associated with the beam structure forces a slight curvature in {{a portion of the}} length of cable under a cable no-load condition so that the portion of the length of cable is spaced from the beam structure to define a cable curved portion. A strain gauge circuit including strain gauges is secured to the beam structure by welding. As the cable is employed to support a load the load causes the cable curved portion to exert a force normal to the <b>cable</b> through the <b>spacer</b> and on the beam structure to deform the beam structure as the cable curved portion attempts to straighten under the load. As this deformation takes place, the resistance of the strain gauges is set to a value proportional to {{the magnitude of}} the normal strain on the beam structure during such deformation. The magnitude of the normal strain is manipulated in a control device to generate a value equal to the magnitude or weight of the load supported by the cable...|$|R
