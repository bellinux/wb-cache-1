50|$|The social {{inclusion}} OMC, by contrast, was not {{directly linked to}} the EMU debate. Social inclusion was for many years a controversial topic to address at the European level due to the subsidiarity concept. In 1999 the Commission finally adopted a communication for a concerted strategy on social protection, proposing a Social Protection Committee which was made official in the Nice Treaty. Said committee {{was responsible for the}} initial standard setting exercise. Next, each member state was asked to benchmark its situation by producing a two year national action plan (NAP or NAPincl), presenting national-level strategies for improving the situation. These were made available in June 2001. 18 months later the EU released a joint report on {{social inclusion}} where the member state’s approaches were compared and contrasted and recommendations were given. While the NAPs form a first level of action, the <b>Community</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> to combat poverty and social exclusion, which aims to improve cooperation between the member states, can be considered the second level of action.|$|E

40|$|With the {{improving}} economical {{situation and}} growing population {{standard of living}} comes the increase of the waste amount in many European cities. This tendency is particularly clearly reflected by growing municipal waste generation rate. In 1993, the 5 th European <b>Community</b> Environment <b>Action</b> <b>Programme,</b> where the targets and principles are set, a target of stabilising municipal waste generation at the 1985 level of 300 kg/capita/annum by 2000 was set. However, the attempt to meet this target was unsuccessful. Almost all countries exceeded the established rate by 75 - 100 %. The 6 th <b>Community</b> Environment <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> discarded utopian objective to reduce waste generation rates. This was not defined in quantitative manner anymore. The initial and essential step in the waste management system planning is waste collection (in this work equivalent to waste generation) prognosis. However, constantly changing situation in the waste management sector strongly impacts waste generation rates (which are usually equating to collection rates) and this makes the forecasting more difficult. Although municipal waste forecasts need isn‘t dealt with legislation, but the knowledge of future waste amounts {{is essential for the}} adoption of important strategic goals, for making policy decisions and for determining the waste management tasks on the level of European Union and Republic of Lithuania.

40|$|AIMS - The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify factors that either promote or hinder implementation of a multicomponent Responsible Beverage Service programme in Swedish municipalities. DESIGN - Forty semi-structured interviews were conducted in six municipalities and directed content analysis, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), was performed. RESULTS - The CFIR framework was useful as an underlying theoretical model in this study. Importance of the following factors, described in the five domains of CFIR, was empirically supported in this study: local needs, evidence strength and advantages of the intervention, costs and available resources, clear goals, evaluation and feedback, access to knowledge and information, clear role definitions and cooperation, and enthusiastic key persons with high confidence in the effectiveness of the intervention. Hindering factors listed by the informants were lack of enthusiasm and opportunities to specialise, low degree of self-efficacy, unengaged decision-makers, complexities of the programme, and a top-down approach. CONCLUSIONS - This study indicates that previously identified factors shown to promote and hinder implementation processes are also valid in the context of multicomponent <b>community</b> <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> like RBS. Suggestions on how to elude some of the hindering factors are proposed, e. g. to develop long-time financial plans, to provide better information about the RBS program in full, and to stress the importance of collaboration between representatives from the municipalities, police authorities and owners of on-licenced premises...|$|R

40|$|This chapter will {{describe}} {{and try to}} understand the development of the higher education policy of the European Union from the perspective of national sovereignty versus Europeanisation. The focus will be on polities and programmes that specifically regard the educational function of higher education institutions (student Inobility, language proficiency, international co-operation) or only partly bear upon this educational function (higher education — industry co-operation, R&D programmes [...] .). This chapter comprises three parts, each corresponding to a particular phase in the development of EU higher education policy, and each providing an overview of the EU education programmes of the period under attention. The first phase began with the first meeting of the Ministers of Education of the EGcountries in 1971. After subsequent meetings, a framework agreement was reached on an <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> in the field of education (1976). Established and executed in what has been termed the `dark ages' of European integration (Keohane and Hoffman, 1991), the programme was scarcely more than a symbolic starting point for higher education co-operation in Europe. The second phase in the EU higher education policy (1983 - 1992) was in itiated by both legal (lawsuits before the European Court of Justice) and political developments (the Solemn Declaration on European Union, the Single European Act). These pointed to a (gradual and contested) shift in interpretation vis-à-vis the authority of the European Community in the field of education, making possible incentive-driven <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> at community-level (COMETT, ERASMUS). The Treaty on European Union (1992), also known as Treaty of Maastricht, marks the beginning of the third period. The acquis communautaire in the field of (higher) education, i. e. the whole of acquired rights and obligations, was formally confirmed, leading to a rationalisation, reorganisation, and elaboration of the <b>community</b> <b>action</b> <b>programmes.</b> At the same time, however, the authority of the EU in relationship with the member states was limited and strictly defined. status: publishe...|$|R

The European Commission identified several aspects of the tax systems which had a negative effect on married women. Among the more relevant were some sensitive points such as the aggregation of incomes in the family unit, the a priori transfer of reductions and deductions to the husband, the impossibility that each spouse declare his or her own income, and the maintenance of the joint and several responsibility of the spouses.

Since {{the latter half of}} the 1980 s, the European Community has been supporting IT training, principally via COMETT (<b>Community</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> in Education and Training for Technology) and the ESPRIT (European Strategic Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology) VLSI Design Training Action. The present study aims to provide an overview of skills availability in the European IT industry, and to assess the effectiveness of the European Community's efforts to provide a greater supply of IT manpower.

The overall aim of Learning from Families is to address government policies and programmes {{from the point of}} view of families of young children themselves, in order to build social environments that enable low income families out of their situation. Part I outlines the challenges facing policy makers, the rationale for the main policies to promote social inclusion and what is thought to contribute to positive and less positive outcomes for families. Policies and practices that seek to help families with children under five years of age are mapped. Part II focuses on documenting families’ experiences and encounters at the receiving end of policies, to understand the barriers to the use of services and full participation in society. In Ireland those parenting alone are the focus of study. Thematic analysis was employed drawing on the families’ experiences with regard to identified dimensions of social exclusion (income and benefits; resources, employment and training, social network, public services, and the subjective nature of social exclusion); the impact of their situation on their children; risk and protective factors, the process into and out of social exclusion and assessment of interventions.

40|$|A {{new piece}} of European legislation, the Ecodesign Directive (2009 / 125 /EC) came into effect on 20 November 2009 and is to be {{implemented}} by Member States by November 20, 2010. This covers energy-using products under an earlier directive (the Energy using Products Directive) but also extends the range of products covered to include those which are related to energy use {{even if they do}} not actually use energy directly such as construction materials and fittings. So it covers 'any goods having an impact on energy consumption during use'. A product list is to be developed by the European Commission. Reduction in energy consumption is posited in the European Climate Change Programme (European Commission, 2006) and climate change is a priority in the Sixth Community Environment Programme (Decision No 1600 / 2002 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council). Climate change also now appears as an objective of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty. Ecodesign is a key element of the European Commission's Integrated Product Policy and appears in the Commission Communication of 18 June 2003 'Integrated Product Policy - Building on Environmental Life Cycle Thinking'. It is also a key innovative aspect appearing in the Sixth <b>Community</b> Environment <b>Action</b> <b>Programme.</b> Building legislation on a life cycle approach is radical and novel given that most environmental impacts are regulated on a vertical basis where legislation is linked to the process rather than the product.

Pupils in need of particular support get {{to be involved in}} an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> – the school needs to provide any particular support a pupil needs. However, the individual development plan does not substitute the <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> Thus an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> as well as an individual development plan will be provided to students in need of particular support. The individual development plan follows the pupil throughout the entire education, regardless of whether its content changes, whilst the <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> pertains to a limited period of time. Pupils that are not in need of particular support are not likely to need to set goals for themselves in addition to those already set outside of school. An <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is primarily concerned with affecting the conditions under which the pupils carry out their work.   The results of my study indicate that the individual development plan is yet another duty on part of the teachers, but with exceptionally scarce repayment. According to teachers at the school explored, the individual development plan generates little or no progress for pupils already involved in an <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> A thoroughly crafted <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is sufficient, according to teachers participating in the study. A pupil not in need of particular support will not need the individual development plan either, according to the teachers – it would merely be another paper to look at during development talks, but it would not benefit the pupil or the teacher...|$|R
