5000|$|In the United States, {{reimbursement}} for many healthcare services {{is based upon}} the extent to which specific work by healthcare providers is documented in the patient's medical record. Enforcement authorities in the United States have become concerned that functionality available in many electronic health records, especially copy-and-paste, may enable fraudulent <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> The authorities are concerned that healthcare providers may easily use these systems to create documentation of medical care that did not actually occur.These concerns came to the forefront in 2012, in a joint letter from the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to the American hospital community. [...] The American Hospital Association responded, focusing on the need for clear guidance from the government regarding permissible and prohibited conduct using electronic health records. [...] In a December 2013 audit report, the U.S. HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued an audit report reiterating that vulnerabilities continue to exist in the operation of electronic health records.

5000|$|The fifth <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> was {{in regard}} to {{payments}} made [...] "during the fiscal years 1899 to 1907," [...] which totaled $864,702.58.

Though the Court found the government did not act improperly by making payment to the treasurer (as the provision did not stipulate per capita distribution), the Court stated it could still be found liable if it violated its fiduciary duty in the manner discussed above. It was documented that the Commission of the Five Civilized Tribes notified Congress and the Secretary of the Interior of the rampant corruption throughout tribal governments before the payments were made to the Seminole treasurer. More pointedly, the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs were informed in January 1898 of [...] "complaints of misgovernment, venality, and fraudulent conduct on the part of Seminole leaders." ...|$|R

50|$|SNOMED CT and ICD are {{designed}} for different purposes and each {{should be used for}} the purposes for which they were designed. As a core terminology for the EHR, SNOMED CT provides a common language that enables a consistent language that enables a consistent way of capturing, sharing, and aggregating health data across specialties and sites of care. It is highly detailed terminology designed for input not reporting. Classification systems such as ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, and ICD-10-PCS group together similar diseases and procedures and organise related entities for easy retrieval. They are typically used for external reporting requirements or other uses where data aggregation is advantageous, such as measuring the quality of care monitoring resource utilisation, or processing <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> SNOMED is clinically-based, documents whatever is needed for patient care and has better clinical coverage than ICD. ICD’s focus is statistical with less common diseases get lumped together in “catch-all” categories, which result in loss of information. SNOMED CT is used directly by healthcare providers during the process of care, whereas ICD is used by coding professionals after the episode of care. SNOMED CT has multiple hierarchy, whereas there is single hierarchy for ICD. SNOMED CT concepts are defined logically by their attributes, whereas only textual rules and definitions in ICD.|$|E
5000|$|The Seminole Nation's <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> {{related to}} {{language}} {{contained in the}} Treaties of 1856 and 1866 and to various agreements and acts of Congress. The Nation's claims were divided into five separate items. The Court dismissed the first claim for reimbursement, finding the Treaty of March 21, 1866 released the government of its obligation to pay the outstanding balance owed under the Treaty of August 7, 1856. The third claim for reimbursement was disallowed upon {{the finding that the}} annual interest from the trust fund established under the Treaty of 1866 was, in fact, directed to its designated purpose (support of local schools). The fourth claim is also in reference to the Treaty of 1866, which provided additionally that the Government construct, [...] "at an expense not exceeding ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, suitable agency buildings' on the Seminole reservation." [...] The Court of Claims found that $10,000 was expended to fulfill this treaty obligation in 1872, and an agency building was erected on the reservation in 1873. Seminole Nation did not claim that the building was unsuitable and, furthermore, the treaty required the Government to erect a suitable building not in excess of $10,000. The Government's obligation was fulfilled and the fourth claim was disallowed.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, FSAs (the {{oldest of}} these accounts) were {{accessed}} only through <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> after incurring, and often paying, an out-of-pocket expense; this often happens after the funds {{have already been}} deducted from the employee's paycheck. (FSAs are usually funded by payroll deduction.) The only method permitted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to avoid this [...] "double-dipping" [...] for medical FSAs and HRAs is through accurate and auditable reporting on the tax return. Statements on the debit card that say [...] "for medical uses only" [...] are invalid for several reasons: (1) The merchant and issuing banks {{have no way of}} quickly determining whether the entire purchase qualifies for the customer's type of tax benefit; (2) the customer also has no quick way of knowing; often has mixed purchases by necessity or convenience; and can easily make mistakes; (3) extra contractual clauses between the customer and issuing bank would cross-over into the payment processing standards, creating additional confusion (for example if a customer was penalized for accidentally purchasing a non-qualifying item, it would undercut the potential savings advantages of the account). Therefore, using the card exclusively for qualifying purchases may be convenient for the customer, but {{it has nothing to do}} with how the card can actually be used. If the bank rejects a transaction, for instance, because it is not at a recognized drug store, then it would be causing harm and confusion to the cardholder. In the United States, not all medical service or supply stores are capable of providing the correct information so an FSA debit card issuer can honor every transaction-if rejected or documentation is not deemed enough to satisfy regulations, cardholders may have to send in forms manually.|$|E
25|$|Under the Northern Rhodesian settlement, {{the company}} dropped its <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of a £l.6 million {{administrative}} deficit: in return the British Government {{agreed to give}} the BSAC half the net revenue from certain rents and land sales and recognised (or appeared to recognise) the company {{as the owner of}} Northern Rhodesia's mineral rights in perpetuity. The British Government could have bought out these rights by paying BSAC £l.6 million to meet its reimbursement claim, but declined to make the money available. This agreement was criticised then and later time by both African and European inhabitants of the territory. The elected unofficial members of the Legislative Council pressed for the royalties issue to be referred to the Privy Council, as the BSAC’s title to unalienated land in Southern Rhodesia had been. Instead, for forty years up to Zambian independence, successive British Governments recognised the BSAC as owner of all underground minerals in Northern Rhodesia, and compelled anyone mining them to pay royalties to the company.|$|R
50|$|A mystery {{surrounds}} the original {{stained glass windows}} of the church. It is believed that as Japanese troops advanced on Singapore, the garrison chaplain had the windows removed and packed away for safekeeping. They were never seen again. As the chaplain did not survive the Occupation, {{no one knows where}} the windows are today - whether buried somewhere on Singapore soil, gathering dust in a cellar in England or in pieces {{at the bottom of the}} sea. Because of the uncertainty over the fate of the windows, the War Damages Commission turned down the church's <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> In 1952, the church committee began looking into replacements for the missing windows. The design and installation of the new windows began in 1952 and were finally unveiled in 1955.

40|$|<b>Claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> {{of child}} support, the {{reversal}} of property settlements and compensation can arise when misattributed paternity is discovered. The ethical justifications for such claims seem {{to be related to}} the financial cost of bringing up children, the absence of choice about taking on these expenses, the hard work involved in child rearing, the emotional attachments that are formed with children, the obligation of women to make truthful claims about paternity, and the deception involved in infidelity. In this paper it is argued that there should not be compensation for infidelity and that reimbursement is appropriate where the claimant has made child support payments but has not taken on the social role of father. Where the claimant’s behaviour suggests a social view of fatherhood, on the other hand, claims for compensation are less coherent. Where the genetic model of fatherhood dominates, the ‘‘other’ ’ man (the woman’s lover and progenitor of the children) might also have a claim for the loss of the benefits of fatherhood. It is concluded that <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> and compensation in cases of misattributed paternity produce the same distorted and thin view of what it means to be a father that paternity testing assumes, and underscores a trend that is not in the interests of children...|$|E
