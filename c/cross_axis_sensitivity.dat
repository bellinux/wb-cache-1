The accelerometer consists of two proof masses, four supporting hinges, two anchors, and a vibrating triple beam, which is clamped at both ends to the two proof masses. LPCVD silicon rich nitride is chosen as the resonant triple beam material, and parameter optimization of the triple-beam structure has been performed.

40|$|AbstractStructural Health Monitoring (SHM) using non {{destructive}} testing generally involves measurement of shift in natural frequency of the monitored structure. Vibration sensors {{play a crucial role}} in such SHM systems and the present day SHM systems use commercially available off the shelf MEMS accelerometers. In this work, an attempt has been made to design a MEMS accelerometer that is specifically intended for concrete SHM applications. This paper presents the design methodology of a MEMS silicon piezoresistive single axis accelerometer with the seismic mass (m) suspended by four symmetrical cantilever beams. The simulation and analysis results using CoventorWare MEMS design tool show that this newly designed accelerometer is capable of measuring vibrations up to 2 g. The modal analysis results indicate that the accelerometers considered for this analysis (Device-A, Device-B, Device-C) using CoventorWare simulation tool has its first mode natural frequency of 1040 Hz and 946 Hz respectively against the specified 900 Hz. The piezoresistive sensitivity of Device-A (with larger mass and optimum stiffness) is found to be the maximum thus demonstrates that the beam length and half side length of the mass should lie in the region (L<a). Further it has been shown that flexural beams placement as chosen in the Device-A is the best choice for achieving maximum sensitivity and desirable natural frequency with reasonably reduced <b>cross</b> <b>axis</b> <b>sensitivity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Using micro-machined silicon technology, an ultra-sensitive {{miniature}} acce.,rometer can {{be constructed}} which meets the requirements for microgravity experiments in the space environment. Such an accelerometer will have a full scale sensitivity of 1 C 2 g a resolution of lC 8 g, low <b>cross</b> <b>axis</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and low temperature sensitivity. Mass of the device is approximately five grams and its footprint is 2 cm x 2 cm. Innovative features of the accelerometer, which are patented, are: electrostatic caging to withstand handling shock up to 150 g, in-situ calibration, in situ performance characterization, and both static and dynamic compensation. The transducer operates on a force balance principle wherein the displacement of the proof mass is monitored by measuring tunneling electron current flow between a conductive tip, and a fixed platen. The four major parts of the accelerometer are tip die, incorporating the tunneling tip and four field plates for controlling pitch and roll of the proof mass; two proof mass dies, attached to the surrounding frame by sets of four leg" springs; and a force plate die. The four parts are fuse-bonded into a complete assembly. External electrical connections are made at bond pads on the front surface of the force plate die.

40|$|The work {{reported}} here describes {{a method for}} estimating angular velocity and angular acceleration of a body using clusters of seven triaxial linear acceleration measurements. Four of the triaxial sensors are fixed to the body while three of the sensors vibrate at a constant frequency {{with respect to the}} body. Unlike other existing solutions to this problem, the method described here does not require integration and also properly resolves the algebraic sign of the angular rates. After describing the basic method, the paper conducts an error analysis to identify critical design parameters of this sensor concept. The basic algorithm is shown to work well even in the presence of sensor noise, bias and <b>cross</b> <b>axis</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Practical issues such as the required number of sensors, sensor arrangement, data fusion, and quantization errors are addressed.

40|$|Usually micro {{machined}} acceleration sensors are silicon-based. There are two conspicuous {{advantages of}} employing silicon technology: firstly, the mechanical {{element of the}} sensor can be integrated with the electronics required for signal processing; secondly, silicon-based micromachining technologies are capable of reducing {{the size of a}} sensor device to the micrometer. Nowadays, integrating electronics into polymer substrates has been realized, which means that polymer devices in future could be integrated with electronics as well. Therefore, the feasibility of fabricating acceleration sensors from polymer is investigated in this dissertation. The fabrication of micro systems from polymer is expected to be even more economic than from silicon. Since polymers tend to creep and their properties are a strong function of temperature, polymer components appear to be not suitable functional elements in a sensor. Accordingly, two methods were proposed to avoid this disadvantage: on the one hand, the principles of thermal flow sensors can be adopted to design acceleration sensors, which apply thermal components instead of a proof mass and a suspending system as the sensing elements; on the other hand, applying a closed feedback loop balancing the inertial force such, that the dependence on mechanical properties and temperature of the sensing element is limited significantly. For the thermal method, two designs, an anemometer and a calorimeter, were investigated and fabricated by micro milling and micromachining. Compared with the anemometric design, the calorimetric sensor has three outstanding advantages, such as higher sensitivity, a linear characteristic curve and direction sensing capability, which make it a good choice for an alternative acceleration sensor. In the experiments, the calorimeter achieved a sensitivity of 0. 5 V/(m/s²) when the power of the heater is 0. 2 W. For the closed loop method three types of driving modes, capacitive, thermo-pneumatic, and electromagnetic, were proposed and tested. In the research, the capacitive and thermo-pneumatic modes showed only theoretical feasibility, but no working sample could be realized due to the available equipments. The magnetic mode successfully fulfilled its function. In this case the acceleration is balanced by an electromagnetic force of a coil in the field of permanent magnets and the electrical current necessary for balancing {{is a measure of the}} acceleration. Both micromachining and mechanical manufacturing processes, such as sputtering, photolithography, and ultrasonic hot embossing were employed in the fabrication of the magnetic closed loop acceleration sensor. The sensor was assembled from a polyimide membrane with conductor paths from gold patterned by photolithography and etching, a frame manufactured by ultrasonic hot embossing, and permanent magnets fixed to the frame. Except the conductor path and permanent magnets all components are made of polymers on a planar substrate, and then the frame is kinked forming the desired three-dimensional structure. In tests, a sensitivity of 0. 46 V/(m/s²) was achieve, and the <b>cross</b> <b>axis</b> <b>sensitivity</b> error was less than 3 %...|$|E

40|$|A <b>cross</b> <b>axis</b> {{wind turbine}} is disclosed, which {{comprises}} of <b>cross</b> <b>axis</b> arrangement. The wind turbine {{consists of three}} vertical blades and six horizontal blades arranged in <b>cross</b> <b>axis</b> orientation. The six horizontal blades serve as the radial arms that link the three vertical blades and the hubs through connectors to form the <b>cross</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbine (CAWT). Three horizontal axis blades that make up as the upper radial arm connects the top part of the vertical blades to the hub through the top connectors. The other three horizontal axis blades that make up as the lower radial arm connects the bottom part of the vertical axis blades to the hub through the bottom connectors. To avoid air flow blockage or interference between the top radial arm and the bottom radial arm, the horizontal axis blade radial arm at the top part of the turbine is offset at an angle of 30 Â° {{with respect to the}} bottom radial arm. In the present invention, the air stream can be channeled {{from the bottom of the}} turbine through the bottom radial arm, and the air streams that did not interact with the bottom radial arm will eventually interact with the top radial arm. The air streams channeled from the bottom of the wind turbine and moving upwards will interact with the horizontal blades and this will eventually improve the self-starting capability of the CAWT.
