The introductory part presents the legal basis <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> plan and its definition under the Regulations of Land Survey Maps and Topographic Key. The content <b>of</b> the <b>geodetic</b> plan and description <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> and surveying information sources which are the graphical part <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> plan are introduced in the second part. This part also describes the types of land survey plans, as they are required under applicable law. The central part of the thesis is to estimate the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> plan. The introductory chapter describes the work of estimating the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> works, but the accuracy assessment resources that are used in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> plans are described in the second part.

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} {{reliability}} and trust <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> structure monitoring are related with new principles of leveling network construction, their testing and mathematical processing. Two indices, point density and errors in their altitude location, {{have been considered}} recently as the main characteristics <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> construction quality used for geodetic monitoring of  engineering object settlements. As it is an evitable distortion of the measuring data {{in the process of}} its accumulation and processing due to influence of additional factors (rough and systematic measurement errors, original data errors and so on), nowadays while evaluating the quality <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> constructions one more important characteristic is {{to be taken into account}} that is reliability <b>of</b> the <b>geodetic</b> construction. The majority <b>of</b> standard <b>geodetic</b> construction schemes do not have a sufficient reliability rate for definitive determination of construction settlements in any measuring cycle.

40|$|Raising of problem. Reliable results <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> {{monitoring}} {{depends on}} several factors. One {{of the main}} factors is reliability <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> points taken as the source {{for the creation of}} geomonitoring network. According to the current normative documents for the creation of horizontal and vertical geodetic networks, the stability <b>of</b> the <b>geodetic</b> points should be determined by the results of periodic monitoring of their coordinates. As practice shows this is not enough, because geodetic reference points simultaneously offset with the monitoring object. Therefore, the assessment of source reliability and systematic control of the base points of geomonitoring network are important. Purpose. To increase the reliability <b>of</b> results <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> monitoring which based on the use <b>of</b> stable reference <b>geodetic</b> points. To develop probabilistic intervals of errors of determination <b>of</b> coordinates <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> points <b>of</b> various classes based on which we can judge their offsets in the selection <b>of</b> a stable <b>geodetic</b> points. Conclusion. By sampling stable reference geodetic points on the interval estimates of the errors of the coordinates with a given level of reliability and defining the mode of their control, you can create a reliable geodetic monitoring network. Using this network for <b>geodetic</b> monitoring <b>of</b> engineering facilities will allow us to obtain reliable, valid observation results...|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{characteristics}} of deformation of a body or a figure represented by discrete points <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> network. In each point <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> network kinematic quantities are considered normal strain, shear strain, and rotation. They are computed from strain and rotation tensors represented by displacement gradient matrix {{on the basis of}} known point displacement vector. Deformation analysis requires the appropriate treatment of kinematic quantities. Thus statistical properties of each quantity in a single point <b>of</b> <b>geodetic</b> network have to be known. Empirical results have shown that statistical properties are strongly related to the orientation in single point and local geometry <b>of</b> the <b>geodetic</b> network. Based on the known probability distribution of kinematic quantities the confidence areas for each quantity in a certain point can be defined. Based on this we can carry out appropriate statistical testing and decide whether the deformation of network in each point is statistically significant or not. On the other hand, we are able to ascertain the quality of the geometry <b>of</b> the <b>geodetic</b> network. The known characteristics of the probability distributions of two strain parameters and rotation in each point can serve as useful tools in the procedures of optimizing the geometry <b>of</b> the <b>geodetic</b> networks...|$|R
