5000|$|The MFC {{was one of}} {{only two}} {{companies}} licensed under the Film Licensed Investment Company Act 1998. This was a scheme proposed by David Gonski in his 1997 Review of Commonwealth Assistance to the Film Industry. Investors received 100 per cent tax concessions for buying shares in a Film Licensed Investment Company (FLIC), which, in turn, invested in qualifying Australian programs. The goal was to spread investors' risk across a slate of productions instead of single projects. The other licence was granted to Content Capital Ltd. Each company could raise up to $20 million in capital over two financial years, ending June 2000. [...] The Federal Minister for the Arts, Peter McGauran, said that:Both companies achieve a balance between commercial and cultural imperatives, through the people associated with the companies, and in the philosophies guiding their business plans. Content Capital's strengths lie in its film industry expertise and experience, and in its commitment to development of emerging and existing talent. Macquarie Film Corporation's strengths are in the substantial capital and corporate structure supporting the company and its portfolio approach to investment. The variation in approach, and the equal division of <b>concessional</b> <b>capital</b> between these two companies, will help in the evaluation of the scheme and provide an opportunity to assess different operating models.Charles Wheeler, an executive director of Macquarie Bank and director of the MFC said the company expected the venture to make pre-tax returns of 20 to 25 per cent and hoped to eventually be able to finance films offshore:We are hoping to become {{a major player in the}} finance entertainment industry in Australia and this is perhaps the start of more activity in this area.. It's a huge potential industry and there's virtually no limit to the amount of money one could invest in film, provided you have a global focus... We think there is a formula by which you can make money from film, but to do that you have to focus on commercial productions, and the more commercial they are, the better... It's the first time this idea has been tried in Australia, so to make it attractive to investors it's important there's some tax advantage. But we are hopeful that by the end of this pilot scheme we will have sufficient evidence to demonstrate ... that film is a very viable investment and they don't need the incentives.Macquarie also created another company, Macquarie Filmed Investments, to manage MFC's investments and oversee strategy in return for a management fee.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{taxation}} incentives to encourage philanthropy and environmental conservation by private landowners have applied in jurisdictions {{such as the}} United States and Canada for many years. This article examines the introduction of tax incentives under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) to {{encourage the use of}} conservation covenants by private landowners to provide permanent protection to the environment in Australia. The amendments, which apply to certain types of conservation covenants entered into on or after 1 July 2002, provide for income tax deductions and <b>concessional</b> <b>capital</b> gains tax treatment where a qualifying conservation covenant is created. The legal and policy background to the introduction of the tax concessions in Australia is outlined and the requirements of the relevant legislative provisions discussed. The article raises a number of issues concerning the potential effectiveness of such incentives to facilitate private conservation of biodiversity. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The Greens are {{replacing}} Labor as the conservatives’ bete noire, says John Quiggin. IN AN election campaign, it’s usual to see vigorous negative campaigning, {{with each}} side combing the other’s policy statements for clauses {{that can be}} attacked, if necessary, {{with the aid of}} misquotation and creative interpretation. What’s surprising in the current campaign is that the conservative attack seems to be directed primarily at the Greens rather than Labor. The scale of the attack on the Greens has been impressive, including repeated statements from the prime minister and deputy prime minister, hostile editorials in the Murdoch press, denunciations from right-wing think tanks and a string of vitriolic opinion pieces. Members of the government have accused the Greens of being Nazis and communists, kooks and more. Opinion pieces have referred to the Greens as revolutionaries, anarcho-syndicalists and so on. The extremism of this rhetoric is surprising given that in the late 1990 s, a Tasmanian Liberal minority government held office for two years, relying throughout its term on Greens support. Labor did the same thing in the late 1980 s. These were uneasy alliances and both broke down in the end. But if the Greens were the totalitarian fruitcakes described in the recent attacks, a minority government relying on their support could not have lasted two weeks, let alone two years. Surely it ought to be possible to point to numerous concrete instances of policy extremism rather than relying on a scare campaign? What is the factual basis for all these scares? Much of it is pure invention or misrepresentation. The Greens have been accused of wanting to make vegetarianism and cycling compulsory and of wishing to force farmers off their land. When pushed to justify these claims, critics point to general statements about the desirability of sustainable land use or increasing the share of commuter trips undertaken by bicycles. Such statements {{can be found in the}} publications and policy statements of state and federal governments of both parties. In other cases, the Greens are being attacked for policies that command the support of most experts. For example, the Greens propose to restore the capital gains tax system introduced by the Hawke-Keating Labor governments. The Productivity Commission, scarcely a hotbed of left-wing activism, recently identified the <b>concessional</b> <b>capital</b> gains tax system introduced by the government as one of the factors contributing to the unsustainable boom in housing prices and the decline in home affordability. The cut was introduced on the basis of spurious arguments during the dotcom boom and has been deplored by many economists. Far from being irrationalist kooks, the Greens are defending rational, evidence-based policy against populism and pork-barrelling. What is really puzzling, though, is the political motivation for such an all-out attack. If people are scared away from voting Greens, they will presumably return to the major party that would otherwise have got their second preference. In most cases, there will be no effect on the final outcome. There have been some ineffectual efforts to paint Mark Latham as the captive of the Greens on his left. But on the whole, the demonisation of the Greens only reveals the extent to which Labor has become a centrist party. It has been suggested that the strategy is focused on the Senate. But given that there are 18 long-term government senators and four Democrats, the Greens could hold the Senate balance of power in the next parliament only in the event of an electoral disaster for the coalition or a merger with the Democrats. The Greens will probably hold the balance of power after 2007, but it’s hard to imagine that this prospect is exercising the minds of coalition strategists right now. The Greens’ only real chance of exercising significant power is that they might win some inner-city seats from Labor. Given a hung parliament, they could then form the support base for a minority Labor government. As Tasmanian experience has shown, this would not be a disaster. In any case, it is entirely within the capacity of the Liberal Party to preclude such an outcome. As long as Liberal preferences go to Labor ahead of the Greens, no Greens candidate can win a lower-house seat. If the government believes its own rhetoric, it would be utterly irresponsible, and even immoral, to give preference to the Greens. But the Liberals have done so in the past and will probably do so again this time.

The public finances deteriorated in 2002, reflecting a combination of expenditure overruns and a drop in non-oil revenue collection.

40|$|International audienceIntroducing {{a carbon}} tax is difficult, partly because it {{suggests}} that current generations have to make sacrifices {{for the benefit of}} future generations. However, the climate change externality could be corrected without such a sacrifice. It is possible to set a carbon value, and use it to create 'carbon certificates' that can be accepted as part of commercial banks' legal reserves. These certificates can be distributed to low-carbon projects, and be exchanged by investors against <b>concessional</b> loans, reducing <b>capital</b> costs for low-carbon projects. As the issuance of carbon certificates would increase the quantity of money, it will either lead to accelerated inflation or induce the Central Bank to raise interest rates. Low-carbon projects will thus have access to cheaper loans at the expense of either 'regular' investors (in case of higher interest rates) or of lenders and depositors (in case of accelerated inflation). Within this scheme, mitigation expenditures are compensated by a reduction in regular investments, so that immediate consumption is maintained. It uses future generation wealth to pay for a hedge against climate change. This framework is not as efficient as {{a carbon tax}} but is politically easier to implement and represents an interesting step in the trajectory towards a low-carbon economy...|$|R

40|$|Reform {{should not}} focus on {{marginal}} rates for higher earners, argues John Quiggin THE CALL for tax reform issued by Reserve Bank governor Ian Macfarlane in his recent appearance before a House of Representatives committee is of interest as much {{for what he did}} not mention as for what he did. Macfarlane identified as major problems the distortions that promote speculative investment in housing, and the high effective marginal tax rates faced by low-income earners. He did not mention the top marginal rate of income tax for the very good reason that reductions in the top rate are a low priority on any serious agenda for tax reform. The absence of a substantive case for a reduction in the top marginal rate is reflected in the frequency with which spurious arguments are advanced. It has regularly been asserted, for example, that bracket creep {{over the past couple of}} decades has lowered the point at which the top marginal rate applies, so that middle-income earners now pay the top rate. This assertion is true only in the trivial sense that the abolition of the 66 per cent top bracket in the 1980 s meant that 47 per cent became the top marginal rate. The point at which the 47 per cent rate cuts in has barely changed, relative to average earnings, in 30 years. The income tax scale is less steeply progressive than it was in the past, not more. As observed recently by Peter Saunders, the big change that has taken place is the failure to adjust the minimum threshold in line with increases in prices and incomes. An even more important negative change has been <b>concessional</b> treatment of <b>capital</b> gains, introduced at the height of the dotcom mania in 1999. Far from encouraging productive investment, this measure has fuelled the growth in speculative housing investment deplored by Macfarlane. Then there are comparisons between the top marginal tax rate for individuals and the company income tax rate. Such comparisons are misconceived since, under dividend imputation, company tax payments are fully offset by imputation credits when income is distributed. The tax treatment of companies and trusts opens up all sorts of opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, but most of these opportunities would exist even if company and personal tax rates were aligned. Finally there is the claim that Australia has higher marginal tax rates, cutting in at lower multiples of average earnings, than other developed countries. This claim got a run in the latest OECD report on the Australian economy. However, a comparison of the summary of the report with the content of the main body suggests that the OECD position reflected pressure from the Australian Treasury, or perhaps the Treasurer’s office, as much as its own analysis. The OECD’s own figures belie claims that Australia is an outlier. Of the 30 OECD countries listed in the report, 13 have top marginal tax rates (including social security taxes) in the range 45 per cent to 50 per cent, eight above this range and nine below it. Similarly, in terms of purchasing power, the income level at which the top rate comes in is very close to the OECD median. The real issue though is not whether we are near the OECD average, but whether cuts in top marginal rates would boost growth. Econometric evidence on this point is inconclusive, but a look across the Tasman is instructive. New Zealand was hailed as a path-breaking miracle economy when Roger Douglas cut the top marginal tax rate to 33 per cent in 1988. A rapid resurgence in economic growth was confidently predicted, even in the face of initially disappointing results. It was only after a decade of woeful economic performance that talk of the Kiwi miracle was finally abandoned. The Clark government elected in 1999 raised the top rate to 39 per cent. The economy promptly recovered and has grown strongly ever since. It would be absurd to suggest that higher tax rates were responsible for the macroeconomic recovery in New Zealand after 1999. But, on the evidence, it is equally absurd to suggest that variations in top marginal tax rates have a significant effect on economic performance. Good macroeconomic management, rather than adjustments to tax rates, is the main prerequisite for sustained growth. The main risks to our continued economic expansion come from weak labour force participation, excessive investment in the non-tradeable housing sector, and a generalised focus on capital gains at the expense of production. These, and not the complaints of high-income earners, should be the main targets of tax reform. • Professor John Quiggin is a federation fellow in economics and political science based at the University of Queensland and the Australian National University.
