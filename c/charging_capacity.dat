This research investigates the impact of fast-DC charging on battery cell balance, <b>charge</b> <b>capacity</b> and range for an EV travelling long distances on an 'electric-highway'. Two commercially available EVs were exposed to a series of discharge and fast-DC charge cycles to measure cell balance and <b>charge</b> <b>capacity.</b> The vehicles' battery management systems (BMS) were capable of successfully balancing individual cells and hence maintaining the batteries' <b>charge</b> <b>capacity.</b> Although fast-DC <b>charge</b> levels and discharge safety margins significantly reduced the vehicles' <b>charge</b> <b>capacity</b> and range as stated by the manufacturer, these values remained stable for the test period.

The material displayed a hollow nanostructure with a crystalline porous shell composed of phase-pure Li2MnSiO4 nanocrystals.

5000|$|Hershner {{purchased}} a new Zero S ZF9 electric motorcycle from Hollywood Electrics on April 26, 2012. It had {{a range of}} up to 114 miles {{in the city and}} 63 miles with half city/half highway riding. [...] To increase this, Hershner modified his electric motorcycle to increase <b>charging</b> <b>capacity</b> and extend the driving range. He initially added an SAE J1772 charging socket, and three onboard 1 kW battery chargers to raise the total onboard charging to 4 kW. Using the public charging electric vehicle network, he tested the modifications first on a 500-mile trip to Miami, FL, and then a 1200-mile trip to the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN, which he said was the longest distance ridden on an electric motorcycle at that time. After these two long-distance trips, Hershner made additional modifications by adding two 2500 watt Elcon chargers to the Zero to max out the available power from a public charging station to charge at 7.2 kW from level 2 and 1.8 kW from level 1 for 9 kW combined charging, reducing the charge time to one hour to recharge his 9 kWh ZF9 pack.|$|E

30|$|The {{conventional}} electrification topology {{consists of}} two groups of charging stations. There are 5 charging stations in the city center at coordinates (4, 4), (4, 8), (8, 4), (8, 8) and (6, 6). These are marked as cyan circles in Fig. 3. Each of these are able to deliver 24 kW to each of 25 vehicles at a time. In order to include the potential for home charging, a charging station was placed at every intersection along the periphery; each delivering 24 kW to each of 50 vehicles at a time. It {{is important to note}} that a given intersection here does not represent an individual home where there may only be 1 or 2 spaces to charge in a garage. Instead, the intersections along the periphery represent all of the homes associated with the vehicles that exited Symmetrica through that intersection. Thus, it is a centralized representation of a distributed <b>charging</b> <b>capacity</b> outside of the city. In theory, full electric vehicle deployment suggests ubiquitous home charging and thus this capacity is effectively infinite. (Every vehicle owner should be able to return home to charge). However, a fair comparison with the online electric vehicle case requires that the installed <b>charging</b> <b>capacity</b> of scenarios be equal. Here, the total installed <b>charging</b> <b>capacity</b> is (5)(0.24)(25) + (48)(0.024)(30) = 64.56 MW.|$|E

30|$|Cycling {{performance}} and rate capability {{are the two}} main issues to evaluate the sodium storage characteristics of CGO as an anode material. As depicted in Fig.  3 c, the CGO nanowires delivered an initial <b>charge</b> <b>capacity</b> of up to 306.7  mAh g− 1 and an initial CE of 61.74 % at a constant current density of 50  mA g− 1. The high capacity loss in the initial cycle {{could be attributed to}} the formation of SEI layer on the active material surface and other irreversible reaction, which is a common feature of nanostructured anodes [33, 34]. Furthermore, the <b>charge</b> <b>capacity</b> rapidly decayed to 205  mAh g− 1 at 10 th cycle and slowly decreased to 171  mAh g− 1 at 60 th (only 0.68  mAh g− 1 capacity loss for per cycle from the 10 th to 60 th cycle). This result indicates that using ternary compounds with nanostructure is a potential effective alternative to improve electrochemical properties of elemental Ge for SIBs. Another important parameter of the CGO is their rate capability. As shown in Fig.  4 b, the CGO nanowires manifested the reversible <b>charge</b> <b>capacities</b> of 261, 212, 164, and 130  mAh g− 1 at current densities of 50, 100, 200, and 500  mA g− 1, respectively. In addition, as the current density returned to 100  mA g− 1, CGO can still deliver a high <b>charge</b> <b>capacity</b> of 175  mAh g− 1. It is worth noting that the capacity decreases very slightly when the current densities increase from 50 to 500  mA g− 1. This could be confirmed that ternary Ge-based compounds are a promising anode material for SIBs.|$|R
30|$|Because of the {{constraints}} in the assumptions that every vehicle attends charging or discharging {{only once a}} day and the charging period for the V 2 G-participated vehicles is directly after their discharging, the optimal number of discharging vehicles is set as 74 although every vehicle has volunteered for V 2 G process.

40|$|TiO 2 -graphene {{nanocomposite}} {{was first}} synthesized by a facile gas/liquid interface reaction. The structure and morphology {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements. The results indicate that TiO 2 nanoparticles (ca. 10 nm in mean grain size) were successfully deposited onto the graphene sheets during the gas/liquid interfacial reaction process. The electrochemical performance was evaluated by using coin-type cells versus metallic lithium in an enlarged potential window of 0. 01 - 3. 0 V. A high specific <b>charge</b> <b>capacity</b> of 499 mAh g(- 1) was obtained at a current density of 100 mA g(- 1). More strikingly, the TiO 2 -graphene nanocomposite exhibits excellent rate capability, even at a high current density of 3000 mA g(- 1), the specific <b>charge</b> <b>capacity</b> was still as high as 150 mAh g(- 1). The high specific <b>charge</b> <b>capacities</b> {{can be attributed to}} the facts that graphene possesses high electronic conductivity, and the lithium storage performance of graphene is delivered during discharge/charge processes of TiO 2 -graphene nanocomposite between 0. 01 and 3. 0 V.
