The plan {{is to build a}} new line from Økern via Breivoll, where there would be an interchange with the Trunk Line, to Trosterud Station on the Furuset Line. Such a <b>cross</b> <b>connection</b> will allow both interconnection between the lower levels of the Grorud Line and the Furuset Line, {{and at the same time}} give access from the Furuset Line to the Ring Line. In addition to this, the plans call for a parallel line to the Furuset Line to run through the lower parts of Grurudalen, between the Furuset Line and the Trunk Line. This line could either connect to the Furuset Line at Furuset, or run across the valley, via Grorud Station on the Trunk Line, and connect to the Grorud Line at Rommen.|$|E

50|$|A very {{flexible}} coating of an insulator is often applied to electric wire and cable, {{this is called}} insulated wires commonly use just air, since a solid (e.g. plastic) coating is impractical. However, wires that touch each other produce <b>cross</b> <b>connections,</b> short circuits, and fire hazards. In coaxial cable the center conductor must be supported exactly {{in the middle of}} the hollow shield in order to prevent EM wave reflections.

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that the degree of cross modal plasticity between the somatosensory and visual cortices is experience-dependent. In a study using tactile tongue devices to transmit spatial information, early blind individuals were able to show visual cortex activations after 1 week of training with the device. Although there were no <b>cross</b> modal <b>connections</b> at the start, the early blind were able to develop connections between the somatosensory and visual cortices while sighted controls were unable to. Early or congenitally blind individuals have stronger <b>cross</b> modal <b>connections</b> the earlier they began learning Braille. An earlier start allows for stronger connections to form as early blind children have to grow up using their sense of touch to read instead of using their sight. Perhaps due to these <b>cross</b> modal <b>connections,</b> sensory testing studies have shown that people who are born blind and read braille proficiently perceive through touch more rapidly than others. Furthermore, tactile spatial acuity is enhanced in blindness and this enhancement is experience-dependent.|$|R
