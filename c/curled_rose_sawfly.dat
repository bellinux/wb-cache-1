50|$|Sawflies {{are serious}} pests in horticulture. Different species prefer {{different}} host plants, often being specific {{to a family}} or genus of hosts. For example, Iris sawfly larvae, emerging in summer, can quickly defoliate species of Iris including the yellow flag and other freshwater species. Similarly the <b>rose</b> <b>sawflies,</b> Arge pagana and A. ochropus, defoliate rose bushes.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} sawflies feed on spruce trees. Among them European spruce sawfly, yellow-headed spruce sawfly, green-headed spruce sawfly and the spruce webspinning <b>sawfly</b> (<b>Rose</b> and Lindquist 1985).|$|R
40|$|Presented {{review of}} rose diseases, {{associated}} with the plant degeneration symptoms, includes rose streak, rose colour break, rose rosette or rose witches' broom, rose dieback, rose wilt, rose stunt, <b>rose</b> leaf <b>curl,</b> <b>rose</b> spring dwarf, rose little leaf, rose "frisure", rose bud proliferation and rose flower proliferation. Most of these disorders are characterized by stunting or dwarfing of plants accompanied by a partial wilt and dieback of shoots. Proliferation and epinasty often occurred. Apart from detected viruses (TSV. SLRSV) parts of degeneration syndrome have been transmitted by grafting other have failed to achieve any transmission of the causal agent. It seems likely that rose degeneration disorders in spite of symptom similarities are due to a complex of interacting factors including probably viruses...|$|R
60|$|Mac {{spoke in}} such a pathetic tone, and gave such a gloomy glare at the {{aforesaid}} <b>curl,</b> that <b>Rose</b> laughed {{in his face and}} added to his woe by handing him her cloak. He surveyed it gravely for a minute, then carefully put it on wrong side out and gave the swan's-down hood a good pull over the head, to the utter destruction of all smoothness to the curls inside.|$|R
60|$|Fatigued by {{the unusual}} exertions of the afternoon, <b>Rose</b> <b>curled</b> herself {{up in the}} sofa corner to rest {{and think about the}} great mystery, little {{guessing}} that she was to know it first of all.|$|R
60|$|Once more Slone {{peered down}} into the void or what seemed a void. But it, too, had changed, lightened. The whole valley was brightening. Great palls of <b>curling</b> smoke <b>rose</b> white and yellow, to turn back as the monuments met their crests, and then to roll upward, {{blotting}} out the stars. It was such a light as he had never seen, except in dreams. Pale moonlight and dimmed starlight and wan dawn all vague and strange and shadowy under the wild and vivid light of burning grass.|$|R
60|$|A little {{spiral of}} <b>curling</b> smoke <b>rose</b> from {{one corner of}} the pyre--the flames licked upward, crackling. La stood there like a {{beautiful}} statue of despair gazing at Tarzan and at the spreading flames. In a moment they would reach out and grasp him. From the tangled forest came the sound of cracking limbs and crashing trunks--Tantor was coming down upon them, a huge Juggernaut of the jungle. The priests were becoming uneasy. They cast apprehensive glances {{in the direction of the}} approaching elephant and then back at La.|$|R
60|$|He succeeded. The corner {{began to}} blaze and <b>curl,</b> and Caleb <b>rose</b> and moved along carefully, lest the wind should blow it out. This {{precaution}} was, however, scarcely necessary, {{for the little}} wind that his motion occasioned, only fanned the flame the more, and the part which was on fire curled round upon that which was not, and thus formed a round and solid mass, which burned fiercely.|$|R
60|$|The dinghy swung round, {{twisting}} broadside-on {{with the}} brine pouring into her {{in spite of}} all that he could do; and while he tore at one oar, another white sea that <b>curled</b> menacingly <b>rose</b> up astern. It broke right into the boat, and in another moment there was a crash, and Nasmyth, who let the oars drop, stretched out his arms to the girl. He jumped when she clutched him, and found himself standing amid the swirling froth on {{what seemed to be a}} ledge of very slippery stone, with both arms about her, while the crushed-in dinghy swept up among the foam-lapped boulders. He sprang down from the stone as another sea came in, and floundered ashore waist-deep with it, after which he set his dripping companion down upon the beach.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Twas {{sweet to}} know it only possible! [...] Some wishes cross'd my mind and dimly cheer'd it, [...] And one or two poor melancholy pleasures, [...] Each in the pale unwarming light of hope [...] Silvering its flimsy wing, flew silent by-- [...] Moths in the moonbeam!-- [...] --Behind the thin [...] Grey cloud that cover'd, but not hid, the sky, [...] The round full moon look'd small. [...] The subtle snow in every passing breeze [...] <b>Rose</b> <b>curling</b> from the grove like shafts of smoke.|$|R
5000|$|Alessandro Del Piero {{the best}} Italian player, we're {{the same age}} and I've {{followed}} his whole career. Ryan Giggs Del Piero was a free kick and penalty kick (62 goals from penalties) specialist. He is the third highest scorer of penalties in Serie A history, scoring 50 times out of 61 attempts, behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio. Del Piero's unique free kick technique was usually characterised by a <b>curling</b> strike which <b>rose</b> high over the wall, and then suddenly dropped into the top corner of the goal; he attributes his ability on set pieces to the time spent studying Roberto Baggio in training. Del Piero is currently the Italian all-time top scorer of free kicks in all competitions (52 goals: 46 goals in clubs, 6 goals in Italy national team). He is also the third all-time highest goalscorer of free kicks in Serie A, with 22 goals, behind only Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović. In addition to his talent and footballing abilities, Del Piero also drew praise throughout his career for his leadership with Juventus, and for his fair play and correct behaviour on the pitch.|$|R

Indeed, in his early years with the Turin club, Del Piero's free kick technique was compared to that of the Frenchman, as he preferred to strike the ball from a distance of around 20 metres from the goal, with a direct kick, rather than having it touched by a teammate first. Del Piero is currently the Italian all-time top scorer from free kicks in all competitions (52 goals: 46 goals at club level, 6 goals with the Italy national team). He is also the third all-time highest goalscorer of free kicks in Serie A, with 22 goals, behind only Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović.

60|$|Know, O incredulous reader! that {{a master}} {{stands in a}} {{somewhat}} different relation towards a pretty, light-headed, probably ignorant girl, to that occupied by a partner at a ball, or a gallant on the promenade. A professor does not meet his pupil to see her dressed in satin and muslin, with hair perfumed and curled, neck scarcely shaded by aerial lace, round white arms circled with bracelets, feet dressed for the gliding dance. It is not his business to whirl her through the waltz, to feed her with compliments, to heighten her beauty by the flush of gratified vanity. Neither does he encounter her on the smooth-rolled, tree shaded Boulevard, in the green and sunny park, whither she repairs clad in her becoming walking dress, her scarf thrown with grace over her shoulders, her little bonnet scarcely screening her <b>curls,</b> the red <b>rose</b> under its brim adding a new tint to the softer rose on her cheek; her face and eyes, too, illumined with smiles, perhaps as transient as the sunshine of the gala-day, but also quite as brilliant; it is not his office to walk by her side, {{to listen to her}} lively chat, to carry her parasol, scarcely larger than a broad green leaf, to lead in a ribbon her Blenheim spaniel or Italian greyhound. No: he finds her in the schoolroom, plainly dressed, with books before her. Owing to her education or her nature books are to her a nuisance, and she opens them with aversion, yet her teacher must instil into her mind the contents of these books; that mind resists the admission of grave information, it recoils, it grows restive, sullen tempers are shown, disfiguring frowns spoil the symmetry of the face, sometimes coarse gestures banish grace from the deportment, while muttered expressions, redolent of native and ineradicable vulgarity, desecrate the sweetness of the voice. Where the temperament is serene though the intellect be sluggish, an unconquerable dullness opposes every effort to instruct. Where there is cunning but not energy, dissimulation, falsehood, a thousand schemes and tricks are put in play to evade the necessity of application; in short, to the tutor, female youth, female charms are like tapestry hangings, of which the wrong side is continually turned towards him; and even when he sees the smooth, neat external surface he so well knows what knots, long stitches, and jagged ends are behind that he has scarce a temptation to admire too fondly the seemly forms and bright colours exposed to general view.|$|R
