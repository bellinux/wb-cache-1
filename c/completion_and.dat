HMS Swordfish was commissioned on 28 April 1916, before <b>completion,</b> <b>and</b> renamed HMS S1 that same day. She was not completed until 21 July.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the ship}} began on 13 June 1863 at the New Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Tifon was laid down on 1 December 1863 and she was {{launched}} on 27 May 1864. She entered service in 1865 and cost a total of 1,105,800 rubles, almost double her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon <b>completion</b> <b>and</b> she, and all of her sister ships except , made a port visit to Stockholm, Sweden in July–August 1865 while under the command of General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>completion</b> <b>and</b> registration, the Rudyard Kipling began fishing off of {{the coast}} of Ireland and Great Britain. In May 1934, the trawler was sold to The Sun Steam Trawling Co Ltd. On 10 May, her {{registry}} from Hull was closed and on 16 May, she was registered in the English port town of Fleetwood, where her new owners were based.

5|$|From 1969 to 1975, Baxter was {{part-time}} and unpaid {{chairman of}} the Sydney Opera House Trust. He had recently retired from the UNSW, but the job was no sinecure. The architect, Jørn Utzon, had left, construction was behind schedule and over budget, and specialist staff needed to be recruited. Baxter put the project under his unpopular but decisive grip, and brought the Sydney Opera House to <b>completion</b> <b>and</b> opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E

5|$|Hood was {{the closest}} to <b>completion</b> <b>and</b> her {{construction}} was continued in case the Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the lessons of the war.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe study graph {{properties}} that admit an increasing, or equivalently decreasing, sequence of graphs {{on the same}} vertex set such that for any two consecutive graphs in the sequence their difference is a single edge. This is useful for characterizing <b>and</b> computing minimal <b>completions</b> <b>and</b> deletions of arbitrary graphs into having these properties. We prove that threshold graphs and chain graphs admit such sequences. Based on this characterization and other structural properties, we present linear-time algorithms both for computing minimal <b>completions</b> <b>and</b> deletions into threshold, chain, and bipartite graphs, and for extracting a minimal completion or deletion from a given completion or deletion. Minimum <b>completions</b> <b>and</b> deletions into these classes are NP-hard to compute...|$|R

The 11,750-square-foot building, located at its {{original}} site on Southeast 52nd Avenue in Portland's Creston-Kenilworth neighborhood, cost $4.5 million and was designed by Scott Edwards Architecture and built by Bremik Construction. Donations and the insurance settlement supplied {{seventy percent of the}} construction costs.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{was not a}} {{religious}} man; he viewed the papacy {{as a means to}} consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before <b>completion,</b> <b>and</b> for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.|$|E

She was placed into reserve after her <b>completion</b> <b>and</b> was not commissioned until 1 March 1876 when she became flagship of the Cherbourg Division. Throughout her career Suffren was often used as a flagship because of her spacious admiral's quarters.|$|E
5|$|The Admiral Spiridov {{class were}} {{a pair of}} {{monitors}} built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1860s. The sister ships {{were assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon <b>completion</b> <b>and</b> remained there for their entire careers. Aside from several accidental collisions and one grounding, their careers were uneventful. They were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads in 1892 before they became training ships in 1900. The Admiral Spiridovs were stricken from the Navy List in 1907; one ship became a stationary target and the other a coal-storage barge. Their ultimate fates are unknown.|$|E
