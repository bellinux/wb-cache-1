50|$|At 10:22 hrs, Blanco Encalada {{arrived to}} the fray. A shot from 200 meters {{perforated}} the Huascars turret, killing {{almost all of}} the sailors within and damaging the rightmost cannon. Another shot from Cochrane passed through the officers' quarters and wrecked the emergency rudder station, which had been disabled already twice before. The Huáscar now could sail only in a wide semicircle to starboard. Once rudder control was regained, Aguirre tried to ram the Cochrane. Latorre was also maneuvering to ram the Huáscar, but the Peruvian ironclad suddenly veered to port and both ships passed by each other. Another projectile pierced Huáscars turret 12 minutes later, killing everyone inside, including Captain Aguirre. Command of the ship went to Lt. Pedro Garezon, who in conference with the remaining officers decided to scuttle the ship rather than allow it to be captured. At 10:54 hrs the order was given to evacuate the wounded from the engine room and open the main <b>condensator</b> to scuttle the ship and to prevent its capture.|$|E

40|$|My {{bachelor}} thesis {{will deal}} with the English infinitive in adverbial function and its translation counterparts in Czech. An infinitive in adverbial function mostly expresses purpose, effect, intention, cause or concession, {{in the beginning of}} the clause it may function as a conjunct or style disjunct. In Czech, these adverbial functions are implied mainly by a finite dependent clause. The main aim of the theoretical introduction is, firstly, to describe and analyse functions of the infinitive in English syntax. The infinitive will be presented in a broader context, i. e., within the concept of complex condensation, especially with the focus on its grammatical qualities. A comparison between English and Czech <b>condensators</b> will be made, as the analytical and synthetic nature of those languages, respectively, represents fertile grounds for comparison. English, with its preference of nominal constructions and reduced dynamism of the finite verb will be compared with Czech, where the lack of preference for nominal constructions can be observed. Further on, we will examine the difference between finite and non-finite verb forms in order to illustrate their properties and point out the syntactic and morphological differences between the two.

40|$|Investigations concern heat {{utilization}} {{and reduction}} of hazardous emissions occurring in residential buildings and accompanying {{operation of a}} great number of industrial enterprises in particular heat and power objects, and firstly, heat-generating units of small power located in densely populated residential areas without centralized heat supply.

40|$|After {{shutting}} down the Ignalina atomic power plant, Lithuania have received a huge blow to it‘s national energetic safety. Not only pressure from The European Union, but risen electricity and natural gas import dependency has forced Lithuania {{to search for a}} quick solution. Intuitive way to solve both of the problems was combined heat and power promotion and development. Lithuania was very quick to master the sophisticated biofuel burning technologies. At the beginning biofuel was used for water heating and steam supply to various technological processes. Not long after, international experience using biofuel for cogeneration has rooted down in Lithuania too. Nowadays these plants energy production prime cost is particularly cheap. To hop into the market it is necessary to find effectiveness increasing capabilities. In this study two different ways of heat pump integration into a regular biofuel CHP are examined. First one is based on full waste heat energy transformation of water steam cycle, second – additional flue gas cooling after the economizer and greater latent heat recovery. Detailed termodinamic and economic calculations have shown that because of very high compressor power and it‘s electricity consumption the first version heat pump actually lessens annual profit. A lot less heat quantity is in the flue gas after the economizer. Heat pump designed to cool them down and gather condensing water vapour heat is many times less powerful. This is because of high coefficient of performance (COP= 9. 899), which is only possible when having low temperature difference between low grade heat pool and heat pump <b>condensator</b> condensing temperature. This kind of heat pump does not require high investment costs and increases annual profit by 264 thousand € or 13, 5 %...|$|E
40|$|PCBs are {{man-made}} {{organic compounds}} classified as {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs). They are characterised by their high applicability as cooling liquid, softener, surfactant, flame retardant, lubricator or dispergent. Such applicability leaded to a production {{of more than one}} million tones since the 1930 s. They were mainly used in closed systems as dielectric fluids in transformers and capacitors, but also highly used in open applications as plasticizers in building materials. From this usage, release of PCB from the falling plaster of buildings, the flaking paint or the volatilisation of lower chlorinated congeners has been happening since the begins of 1980 s, when the use of PCBs was banned. This project has focused on the degradation of PCBs directly over the surfaces in means of the advanced oxidation process known as Fenton. This technique is based on the capability of H 2 O 2 for creating hydroxyl radicals when catalyzed with iron. The final aim is to treat real surfaces in order to decrease the PCB concentration to acceptable level. Also might be suitable for treating contaminated surfaces affected by <b>condensator</b> fires or explosions. Two different surfaces have been used in order to simulate the real conditions. These surfaces have been glass and brick. They both have been artificially contaminated with a commercial mixture of PCBs known as Aroclor 1260, which was typically used in paints and sealants. The concentrations used are found among the real ones detected in several causes in Finland. Subsequently, the surfaces were treated with the Fenton reagents. Then, an extraction of the PCBs has been made in order to analyse them with GC-MS. The effects of the ratio of H 2 O 2 and Aroclor 1260, the time of reaction, the way of adding the reagents and the degree of chlorination of the PCB congeners, are the main subjects involved in this study. Also two ways of extracting the PCBs from the surfaces, one with a solution of hexane/acetone and other with wiped cotton, have been compared. Results show a reduction around 70 % in both surfaces, but lower weight ratio Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2 /Aroclor is needed in the glass (204 : 250 : 1) than in the brick surface (136 : 500 : 1). It seems that more than seven days are needed for maximal degradation. Degradation occurs in a higher grade on the low chlorinated congeners. Also it has been found that the extraction of PCBs with cotton wiped in alcohol {{does not seem to be}} very repeatable when compared with the extraction by hexane-acetone solution. /Kir 1...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{two types}} of nano-structured TiO 2 layers were {{obtained}} by two different methods. First, during an exploratory study, a set of nano-columnar TiO 2 films and niobium doped TiO 2 films was obtained on stainless steel, by a RF reactive sputtering technique. The argon gas is ionized by a high negative voltage applied to the TiO 2 target (cathode), and a plasma is created between the cathode and the substrate (anode). Positively charged ions (Ar+) are accelerated toward the TiO 2 target (a co-target Nb is placed beside the TiO 2 cathode for Nb doping) and their impact sputters atoms off the target. These atoms travel across the chamber and a fraction of them land on stainless steel, resulting in a film TiO 2 and Nb-doped film TiO 2. With adjusting the RF power applied on the co – target, different concentrations of Nb in the TiO 2 film could be controlled. The results of EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) mainly showed {{the presence of a}} barrier layer (junction metal/semiconductor or metal/oxide/semiconductor) between the TiO 2 layer and the stainless steel in the absence and presence of niobium. The carrier density is estimated at almost 1018 cm- 3. In the second part of this thesis, {{two types of}} TiO 2 nano-tubular arrays with nanotubes (NT) aligned perpendicular to the titanium substrate were obtained by anodization of a titanium foil, in two different solutions containing fluoride ions. The NT obtained in a tetrabutylammonium / formamide solution (named: TiO 2 -NT(TB)) are rough, while the second solution, ethylene glycol, allows to synthesize smoother and denser tubes (named: TiO 2 -NT(EG)). All the nanotubular arrays were characterized by EIS and showed in the high frequency range a contribution related to the presence of surface states, and a contribution at low frequencies related to the capacity of the space charge layer. In the dark, in the Na 2 SO 4 solution with neutral pH, the EIS study of TiO 2 -NT (TB) anatase showed that these two contributions vary with the applied potential. The capacity of surface states varied exponentially {{in a wide range of}} potential, but in addition the presence of a localized energy state in the gap could be evidenced. This localized state is the signature of the adsorption of molecular water. After UV exposure during 3 h, and back to the dark, the quasi irreversible disappearance of the localized energy states is related to photo-induced adsorbed water dissociation at some sites on the surface of NT. Furthermore, the increase by a factor 112 of the capacity of the space charge layer was observed after UV exposure. This increase can be explained by the photo activation of the surface of NT, which was inactive before UV exposure. This activation is related to the dissociation of adsorbed molecular water and the insertion of hydrogen into the walls of NT. A geometric model considering the variation of the band bending taking place inside the wall of NT is proposed to replace the classical Mott-Schottky relation, which is only valid for a plate <b>condensator.</b> This model allows understanding the variation of the space charge layer as a function of the applied potential. With this new model, a carrier density of about 1018 cm- 3 et 1020 cm- 3 respectively before and after UV illumination were determined, confirming that the photo-induced activation of the wall of NT is linked to the phenomenon of doping due to hydrogen insertion. In the case of TiO 2 –NT(EG), the contribution of adsorption of molecular water was not observed. The spectrum of EIS before and after UV exposure did not show a significant change and the capacities of space charge layer after illumination only increased by a factor 8. The simulation with the model shows that the carrier density is about 1020 cm- 3 before and after illumination. In other words, these tubes of TiO 2 –NT(EG), are already activated before illumination and the photo-induced effects are less important compared to the TiO 2 –NT(TB) array. For a better identification of the chemical nature of the surface state in the case of rough tubes of TiO 2 –NT(TB), EIS measurements were performed in the same manner, but in acidic (pH= 3. 5) and basic (pH= 12. 5) media, in order to compare the behaviour to that observed in the neutral Na 2 SO 4 solution. In the alkaline electrolyte, the band bending varies only slightly with the applied potential, reflecting a shift of band edge and the filling/emptying of the surface states during polarization. Moreover, the exponential distribution of capacities of surface states is more spread out (850 meV) in alkaline solution than in the neutral solution (257 meV), showing clearly the particular role of the OH groups at the surface of the tubes. In the acidic electrolyte, a phenomenon of diffusion –insertion of protons should be taken into account for interpreting the spectra of EIS. H atoms play the role of electron donors able to increase the carrier density in the wall of the tubes. The comparison between the behaviours in the 3 media clearly associates the surface states to hydroxyl groups. In the last part of this thesis, experiments were performed on TiO 2 –NT(TB) in a NaOH electrolyte, using Intensity Modulated Photocurrent Spectroscopy (IMPS), and the results are discussed in comparison with a thin compact film deposed on a titanium foil par PVD...|$|E
