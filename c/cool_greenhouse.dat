60|$|Some {{flowers on}} a crossed plant {{of the last}} or second {{generation}} were fertilised, without being castrated, by pollen taken from a plant of the same variety, but not related to my plants, and brought from a nursery garden (whence my seeds originally came) having a different soil and aspect. The flowers on the self-fertilised plants of the last or second generation (Table 4/29) were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net, and yielded plenty of seeds. These latter and the crossed seeds, after germinating on sand, were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of six large pots, which were kept at first in a <b>cool</b> <b>greenhouse.</b> Early in January their heights were measured to the tips of their leaves. The thirteen crossed plants averaged 13.16 inches in height, and the twelve (for one had died) self-fertilised plants averaged 13.7 inches, or as 100 to 104; so that the self-fertilised plants exceeded by a little the crossed plants.|$|E
60|$|The crossed plants always {{withstood}} the {{injurious effects}} of being suddenly removed {{into the open}} air after having been kept in the greenhouse better than did the self-fertilised. On several occasions they also resisted much better cold and intemperate weather. This was manifestly the case with some crossed and self-fertilised plants of Ipomoea, which were suddenly moved from the hothouse to the coldest part of a <b>cool</b> <b>greenhouse.</b> The offspring of plants of the eighth self-fertilised generation of Mimulus crossed by a fresh stock, survived a frost which killed every single self-fertilised and intercrossed plant of the same old stock. Nearly the same result followed with some crossed and self-fertilised plants of Viola tricolor. Even {{the tips of the}} shoots of the crossed plants of Sarothamnus scoparius were not touched by a very severe winter; whereas all the self-fertilised plants were killed halfway down to the ground, so that they were not able to flower during the next summer. Young crossed seedlings of Nicotiana withstood a cold and wet summer much better than the self-fertilised seedlings. I have met with only one exception to the rule of crossed plants being hardier than the self-fertilised: three long rows of Eschscholtzia plants, consisting of crossed seedlings from a fresh stock, of intercrossed seedlings of the same stock, and of self-fertilised ones, were left unprotected during a severe winter, and all perished except two of the self-fertilised. But this case is not so anomalous as it at first appears, for it should be remembered that the self-fertilised plants of Eschscholtzia always grow taller and are heavier than the crossed; the whole benefit of a cross with this species being confined to increased fertility.|$|E

40|$|Cities profoundly alter {{biological}} communities, favoring {{some species}} over others, though the mechanisms that govern {{these changes are}} largely unknown. Herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant in urban than in rural areas, and urban outbreaks {{have been attributed to}} reduced control by predators and parasitoids and to increased susceptibility of stressed urban plants. These hypotheses, however, leave many outbreaks unexplained and fail to predict variation in pest abundance within cities. Here we show that the abundance of a common insect pest is positively related to temperature even when controlling for other habitat characteristics. The scale insect Parthenolecanium quercifex was 13 times more abundant on willow oak trees in the hottest parts of Raleigh, NC, in the southeastern United States, than in cooler areas, though parasitism rates were similar. We further separated the effects of heat from those of natural enemies and plant quality in a greenhouse reciprocal transplant experiment. P. quercifex collected from hot urban trees became more abundant in hot <b>greenhouses</b> than in <b>cool</b> <b>greenhouses,</b> whereas the abundance of P. quercifex collected from cooler urban trees remained low in hot and <b>cool</b> <b>greenhouses.</b> Parthenolecanium quercifex living in urban hot spots succeed with warming, and they do so because some demes have either acclimatized or adapted to high temperatures. Our results provide the first evidence that heat can be a key driver of insect pest outbreaks on urban trees.

50|$|Crinodendron hookerianum {{will only}} thrive in colder areas in a {{sheltered}} woodland garden or against a south-facing or west-facing wall, tolerating an exposed site only in mild areas. It {{can also make}} a fitting subject for the <b>cool</b> <b>greenhouse</b> or conservatory, under which conditions it will flower earlier. It is hardy to -7°C. It should be grown in fertile, moist but well-drained, humus-rich, acid soil in partial shade (in full sun only if the roots can be kept cool and shaded). It should be sheltered from cold, drying winds. Young growth and flower buds are susceptible to damage by hard frosts - the latter especially so, owing to the plants unusual behaviour in producing small flower buds in Autumn which ripen gradually into the mature flowers of the following Summer. Although the only pruning generally required in colder areas is the removal of dead wood in late Spring, in milder areas in a light woodland environment it can even be clipped to make a wind-break. Vegetative propagation is by greenwood cuttings in early Summer or semi-ripe-wood cuttings in late Summer. With regard to pests and diseases the plant is generally trouble-free.

Given reasonable assumptions about the isotopic composition of Cretaceous seawater, our results suggest that middle bathyal water temperatures at Blake Nose increased from ~ 12 °C in the late Albian through middle Cenomanian to a maximum of 20 °C during the latest Cenomanian and earliest Turonian. Bottom waters were again ~ 12 °C during the middle Campanian and cooled to a minimum of 9 °C during the Maastrichtian. Correlative middle bathyal foraminifera from other ocean basins yield paleotemperature estimates that are very similar to those from Blake Nose.

The evergreen Disas are indigenous to South Africa and have great potential for marketing as cut flowers or pot plants but production techniques need to be further investigated and improved. Two Disa hybrids ('Unidiorosa' and 'Kewensis') were subjected to different ammonium levels in nutrient solutions under varying environmental conditions.

Two levels of shading were provided (56 % and 69 %) and two root medium temperatures tested. Where most greenhouse crops need less than 10 % of their total N supply as ammonium, Cymbidiums need about 20 %.

40|$|Tropical climate {{countries}} are net importers of temperate crops due to difficulties encountered in cultivating them, thus constant increase in prices of these crops is always experienced due to increasing demand. To meet the demands, {{efforts have been}} made to adapt temperate crops to tropical climate but the crops quality is always low even though at high production cost. <b>Cool</b> <b>greenhouse</b> or upland farming has been deployed in some cases but these are respectively energy consuming and detrimental to mountain ecosystems. Soil cooling is considered to be appropriate in this case to create winter-like soil temperature and to reduce soil water evaporation. Sustainable chilled water production from solar thermal combined power and cooling is presented in this paper to use the (virtually) free solar energy in the tropics to run a combined plant of organic Rankine power and vapour absorption refrigeration cycle thereby generating electrical power together with chilled water production. The study involves the analysis of a sample size soil in Malaysia to determine its cooling load and the plant capacity to overcome the load. The technical analysis is based on the performance of the combined plan over a range of working fluid superheating temperature and the effective solar collector size to supply the needed heat at the range of the temperatures.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is a new {{greenhouse}} design that incorporates both a filter for rejecting near infrared radiation (NIR) and a solar <b>cooling</b> system. <b>Cooled</b> <b>greenhouses</b> are an important issue for the combination of high global radiation and high outdoor temperatures. As a first measure, this study prevents heat entering the greenhouse by applying a NIR-reflective cover material. The special spectral selective properties of these materials will block up to 50 % of the outside solar energy from entering the greenhouse, which will reduce the cooling capacity required. The second measure is the introduction of a solar driven cooling system. When the NIR reflecting coating is designed as a parabolic or circular shaped reflector integrated in the greenhouse, the reflected solar energy received by a PV cell at the focus delivers sufficient electric energy to drive a fan and pad cooling system. The excess energy can be used for desalination and/or energy supply. Parameters related to typical climate conditions and energy flows are presented...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to manage the environment inside an horticultural greenhouse in order to guarantee suitable growing condition for the crop, safety condition for the workers and energy savings. Microclimate is influenced by climatic parameters, such as solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. Evaporative systems are generally used in warm regions for commercial <b>greenhouse</b> <b>cooling,</b> however such systems require large quantity of water that is often a scarce natural resource in Mediterranean areas. Solar absorption systems can be applied for <b>greenhouse</b> <b>cooling</b> in regions with high values of solar irradiation as alternative to evaporative systems by exploiting renewable energy sources. The solar cooling system could provide significant energy-saving opportunities for <b>cooling</b> <b>greenhouses</b> in hot climates allowing the reduction of electricity and water consumption by exploiting the contemporaneity between the cooling requirements and the solar energy availability.

The aim of the research was to define the solar collector surface related to the greenhouse cultivated area and the potential of the system in terms of cooling capacity and energy consuption. The simulation study was realized based on the experimental data collected at the experimental centre of the University of Bari, Southern Italy, in order to control the air temperature of a greenhouse covered with plastic film; the greenhouse was characterized by a surface of 300 m 2.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the technical feasibility {{of a novel}} cooling system for commercial greenhouses, knowledge {{of the state of}} the art in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>cooling</b> is required. An extensive literature review was carried out that highlighted the physical processes of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>cooling</b> and showed the limitations of the conventional technology. The proposed cooling system utilises liquid desiccant technology; hence knowledge of liquid desiccant cooling is also a prerequisite before designing such a system. Extensive literature reviews on solar liquid desiccant regenerators and desiccators, which are essential parts of liquid desiccant cooling systems, were carried out to identify their advantages and disadvantages. In response to the findings, a regenerator and a desiccator were designed and constructed in lab. An important factor of liquid desiccant cooling is the choice of liquid desiccant itself. The hygroscopicity of the liquid desiccant affects the performance of the system. Bitterns, which are magnesium-rich brines derived from seawater, are proposed as an alternative liquid desiccant for <b>cooling</b> <b>greenhouses.</b> A thorough experimental and theoretical study was carried out in order to determine the properties of concentrated bitterns. It was concluded that their properties resemble pure magnesium chloride solutions. Therefore, magnesium chloride solution was used in laboratory experiments to assess the performance of the regenerator and the desiccator. To predict the whole system performance, the physical processes of heat and mass transfer were modelled using gPROMS® advanced process modelling software. The model was validated against the experimental results. Consequently it was used to model a commercials-scale greenhouse in several hot coastal areas in the tropics and sub-tropics. These case studies show that the system, when compared to evaporative cooling, achieves 3 oC- 5. 6 oC temperature drop inside the greenhouse in hot and humid places (RH> 70 %) and 2 oC- 4 oC temperature drop in hot and dry places (50 %<RH< 65 %) ...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{greenhouses}} built with solar panels {{integrated into the}} roof. In summer time this will operate very well, although broad shadow stripes can result in growth and yield differences. In winter the amount of sunlight is further limited by the solar panels and will result in further reduction of light accession to the cultivation space. As a result, the crops suffer from growth problems. These drawbacks are eliminated by the application of Concentrating Power Systems (CSP) with Fresnel lenses. A Fresnel lens works like a normal lens but is much thinner. When the sun shines, the lens receives both direct and indirect sunlight. The lens will concentrate all direct sunlight, which can be collected as thermal energy in the focal point. This absorbed radiation can be converted with an absorption cooler into cold water for cooling. This cold water can <b>cool</b> the <b>greenhouse</b> without the need of water use. The indirect solar radiation, the diffuse light will not focus and is therefore available as a fairly constant light source in the building or in the greenhouse. The capture of all direct radiation at high intensities will diminish the incoming heat load, which is useful for a better internal climate control of greenhouses and buildings. This lower heat load {{makes it easier to}} keep the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>cool</b> with the absorber. In this study the details of energy flows and thermal conversion with absorption cooler is determined. Calculation shows a 47 % heat load reduction (from 337 W/m 2 to 157 W/m 2) with the Fresnel lenses in the covering of the greenhouse.

Using {{the difference between}} the outside and inside air temperatures, it was concluded that at 0. 5 m above the floor the RHF system reduced the temperature by 1. 1 °C in 2005 and 0. 8 °C in 2006. Both cooling scenarios were compared with other cooling technologies: the use of the natural ventilation + shading + RHF gave a smaller air temperature difference than fogging at a height equal to or lower than 0. 5 m.

It describes 216 contacts with parties during this period related to technical assistance with geothermal direct heat projects. Areas dealt with include requests for general information including maps and material for high school debates, and material on geothermal heat pumps, resource and well data, space heating and <b>cooling,</b> <b>greenhouses,</b> aquaculture, equipment, district heating, resorts and spas, industrial applications, electric power and snow melting. Research activities include work on model construction specifications of lineshaft submersible pumps and plate heat exchangers, a comprehensive aquaculture developer package and revisions to the Geothermal Direct Use Engineering and Design Guidebook. Outreach activities include the publication of the Quarterly Bulletin (Vol. 18, No. 4) which was devoted entirely to geothermal activities in South Dakota, dissemination of information mainly through mailings of publications, tours of local geothermal uses, geothermal library acquisition and use, participation in workshops, short courses and technical meetings by the staff, and progress monitor reports on geothermal activities...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of various}} {{renewable}} energy resources in agricultural greenhouses for heat and power generation {{has been studied}} extensively and several applications already exist. Among renewable energy resources solar energy, geothermal energy and biomass have been more or less used mainly for heat production in them. Currently economic and environmental considerations favour the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energies for energy generation in greenhouses. The necessity of mitigation of greenhouse gases emissions and the decrease {{in the cost of}} energy generation from renewables make their use more attractive in various commercial applications including in agricultural greenhouses. In the case of Crete-Greece, cost analysis of the use of solid biomass and geothermal energy for direct heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>greenhouses</b> shows that these investments are very profitable and attractive. However, the use of geothermal heat pumps for heating and cooling them is not cost effective. Use of solar photovoltaic cells for power generation is not cost effective, particularly when electricity generation in greenhouses is subsidized by the government. The decrease of CO 2 emissions due to the use of renewables in the greenhouses is considered as an additional benefit...|$|R
