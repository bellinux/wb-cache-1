The Chinese crested tern is in a <b>critical</b> <b>situation</b> and three other species are classed as endangered. International agreements provide a measure of protection, but adults and eggs of some species are still used for food in the tropics.

5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was mainly}} food that the {{inhabitants}} of Jerusalem needed. Starting 5 June, the Israeli engineers started to fix the road so that it let civil transport trucks pass to supply the city. 150 workers, working in four teams, installed a pipeline to supply the city with water, because the other pipeline, crossing Latrun, had been cut by the Jordanians. In O Jerusalem, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins talked about heroic action, when during the night of 6–7 June, in fear of the <b>critical</b> <b>situation</b> of Jerusalem and to improve {{the morale of the}} population, 300 inhabitants of Tel Aviv were requisitioned to carry on their backs, for the few kilometers not yet ready for the trucks, what would be needed to feed {{the inhabitants of}} Jerusalem one more day.|$|E

The line then turned westward so the 5th Mounted Brigade faced northwards in front of Summil with the 4th Light Horse Brigade to their left in front of Ipseir and connecting with the right of the infantry division; the 75th Division at Suafir esh Sharqiye. A <b>critical</b> <b>situation</b> created by the strong Ottoman attacking forces had been controlled by the coolness and steadiness of the troops, especially the machine-gun squadrons of the 5th Mounted and the 4th Light Horse Brigades. The Australian Mounted Division suffered about 50 casualties mainly from the 5th Mounted Brigade.|$|E

5|$|After Phocas's fall, Heraclius became {{emperor of}} Byzantium. The Patriarch Nikephoros claims in his Short History that the crown was first offered to Priscus, who refused it. As {{commander}} of the excubitores, a protopatrikios (first among the patrician order) {{and one of the}} few senior and influential officials with ties to past regimes, Priscus represented a potential threat to Heraclius. Nevertheless, facing a <b>critical</b> <b>situation</b> in the East, where the Persians had overrun much territory and were raiding Anatolia, Heraclius appointed Priscus in command of the Anatolian army in the autumn of 611. The Persian general Shahin captured Caesarea in Cappadocia, only to be blockaded and besieged there by Priscus. Heraclius himself decided to visit the army camp at Caesarea during winter, but Priscus refused to meet him, on the pretext of an illness. This snub alienated Heraclius from his general, and when Shahin and his army managed to break out and escape in summer, Priscus was recalled to Constantinople, ostensibly to become godfather to the Byzantine emperor's son, Heraclius Constantine. At the capital, he was removed from his post as comes excubitorum, which went to Heraclius's cousin Nicetas, while command in Anatolia went to the other surviving general of Maurice, Philippicus, brought out of retirement. Priscus was brought before the Byzantine Senate and accused by Heraclius of treason. In the end, he was tonsured as a monk on 5 December 612 and confined in the Monastery of the Chora, where he died in 613.|$|E

25|$|Umar {{ordered his}} army {{to retreat to}} the {{bordering}} areas of Mesopotamia near the Arabian desert and began raising armies for another campaign into Mesopotamia. The Arab armies were concentrated near Medina, and owing to the <b>critical</b> <b>situation</b> Umar wished to command the army in person. This idea was opposed {{by the members of}} Majlis ash-Shura at Medina, who claimed that the two-front war required Umar's presence in Madinah. Umar appointed Saad ibn Abi Waqqas as commander for the campaign in Mesopotamia. Even though Saad was suffering from sciatica, yet still Umar thought this important invasion should be commanded by someone who is senior and respected in military chain of command. Saad left Medina with his army in May 636 and arrived at Qadisiyyah in June.|$|E

After the plague had weakened, in late 639, Umar visited Syria for political and administrative re-organization, as most of the veteran commanders and governors had died of the plague.|$|E
25|$|Cavallo {{was called}} by President de la Rúa in March 2001 to lead the economy once again, {{in the face of}} a {{weakened}} coalition government and two years of recession. He attempted to restore business confidence by renegotiating the external debt with the International Monetary Fund and with bondholders, but the growing country risk and spiraling put options by large investors and foreign holdings led to a bank run and a massive capital flight. In late November 2001, Cavallo introduced a set of measures that blocked the usage of cash, informally known as the corralito ("financial corral"). The anger of those Argentines with the means to invest abroad created a framework for the popular middle-class protest termed the cacerolazo. Political pressure by the Peronist opposition and other organized economic interests coincided with the December 2001 riots. This <b>critical</b> <b>situation</b> finally forced Cavallo, and then de la Rúa, to resign.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, the Ottoman Empire had {{declined}} {{enough to become}} a target for other global powers (see History of the Balkans). This instigated the Crimean War in 1854 and began a tenser period of minor clashes among the globe-spanning empires of Europe that eventually {{set the stage for}} the First World War. In the second half of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Kingdom of Prussia carried out a series of wars that resulted in the creation of Italy and Germany as nation-states, significantly changing the balance of power in Europe. From 1870, Otto von Bismarck engineered a German hegemony of Europe that put France in a <b>critical</b> <b>situation.</b> It slowly rebuilt its relationships, seeking alliances with Russia and Britain to control the growing power of Germany. In this way, two opposing sides—the Triple Alliance of 1882 (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy) and the Triple Entente of 1907 (Britain, France and Russia)—formed in Europe, improving their military forces and alliances year-by-year.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd {{decided that}} a rapid advance on Damascus would best deal with the <b>critical</b> <b>situation.</b> He sent two {{companies}} of Free French troops and some artillery south to Sheikh Meskine to bolster reinforce the two squadrons of the Transjordan Frontier Force which had taken defensive positions across the road eastwards from Sheikh Meskine to Dezraa and ordered the Indian brigade to advance. During the night of 15 June, pushing forward through the hills {{to the left of}} the Kissoué to Damascus road, Indian troops took Aartouz on the Quneitra to Damascus road, cutting the rearward communications of the Vichy force advancing on Quneitra. On the afternoon of 16 June, it was reported incorrectly that Ezraa had been re-taken by the Allies but the news from Quneitra was less promising. Outnumbered 3:1 and facing tanks against which they had no effective counter, the Allied defenders at Quneitra, a battalion of the Royal Fusiliers (less a company which was at Kissoué), held out until, surrounded and ammunition virtually exhausted, at 19:00 on 16 June the remaining 13 officers and 164 men surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Less {{significant}} {{were the}} clashes in the Akhalkalaki district. The Armenian operation was thwarted by the massive Georgian military presence {{and lack of}} support by the local Armenian population. The region was garrisoned with over 6,000 troops commanded by general Abel Makashvili. Despite the odds Armenian forces mounted an offensive seizing four villages. Makashvili demanded them to leave the area immediately otherwise punitive actions would take place. On 14 December the Armenians met the demand and left the villages just to renew their attacks af few days later this time around with cavalry support. The village of Troitskoe changed hands several times until the Georgians ultimately retook it and repelled all Armenian units from the area. On 19 December Armenian forces once again attempted to take Troitskoe but were repulsed losing 100 men to Georgian machine gun fire. Due to heavy winter storms neither side could achieve any military breakthrough in the region. Confrontations in the Akhalkalaki district ceased {{for the rest of}} the war while all Georgian troops there had to remain on order of high command despite the <b>critical</b> <b>situation</b> in Lori.|$|E

25|$|For a year, the Allies had {{repeatedly}} promised to send serious military forces to Serbia, while nothing had materialized. But with Bulgaria's mobilization to its south, {{the situation for}} Serbia became desperate. The developments finally forced the French and the British to decide upon sending a small expedition force of two divisions to help Serbia, but even these arrived {{too late in the}} Greek port of Salonika to have any impact in the operations. The main reason for the delay was the lack of available Allied forces due to the <b>critical</b> <b>situation</b> in the Western Front. The Entente used Greek neutrality as an excuse, although they could have used the Albanian coast for a rapid deployment of reinforcements and equipment during the first 14 months of the war. (As the Serbian Marshal Putnik had suggested, the Montenegrin army gave adequate cover to the Albanian coast from the north—at a safe distance from any Bulgarian advance in the south {{in the event of a}} Bulgarian intervention.) The Entente also delayed due to protracted secret negotiations aiming at bringing Bulgaria into the Allied camp, which event would have alleviated Serbia's need for Franco-British help.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Army {{was formed}} in 1914 as part of Austria-Hungary's {{mobilization}} following its declaration of war on Serbia and Russia, carrying out the prewar plans {{for the formation of}} six field armies. Just as all Austro-Hungarian field armies, it consisted of a headquarters and several corps, along with some unattached units. The 1st Army was put under the command of General of the Cavalry Viktor Dankl von Krasnik and was composed of the I, V, and X Corps, originating from Kraków, Presburg and Przemyśl, respectively. Under his command, the units of the 1st Army scored the first Austro-Hungarian victory of World War I during the defense of Galicia by defeating the Russian 4th Army at the Battle of Krasnik in 23–25 August 1914. However, due to the <b>critical</b> <b>situation</b> on other parts of the front, Krasnik was forced to withdraw south along the Dunajec river to the area north of Kraków. During the winter of 1914 the 1st Army took part in the Battle of the Vistula River in Russian Poland, reaching Ivangorod. In May 1915, General Krasnik was transferred to the Italian Front. He was replaced by General of the Cavalry Karl Kirchbach von Lauterbach {{for a couple of months}} before command of the 1st Army was given to General of the Artillery Paul Puhallo von Brlog. The 1st Army did not take part in the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive, remaining in Volodymyr-Volynskyi during that time.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the bulk}} of US civilians had been {{evacuated}} out of South Korea by ship, the priority of FEAF changed to a military nature. The 339th F(AW)S received orders from Fifth Air Force to move all available aircraft, along with crews and equipment, to Itazuke Air Base to assist the 68th in providing air cover for the evacuation of Seoul. However, the 339th's complement of aircraft were scattered over several bases at the time. Seven F-82s at Yokota AB were flyable and two were in the hangar undergoing maintenance for major repairs. Four other F-82s were at Misawa AB on TDY. The three at Yokota were dispatched immediately to Itazuke, {{as well as the}} four at Misawa, making a total of seven combat ready F-82Gs present for duty on 27 June. The 68th F(AW)S had a total of twelve operational F-82Gs. This, combined with what the 339th could contribute, was insufficient to meet the combat needs thrust upon FEAF. The F-80 Shooting Star was available, but its thirsty jet engine meant it could only remain over the airfield for a few minutes before having to return to base and it could not reach the forward combat area from Japan. No USAF P-51 Mustangs were available, and the British Commonwealth had not yet made a decision to commit to combat in Korea, making the presence of Australian Mustangs in Japan academic at this <b>critical</b> <b>situation.</b> FEAF ordered Twentieth Air Force to send eight F-82s from its 4th F(AW)S from Okinawa to Itazuke, making a total of 27 F-82s available for combat duty. This was commendable, considering that on 31 May 1950 a total of 32 F-82s existed within FEAF. With these combined squadrons, the 347th Provisional Fighter Group (AW) was formed.|$|E
