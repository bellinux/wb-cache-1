The requirement for NSW specialized Courses of Instruction (COI) {{in support of}} the War on Terrorism will continue to increase, necessitating establishment of the advanced training command. NAVSPECWARADVTRACOM will be responsible for the coordination, management, and conduct of the specialized COIs and for providing the same training to Joint Special Operations and foreign <b>counterpart</b> <b>personnel.</b> Manpower exceeding 200 will be provided by transfers from Naval Special Warfare Center, San Diego. The command supports more than 30 advanced training courses, seven detachments and 15 training sites across the country, including detachments in Alaska and Hawaii.|$|E
40|$|Although {{heavy-duty}} disc ploughs {{are used}} {{at the very beginning}} of t he wet season in Thailand, indigenous mouldboard ploughs are normally used the rest of the time. The purpose of the project was to improve the design of these moldboard ploughs through the use of modern engineering techniques, computer-aided design (CAD) in particu larTo find the mouldboard shape best suited to Thai conditions, a profi lograph was designed and manufactured at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. The profilograph was used to draw the shapes of a number of indigenous ploughs, and the data so obtained w ere stored in a micro-computer data base for subsequent analysis. Specifications for a mod ified plough were prepared, but resources did not permit adequate field demonstrations to be carried out to verify the plough's practicability under Thai conditions. Certainly there wa s room for the design to be improvedA seminar was organized for 23 participants from government and priv ate enterprises, including local manufacturers, to discuss the suitability of the pr oposed modified plough, and to familiarize participants with the technological know-how develope d by the project. The participants responded favourably to the idea of commercialization of the plough, and made constructive suggestions for the further improvement of existin g local ploughsThe project made an important contribution toward the fostering of l ocal industries, especially blacksmiths and small-scale plough manufacturers. CAD ha s opened up new possibilities for improving indigenous mouldboard ploughs, and local manu facturers showed a genuine willingness to be involved in such innovationIt was recommended that field tests be carried out to verify the pra cticability of the proposed improved mouldboard plough. The tests should cover all regions of Thailand so that modifications could be made to suit the widely differing conditions. De monstration and training programmes directed particularly toward small-scale manufacturers a nd blacksmiths should be carried out in order to disseminate the project's results more widelySince a more sophisticated computer program was being developed at t he University of Tsukuba, it was strongly recommended that <b>counterpart</b> <b>personnel</b> ma intain the channels of communication established during the project so that technical infor mation could be exchanged easil...|$|E

50|$|With the {{concurrence}} of the British government, the U.S., in 1873, built a consulate on Shamian Island, a sandy one kilometer {{long strip}} of land around which a man-made canal had been dug ten years before to separate it {{from the rest of}} the city. Along with their European <b>counterparts,</b> foreign diplomatic <b>personnel</b> tried to recreate a Western lifestyle. They built Anglican and Catholic churches, tennis courts, an indoor swimming pool, and long promenades. Today, visitors to Shamian Island can still see the vestiges of late eighteenth century and nineteenth century Western life.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the North Sea {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} has been exposed to widespread change, including organizational restructuring, "down-sizing", and increased safety regulation. This article reviews the literature on psychosocial stress, health, and safety among offshore personnel in the light of these developments. Few studies directly compare onshore and offshore populations; the available data suggest that, relative to their onshore <b>counterparts,</b> offshore <b>personnel</b> experience greater anxiety, more sleep problems, and higher work load. Within the offshore population, objective factors (eg, size, age, type of installation, work patterns, and occupational differences), subjective work perceptions, individual differences (age and personality), and health behavior, all play significant roles in relation to health and safety outcomes. However, much of the research in stress and health offshore has methodological limitations and does not allow causal interpretation. The need for prospective studies of the long-term mental and physical health of offshore personnel, and for research in several specific areas, is noted...|$|R

40|$|Proper {{selection}} of advisory personnel for "transition teams" {{is critical to}} military advisory efforts in Iraq. The selection procedures currently in place have shortcomings that may be best adjusted through analyzing historical experiences and prior lessons learned. The U. S. military has decades, if not more than a century, of advisory experience, to include with Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia. Transition teams' main purpose is to provide advisory support to the Iraqi Security Forces in garrison, training, and combat environments. Advisors are expected to live, work, train, and fight alongside their Iraqi <b>counterparts.</b> Clearly some <b>personnel</b> are better suited than others to such austere and often ambiguous environments. Therefore, discrete {{selection of}} appropriate personnel has {{to be considered for}} successful advising. Historic lessons learned, coupled with current experience advising Iraqi Security Forces, suggest the need to develop discrete selection criteria. Critical to selection is recruitment and screening of candidates. Personnel that are selected for advisory duty should then proceed to a preparatory phase in which advisor-specific skills are developed or enhanced prior to deployment. Assessment should continue through all phases of team formation and deployment to ensure that there is no degradation of individual suitability and / or team capability over time.

25|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1960s, Brazil's {{bilateral}} defence {{agreements with the}} United States ensured easy access to a postwar surplus of American military equipment, including a number of World War II-vintage M8 Greyhound armoured cars. The Brazilian arms industry limited itself to restoring and maintaining this obsolete hardware until 1964, when American involvement in the Vietnam War placed restrictions {{on the amount of}} defence technology available for export. Brazil responded by creating an indigenous import substitution programme in 1968 aimed at reproducing US equipment already in service. By 1970 the Brazilian Army was developing an updated Greyhound known simply by its Portuguese initials, CRR (Carro de Reconhecimento sobre Rodas). Engesa, then an obscure civilian engineering firm, took over the project and by November 1970 a prototype was completed. The new EE-9 Cascavel entered the pre-production phase between 1972 and 1973. Assembly lines for the Cascavel and its armoured <b>personnel</b> <b>counterpart,</b> the EE-11 Urutu, were opened in 1974. The hulls were purchased by the Brazilian Army, but mounted the same antiquated 37mm cannon and turret recycled from its elderly Greyhounds. To compete with more formidable armament available on the international market, Engesa also marketed a heavily modified Cascavel with an automatic transmission and the same 90mm (3.54in) low-pressure gun found on the Panhard AML. This model, intended for export, drew interest in the Middle East and twenty were immediately purchased by Qatar.|$|R
40|$|There has {{recently}} been a noticeable {{increase in the number}} of articles and blogs surrounding the case of Major League Soccer. This rise is down to the enhanced interest in football throughout the U. S and their national league, the MLS. Despite the evident growth the league has witnessed since its introduction in 1996, the governance structure of the league continues to be deliberated. This study has been designed to evaluate the differences in sporting competition design, between football in the United States and European football. To aid this evaluation, MLS and the EPL will be employed as case studies for comparative analysis. The focus of this research investigation is to highlight how the MLS can become more competitive on the international stage. The league has received varied views regarding the future of the MLS, with certain stakeholders believing that MLS should look to conform with its European <b>counterparts,</b> whereas other <b>personnel</b> hold the view that the league should maintain its already established, conventional North American model. Consequently, this thesis examines the differences in competition design between the EPL and MLS, in which the findings will be paralleled alongside the MLS’ current design to initiate potential alternatives. To aid the analyses of each competition’s structure, in-depth semi-structured interview have been conducted with multiple stakeholders within the football industry. These interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed, searching for the emergence of key themes and responses to how MLS can flourish in the future. Analysis of data indicates that there continues to be a divide amongst stakeholders surrounding the competition design of the MLS. Based on these findings, the considerations have been conceptualised, allowing the researcher to make recommendations as to how MLS can be considered a major player in the football industry...|$|R
