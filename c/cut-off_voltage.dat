An AA-sized alkaline battery might have an effective {{capacity of}} 3000mAh at low drain, but at a load of 1 ampere, which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could be as little as 700mAh. The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total usable capacity depends on the <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> of the application. Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers about as much capacity on intermittent or continuous light loads.

40|$|Abstract — Standby {{power can}} {{dominate}} the power budgets of battery-operated ultra-low power processors, and reducing standby {{power is the}} key challenge for further power reduction. State-of-the-art ultra low voltage sensors consume hundreds of nW in wake mode and 100 pW or less in standby mode. Therefore, applying known circuit techniques for further standby power reduction is very challenging. In this paper, we extend known standby power reduction techniques for use in ultra-low power processors. In particular, we propose structures that enable the use of super <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltages</b> throughout the design with minimal power overhead.

After every 10 cycles, the pouch cells were charged or discharged to 3. 8 V and evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This approach allows the impact of electrolyte additives on the impedance of cells cycled to different <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltages</b> to be studied systematically. The addition of 2 % PES or “PES- 211 ” proved to be beneficial in suppressing impedance growth when cells are cycled up to and above 4. 4 V. Long-term cycling tests between 3. 0 V and 4. 4 V at 45 ◦C showed that “PES- 211 ” had the best capacity retention (∼ 85 %) and the least impedance growth after 500 cycles. The results suggest the use of “PES- 211 ” could lead to longer lived and higher power NMC/graphite Li-ion cells with better tolerance to high voltage (4. 4 V) which will improve energy density. © The Author(s) 2014.

40|$|A pseudo {{two-dimensional}} (P 2 D) electro-chemical {{lithium-ion battery}} model {{is presented in}} this paper to study the capacity fade under cyclic charge-discharge conditions. The Newman model [1, 2] has been modified to include a continuous solvent reduction reaction responsible for the capacity fade and power fade. The temperature variation inside the cell is accurately predicted using a distributed thermal model coupled with the internal chemical heat generation. The model is further improved by linking the porosity variation with the electrolyte partial molar concentration, thereby proving a stronger coupling between the battery performance and the chemical properties of electrolyte. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer growth is estimated for different <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltages</b> and charging current rates. The results show that the convective heat transfer coefficient as well as the porosity variation influences the SEI layer growth and the battery life significantly. The choice of an electrolyte decides the conductivity and partial molar concentration, which is found to have a strong influence on the capacity fade of the battery.

The ex-situ characterization of carbonaceous cathodes in correspondence of different <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltages</b> was based on vibrational spectroscopies, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

At the same time, the presence of polar degradation products (carbonates, carboxylates) at the cathode surface is accompanied by the build-up of a surface electric potential gradient, as revealed by differential binding energy shifts resulting from C 1 s photoelectron spectra.
