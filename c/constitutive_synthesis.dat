50|$|Outplanted {{stock that}} {{is unable to}} {{tolerate}} high temperatures occurring at soil surfaces will fail to establish on many forest sites, even in the far north. Factors affecting heat tolerance were investigated by Colombo et al. (1995); the production and roles of heat shock proteins (HSPs) are important in this regard. HSPs, present constitutively in black spruce and many other, perhaps most, higher plants are important both for normal cell functioning and in a stress response mechanism following exposure to high, non-lethal temperature. In black spruce at least, there is an association between HSPs and increased levels of heat tolerance. Investigation of the diurnal variability in heat tolerance of roots and shoots in black spruce seedlings 14 to 16 weeks old found in all 4 trials that shoot heat tolerance was significantly greater in the afternoon than in the morning. The trend in root heat tolerance {{was similar to that}} found in the shoots; root systems exposed to 47 °C for 15 minutes in the afternoon averaged 75 new roots after a 2-week growth period, whereas only 28 new roots developed in root systems similarly exposed in the morning. HSP73 was detected in black spruce nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble protein fractions, while HSP72 was observed only in the soluble protein fraction. Seedlings exhibited <b>constitutive</b> <b>synthesis</b> of HSP73 at 26 °C in all except the nuclear membrane fraction in the morning; HSP levels at 26 °C in the afternoon were higher than in the morning in the mitochondrial and microsomal protein factions. Heat shock affected the abundance of HSPs depending on protein fraction and time of day. Without heat shock, nuclear membrane-bound HSP73 was absent from plants in the morning and only weakly present in the afternoon, and heat shock increased the abundance of nuclear membrane. Heat shock also affected the abundance of HSP73 in the afternoon, and caused HSP73 to appear in the morning. In the mitochondrial and microsomal protein fractions, an afternoon heat shock reduced HSP73, whereas a morning heat shock increased HSP73 in the mitochondrial but decreased it in the microsomal fraction. Heat shock increased soluble HSP72/73 levels in both the morning and afternoon. In all instances, shoot and root heat tolerances were significantly greater in the afternoon than in the morning.|$|E

Bacteriol. 84 : 23 – 30. 1962 —The hybrid Saccharomyces fragilis × S. dobzhanskii produced a constitutive β-glucosidase when grown in succinate synthetic medium. Upon addition of β-glucosides, thio-β-glucosides, or low concentrations of glucose, a further induction of enzyme synthesis was observed.

Phenyl-thio-β-d-glucoside did not affect <b>constitutive</b> <b>synthesis</b> nor induction by glucosides, thio-glucosides, or glucose. Repression of β-glucosidase synthesis is brought about by high concentrations of glucose and other carbon compounds. Preinduction does not confer resistance to catabolic repression of enzyme synthesis; {{this leads to the}} conclusion that two sites of control for β-glucosidase synthesis are present in yeast. Multiplicity of control is further suggested from: (i) the properties of the inducing system; (ii) semiconstitutive nature of enzyme synthesis; (iii) the repression of <b>constitutive</b> <b>synthesis</b> by glucose; (iv) the elevated derepressed rates of enzyme synthesis after glucose inhibition; and (v) the selection of a family of low constitutive mutants with variable inducibility...|$|E

However, the working mechanism of BCG after intravesical instillation is not completely understood. A functional role of urothelial (tumor) cells in the initiation of the BCG-induced immune reaction should be considered. Here, {{the possibility of a}} causal relationship between BCG-induced interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) synthesis and BCG internalization by urothelial tumor cells was examined in a series of human transitional bladder cancer (TCC) cell lines with different degrees of differentiation. The results showed that the well differentiated TCC cell lines, RT 4, SBC- 2, and SBC- 7, did not possess the capacity to internalize BCG, which was associated with an inability to upregulate IL- 6 synthesis when stimulated with BCG. Moreover, these cell lines expressed a low level of <b>constitutive</b> IL- 6 <b>synthesis.</b> In contrast, the poorly differentiated TCC cells, T- 24, TCC-SUP and J- 82, were able to internalize BCG. In T 24 and J 82, but not in TCC-SUP cells, BCG internalization appeared to result in an upregulation of IL- 6 <b>synthesis.</b> <b>Constitutive</b> IL- 6 <b>synthesis</b> of the high grade cell lines was found to be cell line-dependent: both TCC-SUP and J 82 cells exhibited a high level of <b>constitutive</b> IL- 6 <b>synthesis,</b> whereas T 24 cells exhibited a low level. The possible relationship between BCG internalization and IL- 6 upregulation was studied in detail with the T 24 cell line, which exhibited a low constitutive and high BCG-inducible IL- 6 synthesis, using anti-BCG antibodies (alphaBCG) and Cytochalasin B as internalization inhibitors. Upregulation of IL- 6 synthesis was significantly inhibited by alphaBCG or Cytochalasin B, indicating that internalization is a prerequisite for BCG-induced upregulation of IL- 6 synthesis.

The cargA + O- mutations were, therefore, small alterations, possibly single base substitutions. On the other hand, the cargA + Oh- 1 and cargA + Oh- 2 mutations, leading to a constitutive and mating-type dependent arginase synthesis, were identified as insertions.

The concentration of arginase RNA was significantly increased in the mutants, indicating that the regulation of arginase synthesis was exerted, at least in part, at the level of RNA synthesis or stability. In the cargA + Oh- 2 strain the Ty 1 element was located at a distance of approximately 600 base pairs from the insertion present in the cargA + Oh- 1 strain.

The phoT mutations led to a complete Pi− phenotype in this background, and no activity of the pst system could be detected. The introduction of the phoS mutations changed the specificity of the pst system so that arsenate became growth inhibitory. Changes in the phosphate source led {{to changes in the}} levels of <b>constitutive</b> alkaline phosphatase <b>synthesis</b> found in phoS and phoT mutants.

The amiC translation termination codon (A) TGA overlaps the initiation codon for the downstream amiR transcription antitermination factor gene, implying that the amiCR operon is coordinately regulated. Disruption of the amiC open reading frame by insertion and deletion leads to <b>constitutive</b> amidase <b>synthesis,</b> suggesting that AmiC is a negative regulator. This is confirmed by the finding that a broad-host-range expression vector carrying amiC (pSW 41) represses amidase expression {{in a series of}} previously characterized P. aeruginosa amidase-constitutive mutants. The AmiC polypeptide has been purified from PAC 452 (pSW 41), and N-terminal amino acid sequencing has confirmed the gene identification...|$|R
