2500|$|The Bell 212 {{registered}} as G-BDIL was a twin-engine two-bladed medium helicopter manufactured on 18 July 1975. For the flight the rear bench seats were removed to allow fitting a rescue winch, leaving only two rear seats available {{and the remaining}} two cabin crew using safety harnesses. The aircraft had an <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Airworthiness that was valid until 30 January 1983 and a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maintenance</b> that was valid until 27 October 1982 or 7,567.5 airframe hours. The airframe had a total of 7,532.25 hours {{at the time of}} the accident. [...] The gross weight of the aircraft and the estimated center of gravity were both within authorized limits. [...] The aircraft had two liferafts installed and all six personnel were wearing immersion survival suits and life vests with personal locator beacons. The aircraft was also equipped with a SARBE beacon and an underwater locator beacon, both activated by immersion in salt water. [...] Available navigation equipment installed included a Decca Navigator System, VOR, and ADF receivers. During the flight, the co-pilot had asked for the non-directional beacon located on the Murchison platform to be turned on to assist in finding the Baffin Seal but the beacon remained off until after the accident because the platform's radio operator was fixing an equipment issue.|$|R

40|$|The air {{transport}} business is large in its operations, integrated, automated and complex. Air carriers are constantly striving to achieve {{high standards of}} safety and simultaneously to attain an increased level of availability performance at minimal cost. This needs to be supported through an effective maintenance programme which has {{a major impact on}} the availability performance and which ultimately can enhance the aircraft’s capability to meet market demands at the lowest possible cost. The development <b>of</b> a <b>maintenance</b> programme is challenging, but can be enhanced by supporting methodologies and tools. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop decision support methodologies and tools for aircraft scheduled maintenance programme development within the framework <b>of</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Review</b> Board (MRB) process. To achieve the purpose of the research, literature studies, case studies, and simulations have been conducted. Empirical data have been collected through document studies, interviews, questionnaires, and observations from the aviation industry. For data analysis, theories and methodologies within risk, dependability and decision making have been combined with the best practices from the aviation industry. One result of the research is the identification of potential areas for improving the use of MSG- 3 methodology in aircraft scheduled maintenance development. Another result is the development of a systematic methodology guided by the application of an Event Tree Analysis (ETA) for the identification and quantification of different operational risks caused by aircraft system failures, to support decision making for maintenance task development. A third result is a proposed methodology, based on a combination of different Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies, for selecting the most effective maintenance strategy for aircraft scheduled maintenance development. Finally, the fourth result is a proposed Cost Rate Function (CRF) model supported by a graphical approach. The approach can be used to identify the optimum maintenance interval and frequencies of Failure Finding Inspection (FFI) and to develop a combination of FFI and restoration tasks for the aircraft’s repairable items which are experiencing aging. These results are related to some of the specific industrial challenges, and are expected to enhance the capability of making effective and efficient decisions during the development <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> tasks. The results have been verified through interaction with experienced practitioners within major aviation manufacturers and air operators.

40|$|Over thе years, thе {{significance}} of thе purpose <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> and thе management <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> has further developed.

40|$|Abstract — The {{applications}} {{of planning and}} design solutions are cradle for the building defects and maintenance issues related with design faults of the built environment. Maintenance that emerges from deficient design indicates that the building design has not been conceded in perception <b>of</b> building <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Reviewing</b> the nature <b>of</b> deficient design and resulting maintenance problems in various built forms reveals that housing sector is most effective of this phenomenon. The reason can be set as since all the population of world is living {{in some form of}} shelter/enclosure called house. Adoption of the information technology (IT) standard has not only heightened the need for IT knowledge but also extend the capabilities of many designers/architects and builders. Therefore there is niche to develop an integrated hub that could regulate the function of each professional involved in building processes. This paper will look into the prospectus to develop the automated monitoring system to check the performance of low and medium cost housing. Furthermore this paper will also highlights the stages of research to accomplish integrated monitoring system for housing performance. In the last section of paper it would be justified that integrated monitoring system could be considered as the problem solving scheme to attain the rational solution to check the housing performance and quality at post occupational stage, particularly in developing regions...|$|R
