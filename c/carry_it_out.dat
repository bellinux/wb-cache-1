5|$|The JNA {{learned about}} Croatia's {{intention}} {{to develop its}} own military force from JNA Captain Vladimir Jager, a double agent employed by Croatia and the JNA Counterintelligence Service (KOS). The JNA devised Operation Shield (Štit), aimed at disarming the Croatian forces and the arrest and trial of the Croatian leadership, in response. Although the operation was prepared by December 1990, federal Defence Minister General Veljko Kadijević never sought authorisation to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> from the Yugoslav Presidency. Instead, he ordered the KOS to stand down on the morning the operation was scheduled to begin.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} was particularly keen {{to secure the}} release of Major Andy Harrison—the last British UNMO being held by the RUF. Harrison's contingent of UNMOs was protected by an Indian Army detachment. The Indian Army Gurkhas—attached to UNAMSIL—were under siege by the RUF at their base in Kailahun. The British and Indian commands in Sierra Leone had devised a plan to extract the UNMOs. British special forces remained in the country, ready to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> but the UN and the British command feared that the RUF would retaliate against other UNAMSIL forces they had besieged if the UNMOs were extracted. Thus, Major General Vijay Kumar Jetley, Commander of UNAMSIL, was allowed to continue negotiations {{for the release of}} the other besieged UNAMSIL contingents.|$|E

5|$|The Communist Party of Yugoslavia {{played no}} part in the coup, {{although}} it made {{a significant contribution to}} the mass street protests in many cities that signalled popular support for the coup after it occurred. The coup was successful and overthrew the three-member regency: Prince Paul, Dr. Radenko Stanković and Dr. Ivo Perović, as well as the government of Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković. Two days before the coup, the Cvetković government had signed the Vienna Protocol on the Accession of Yugoslavia to the Tripartite Pact (Axis). The coup had been planned for several months, but the signing of the Tripartite Pact spurred the organisers to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> encouraged by the British Special Operations Executive.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} plan—drafted {{under the}} direction of the Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Toyoda Soemu—called for Yamato and her escorts to attack the U.S. fleet supporting the U.S. troops landing on the west of the island. Yamato and her escorts were to fight their way to Okinawa and then beach themselves between Higashi and Yomitan and fight as shore batteries until they were destroyed. Once the ships were destroyed, their surviving crewmembers were supposed to abandon ship and fight U.S. forces on land. Very little, if any, air cover could be provided for the ships, which would render them almost helpless to concentrated attacks from US carrier-based aircraft. In preparation for executing the plan, the assigned ships left Kure for Tokuyama, Yamaguchi, off Mitajiri, Japan, on 29 March. However, despite obeying orders to prepare for the mission, Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō—commander of the Ten-Go force—still refused to actually order his ships to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> believing the plan to be futile and wasteful.|$|E
5|$|Castelli also {{abolished}} the mita in Upper Peru, a mandatory form {{of public service}} that bordered on slavery. Mariano Moreno has also wished to end the mita, but Moreno had resigned from the Junta by this point. Without Castelli being in Buenos Aires to mediate between them, the disputes between Moreno and Saavedra had worsened. The Junta requested that Castelli should moderate his actions, but he went ahead with the positions he shared with Moreno. Several Saavedrist officers, such as José María Echaurri, José León Domínguez, Matías Balbastro, chaplain Manuel Antonio Azcurra, and sergeant major Toribio de Luzuriaga, planned to kidnap Castelli, deliver him to Buenos Aires for trial, and give command of the Army of the North to Juan Jose Viamonte. However, Viamonte did not accept the plan when he was informed by the conspirators, and {{did not attempt to}} <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> When Castelli knew about Moreno's resignation, he wrote a letter to Vieytes, Rodriguez Peña, Larrea, and Azcuénaga, asking them to move to Upper Peru. If they defeated Goyeneche, they planned to march back to Buenos Aires. However, the letter was sent via the common postal service, and the postmaster of Córdoba, Jose de Paz, decided to send it instead to Cornelio Saavedra. The Morenist members of the Junta had already been ousted and exiled by that point.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire was led by Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander Robert Burke, who issued his report on March 8, 1967 {{and found that the}} unloading operation had not had the supervision required to safely <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Burke specifically cited the lack of a marine chemist on the scene, as required by the Fire Department, and an expert in inerting procedures, as recommended by the National Fire Protection Association.|$|E
25|$|The program {{implementation}} {{was mostly}} {{left to the}} individual schools, which did not consistently <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Additionally, educating a generation is a long process, for which the League was not prepared. There was no consensus {{as to how the}} Irish language should be reinstituted; the League and schools did not develop a system assessment plan to monitor progress. As a result, the movement lost strength, and the number of native Irish speakers has been in steady decline.|$|E

Construction projects were usually the domain of eunuchs, who were often assigned to supervise it. The treasure fleet's construction was not different in that eunuchs were assigned to supervise it, while the military were assigned to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Civil officials criticized the state expenses brought forth by the fleet's construction. Despite the criticism, the Yongle Emperor was keen on continuing his grand plans.|$|E

However, Isobe testified later that he had rejected these suggestions and continued to make arrangements for the attack on Saionji. According to his account, the attack was only canceled after the officers assigned to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> (teachers at a military school in Toyohashi) could not agree over the use of cadets in the operation.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in July 1914, Callaghan set sail in his flagship, the battleship HMS Iron Duke, for his war station at Scapa Flow. There he met his successor-designate Sir John Jellicoe who had received orders from First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill to relieve the ageing Callaghan of command of his fleet. Jellicoe had resisted the order, believing it would cause tension in the fleet, but the order was confirmed by the Admiralty and Jellicoe was instructed to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Callaghan was bitterly disappointed not to command his fleet in the war he had completely readied it for.|$|E
25|$|Left {{with little}} {{political}} power and flexibility, the CUP began to plan a coup against Kâmil Pasha's Freedom and Accord government. In addition, an animosity had already been brewing between Kâmil Pasha and the CUP since the 1908 Young Turk Revolution that had started the Second Constitutional Era. During the {{more than four years}} since, Kâmil Pasha had made a series of efforts to keep CUP members far from government and keep the army, which had many CUP members among its ranks, out of politics. By January 1913, the CUP was thoroughly frustrated with Kâmil Pasha and Freedom and Accord. Although the coup was to be a surprise attack, the CUP had made definitive decisions to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> far in advance.|$|E

25|$|The {{executive}} order to disband AK entirely came from Gen. Leopold Okulicki on 18 January 1945. The 5th Brigade refused to <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> The shifting of {{the borders of}} Poland and the annexation of {{eastern half of the}} Second Polish Republic by Joseph Stalin was ratified by the new communist authorities in postwar Poland on August 16, 1945. The process of expulsions of Poles and Belarusians kicked into full swing. Remaining in Puszcza Białowieska and still growing in numbers, the 5th Brigade led by Szendzielarz fought a successful battle against the units of the Red Army, the pro-Soviet Polish People's Army, and the MBP security forces in around Miodusy-Dworaki village in Siemiatycze County on 18 August 1945. Nevertheless, faced with overwhelming concentration of the enemy forces, Major Szendzielarz ordered the dissolution of the 5th Brigade on 7 September 1945. Rajs refused to surrender.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} called {{more than}} 130 witnesses and introduced more than 400 {{pieces of evidence}} intended to prove that Muhammad undertook the murders and ordered Malvo to help <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Evidence included a rifle, found in Muhammad's car, that was linked by ballistics tests not only to 8 of the 10 killings in the Washington area but also to two others, in Louisiana and Alabama; the car itself, which was modified so that a sniper could shoot from inside the trunk; and a laptop computer, {{also found in the}} car, that contained maps with icons pinpointing shooting scenes. Witness accounts that put Muhammad across the street from one shooting and his car near the scene of several others. There was also a recorded phone call to a police hotline in which a man, his voice identified by a detective as Muhammad's, demanded money in exchange for stopping the shootings.|$|E
25|$|Bruxism {{can cause}} {{significant}} tooth wear {{if it is}} severe, and sometimes dental restorations (crowns, fillings etc.) are damaged or lost, sometimes repeatedly. Most dentists therefore prefer to keep dental treatment in people with bruxism very simple and only <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> when essential, since any dental work is likely to fail in the long term. Dental implants and complex bridgework for example are relatively contraindicated in bruxists. In the case of crowns, {{the strength of the}} restoration becomes more important, sometimes at the cost of aesthetic considerations. E.g. a full coverage gold crown, which has a degree of flexibility and also involves less removal (and therefore less weakening) of the underlying natural tooth may be more appropriate than other types of crown which are primarily designed for esthetics rather than durability. Porcelain veneers on the incisors are particularly vulnerable to damage, and sometimes a crown can be perforated by occlusal wear.|$|E

25|$|The Fard Salah {{are all of}} the {{compulsory}} Muslim prayers - {{the five}} daily prayers, {{as well as the}} Friday prayer (Salat al-Jumu'ah) and the Eid prayers (Eid prayers). Non-performance of any these prayers renders one a non-Muslim according to the stricter Hanbali madhhab of Sunni Islam, while the other Sunni madhhabs simply consider doing so a major sin. However, all four madhhabs agree by consensus that denial of the compulsory status of these prayers invalidates the faith of those who do so, rendering them non-Muslim. Fardh prayers (as with all fard actions) are further classed as fard al-ayn (obligation of the self) and fard al-kifayah (obligation of sufficiency). Fard al-Ayn are actions considered obligatory on individuals, for which the individual will be held to account if the actions are neglected. Fard al-Kifayah are actions considered obligatory on the Muslim community at large, so that if some people within the community <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> no Muslim is considered blameworthy, but if no one carries it out, all incur a collective punishment.|$|E
