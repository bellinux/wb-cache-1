40|$|Abstract. One of {{the steps}} during the {{implantation}} of hearing aids and cochlea implants {{is the creation of}} a shallow implant bed in the thin skull bone. Correct placement of the implant is paramount but difficult to achieve preoperatively. The profile of the calotte, which can be determined through e. g. 3 D imaging, is important for this task. Additionally, in a robot-based surgical operation, the final position and orientation of the implant must be known before milling starts to ensure optimal fitting. We present an algorithm which allows semi-automatic determination of this optimal placement through both the planning system and the surgeon. The <b>computer</b> <b>supports</b> the surgeons with his speed and accuracy, while the robot aids in the precise execution. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a test of}} a computer's floating-point arithmetic unit. The test has two goals.

This model was developed as an aid in the design, analysis, implementation and testing of portable, high-quality numerical software. If a <b>computer</b> <b>supports</b> the arithmetic model, then software written using the model will perform correctly and to specified accuracy on that machine. The second goal of the test is to check that the basic operations perform as the manufacturer intended.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{selected}} {{literature suggests that}} integrating multi-media <b>computer</b> <b>supports</b> with activity schedules {{can be an effective}} way to teach students to manage their work, play, and skill-building activities independently. Activity schedules originally were a means of promoting independent execution of previously learned responses by using pictures and words in notebooks or lists to cue a student’s performance of a se-quence of activities. As activity schedules subsequently became more technologically elaborate, they also evolved as a means of expanding existing repertoires. Preliminary studies illustrate how activity schedules delivered on the computer may engen-der new learning via the videos, sounds, dialogue, images, and words employed as instructional stimuli. For the researcher, the blend of computer and notebook activity schedules provides a framework for studies on teaching play, socialization, and com-munication. For the practitioner, use of activity schedules ad-dresses pressing needs to teach generative and functional skills. Many special educators are familiar with the class ofremedial techniques known generically as “visualsupports. ” One currently popular form of visual support is broadly referred to as the “activity schedule...|$|E
40|$|Self-explaining, which asks {{students}} to generate explanations while reading a text, is a self-constructive activity and is helpful for students ’ learning. Studies {{have revealed that}} prompts by a human tutor promote students’ self-explanations. However, most studies on self-explaining focus on spoken self-explanations. This study investigates the effects of two kinds of content-free <b>computer</b> <b>supports</b> for self-explaining: one is full-text reading and modifiable typing interface {{and the other is}} prompting. The results showed that self-explaining in a full-text reading and modifiable typing interface, particularly when prompted, made students perform better in applying target procedural knowledge to similar problems than reading did. The results also showed that typing self-explaining can make similar high-quality self-explanation proportion to spoken self-explaining. In addition, this study investigates the effects of content-free prompts by comparing with no prompts and with contentrelated prompts. This study uses the computer as a learning companion to provide prompts without understanding the content of students ’ self-explanations.

40|$|Inter-organizational {{scheduling}} is a process, {{where two}} or more organizations coordinate activities for mutual benefits. Decision making {{in such an environment}} is a multi-criteria, multi-party practice, including cooperation between parties. It is characterized by distributed, dynamic, ill-defined and conflicting information. As this information {{is in the form of}} tacit knowledge, its efficient transference between organizations is not possible through databases and computer-supported tools. Therefore human collective work remains a key factor in interorganizational scheduling. This, comprising interaction between human operators, algorithms, software, and autonomous agents implies a need for structural and functional concepts. In this paper, inter-organizational dynamic collective work is studied using a cognitive-based analysis. Our aim is to identify the key factors affecting the process. Through a comparative review of the literature, it is argued that cooperative processes, involving coordination mechanisms, are one component of collaborative states in collective works in scheduling between organizations. In such a way, in collaborative scheduling, group and domain knowledge and tasks, group knowledge, group decision processes, and cooperative activities play a key role. This approach can contribute in system analysis, (re) design, and evaluation as well as designing <b>computer</b> <b>supports</b> in inter-organizational scheduling...|$|E

In the encirclement of more and more intensive use of computer techniques that help to CAAT all the aims and the volume of auditing do not change when the audit is done in the computer-informatics environment. The computer assisted audit technique (CAATs) can improve the efficiency and productivity of audit procedures. In the computerized information system, the CAATs are the ways in which an auditor can use computer to gather or as help in gathering auditing evidence. There are more reasons why the auditors apply computer techniques that help in auditing. Most often, they do it to achieve improvement of auditing efficiency when the data volume is large. It depends on several factors whether the auditors will apply the computer techniques that help auditing and to what degree respectively. If they do it, the most important are the computer knowledge, professional skill, experience of auditors, and availability of computer technique, and adequacy of <b>computer</b> <b>supports,</b> infeasibility of hand tests, efficiency and time limit.
