5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the naming convention of optical filters where {{the name of the}} filter denotes the wavelengths that are blocked, and in line with the convention for air filters and oil filters, photographic filters are named for the color of light they pass. Thus a blue filter makes the picture look blue. A black filter marginally allows more light in the blue wavelength to pass resulting in a slight shift of the color temperature of the photo to a cooler color. Because of this, the term [...] "IR filters" [...] is commonly used to refer to filters that pass infrared light while completely blocking other wavelengths. However, in some applications the term [...] "IR filter" [...] still {{can be used as a}} synonym of infrared <b>cut-off</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{communication}} describes for {{the first}} time how nano-size particles, sensitized with natural dye molecules of anthocyanin, can be used as catalysts in photo-degradation of gram negative Escherichia coli bacteria in water. The naked ZnO nano-particles degraded up to 83 % of the bacteria under solar simulator light, while the dye-sensitized particles increased the bacterial loss by ∼ 10 %. Solar simulator light includes about 5 % of UV tail (shorter than 400 nm) which means that both UV and visible light (longer than 400 nm) radiations could be involved. When a <b>cut-off</b> <b>filter</b> was used, the naked ZnO caused only 40 % bacterial loss, in accordance with earlier literature that described killing of bacteria with ZnO particles both in the dark and under light. With the <b>cut-off</b> <b>filter,</b> the sensitized ZnO particles caused higher than 90 % bacterial loss, which confirms sensitization of the ZnO particles to visible light. Moreover, the results show that the catalyzed photo-degradation process causes mineralization of the bacteria and their organic internal components which leach out by killing. The catalyst can be recovered and reused losing ∼ 10 % of its activity each time due to mineralization of the dye molecules. However, catalyst activity can be totally regained by re-sensitizing it with the anthocyanin dye. The effects of different experimental conditions, such as reaction temperature, pH, bacterial concentration and catalyst amount together with nutrient broth and saline media, will be discussed together with the role of the sensitizer...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 More than 3700 fertilized toad {{eggs were}} used {{in a series of}} studies {{designed}} {{to determine the effects of}} UV-B radiation (290 - 315 nm) on temporal developmental patterns, systematic development and viability prior to metamorphic climax. The eggs were exposed to radiation from either "white-light" fluorescent lamps (Vita-Lite, Duro-Test Corporation, North Bergen, New Jersey) or "white-light" fluorescent lamps plus fluorescent sunlamps (Westinghouse- FS 40). Several radiation exposure schedules were utilized (chronic or varied, daily exposures) and, in all but one study, filters were utilized - Kodacel <b>cut-off</b> <b>filters</b> to transmit wavelengths longer than 290 nm and Mylar <b>cut-off</b> <b>filters</b> to transmit wavelengths longer than 315 nm. These filters provided a transmission "window" in the UV-B region. Exposure of the developing tadpoles on a daily basis to eleven or more Sunburn Units of UV-B radiation per day resulted in the development of tadpole populations with lordotic posture, hyperplasia in the presumptive cornea and other dorsal epithelial tissue, increased pigmentation in the presumptive cornea, desquamation of areas of the dorsal surface, and increased mortality. Exposure of the tadpoles on a daily basis to 4. 4 Sunburn Units of UV-B radiation per day resulted in a significant lengthening of the time periods required to achieve metamorphic climax. Biological photoreactivation of ultraviolet damage was demonstrable with three groups of tadpoles exposed to comparable daily exposures of UV-B radiation (11. 0 Sunburn Units per day) at a comparable rate (1. 1 Sunburn Units per hour) from similar sources. The critical differences between the groups was the duration of exposure to UV-A and visible radiation (0, 2 and 4 hours) following the termination of the UV-B exposure...|$|R

40|$|Large eddy {{simulation}} (LES) {{with additional}} filtering of the non-linear term, also coined LES with double decomposition of the subgrid-scale stress, is considered. In the literature, {{this approach is}} mainly encountered in combination with pseudo-spectral discretization methods. In this case, the additional filter is a sharp <b>cut-off</b> <b>filter,</b> which appears in the eventual computational algorithm as the 2 / 3 -dealiasing procedure. In the present paper, the LES approach with additional filtering of the non-linear term is evaluated in a spatial, finite-difference discretization approach. The sharp <b>cut-off</b> <b>filter</b> used in pseudo-spectral methods is then replaced by a spectral-like filter, which is formulated and discretized in physical space. As suggested in the literature, the filter width of this spectral-like filter corresponds at least to 3 / 2 times the grid spacing h to avoid aliasing. Furthermore, spectral-like discretization of the derivatives are constructed such that derivative-discretization errors are low in the wavenumber range resolved by the filter, i. e. 0 kh 2 / 3. The resulting method in combination with a Smagorinsky model is tested for decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence and compared to standard lower-order discretization methods. Further, an analysis is elaborated of the Galilean-invariance problem, which arises when LES in double decomposition approach is combined with filters, which do not correspond to an orthogonal projection. The effects of a Galilean coordinate transformation on LES results, are identified in simulations, and we demonstrate that a Galilean transformation leads to wavenumber-dependent shifts of the energy spectra.
