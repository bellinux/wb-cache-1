The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering.

Coloring techniques depend upon time, temperature, surface preparation, humidity and other variables. Pre-patinated copper sheets are produced by fabricators under controlled environments using patented chemical processes. Green patina finishes are primarily developed using acid chloride or acid sulfate. Treatments with ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac), cuprous chloride/hydrochloric acid, and ammonium sulfate are somewhat successful. Statuary finishes can be produced in light, medium, and dark brown, depending on the concentration and number of coloring applications. One advantage is that the treatment disguises surface markings on bright mill finish copper and can advance the natural patination process.|$|E

40|$|Copper {{and copper}} alloys {{are widely used}} in {{architectural}} applications {{to take advantage of}} their inherent range of colors. While these metals may be used in their natural color, as fabricated, it is sometimes desirable to chemically color pure copper (C 11000 *), commercial bronze (C 22000), architectural bronze (C 38500) or other alloys referred to as “bronze ” in architectural parlance. The most common colors to be produced are referred to as brown or statuary finishes for bronze and green or patina finishes for copper.

40|$|The <b>chemical,</b> <b>color</b> and {{strength}} properties of thermally modified cultivated 15 -year-old Acacia hybrid were investigated. Logs of A. hybrid were harvested and cut at the bottom, middle and top sections. The wood later underwent hot oil thermal modification using palm oil at temperatures 180, 200 and 220 ºC for 30, 60 and 90 min. Untreated wood {{was used as}} control. The hot oil thermal modification process caused some features changed in the <b>chemical</b> composition, <b>color</b> appearances {{and strength}} properties of A. hybrid wood. Parameters such as temperatures and treatment time were closely monitored as they influence the <b>chemical,</b> <b>color</b> and strength changes in the treated wood. Temperatures of 180, 200 and 220 ºC, and treatment time of 1, 2 and 3 h. {{were used in the}} study. The degradation in holocellulose, cellulose, and hemicellulose contents was recognized when acacia woods were exposed to oil thermally modified process. Holocellulose and celulose degraded with the increasing of treatment temperature and duration of heating exposure, while lignin showed the increment in content through this treatment. The color changes in the sapwood and heartwood were measured using the Minolta Chroma-meter CR- 310 and the results are presented according to the CIE L* a* b* color co-ordinates system. The results show that temperature at certain treatment time enhanced and darkened the treated wood. The color of the treated sapwood can be enhanced to match the color of the natural A. hybrid heartwood. The strength properties of the oil heat treated A. hybrid wood decreases in values of both MOR and MOE throughout the treatment process.
