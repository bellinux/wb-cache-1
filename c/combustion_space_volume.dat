An elongated heat pipe is mounted longitudinally in the casing and is offset from and extends alongside the <b>combustion</b> <b>space.</b> The heat pipe is in heat transmitting relationship with the air intake conduit for heating incoming air.

The methane-air combustion characteristics in the <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> were examined with and without catalytic platinum wires. The installing locations and scale effects of the platinum wires were varied to distinguish between thermo-fluidic and catalytic effects. Temperature distribution through the channels and the compositions of burned gas were measured. Conclusively, the platinum wires in the upstream channel slightly enhanced flame stabilization by an enhanced heat transfer, not by a catalytic reaction. In contrast, the platinum wire located within the recirculation area of the <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> promoted the catalytic reaction and extended the self-sustainable reaction conditions when it had sufficient surface area. Two reaction regimes, of an ordinary gas reaction and of a catalytic reaction, were distinguished and a hysteresis in the reaction-mode transition was confirmed through the comparison of CO, O 2, and methane across the transition conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three dimensional {{study of a}} gas-fired, regenerative, side-port glass melting furnace. The furnace {{is divided into three}} regions: <b>combustion</b> <b>space,</b> glass tank and batch blanket. The <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> is simulated separately, while the glass tank and the batch blanket are coupled together as a whole. To couple the three regions, a new method is proposed that is more flexible and faster than the existing conventional methods. The melting process of the batch blanket, the natural convection vortices of the glass tank and the turbulence and the chemical reactions of the <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> are all simulated. The simulation was preformed using Gambit- 2 and Fluent- 6 software. The calculated temperatures are compared with actual values measured at different locations on the furnace surfaces.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{computer model}} has been developed that is suitable for predicting and analyzing combustion, fluid flow and heat transfer in the <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> of glass melting furnaces. The model is capable of simulating gas flow, heat transfer, and the major chemical reactions within the <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> of a furnace. The model solves the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow along {{with a series of}} additional conservation equations for energy, turbulence and combustion. The k- 2 ̆ 6 epsiv; model is incorporated for turbulence, discrete ordinates method for radiation heat transfer and an assumed PDF method is used for combustion modeling. ^ The model was validated against two sets of experimental data. Good agreement between predictions of wall and roof temperatures and measurements were obtained, often well within the reported experimental error. Satisfactory results were also achieved for load heat fluxes for the two different experimental furnaces. ^ Results from simulations of the <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> of a gas-fired glass melting furnace are presented and discussed. Three separate parametric studies were conducted to give insight into the <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> of the glass melting furnace that was modeled.

40|$|A typical {{glass furnace}} {{consists}} of a <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> and a melter. Intense heat is generated from the combustion of fuel and air/oxygen in the <b>combustion</b> <b>space.</b> This heat is transferred mainly by radiation to the melter in order to melt sand and cullet (scrap glass) eventually creating glass products. Many furnaces use electric boosters to enhance glass melting and increase productivity. The coupled electric/combustion heat transfer patterns are key to the glass making processes. The understanding of the processes {{can lead to the}} improvement of glass quality and furnace efficiency. The effects of electrical boosting on the flow patterns and heat transfer in a glass melter are investigated using a multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code with addition of an electrical boosting model. The results indicate that the locations and spacing of the electrodes have large impacts on the velocity and temperature distributions in the glass melter. With the same total heat input, the batch shape (which is determined by the overall heat transfer and the batch melting rate) is kept almost the same. This indicates that electric boosting can be used to replace part of heat by combustion. Therefore, temperature is lower in the <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> and the life of the furnace can be prolonged. The electric booster {{can also be used to}} increase productivity without increasing the furnace size...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{simulation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} powerful tools for the design, optimisation and trouble shooting of glass melting furnaces.

Besides the computation of the flow fields and the energy equation, the main models are: batch, electrical boosting, bubbling, stirring, foam, combustion, turbulence, radiative heat transfer, volatilisation and refractory corrosion. Particle tracing, with the computation of glass quality indices, and the computation of the melt-redox state is also integrated in the program.

40|$|Background: Loss {{of hearing}} is a {{national}} health problem with significant social and psychosocial implications. Worldwide there are about 65 - 330 million people affected with hearing impairment, of which 60 % suffers from significant hearing loss. Role of tympanic membrane and ossicular chain in the physiology of hearing is well documented. The emergence of {{the role played by}} mastoid air <b>space</b> <b>volume</b> in sound transmission is being critically evaluated these days. The present study is designed to analyze the effect of mastoid air <b>space</b> <b>volume</b> in tympanic membrane perforation with conductive hearing loss. Methods: 32 subjects both male and female with medium sized tympanic membrane perforation were included in the study. They were grouped into two (those with sclerotic and cellular mastoid). Hearing threshold assessed using pure tone audiometer. Mastoid air <b>space</b> <b>volume</b> evaluated using digital X-ray mastoid schuller's view.

Results: The hearing loss in first group having cellular mastoid and second group with sclerotic mastoid were 22. 82 +/- 6. 28 and 27. 82 +/- 5. 66 respectively.
