25|$|The urate to {{creatinine}} (breakdown {{product of}} creatine phosphate in muscle) <b>concentration</b> <b>ratio</b> in urine is elevated. This {{is a good}} indicator of acid overproduction. For children under ten years of age with LNS, a urate to creatinine ratio above two is typically found. Twenty-four-hour urate excretion of more than 20mg/kg is also typical but is not diagnostic. Hyperuricemia (serum uric acid concentration of >8mg/dL) is often present but not reliable enough for diagnosis. Activity of the HGPRT enzyme in cells from any type of tissue (e.g., blood, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphoblasts) that is less than 1.5% of normal enzyme activity confirms the diagnosis of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Molecular genetic studies of the HPRT gene mutations may confirm diagnosis, and are particularly helpful for subsequent 'carrier testing' in at-risk females such as close family relatives on the female side.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{data on the}} {{behavior}} of radionuclides in aquatic ecosystems are needed for radioecological modeling, which is commonly used for predicting transfer of radionuclides, estimating doses, and assessing possible adverse effects on species and communities. Preliminary studies of radioecological parameters including distribution coefficients and <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios,</b> for 90 Sr and 137 Cs were not in full agreement with the default values used in the ERICA Tool and the RESRAD BIOTA codes. The unique radiation situation in the Techa River, which was contaminated by long-lived radionuclides (90 Sr and 137 Cs) {{in the middle of the}} last century allows improved knowledge about these parameters for river systems. Therefore, the study was focused on the evaluation of radioecological parameters (distribution coefficients and <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios</b> for 90 Sr and 137 Cs) for the Techa River and the Miass River, which is assumed as a comparison waterbody. To achieve the aim the current contamination of biotic and abiotic components of the river ecosystems was studied; distribution coefficients for 90 Sr and 137 Cs were calculated; <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios</b> of 90 Sr and 137 Cs for three fish species (roach, perch and pike), gastropods and filamentous algae were evaluated. Study results were then compared with default values available for use in the well-known computer codes ERICA Tool and RESRAD BIOTA (when site-specific data are not available). We show that the <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios</b> of 137 Cs in whole fish bodies depend on the predominant type of nutrition (carnivores and phytophagous). The results presented here are useful in the context of improving of tools for assessing concentrations of radionuclides in biota, which could rely on a wider range of ecosystem information compared with the process limited the current versions of ERICA and RESRAD codes. Further, the <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios</b> of 90 Sr are species-specific and strongly dependent on Ca 2 + concentration in water. The universal characteristic allows us to combine the data of fish caught in the water with different mineralization by multiplying the concentration of Ca 2 +. The <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios</b> for fishes were well-fitted by Generalized Logistic Distribution function (GLD). In conclusion, the GLD can be used for probabilistic modeling of the <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios</b> in freshwater fishes to improve the confidence in the modeling results.

40|$|Using the Amadeus firm-level database, {{this paper}} {{examines}} sector-specific indicators {{of competition in}} a number of Central, Eastern and Southeastern European (CESEE) countries. More specifically, it provides an overview of two key indicators of the level of competition, namely profit margins and the concentration of sales, across 27 industries in 13 CESEE countries. We discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} various indicators of competition that are commonly used in the literature and explain why we use the aforementioned proxy 2 variables for the intensity of competition. The paper then provides a cross-country and cross-sector overview of the differences in these competition indicators for the period from 1999 to 2007 before empirically identifying the main determinants of these differences. We find large differences between individual sectors, while differences between countries are considerably smaller. Profit margins and <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios</b> are notably high in communications, finance, housing, and miscellaneous goods and services. Manufacturing achieves, on average, lower profit margins and <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios</b> than other sectors. Over time, profit margins have increased in most sectors as a result of the rapid catching-up process in the CESEE region, while <b>concentration</b> <b>ratios</b> have declined, suggesting that the region is still in a phase of rapid market expansion. We observe some indication of an increase in competition in only a handful of sectors, e. g. housing and utilities, passenger transport, and information services.
