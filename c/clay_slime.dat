5000|$|Critics {{argue that}} each holding pond has been {{perceived}} as a risk that threatens water quality, public health, wildlife, and the regional economy. Dams restraining the ponds have overflowed or burst, sending a slurry of clay into the river, and coating the riverbed for many miles with a toxic <b>clay</b> <b>slime</b> that suffocates flora and fauna. One such incident in 1971 killed over three million fish when [...] of phosphate waste swept into the river, causing an estimated 5 ft tide of slime that spread into adjacent pastures and wetlands. Since the 1971 spill, clay settling areas are now constructed as engineered dams. No such spills have occurred from any settling areas built to these standards. The current dams withstood three hurricanes which crossed the Bone Valley in 2004.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{industrial}} and commercial expansion {{in recent years}} has created the need for more land. One of the op-tions to create more land is to reclaim ex-mining land. Ex-mining land contains numerous mined out lakes and ponds. Numerous methods are available to fill these lakes and ponds. The ex-mining land consists of a variety of materi-als, such as sand, <b>clay,</b> <b>slime</b> and organic peat. A new land-fill method, which is economically competitive, technologi-cally feasible and will not contribute to any environmental problems, was developed. It is based on flocculation of slurry slime with Natural Organic Polymer (NOP) or Poly Vinyl Acetate (PVC), mixed with residual soil and usage of the flocculated slurry slime as part of the fill material. The physical and geotechnical properties of the floccu-lated slurry were assessed by laboratory tests, including pH and Eh measurements, acid neutralization capacity de-termination, hydraulic conductivity and comparison and cost analysis with conventional fill materials, such as sands. The flocculated slurry slime was slightly alkaline, with pH 8. 4, Eh value of 171 mV, negligible ANC, and hy-draulic conductivity of 8 x 10 – 5 - 7 x 10 – 4 m/s. It was also found that the material is unlikely to cause significant change in redox conditions of the subsurface environment over a long-term period. The proposed method is more feasible as compared to other methods in comparison and cost analysis. In general, the flocculated slurry slime is suit-able {{to be used as a}} fill material for land reclamation...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{dewatering}} {{of mineral}} waste tailings and subsequent disposal are important issues which confront the mining and mineral processing industry world-wide. Conventional, ore treatment and hydrometallurgical processes {{used in the}} extraction of value metals from low grade ores involve the production of fine particles via grinding for desired liberation. They require the utilisation of voluminous amounts of water, generating equivalently large volumes of intractable waste tails of low solid density. For <b>clay</b> <b>slimes,</b> flocculation and thickening operations used for dewatering produce fast settling rate but low sediment consolidation, even {{after several years of}} impoundment in dams; warranting alternative, cost-effective methods for enhanced dewaterability. In the present work, electroosmotic dewatering and consolidation of model and real kaolinite and smectite clay mineral pulps were investigated. The study focused on probing the specific influence of variables such as the dispersion pH, supernatant (electrolyte) concentration, voltage input, and current reversal/intermittence on electrical energy consumption during electroosmosis and establishing optimum physico-chemical conditions conducive to the electroosmotic dewatering process. Remarkable efficacy in electroosmotic consolidation, reflecting a dramatic increase in <b>clay</b> <b>slimes</b> sediment loading by 20 - 30 wt per cent to 'spadeable' pulps was readily achieved at acceptable power consumption rates under laboratory scale conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Hot water {{extraction}} of bitumen from Alberta oil sands generates {{large quantities of}} tailings slurry. The fine grained sludge component of this waste is the most troublesome because of its stability and poor compaction potential. Dispersed bitumen, and organic matter that is insoluble in common solvents (IOM), {{are associated with the}} fines contained in these <b>clay</b> <b>slimes.</b> This organic matter is believed to be partly responsible for the intractability of the sludge, and it could therefore {{play an important role in}} determining the behavioural characteristics of oil sand slimes. In previous investigations we had attempted to enrich the insoluble organic matter by dissolving the minerals in concentrated HCl/HF. As a result of this treatment the inorganic material is decomposed, but the organic constituents are also likely to undergo significant changes. In the present work we have attempted a milder HCl/HF treatment for mineral dissolution. The results from the current investigation are compared with the results of the previous study to assess the chemical alterations of the organic matter resulting from the two treatments.

40|$|Two {{commercial}} oil sand extraction plants in Alberta generate {{vast quantities of}} tailings slurry {{as a result of}} the hot water extraction of bitumen from tar sands. The fine grained sludge component of this waste is the most troublesome because of its stability and poor compaction potential. Considerable quantities of organic matter are strongly associated with the fines contained in these <b>clay</b> <b>slimes.</b> This organic matter. is believed to be partly responsible for the intractability of the sludge and it could therefore play an important role in determining the nature of slime stability. In this investigation we have isolated organic matter from the mineral fines present in the Syncrude sludge pond tailings. The sludge was fvst fractionated into recoverable bitumen, sediment and suspension using an oil phase agglomeration technique. The organic matter, associated with the clay fines present in the suspension, was then concentrated by dissolving the mineral matter in HCUHF. These fractions have been characterized using elemental analysis and solid state 13 C NMRspectroscopy. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Cassiterite {{extraction}} in West Malaysia {{has left}} a legacy of some 80, 000 hectares of nutrient-poor, drought-prone, quartz sandy tailings. Their proximity to urban centres has long made them a target for agricultural and forestry enterprises, and various techniques {{have been developed to}} overcome their intractability, including amendment with bulky organic matter and replacement with natural soils. Although reasonably successful, these approaches have often failed to acknowledge that a percentage of the original heavy mineral suite remains in sandy tailings, exerting possible phytotoxic effects and certainly raising concerns about the suitability of sandy tailings for agronomic crop production. To determine {{the nature and extent of}} trace element contamination of sandy tailings, ten different areas were identified and sampled in the states of Selangor and Perak. Preliminary analyses failed to corroborate earlier discoveries of elevated mercury and cadmium status, but lead, zinc, arsenic, uranium and rare earth elements were all common. However, greater concentrations of all these elements were found in <b>clay</b> (<b>slime)</b> tailings, which had been colonized by dense vegetation cover. This indicated that levels of trace elements in sandy tailings were not of themselves phytotoxic, but in the context of reduced nutrient availability, might exert a disproportionate influence on their colonization by plants. The colonization of sandy tailings by Melastoma malabathricum was therefore examined, revealing that in two of four sites, water contents were greater in colonized areas than the rest of each site. Macronutrient concentrations were also greater in colonized tailings, as were concentrations of zinc and manganese, but whether these were the cause or result of plant establishment could not be determined conclusively. Overall, trace element distribution in sandy tailings did not influence colonization by Melastoma, although in three of four populations, foliar concentrations of uranium were greater than those of a population growing on a natural soil. This has serious implications for the agronomic use of sandy tailings. The effects of bulky organic and clay amendment of sandy tailings on the availability and uptake of trace elements has never before been examined. A tropical greenhouse experiment was undertaken to examine the effects of peat and clay on the growth and trace element chemistry of Panicum miliaceum and Pueraria phaseoloides. The use of symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi was also included, since although these often improve the phosphorus nutrition of their hosts, they might also increase trace element uptake from pools sorbed by organic matter. Neither clay nor peat improved the growth of either plant species. However, addition of clay substantially increased the availability of aluminium and trace elements, and its use in rehabilitation attempts cannot be recommended. In contrast, peat reduced the availability of Co, Cu, As, La, Ce and U, whilst simultaneously improving the ECEC of sandy tailings. The effects of mycorrhizal inoculation were difficult to interpret, since the carrier medium used (predominantly zeolite) drastically altered the chemistry of soils to which it was added. Growth of Panicum and Pueraria was equally poor on two of three naturally sandy soils. Adding peat to sandy tailings produced plants with similar foliar chemistry to those grown on natural soils, suggesting that plant communities established on these natural siliceous media could act as models for the sustainable rehabilitation of anthropic mine tailings - something which has never before been suggested. A range of native species are recommended as having potential for further research into naturalistic rehabilitation.

In this investigation the settling behaviour of the sludge was studied after removal of emulsified bitumen by an oil phase agglomeration technique. After partial removal of bitumen the sludge was fractionated into settling and non-settling fractions. The insoluble organic matter associated with the clay lines present in the non-settling portion of sludge was concentrated by dissolving the mineral matter in HCl/HF. These fractions were analysed using elemental analysis and solid state 93 C n. m. r. spectroscopy. The elemental analyses were discussed in terms of a van Krevelen diagram by plotting H/C atomic ratios against O/C atomic ratios. N. m. r. data were used to calculate the aromaticities of the various organic fractions. Based on the n. m. r. data, it is suggested that the IOM associated with sludge solids is derived from the parent oil sand feed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Around the turn-of-the century, mining {{activities}} greatly increased sediment accumulation and metal fluxes in nearshore regions of Lake Superior. In the low-energy environment of Portage Lake, within the Keweenaw Waterway estuary, sediment accumulation increased 33 X, whereas elemental Cu flux increased 312 X. One difficulty {{in establishing the}} dispersion of mining discharges is that stamp sands were derived from local ore deposits, hence few elements are “unique ” to the source materials. One approach is to search for multi-elemental “signatures ” in concentration and flux profiles. For exam-ple, several rare earth elements of the lanthanide series are characteristic of source materials and {{have the potential to}} identify stamp sand material across Lake Superior. Although conditions of variable mass loading from multiple sources can produce complicating dilution effects in concentration profiles, multi-variate techniques are capable of deciphering original source signals. Here non-destructive neutron acti-vation analysis was utilized to construct elemental flux and concentration profiles, then multivariate tech-niques (Factor Analysis, End-member Analysis) were used to illustrate how partial mass flux signatures can be assigned to two different types of ore lodes (conglomerate, amygdaloid) and to background (ero-sional) sedimentation. Temporal patterns were verified through archived company discharge records. Also exploited were the varve-like deposition of <b>slime</b> <b>clays</b> to independently check 210 Pb determination...|$|R
40|$|Coating of bitumen by <b>clays,</b> {{known as}} <b>slime</b> coating, is {{detrimental}} to bitumen recovery from oil sands using the warm slurry extn. process. Sodium hydroxide (caustic) {{is added to}} the extn. process to balance many competing processing challenges, which include undesirable slime coating. The current research aims at understanding the role of caustic addn. in controlling interactions of bitumen with various types of model clays. The interaction potential was studied by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). After confirming the slime coating potential of montmorillonite clays on bitumen in the presence of calcium ions, the interaction of kaolinite and illite with bitumen was studied. To represent more closely the industrial applications, tailings water from bitumen extn. tests at different caustic dosage was used. At caustic dosage up to 0. 5 wt % oil sands ore, a negligible coating of kaolinite on the bitumen was detd. However, at a lower level of caustic addn., illite was shown to attach to the bitumen, with the interaction potential decreasing with increasing caustic dosage. Increasing concn. of humic acids as a result of increasing caustic dosage was identified to limit the interaction potential of illite with bitumen. This fundamental study clearly shows that the crit. role of caustics in modulating interactions of clays with bitumen depends upon the type of clays. Thus, clay type was identified as a key operational variable...|$|R
