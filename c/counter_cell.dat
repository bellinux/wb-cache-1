40|$|As {{compressible}} convection has inherent up/down asymmetry, overshooting {{above and}} below a convection zone behave differently. In downward overshooting, the narrow downflow columns dynamically play an important role. It is customary, and reasonable, to use the downward flux of kinetic energy {{as a proxy for}} overshooting. In the upward situation, the flux of kinetic energy can take on different signs near the upper boundary of the convection zone, and its magnitude is generally small. It cannot make a good proxy for overshooting. This paper discusses the results of a set of numerical experiments that investigate the problem of overshooting above a convection zone. Particle tracing and color advection are used to follow the mixing process.

30|$|Importantly, imaging live hESCs also {{requires}} a much faster imaging speed to <b>counter</b> <b>cell</b> motion and to capture dynamic changes that cannot {{be obtained by}} any other biotechnological means. Standard single-emitter fitting programs render the technique impractically slow (i.e. minute-scale acquisition times), even {{with the aid of}} the light-sheet illumination. Since the Nyquist sampling theorem requires approximately two data points per resolution unit to faithfully reconstruct an image (Shroff et al. 2008; Patterson et al. 2010), reducing the number of image frames requires increasing the number of resolvable single-molecule events per frame. Spatially overlapping molecules within a diffraction-limited focus volume in the same frame breaches the sparcity requirement of many single-emitter fitting programs (Henriques et al. 2010; Wolter et al. 2012) and further slow down the data acquisition. Here, we demonstrate a high-SNR illumination scheme that works hand in hand with a highly efficient reconstruction algorithm resolving overlapping fluorophores to enable rapid deep-cell super-resolution imaging.|$|E

However, the wide use of the traditional vital dye trypan blue (TB) raises environmental and health concerns due to its potential teratogenic effects. To avoid this chemical hazard, it is of importance to introduce an alternative non-hazardous vital dye that is compatible with automated <b>cell</b> <b>counters.</b> Erythrosin B (EB) is a vital dye that is impermeable to biological membranes and {{is used as a}} food additive. Similarly to TB, EB stains only nonviable cells with disintegrated membranes. However, EB is less popular than TB and is seldom used with automated <b>cell</b> <b>counters.</b> We found that cell counting accuracy with EB was comparable to that with TB. EB was found to be an effective dye for accurate counting of cells with different viabilities across three different automated <b>cell</b> <b>counters.</b> In contrast to TB, EB was less toxic to cultured HL- 60  cells during the cell counting process. These results indicate that replacing TB with EB for use with automated <b>cell</b> <b>counters</b> will significantly reduce the hazardous risk while producing comparable results...|$|R

Cnidarian jellyfish sometimes show extensive proliferations – outbreaks or blooms – along with occasional strandings on beaches. Due to the invisibility of several diaphanous and completely transparent species, {{sometimes they are}} not seen by bathers or sea-workers, resulting in envenomations with consequent local or systemic implications such as contact dermatitis, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and, in serious cases, anaphylaxis. Researchers have historically focused their efforts on the identification of stings, evaluating the shape of lesions, the marks left on the skin, and the etiology of illness, {{in order to find}} methods useful to inactivate venoms and to develop care systems aimed at the mitigation of pain, swelling, redness, and systemic consequences. In the interest of better knowing the toxic mechanisms consequent to cnidarian stinging, beginning in the 1990 s, research focused on studying the effects of venoms at a cellular level. Since then, a considerable number of papers have provided data about the mechanisms of action of venoms and the associated impacts on cell survival, growth, and metabolism. Subsequently, the utilization of compounds present in jellyfish venoms, both for therapeutical purposes and to <b>counter</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, has been considered.

40|$|The DIF concept {{states that}} equal {{internode}} length {{can be achieved}} with the same difference between day and night temperature irrespective of the mean 24 h temperature. However, the physiological background of the DIF concept is unclear. An attempt to model internode elongation is presented based on three plausible processes, namely (1) the accumulation of elongation requirements during the day, (2) elongation during the night using elongation requirements and (3) the limitation of internode length due to low turgor pressure unable to <b>counter</b> <b>cell</b> wall elasticity. Each reaction rate constant, one per process, depends on temperature according to Arrhenius’ Law. The resulting process-based model describes internode elongation in time and was calibrated on a chrysanthemum data set. Chrysanthemum plants were grown in growth chambers with rigorously defined day and night temperatures. In total, 16 temperature treatments were applied, resulting from the combination of four day and four night temperatures (16, 20, 24 and 28 °C). Internode elongation was measured for the tenth internode in ten plants per treatment. The percentage variance accounted for, R 2 adj, was almost 91 ÐTransferability of model parameters was shown to exist by cross validation. Simulation of the internode length in time as function of mean 24 h temperature and DIF showed that the DIF concept is not apparent after a growing period of 10 d, but is visible after 20 d.

30|$|Acquiring {{sub-cellular}} super-resolution images {{deep inside}} a living cell {{is one of}} the most challenging tasks in bioimaging. In this study, we designed LSBM and demonstrated its capability by visualizing the structure and dynamics of heterochromatin in fixed and live hESCs. With the fixed hESCs, we first demonstrated a mesh like heterochromatin structure in pluripotent stem cells. These structurally distinct organizations are also aligned with the topological domain hypothesis (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009; Dixon et al. 2012). The latest sequencing data suggest that mammalian genomes are organized into conserved topological chromatin-chromatin interaction domains for efficient large-scale gene expression regulation and constraining the spread of heterochromatin in different cell types (Dixon et al. 2012). The dynamic change of the nanoscopic structural features revealed in Figure  4 is a combination of the Brownian motion of the chromatin, the movement of heterochromatin in response to sub-cellular activities, and the cell motion (Dion & Gasser 2013). LSBM provides a viable imaging tool to examine these dynamics, for the first time, with nanometer resolution. Further studies can be done to examine the heterochromatin structure and its dynamics in hESCs at different phases of the cell cycle and during their responses to different differentiation stimuli. Techniques can be applied to label a region of interest to help lock the imaging FOV in order to <b>counter</b> <b>cell</b> motion. The 2.3 -s temporal resolution of LSBM is a unique capability enabled by the Bayesian algorithm. Importantly, using bright and fast-switching molecules, and increasing the frame rate of the camera, i.e. by using a cropped mode for a smaller FOV, can further increase the imaging speed to the sub-second level.|$|E

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} {{unanimously}} considered a highly heterogeneous disease {{due to its}} diverse molecular features. Breast tumor kinase (BRK), also known as protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK 6), is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in over 80 % of breast carcinomas. The role and mechanism of action of enzymatically activated BRK in breast pathology are unclear. The objectives of this project were to reveal the effect of BRK activation on cell migration, proliferation and tumorigenesis. We also aimed to determine the mechanism of action of BRK in the promotion of cell proliferation. We used BRK-negative cells (MCF 10 A, MDA-MB- 231 and HEK 293) to generate three sets of stable cell lines that stably expressed GFP alone, GFP-BRK-WT or GFP-BRK-Y 447 F (constitutively active) by retroviral infections. We also stably knocked down BRK from BRK-positive cells BT 20 and SKBR 3 by RNA interference using shRNAs against BRK. Western blotting, immunoprecipitation and qPCR studies were conducted to evaluate protein expression, protein-protein interaction and mRNA expression, respectively. Both sets of cell lines {{were used to determine}} the effect of BRK on cell proliferation (automated cell <b>counter),</b> <b>cell</b> migration (transwell and wound healing assay), transformation (colony formation assay) and tumor formation (mouse Xenograft assay). To investigate the mechanism of action of BRK, we validated downstream of tyrosine kinases 1 (Dok 1), a tumor suppressor, as a BRK substrate. Deletion or site-directed mutagenesis was performed to map BRK-targeted tyrosines in Dok 1 protein. Results obtained from this research project showed that stable expression of the constitutively active mutant of BRK (BRK-Y 447 F) in MDA-MB- 231 cells led to {{a significant increase in the}} cell proliferation, migration rate and promoted colony formation and drastically enhanced tumor formation in athymic nude mice in comparison to control cells. Additionally, depletion of BRK abrogated the migration of BT 20 and SKBR 3 cells. Furthermore, we showed that BRK interacts with and phosphorylates Dok 1, inducing Dok 1 downregulation via a ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated mechanism. Together, our results show that the activation of BRK is essential for mammary gland tumorigenesis and suggest that targeting of Dok 1 for degradation is a novel mechanism of action of BRK in the promotion of cell proliferation, migration and tumor formation...|$|E
