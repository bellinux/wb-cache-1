5000|$|The song {{starts off}} with an {{acoustic}} guitar, restrung in a fashion similar to Nashville tuning, but with the low E string replaced by a high E tuned two full octaves higher than normal. It plays arpeggios over E and D minor added ninth chords. The alternate stringing allows for adjacent pitches (such as the E, F♯, and G of the Em9 chord) to ring out separately on separate strings throughout the arpeggio. A fretless bass enters, also played by guitarist David Gilmour rather than usual bassist Roger Waters. Next to join in is the Fender Rhodes electric piano by Rick Wright, Gilmour's vocals, and overdubbed acoustic guitar and drums {{at the start of}} the second verse. In the middle is a guitar solo which is played over the album's leitmotif of the melody to [...] "Another Brick in the Wall" [...] (in E minor and A minor, rather than D minor). After the solo, Roger Waters sings the lead vocal for the rest of the song. The bridge is a chord sequence later heard on the album as [...] "Bring the Boys Back Home", ending on an E minor chord, leading to a reprise of the instrumental introduction, augmented by prominent ARP Quadra riffs and a faintly audible sound of a drill. At this point, there is a piece of indecipherable whispering from the left <b>channel.</b> <b>Drums</b> and vocals then join in. At about 3:23 into the song, a sonar-like sound, similar to the ping in [...] "Echoes", is heard. When Waters sings the final verse, he does so one octave higher than Gilmour, with the highest note being the first C above middle C.|$|R
5000|$|After {{putting his}} own music on hold, {{it was time}} to lay down some new music of his own. In late 2009, Syd {{released}} the EP Upswing. It was created west of Los Angeles, in Oxnard, California at <b>Drum</b> <b>Channel</b> Studios. Dylan Allen once again played guitar and bass and Matt Bogdanow played drums on 2 songs (The Pattern and Mallory) and Syd returned to the drums and laid down his first recorded percussion performances on The Big Town and Easier on You. The tracks were laid down with Kevin Majorino at <b>Drum</b> <b>Channel,</b> but as he had done in the past, Syd returned to Vermont to mix and master with Lane Gibson. The EP was described as, [...] "unbridled, hook-heavy pop". Syd and his band went back on tour in support of the new record, but as it would turn out, Friday March 6, 2009—the last tour date for Upswing in Winooski, Vermont--would be the last Syd show for many years. Though never publicly stating it, the project seems to be on hiatus.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{bottlenecks}} in {{the progress of the}} Music Information Retrieval (MIR) research field is the limited access to common, large and annotated audio databases that could serve for technology development and/or evaluation.

50|$|Lake Winnebago {{is one of}} {{the more}} heavily fished lakes in the state. Many {{fishermen}} consider it one of the nation's top walleye fisheries. Other species present include bluegill, largemouth bass, muskellunge, northern pike, perch, burbot, white bass, Crappie, freshwater <b>drum,</b> <b>channel</b> catfish, flathead catfish, and smallmouth bass. In June 2010, Oshkosh hosted an event recognized by Guinness World Records as history's largest fishing tournament. A 2007 study put the economic value of recreational fishing at approximately $300 million per year.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{its course}} Middle Island Creek is a slow-moving, low-gradient stream.

40|$|This study {{involves}} {{the development and}} evaluation of an in-line melt rheometer (ILR) for use in process control. The ILR consists of a rotating drum, which is positioned directly in the main process flow <b>channel.</b> The <b>drum</b> creates a shear deformation in a zone formed between the <b>drum</b> and the <b>channel</b> wall. A method to correct {{for the effects of}} pressure flow superposed on the shear deformation was developed. The problems associated with sample renewal and temperature control in the shearing zone were explored with the help of simulations. The ILR's sensitivity to processing conditions was documented, and its accuracy and repeatability were demonstrated. The ILR was used as viscosity sensor to control ionomer neutralisation by reactive extrusion. Proportional-integral and minimum variance control algorithms were successfully implemented. The quality of control was good but could be improved by reducing ILR signal noise and by decreasing the ILR's measurement delay, which is governed primarily by the sample renewal rate...|$|R
50|$|For harmony {{between the}} living and the dead, vital for a {{trouble-free}} life, traditional healers believe that the ancestors must be shown respect through ritual and animal sacrifice. They perform summoning rituals by burning plants like imphepho (Helichrysum petiolare), dancing, chanting, <b>channelling</b> or playing <b>drums.</b> Traditional healers will often give their patients muti—medications made from plant, animal and minerals—imbued with spiritual significance. These muti often have powerful symbolism; for example, lion fat might be prepared for children to promote courage. There are medicines for everything from physical and mental illness, social disharmony and spiritual difficulties to potions for protection, love and luck.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, in 1993 Roland {{released}} the [...] "GM2MT" [...] SysEx pack, {{which can be}} used to reprogram the MT-32 and compatibles to match General MIDI specifications as close as possible. 64 of the 128 patches (the limit of possible variations) are completely new or modified sounds, with additional sounds having been added to <b>drum</b> <b>channel</b> 10. Despite this, compatibility with GM is still limited by the lack of parts (9 on the MT-32, 16 per GM specification) and reversed panpot compared to MMA MIDI specifications. The utility was predated by a pack called [...] "MT32GS", released by Mike Cornelius in 1992.|$|R

40|$|A {{dynamics}} {{analysis of}} a nuclear boiler based on a steam-generating, pressure-tube, heavy-water-moderated design is presented. In effect the plant {{is very similar to}} a La Mont recirculating cycle. A detailed mathematid model to represent plant dynamics (linearized, full power) is discussed with special reference to the boiling <b>channel,</b> steam <b>drum,</b> and recirculating loop. A simplified model is derived for analogue computer studies. Dynamic performance is discussed in terms o f (1) boiler only (no reactivity feedbacks) : influence of pressure feedbacks, steam drum design, subcooling, recirculating delay; (2) complete plant (including reactor) : as above but including influence of void coefficient. The two most important results are: (1) the strong dependence of plant behaviour/stability on the degree of float allowed to pressure; (2) the possibility of designing an inherently stable and self-regulating plant with a small positive void coefficient. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the complete dynamic analysis under the heads: (1) optimal plant design; (2) control system design; (3) development of analytical/computing methods; (4) research into two-phase physics...|$|R
50|$|Although the tones {{featured}} in NES {{music can be}} thought of emulating a traditional four-piece rock band (triangle wave used as a bass, two pulse waves analogous to two guitars, and a white noise <b>channel</b> used for <b>drums),</b> composers would often {{go out of their way}} to compose complex and rapid sequences of notes, in part due to the restrictions mentioned above. This is similar to music composition during the Baroque period, when composers, particularly when creating solo pieces, focused on musical embellishments to compensate for instruments such as the harpsichord that do not allow for expressive dynamics. For the same reason, many early compositions also feature a distinct jazz influence. These would overlap with later influences from heavy metal and j-pop music, resulting in an equally distinct compositional style in the 16-bit era.|$|R
40|$|Vertical bearing {{capacity}} of a shallow foundation with short skirts in normally consolidated clay has been investigated in the UWA drum centrifuge for embedment depths up to two footing diameters. Tests were carried out in a special fabricated strong box set into the <b>channel</b> of the <b>drum.</b> A half-model test was conducted adjacent to the strongbox Perspex window, facilitating optical measurement of soil deformation during foundation loading. A full-model test was conducted {{in the interior of}} the strongbox to ascertain the true {{bearing capacity}} as the half-model results are anticipated to be distorted by friction developed along the Perspex window. This paper describes the experimental techniques adopted and the results in terms of bearing capacity factor and the accompanying soil failure mechanisms. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, London. </p...|$|R
50|$|Numerous aquatic species {{make their}} home in Logan Martin Lake with game and non-game fish being the {{dominant}} interest for human use. Numerous local and national fishing tournaments are held on the lake annually, the lake has also hosted championship events of the FLW Outdoors Tour and the Bassmaster Classic in 1992, 1993, and 1997. Large numbers of both largemouth and spotted bass inhabit the lake, as well as striped bass, white bass, hybrid bass, crappie, catfish (mostly of the <b>channel</b> variety), bream, <b>drum,</b> carp, and gar. Fish in Logan Martin lake are polluted with, in some cases, substantial amounts of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), originating from Choccolocco Creek, and ultimately Anniston, Alabama. The pollution culminated with several high-profile class action lawsuits in the early 2000s, {{one of which was}} led by attorney Johnnie Cochran.|$|R

40|$|The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{performed}} {{tests to}} determine whether a significant difference in fish passage existed between a 6 -ft screening facility built perpendicularly to canal flow and an identical screening facility with the screen mounted at a 45 -degree angle to the approach <b>channel.</b> A modular <b>drum</b> screen built by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife was installed at PNNL`s Aquatic Ecology research laboratory in Richland, Washington. Fall chinook salmon fry were introduced into the test system, and their movements were monitored. A total of 14 tests (400 fish per test) that lasted 20 hours were completed during April and May, 1996. There {{was no significant difference in}} fish passage rate through the two approach configurations. Attraction flow to the bypass across the face of the screen was more evident for the angled approach, although this did not appear to play a significant role in attracting fish to the bypass. Approach velocities at the face of the screen did not exceed the 0. 4 fps criteria for either approach configuration and posed not threat to fish. No fish passed over, around, or through the drum screen during any test...|$|R
5000|$|Around 1978 {{while working}} for the company Musicaid in St. Albans, Dave Simmons {{developed}} a device with similar capabilities to the Syndrum and Synare, which he called the SDS-3. The SDS-3 featured four <b>drum</b> <b>channels</b> and a noise generator; the SDS-4 was a functionally similar two-channel version. [...] At this juncture, the drum pads were round, with wooden frames and real 8-inch drum heads. Musicaid was also the distributor for the Lyricon wind synthesizer as played by John L. Walters of Landscape. Walters introduced Richard James Burgess to Simmons and Burgess began using the SDS-3s and SDS-4s live, on stage, with his band Landscape. Recognizing {{the potential for a}} fully electronic drum set that could replace the traditional acoustic set rather than supplement it, Burgess began collaborating with Dave Simmons. They mocked up the sounds and flowchart using an ARP 2600 synthesizer. Since Burgess was using the instrument in a live setting, they developed the four customizable preset buttons. The distinctive hexagonal shape came about after triangles and bat-wing mock-ups had been tried. Burgess finally decided that a honeycomb shape would fit together ergonomically and be simple yet distinctive in appearance. A limited edition of what Simmons referred to as the Mount Rushmore Head sets were also built. Burgess has two of these sets. The basic descending tom-tom sound was modeled after the way Burgess tuned his Pearl single-headed concert tom kit on which he would loosen one tension rod, causing a wrinkle in the head and creating a descending pitch after the tom was hit.|$|R
