5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E
5|$|Baird was {{appointed}} President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006. Following his appointment, {{he said that}} one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from Ottawa to other regions for political purposes. Baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> initiate a radical reduction in the size of government. In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues. One of the members was Frances Lankin, a former Ontario New Democratic Party cabinet minister.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Kennedy {{administration}} sent Cable 243 to Lodge at {{the embassy}} in Saigon, marking a change in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek {{the removal of the}} Nhus from power, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diệm refused to heed American pressure for reform. As the probability of Diệm sidelining the Nhus was seen as virtually nil, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup. The Voice of America broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the raids and absolving the army of responsibility. Aware that the Americans would neither oppose a coup nor respond with aid <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> sanctions, the generals deposed the Ngô brothers, who were arrested and assassinated the next day, 2 November 1963.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate {{that he had no}} <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on the laundry at Frank's house.|$|E

25|$|With few {{exceptions}} throughout the literature, symbolic predispositions has presented more substantive and statistical explanatory power on {{attitudes and behaviors}} than self-interest. Only in occasional exceptions, as when there are clear and substantial stakes as job <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> regarding tax burdens or ambiguous and dangerous threats as compulsory military draft lottery, self-interest has a clear effect on political attitudes and behavior. Even in these cases, the impact of self-interest are quite specific to the issues in question.|$|E
25|$|Meat {{from less}} tender <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> older cattle can be {{mechanically}} tenderized by forcing small, sharp blades through the cuts {{to disrupt the}} proteins. Also, solutions of exogenous proteolytic enzymes (papain, bromelin or ficin) can be injected to augment the endogenous enzymes. Similarly, solutions of salt and sodium phosphates can be injected to soften and swell the myofibrillar proteins. This improves juiciness and tenderness. Salt can improve the flavor, but phosphate can contribute a soapy flavor.|$|E

In southern and central Europe, parsley is part of bouquet garni, a bundle of fresh herbs used as an ingredient in stocks, soups, and sauces. Freshly chopped green parsley is used as a topping for soups such as chicken soup, green salads, or salads such as salade Olivier, and on open sandwiches with cold <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> pâtés.|$|E

Fresh meat <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> processed cuts may produce iridescence, commonly {{thought to be}} due to spoilage but actually caused structural coloration and diffraction of the light. A common additive to processed meats, both for preservation and because it prevents discoloring, is sodium nitrite, which, however, is also a source of health concerns, because it may form carcinogenic nitrosamines when heated.|$|E

In June 2001, Fiorina asked employees to either take pay <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> use their allotted vacation time to cut additional costs, resulting {{in more than}} 80,000 people signing up and saving HP 130 million. Despite these efforts from employees, in July Fiorina announced that 6,000 jobs would be cut, the biggest reduction in the company's 64-year history, but those cuts would not actually occur until after the Compaq merger was announced. In September 2001, Fiorina said she intended to cut an additional 15,000 jobs {{in the event of}} a merger with Compaq.|$|E

Police received thousands of tips based on references in the publicized portions of the letter, all of which proved useless. All the shooting victims to date had long dark hair, and thousands of women in New York acquired short <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> brightly colored dyes, and beauty supply stores had trouble meeting the demand for wigs.|$|E

25|$|A {{second group}} put their main {{emphasis}} {{on tax cuts}} rather than spending <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> debt reduction. Many embrace supply-side economics, arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues. These additional government revenues, would {{in the long term}} reduce debt, they also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit. Some supply-siders have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary. However, the Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the Bush tax cuts added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002-2011 and would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the wider}} economy, Canada was {{surprisingly}} unhurt by these events. While growth slowed, the economy never actually entered a recession. This {{was the first time}} that Canada had avoided following the United States into an economic downturn. The rate of job creation in Canada continued at the rapid pace of the 1990s. A number of explanations have been advanced to explain this. Canada was not as directly affected by 9/11 and the subsequent wars, and the downward pressure of these events was more muted. Canada's fiscal management during the period has been praised as the federal government continued to bring in large surpluses throughout this period, in sharp contrast to the United States. Unlike the United States no major tax <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> major new expenditures were introduced. However, during this time, Canada did pursue an expansionary monetary policy in an effort to reduce the effects of a possible recession. Many provincial governments suffered greater problems with a number of them returning to deficits, which was blamed on the fiscal imbalance. 2003 saw elections in six Canadian provinces and in only one did the governing party not lose seats.|$|E
25|$|Rejecting a {{work is a}} {{very serious}} action and one which we do not take lightly. Where {{possible}} we try to consider <b>cuts</b> <b>or,</b> in the case of games, modifications which remove the material which contravenes the Board's published Guidelines. In the case of Manhunt 2 this has not been possible. Manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing. There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism {{in the way in which}} these killings are committed, and encouraged, in the game. Although the difference should not be exaggerated the fact of the game's unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying and the sheer lack of alternative pleasures on offer to the gamer, together with the different overall narrative context, contribute towards differentiating this submission from the original Manhunt game. That work was classified '18' in 2003, before the BBFC's recent games research had been undertaken, but was already at the very top end of what the Board judged to be acceptable at that category. Against this background, the Board's carefully considered view is that to issue a certificate to Manhunt 2, on either platform, would involve a range of unjustifiable harm risks, to both adults and minors, within the terms of the Video Recordings Act, and accordingly that its availability, even if statutorily confined to adults, would be unacceptable to the public.|$|E

[...] When subcutaneous emphysema occurs due to pneumothorax, a chest tube is frequently used to control the latter; this eliminates the source of the air entering the subcutaneous space.

Suction may also be applied to the tube to remove air faster. The progression of the condition can be monitored by marking the boundaries with a special pencil for marking on skin.|$|E
