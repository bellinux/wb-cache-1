25|$|On 1 April 1973, Air France re-introduced a daily {{non-stop}} Orly–Tegel rotation {{to complement}} the daily service via Cologne. The additional daily service consisted of an evening inbound and early morning outbound flight, which included a night stop for both aircraft and crew in Berlin. To improve <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> on its Berlin services and cut down on aircraft parking as well as crew accommodation costs, from 1 April 1974, Air France routed both of its daily Orly–Tegel services via Cologne, with aircraft and crew returning to their base at Paris Orly the same day. From 1 November that year, Air France's Berlin flights switched to the French capital's then new Charles de Gaulle (CDG) Airport.|$|E
25|$|Slots {{left by the}} US {{carriers}} (and {{the collapse}} of Zoom, XL Airways UK and Sterling) were taken by EasyJet, Flybe, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. A number of full-service airlines have established or resumed operations at the airport, including Aeroflot, Cathay Pacific, Swiss International Air Lines and Turkish Airlines. This {{is part of the}} airport's strategy to attract higher-spending business travellers (countering its dependence on European low-cost and charter markets), increasing year-round <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> by smoothing peaks and troughs in traffic. Gatwick's success in persuading these airlines to launch (or re-launch) routes to overseas destinations important for business and leisure travel was aided by a lack of comparable slots at Heathrow. On 16 June 2015, it was announced that Canadian airline WestJet would begin flights to Gatwick in the spring of 2016. This was followed by an announcement on 25 June 2015 by Air Canada Rouge that it would begin a seasonal service from Gatwick to Toronto on 20 May 2016. On 20 April 2017, Norwegian Air Shuttle announced its first long-haul route operated by Norwegian Air UK from Gatwick to Singapore.|$|E

2500|$|India has {{the fifth}} largest {{installed}} wind power {{capacity in the}} world. As of 31 March 2015, the installed capacity of wind power was 23,444 MW an increase of 2312 MW {{over the previous year}} [...] Wind power accounts nearly 8.5% of India's total installed power generation capacity and generated 28.314 billion kWh in the fiscal year 2014-15 which is nearly 2.6% of total electricity generation. The <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> factor is nearly 15% in the fiscal year 2014-15. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) of India has announced a revised estimation of the potential wind power resource (excluding offshore wind power potential) from 49,130 MW assessed at 50m Hub heights to 102,788 MW assessed at 80m Hub height at 15% capacity factor.|$|E
2500|$|The JG {{introduces}} no relative wage {{effects and}} the rising demand per se does not necessarily invoke inflationary pressures because by definition it is satisfying the net savings desire {{of the private sector}} (see Mitchell and Muysken, 2008 for more details). Additionally, in today’s demand constrained economies, firms are likely to increase <b>capacity</b> <b>utilisation</b> to meet the higher sales volumes. Given that the demand impulse is less than required in the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) economy, it is clear that if there were any demand-pull inflation it would be lower under the JG. There are no new problems faced by employers who wish to hire labour to meet the higher sales levels. Any initial rise in demand will stimulate private sector employment growth while reducing JG employment and spending. [...] However, these demand pressures are unlikely to lead to accelerating inflation while the JG pool contains workers employable by the private sector.|$|E

40|$|Background: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), {{a major cause}} of morbidity and mortality worldwide, often occurs in the presence of comorbidities, which may influence experience and management of the disease. No prior research seems to have gained perspectives of newly diagnosed primary care COPD patients in the context of multimorbidity. Aims: This qualitative study aimed to explore the impact of a new diagnosis of COPD in the context of multimorbidity and also sought {{to gain a better understanding}} of how patients react to the diagnosis and incorporate it into their lives. Methods: Participants were identified from a cohort of primary care patients with multimorbidity recently diagnosed with COPD. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews from nine male and eight female participants. Thematic analysis was performed and the data interpreted from a constructivist perspective. Results: Five core themes regarding COPD were induced: (i) reaction to diagnosis, (ii) impact on function and health behaviour, (iii) factors influencing self-management <b>capacity,</b> (iv) healthcare <b>utilisation</b> and (v) interplay of comorbidities. Most participants had difficulty recognising the importance of COPD and its long-term implications. For many, the salience of another chronic condition outweighed COPD. Self-management <b>capacity</b> and <b>utilisation</b> of healthcare services were challenged by low prioritisation of COPD among other comorbidities. Conclusions: This study provides an insight into how primary care patients feel about being diagnosed with COPD, as well as their prioritisation of the disease in the context of multimorbidity. It highlights the need for tailored education and personalised management incorporating patients 2 ̆ 7 perspectives in primary care...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to improve the <b>capacity</b> & {{material}} <b>utilisation</b> through the design and implementation of effective nesting and batching processes. This led to improved production planning and control processes, through the reduction of wastage and off-cuts. The previous nesting and batching processes were insufficient and resulted in the waste of material, labour hours and money. A further area of concern was the level of inventory control. The improvement of the material utilisation was done through the effective use of batching and nesting techniques, algorithms and software. Inventory control {{was used to determine}} the length of the production window. The management of Shop-Floor control tools greatly reduced the inventory levels of both the material and the work in process (WIP). Various reports and GANTT Charts was also used to measure the adherence to plan and served as key performance indicators (KPIs). The “Dynamic Conservatism” method was used to manage the change in processes. This project improved the <b>capacity</b> and material <b>utilisation</b> through the design, implementation and use of nesting and batching methods and processes. This reduced set- up and material handling times. The production of off cuts was minimised and waste were reduced. Thesis (B Eng.

Adult seals have adaptations {{that allow them to}} voluntarily dive at depth for long periods, including increased bradycardic control, increased myoglobin levels and haematocrit. To establish whether the profile of skeletal muscle also changes in line with the development of diving ability, biopsy samples were collected from the trapezius muscle of pups, juveniles and adults. The proportions of different fibre types and their oxidative capacity were determined. Only oxidative fibre types (Type I and IIa) were identified, with a significant change in proportions from pup to adult.
