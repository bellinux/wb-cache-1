Henry and Radar begin to <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning to him. As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Cosme was {{predicted}} {{to make landfall}} on Hawaii as a tropical storm. In anticipation of the storm, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the island of Hawaii on July 20. Also, small craft advisories were in effect for Maui and Hawaii; wind advisories were issued for summits in those regions. High surf advisories were also put into effect for coastal areas. The Hawaii County Civil Defense prepared for the storm by planning for increases in emergency response personnel and opening of evacuation centers. County crews worked to <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> drains and culverts to prevent flooding.|$|E

5|$|In St. Louis, Anson Stokes, an apathetic {{employee}} at a self storage facility, is yelled at by his boss to <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> {{an old and}} dusty storage locker. To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old antiques {{and a picture of}} the previous owner with the woman from the apartment.|$|E
5|$|Some researchers, {{as well as}} some timber {{companies}} and private citizens, understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many ecosystems. Fire would help <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk. As early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. Over the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems. In 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks. The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems. By 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes. The service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property. The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions, controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems. Fire ecology became better understood after many forests had aged to maturity and were overdue for a large scale burn.|$|E

Since 1990, creosote buildup has caused 75% fewer fires. This is partly due to the use of efficient wood-burning stoves that fully combust the carbon from fuel, and partly due to the use of Class A flues, insulated double wall stainless steel pipe.|$|E

25|$|Some {{members of}} the French parliament, {{as well as other}} observers, {{publicly}} decried the intense lobbying by various groups and industries. Bernard Carayon, UMP deputy for the Tarn d√©partement, denounced lobbying, pressures and even blackmail on the part of certain groups on national TV. A number of parliamentarians said they had never seen such intense lobbying from all sides, including a grassroot effort from Internet users and free software advocates which inundated them with letters and emails. At one point, Senator Michel Charasse demanded that parliamentary staff <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> corridors of loitering lobbyists.|$|E
25|$|Steam trams {{relied upon}} their weight and {{adhesion}} for propulsion {{and as the}} town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into the rail grooves. Water boys and track cleaners were employed to <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the rail grooves with long iron bars, which they dragged along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in the grooves, to allow the wheel tread to grip the track. The specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to be silent, had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, it, no doubt, caused considerable damage to the track.|$|E

He secured his place in history as a tough-minded reform mayor who helped <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> corruption, brought in gifted experts, and fixed upon the city a broad sense of responsibility for its own citizens. His administration engaged new groups that had been kept out of the political system, gave New York its modern infrastructure, and raised expectations of new levels of urban possibility.|$|E

25|$|In September, Arenas {{underwent}} a third operation on his surgically repaired left knee to <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> fluid and debris, and {{was expected to}} miss {{at least the first}} month of the season. The forecast came in longer than expected, as Arenas missed 5 months of action due to concerns on his knee before returning on March 29, 2009. In {{the first game of the}} preseason, Jamison suffered a right knee contusion, and was expected to miss the rest of the preseason. Haywood announced that he would undergo surgery on his right wrist and was expected to miss 4‚Äì6 months. The preseason marked the return of Etan Thomas who had missed all of the 2007‚Äì2008 season while recovering from open heart surgery. The Wizards added guard Fenny Falmagne from the Dakota Wizards on August 23, 2008 that later was waived by the team after knee injury.|$|E
25|$|As {{the ship}} turned slowly to comb torpedoes, two sticks of bombs fell {{on either side}} of the tanker. The vessel lifted, and went on lifting until she was <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> of the water. Cascades of spray and bomb {{splinters}} lashed the deck, she fell back with a crash. Ohio had differential gearing which slowed the propeller automatically; on other ships, the same effect would have shaken the engines out of their rooms. Continuously bombed, the tanker kept on steaming until another explosion to starboard sent her reeling to port. The engine-room lights went out, plunging her into darkness. The master switches had been thrown off by the force of the explosion, but they were quickly switched on again by an electrician. This time, the ship had not escaped damage. The boiler fires were blown out, and it was a race against time to restore them before the steam pressure dropped too low to work the fuel pumps. The engineers lit the fire starter torches to restart the furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Stonebrood (Aspergillosis larvae apium) is a {{fungal disease}} caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger. It causes mummification of the brood of a honey bee colony. The fungi are common soil {{inhabitants}} {{and are also}} pathogenic to other insects, birds, and mammals. The disease is difficult to identify {{in the early stages}} of infection. The spores of the different species have different colours and can also cause respiratory damage to humans and other animals. When bee larvae take in spores, they may hatch in the gut, growing rapidly to form a collar-like ring near the larval heads. After death, the larvae turn black and become difficult to crush, hence the name stonebrood. Eventually, the fungus erupts from the integument of the larvae and forms a false skin. In this stage, the larvae are covered with powdery fungal spores. Worker bees <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the infected brood and the hive may recover depending on factors such as the strength of the colony, the level of infection, and hygienic habits of the strain of bees (variation in the trait occurs among different subspecies/races).|$|E
