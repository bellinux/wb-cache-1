50|$|The little {{research}} {{that has been done}} on this feature indicates that it may not be trivial to get high performance gains by using MPI-IO. For example, an implementation of sparse matrix-vector multiplications using the MPI I/O library shows a general behavior of negligible performance gain, but these results are inconclusive. It was not until the idea of collective I/O implemented into MPI-IO that MPI-IO started to reach widespread adoption. Collective I/O substantially boosts applications' I/O bandwidth by having processes collectively transform the small and noncontiguous I/O operations into large and contiguous ones, thereby reducing the locking and disk seek overhead. Due to its vast performance benefits, MPI-IO also became the underlying I/O layer for many state-of-the-art I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and Parallel NetCDF. Its popularity also triggered a series of research efforts on collective I/O optimizations, such as layout-aware I/O and <b>cross-file</b> aggregation.|$|E
