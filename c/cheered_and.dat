5|$|Upon {{learning}} {{that the young}} emperor of Brazil, Dom PedroII, sought a wife, {{the government of the}} Two Sicilies offered the hand of Teresa Cristina. It also sent PedroII a painting that greatly embellished the princess, which prompted him to accept the proposal. A proxy wedding was held on 30 May 1843 in Naples, PedroII being represented by his fiancée's brother Prince Leopold, Count of Syracuse. A small Brazilian fleet composed of a frigate and two corvettes departed for the Two Sicilies on 3 March 1843 to escort the new Empress of Brazil. She arrived on Rio de Janeiro on 3 September 1843. PedroII immediately rushed to board the ship and greet his bride. Upon seeing this impetuous gesture, the crowds <b>cheered</b> <b>and</b> guns fired deafening salutes. Teresa Cristina {{fell in love with her}} new husband at first sight.|$|E

25|$|Such was the {{impression}} of Lever’s demeanour and testimony on the defence team that, {{as soon as the}} court was assembled on the following day, they capitulated completely.

There followed a scene {{on the floor of the}} court wherein the legal teams literally haggled over the size of the financial settlement. In the end, the sum agreed to was fifty-thousand pounds, plus around forty-thousand which was eventually awarded from individual newspapers.

25|$|Pan Am was {{the launch}} {{customer}} of the Boeing 747, placing a $525million order for 25 in April 1966. On January 15, 1970 First Lady Pat Nixon christened a Pan Am Boeing 747 Clipper Young America at Washington Dulles {{in the presence}} of Pan Am president Najeeb Halaby. During the next few days, Pan Am flew several 747s to major airports in the United States as a public relations effort, allowing the public to tour the airplanes. Pan Am began its final preparations for the first 747 service on the evening of January 21, 1970, when Clipper Young America was scheduled to fly from New York John F. Kennedy to London Heathrow. An engine failure delayed the inaugural flight's departure by several hours, necessitating the substitution of another 747 which eventually flew to London Heathrow. Passengers <b>cheered</b> <b>and</b> drank champagne as the jet finally lifted off from the runway at John F. Kennedy Airport.|$|E
25|$|Fanny Blankers-Koen thereby {{became the}} first Dutch athlete to win an Olympic title in athletics, but she was more {{concerned}} with her next event, the 80m hurdles. Her chief opponent was Maureen Gardner, also coached by Blankers-Koen's husband and who had equalled Blankers's world record prior to the Games, and would be running for her home crowd. Both athletes made the final, in which Blankers-Koen {{got off to a}} bad start (she would later claim she thought there had been a false start). She picked up the pace quickly, but was unable to shake off Gardner, who kept close until the finish line, and the two finished almost simultaneously. When the British national anthem was played, the crowd in Wembley Stadium <b>cheered,</b> <b>and</b> Blankers-Koen briefly thought she had been beaten. However, the anthem was played in honour of the British royal family, which entered the stadium at that time. Examination of the finish photo clearly showed that not Gardner, but Blankers-Koen had won, although both received the same time (11.2s).|$|E

25|$|Although Sumter was a masonry fort, {{there were}} wooden {{buildings}} inside for barracks and officer quarters. The Confederates targeted these with Heated shot (cannonballs heated red hot in a furnace), starting fires {{that could prove}} more dangerous to the men than explosive artillery shells. At 7 p.m. on April 12, a rain shower extinguished the flames {{and at the same}} time the Union gunners stopped firing for the night. They slept fitfully, concerned about a potential infantry assault against the fort. During the darkness, the Confederates reduced their fire to four shots each hour. The following morning, the full bombardment resumed and the Confederates continued firing hot shot against the wooden buildings. By noon most of the wooden buildings in the fort and the main gate were on fire. The flames moved toward the main ammunition magazine, where 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored. The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety, but two-thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed. He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea, but the tide kept floating them back together into groups, some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds. He also ordered his crews to redouble their efforts at firing, but the Confederates did the same, firing the hot shots almost exclusively. Many of the Confederate soldiers admired the courage and determination of the Yankees. When the fort had to pause its firing, the Confederates often <b>cheered</b> <b>and</b> applauded after the firing resumed and they shouted epithets at some of the nearby Union ships for failing to come to the fort's aid.|$|E
25|$|Australia's second innings began weakly, with Langer edging Agarkar to Patel {{before he}} even opened his account. Australia were then at 6/1. A window of {{opportunity}} opened up for the Indians. However, their hopes were soon evaporated by Matthew Hayden's crescendo of explosive and dynamic strokeplay. He hit the ball savagely, transferring his weight to the back foot often, and displayed clean and strong hits which sent the ball crashing to the fence. His powerful strokeplay ended in him stroking 99 from 98 balls. He reached 99 with a huge six off Ashish Nehra. The Queensland fans and the hayden family <b>cheered</b> <b>and</b> backed Hayden up to the hilt screaming out cheers to him, but he missed out the century when he top-edged a sweep to Sehwag at midwicket off Harbhajan. Hayden's knock was remarkable for the utter disdain he treated the Indian bowlers with. He was impervious {{to the efforts of}} the Indian bowlers, which was shown {{by the fact that he}} managed to treat even the good balls contemptuously. Of the 98 balls he faced for his 99, 51 balls were good length deliveries, which were dispatched for 52 runs. When the Indian bowlers pitched the ball slightly short, he was less destructive, hitting 12 runs off 30 such deliveries. In 17 other deliveries of which 8 were half-volleys and 9 were short balls Hayden hit 19 runs and 16 runs respectively, for a total of 35 runs from the other deliveries. He dominated almost every Indian bowler he faced, except Ajit Agarkar by scoring runs at more than a run-a-ball rate.|$|E

Food and water were offered at the scene by Egyptian people to the Egyptian protesters in sign of solidarity with the protesters.|$|E

500|$|At Le Gris' {{death the}} crowd <b>cheered</b> <b>and</b> the King greeted the victor with several fine presents. Carrouges became a wealthy and famous {{man as a}} result of his victory, but despite his end Le Gris was not forgotten. In the duel's {{immediate}} aftermath, the Executioner of Paris took charge of the body and stripped its armour and clothing before dragging it through the streets to the Gibbet of Montfaucon. There it was strung up alongside the bodies of murderers and thieves to rot before eventually being flung into a common grave. However, the memory of Jacques Le Gris was kept alive by his family and supporters for many years. His son Guillaume Le Gris paid over 200 francs for masses to be said for his father, [...] "a man of noble memory" [...] and continued to pay similar sums for at least ten years after his death. Count Pierre too retained favourable memories of his advisor, taking revenge by blocking Carrouges' efforts to purchase more land or expand his influence in Normandy.|$|E
500|$|In June 1958 Monteux {{conducted}} the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in three concerts, {{described by the}} orchestra's historian Richard Morrison as [...] "a sensation with players, press and public alike." [...] The first concert included Elgar's Enigma Variations, in which Cardus judged Monteux to be more faithful to Elgar's conception than English conductors generally were. Cardus added, [...] "After {{the performance of the}} 'Enigma' Variations, the large audience <b>cheered</b> <b>and</b> clapped Monteux for several minutes. This applause, moreover, broke out just before the interval. English audiences are not as a rule inclined to waste time applauding at or during an interval: they usually have other things to do." [...] Monteux considered British concertgoers [...] "the most attentive in the world", and British music critics [...] "the most intelligent". However, a disadvantage of conducting a London orchestra was having to perform at the Festival Hall, of which he shared with Beecham and other conductors an intense dislike: [...] "from the conductor's rostrum it is impossible to hear the violins".|$|E
