5000|$|<b>Cystolith</b> (Gr. [...] "cavity" [...] and [...] "stone") is a botanical {{term for}} the {{inorganic}} concretions, usually of calcium carbonate, formed in a cellulose matrix in special cells called lithocysts, generally in the leaf of plants of certain families, e.g. Ficus elastica, the Indian rubber plant of the family Moraceae. Plants in the family Urticaceae, also known as stinging nettles, also form leaf cystoliths, but only during their later flowering and seed setting stages. Cannabis and other plants in the family Cannabaceae also produce leaf and flower cystoliths.|$|E
50|$|The genus was {{described}} by George Bentham in 1846 based on Colombian specimens of Myriocarpa stipitata collected by Mss. Barclay. Weddell placed Myriocarpa in the Urticaceae tribe Boehmerieae despite its anomalous pubescence, <b>cystolith</b> morphology and wood anatomy. In his review of the Urticaceae, Friis retained its position within the Boehmerieae, presumably because its position in any other Urticaceae tribe would be equally ambiguous. The position of Myriocarpa within the Boehmerieae is not supported by recent phylogenetic analyses of trnL-F sequence data that recovered Myriocarpa within a strongly supported clade including both the Urticeae and Lecantheae tribes.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the leaf anatomy of Odontonema strictum (Nees) O. Kuntze (Acanthaceae), with emphasis on <b>cystoliths,</b> which are very abundant in this species. Leaves fully expanded from five mature individuals were collected in the teaching garden of the “Setor de Ciências Biológicas” (UFPR) and fixed in FAA 70. The <b>cystoliths</b> were located in the epidermal cells of the adaxial face (litocysths) and also among the collenchyma cells of the midrib and petiole. The <b>cystoliths</b> were cylindrical, long, with several small projections. They sometimes occurred in pairs and varied greatly in size, with an average length of 163. 4 ± 68. 8 µm and a density of 23 ± 9. 97 <b>cystoliths.</b> mm- 2 (n= 10). The foliar lamina presented a uniseriate epidermis, dorsiventral mesophyll, and palisade parenchyma, which was continuous along the lamina. In the midrib, arc-shaped vascular veins were surrounded by fundamental parenchyma. Glandular trichomes occurred on both faces of the leaf, while non-glandular trichomes and diacytic stomata were present only on the abaxial face. The great number {{and size of the}} <b>cystoliths</b> observed could be related to defenses against herbivory and to mechanisms of removal of excess calcium absorbed from the soil...|$|R

The aim of the present work was to analyze the anatomical structure of stem, leaf and root of J. curcas and J. macrocarpa seedling cultivated in a greenhouse. Fixed samples were properly treated using triple stain hematoxylin, safranin and fast green. Primary roots were diarch and triarch in J. curcas, whereas in J. macrocarpa were diarch and the cortex showed parenchyma cells, larger in J. macrocarpa than J. curcas. Stem cortex was thicker in J. macrocarpa than in J. curcas. Both species had parenchyma cells with <b>cystolith,</b> chloroplasts, laticifers and starch granules, these being more abundant in J. macrocarpa. Leaves were characterized by dorsoventral anatomy, with the epiderm showing amphistomatic condition with high stomata density at the lower surface. Both Jatropha species had paracytic stomata.

40|$|Objectives: Standardization is {{essentially}} a measure for ensuring the quality control of herbal drugs. But {{the gender of the}} plant affecting the quality of crude drugs {{does not appear to have}} been taken care of so far. Today, sophisticated modern research tools for the evaluation of the plant drugs are available but the microscopic method is one of the simplest and cheapest methods. Methods and Materials: The pharmacognostic investigation of the fresh, powdered, and anatomical sections of the female leaves of Trichosanthes dioica Roxb. was carried out to determine its bioprospective constants. Results and Discussion : Externally, the leaves possess a cordate base, a sinuate and dentate margin, an acute to acuminate apex, and both surfaces are very rough with rigid hair surface. Internally, it shows the presence of anomocytic stomata, unicellular, and both glandular and simple covering trichomes scattered as such throughout or attached with the cells of the epidermis. Majority of the glandular trichomes are with a four-to-five-celled uniseriate stalk and unicellular head; very few are short and with uni- to bicellular stalk and uni- to multicellular head especially from that of the petiole region. Simple covering, multicellular, uniseriate thick-walled trichomes are of various sizes. Usually cells of both simple and glandular trichomes are often embedded with <b>cystolith.</b> Phytochemical studies of the powdered leaves revealed the presence of alkaloids, resins, glycosides, flavonoids and some carbohydrates.

40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to obtain and compare two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) ultrasonographic images of the urinary bladder in different disease conditions. Materials and Methods: The present study was conducting on total 10 clinical cases of the urinary bladder in dogs. The ultrasound (US) machine used for this study was 3 D US machine (Nemio-XG: Toshiba, Japan) having a four-dimensional volumetric probe. Results: In the present study, the inflamed thickened wall was clearly visible with the distinction of different layers of the urinary bladder wall in some of the cases of cystitis using 2 D ultrasonography. In 3 D sonogram, the urinary bladder was visualized as a large anechoic structure with no distinction of different layers of the bladder wall. The <b>cystoliths</b> were clearly visible as hyperechoic structures with distal acoustic shadow in 2 D sonogram and appeared as a bright echogenic area in 3 D sonogram. In case of urinary bladder neoplasia in 2 D ultrasonogram, the bladder lumen was found to be occluded with a large growth imaged as focal anechoic areas in the tissue of mixed echogenicity with small hyperechoic dots in this tissue parenchyma. In 3 D ultrasonogram, a tissue of mixed echogenicity of pus was also observed. Conclusion: From the present study it was concluded that 2 D and 3 D ultrasonography is very helpful for diagnosis of different clinical conditions of the urinary bladder such as cystitis, <b>cystoliths,</b> and urinary bladder neoplasia. The cavity of urinary bladder was more clearly visualized in 3 D ultrasonography, but the distinction of different layers of the bladder wall was visualized only in 2 D ultrasonography.
