40|$|Abstract—Historically, space-based {{processing}} systems have lagged behind their terrestrial counterparts by several processor generations due, in part, {{to the cost}} and complexity of im-plementing radiation-hardened processor designs. Efforts such as NASA’s SpaceCube seek to change this paradigm, using higher performance commercial hardware wherever possible. This {{has the potential to}} revolutionize onboard data processing, but it cannot happen unless the soft error reliability can be characterized and deemed sufficient. A variety of fault injection techniques are used to evaluate system reliability, most commonly fault emulation, fault simula-tion, laser testing, and particle beam testing. Combining multiple techniques is more complex and less common. In this study we <b>characterize</b> <b>a</b> <b>real-world</b> application that leverages a radiation-hardening by software (RHBSW) solution for the SpaceCube platform, using two fault injection strategies: laser testing and fault emulation. We describe several valuable lessons learned, and show how both validation techniques can be combined to greater effect. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{benefits}} of electronically-switched directional antennas in low-power wireless networks. This antenna technology may improve energy efficiency by increasing the communication range and by alleviating contention in directions other than the destination, but in principle requires a dedicated network stack. Unlike most existing works, we start by <b>characterizing</b> <b>a</b> <b>real-world</b> antenna prototype, and apply this to an existing low-power wireless stack, which we adapt with minimal changes. Our results show that: i) {{the combination of a}} low-cost directional antenna and a conventional network stack already brings significant performance improvements, e. g., nearly halving the radio-on time per delivered packet; ii) the margin of improvement available to alternative clean-slate protocol designs is similarly large and concentrated in the control rather than the data plane; iii) by artificially modifying our antenna's link-layer model, we can point at further potential benefits opened by different antenna designs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} {{benefits}} of electronically-switched directional (ESD) antennas in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). ESD antennas have proved beneficial in cellular and ad-hoc networks, by increasing the communication range and by alleviating contention in directions other than the destination. The advantages in WSNs are, however, still largely to be quantified. Unlike existing works in this field, we start by <b>characterizing</b> <b>a</b> <b>real-world</b> antenna prototype, and apply this to an existing WSN stack, which we adapt with minimal changes. Our results show that: i) {{the combination of a}} low-cost ESD antenna and a mainstream WSN stack already brings significant performance improvements, e. g., nearly halving the radio-on time per delivered packet; ii) the margin of improvement available to alternative clean-slate protocol designs is similarly large and concentrated in the control rather than the data plane; iii) by artificially modifying our antenna’s link-layer model, further potential benefits opened by different antenna designs may be available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providing such quantitative insights based on a real ESD antenna prototype and a complete WSN stack. I...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} and {{explores the}} notion of <b>a</b> <b>real-world</b> environment with respect to adaptive pattern recognition and neural network systems. It then examines the individual properties of <b>a</b> <b>real-world</b> environment and proposes Continuous Adaptation, Persistence of information and Context-sensitive recognition to be the major design criteria a neural network system in <b>a</b> <b>real-world</b> environment should satisfy. Based on these criteria, it then assesses the performance of Hopfield networks and Associative Memory systems and identifies their operational limitations. This leads {{to the introduction of}} Randomized Internal Representations, a novel class of neural network systems which stores information in a fully distributed way yet is capable of encoding and utilizing context. It then assesses the performance of Competitive Learning and Adaptive Resonance Theory systems and again having identified their operational weakness, it describes the Dynamic Adaptation Scheme which satisfies all three design criteria for <b>a</b> <b>real-world</b> environment...|$|R
