In this paper we show that our model <b>checking</b> <b>procedure</b> for linear programs can be extended {{in such a way}} to support the analysis of linear programs featuring a symbol for undefined values and conditional expressions. This extension is particularly important as it paves the way to the construction of model <b>checking</b> <b>procedures</b> for wider classes of imperative programs such as, e. g., linear programs with arrays. We provide a detailed account of a symbolic model <b>checking</b> <b>procedure</b> for this extended class of linear programs, discuss its implementation in the eureka tool, and present experimental results that confirm its effectiveness in the analysis of linear programs with arrays...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for checking CTL formulas in Kripke structures with side conditions, where the side conditions define new variables {{in terms of}} path formulas. Given any CTL formula where the defined variables may occur, the presented algorithm will determine the set of states where the CTL ∗ formula holds that is obtained by replacing each new variable defined by a side condition by its definition. The basic idea of our algorithm is to translate each side condition to a Kripke structure that encodes precisely {{the definition of the}} new variable. After that, we compute the products of these structures with the given structure and use a generalization of the well-known CTL model <b>checking</b> <b>procedure.</b> The presented model <b>checking</b> <b>procedure</b> can still be implemented as a symbolic model <b>checking</b> <b>procedure</b> (e. g. with BDDs). We moreover show how each CTL ∗ model checking problem can be translated efficiently to a CTL model checking problem with side conditions, and hence show that the method can be used to construct efficient CTL ∗ and LTL model <b>checking</b> <b>procedures.</b> Moreover, it is shown that for LTL model checking, we can still use standard CTL model <b>checking</b> <b>procedures</b> instead of our generalized version. ...|$|R

5000|$|On 26 July 2010, after {{completing}} a security oversight investigation in May, the EU authorities revoked Budapest Airport's official [...] "Schengen Clear" [...] certification, due to serious lapses observed in personal security <b>check</b> <b>procedures</b> and unauthorised passing of banned objects. This meant passenger connecting via another {{airport in the}} Schengen Zone {{would have to be}} rescreened through security, just as foreign non-Schengen connecting passengers, causing delays and inconvieniance.

The airports layout was also cited as an excuse for the failure. Budapest Airport was the first airport to be checked through a stringent undercover evaluation for compliance with the new regulation. (Hungarian state news agency MTI reports: http://hirek.mti.hu/english/article/491952/) In response additional security measures were immediately implemented at Budapest Airport causing flight delays at both terminals. Unusually long passenger waiting queues were observed at the more busy 2A-B terminal complex's departures area. These problems were solved over time, especially through the opening of the SkyCourt terminal including a central security zone.|$|E

The foothold selection decision maker is shaped automatically, without expert knowledge. The robot learns how to select appropriate footholds by walking on rough terrain or by testing ground primitives.

A new approach to function approximation is proposed. It uses the leastsquares fitting method, the Kolmogorov theorem and population-based optimization algorithms.

40|$|Repeated {{checking}} paradoxically increases memory uncertainty. This {{study investigated}} the underlying mechanism of this effect. We hypothesized {{that as a result}} of repeated checking, familiarity with stimuli increases, and automatization of the <b>checking</b> <b>procedure</b> occurs, which should result in decreased memory confidence. We also hypothesized that defamiliarization of the stimuli background leads to de-automatization of <b>checking</b> <b>procedures,</b> and thereby attenuates the effects of repeated checking on memory. Eighty-nine healthy participants performed a computerized checking task, in which they had to activate, deactivate, and check threat-irrelevant stimuli. In a pre- and post-test, participants re-checked stimuli, after which they rated confidence in their memory about the last check. They also completed a reaction time task during the pre- and post-test, to assess automatization of the checking task, in which they responded to tones that were randomly presented. To test the effects of defamiliarization, the perceptual characteristics of the stimuli background were modified. Results showed that repeated checking led to reductions in memory confidence. Furthermore, re-checking led to automatization of <b>checking</b> <b>procedures,</b> but automatization did not mediate the relationship between repeated checking and memory confidence.
