40|$|Energy {{storage is}} {{important}} for many applications from hybrid vehicles to off-peak electric power to rotating machinery. A flywheel offers the combination of high energy density and high power density not attainable with other energy storage medium. In many situations, it is desirable to store energy at a constant angular velocity. This work proposes a novel self-governing fluidic variable inertia flywheel that can maintain a constant angular velocity {{across a range of}} energy storage. The fluidic flywheel uses a piston to separate the liquid filled chamber from a chamber vented to atmosphere. A force balance is created on the piston due to the radial pressure gradient of the liquid reacted by a <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>spring.</b> Energy added to the system is stored in equally two forms: increases the kinetic energy of the flywheel at a constant angular velocity and increasing the potential energy of the <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>spring.</b> A design example demonstrates that the fluidic flywheel enables a constant angular velocity with an order of magnitude lower mass moment of inertia than a conventional flywheel. This promising technology enables a simple constant angular velocity energy storage system, yet requires future work in numerous areas. I...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical springs are {{a common}} element in {{mechanism}} {{from all walks of}} life; cars, watches, appliances, and many others. These springs generally exhibit a linear relationship between force and deflection.

The expressed and purified SAH domain was highly helical, melted non-cooperatively, and was monomeric as shown by circular dichroism and mass spectrometry as expected for a SAH domain. Single molecule force spectroscopy experiments showed that the SAH domain unfolded at very low forces (< 30 pN) without a characteristic unfolding peak.

The {{receiver}} is held at {{the focus of the}} reflector by an aerostat tethered to the ground by multiple tethers.

40|$|The {{study of}} sound and {{vibration}} are closely related. Sound or "pressure waves" are generated by vibrating structures (e. g. vocal cords); these pressure waves can also induce the vibration of structures (e. g. ear drum). Hence, when trying to reduce noise it is often a problem in trying to reduce vibration. The high speed engines and machines when mounted on foundations and supports cause vibrations of excessive amplitude because of unbalance forces setup during their working. These are the disturbing forces which damage the foundation on which the machines are mounted. So the vibration transmitted to the foundation should be eliminated or reduced considerably by using some devices such as springs, dampers etc. between the foundation and machine. "Passive vibration isolation" refers to vibration isolation or mitigation of vibrations by passive techniques such as rubber pads or mechanical springs, as opposed to "active vibration isolation" or "electronic force cancellation" employing electric power, sensors, actuators, and control systems. Passive vibration isolation is a vast subject, since there are many types of passive vibration isolators used for many different applications. [1 - 6]. The proposed isolator {{is divided into three}} portions. The upper portion is a table on which the isolated objects are placed. The upper portion consists of one horizontal top plate and two vertical hexagonal plates. The middle portion consists of two shafts connected by elements to provide a nonlinear restoring <b>force.</b> <b>Constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>springs,</b> coil springs and wires are examples of such elements. Here <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>springs</b> are composed of rolled spring steel and have <b>constant</b> restoring <b>force</b> regardless of their stretch. At both ends of each shaft, inner and outer roller bearings are installed. In the lower portion one screw connected by two beams. The beams are connected to the cranks using pin connections. Half of the length of the screw jack is threaded by the opposite direction to that of the outer half. With such a composition the horizontal restoring force provides by the middle portion can be converted into the vertical restoring force. In conversion, the vertical resisting force can be adjusted simply by changing the angle of the inclined bars of the cranks which is the key ingredient of the present vibration isolator.

Although the function of the SAH-domains in human class- 6 and class- 10 myosins has well been characterised, the distribution of the SAH-domain in all myosin subfamilies and across the eukaryotic tree of life remained elusive.

30|$|In 1998, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and ILC Dover, Inc. {{developed}} a 1 m diameter X-band planar membrane reflect array antenna [41], {{as shown in}} Figure  7 (a). The two-layer membrane was polyimide film with both sides clad with 0.5 µm thick copper. The frame was a circular inflatable tube, which was connected to a tripod supporting the antenna feed. In 2000, the two companies co-{{developed a}} 3 m Ka-band membrane reflect array antenna [42], as shown in Figure  7 (b). The horseshoe shaped frame consisted of one straight rigid tube, two straight tubes, and one semi-circular inflatable tube. The membrane could be rolled on the rigid tube to avoid creases. There were 16 catenary points distributed on the horseshoe shaped frame to apply stress on the membrane, and the surface flatness {{was measured to be}} ±  0.2 mm. In 2002, JPL proposed the idea of a “movie screen” membrane array antenna with a rectangular frame [44, 45], as shown in Figure  7 (c). The antenna feed was offset on the spacecraft, which eliminated the need for a feed-supporting tripod, resulting in a more compact structure. Two edges of the rectangular frame were inflatable tubes, and the other two edges were flat panels covered by roll-up shells, on which the membrane could be tightly rolled. Several cross bars, distributed uniformly on the membrane and employed as compression members to stretch the membrane, had no connection with the inflatable tubes. One <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>spring</b> hung on each end of the cross bar and was connected to cables at the membrane edge. Similarly, some constant force springs hung on the flat panel and were connected to the cable. The membrane was deployed by the tubes inflating and was tensioned by constant force springs after deployment. From 2004 to 2008, JPL conducted a series of studies on “movie screen” antennas [46 – 48]. In 2008, a 2.2 m ×  2.2 m planar membrane antenna was developed and achieved a surface flatness of 0.17 mm.|$|E
40|$|The {{design for}} a human powered battery charger was {{analyzed}} and a redesign was proposed. The original product was designed in the MIT ME course 2. 009 to power a LED projector {{that will be used}} to teach literacy classes in Mali. The goals of the new design are to decrease the cost and usability of the alpha prototype, producing a minimum of 60 W that is required to provide a 10 : 1 use to charge ratio for the 6 W projector. The alpha prototype utilizes a modified rowing motion to move a device produces power through a <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>spring,</b> a small motor. A voltage regulator safely charges the battery using the voltage output of the motor. The rowing motion requires a number of moving parts and expensive components and although the complex motion combines the power available from the leg and arm muscles, the movement is not simple to understand or particularly comfortable to use. A model was created to test a proposed redesign that simplifies the product in several areas. The new design will use the arm muscles only to provide the necessary power and will avoid costs by making the charger a stationary product. The model is made of a recoil spring and pulley mechanism mounted to a freewheel, which turns a shaft and flywheel. The shaft would then be connected to a motor to charge the battery in a similar manner to that of the alpha prototype. (cont.) The experiments performed and calculations on the model provided information that suggests that a flywheel based design does provide sufficient power for a 60 W output.

In 1974, Roy received a degree in physics from Boston University and then got a job as a computer programmer for an insurance company until becoming a sculptor in 1975. The idea for the career direction came from his wife-to-be, Marji, who was at the time an art student at Rhode Island School of Design. His sculptures, which are mainly made from laminated Baltic birch hardwood, are not timepieces but they do include clockwork-like mechanisms such as escapements, suspended weights, counter-weights, and (more recently) <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>springs.</b> They are not electrically powered because an important connection is that the viewer winds the piece by hand. The run time of early models was about 30 minutes, but he has refined the technique to the point that some run up to 40 hours on a single full wind. Many include the moving moiré pattern from co-axial spoked wheels rotating in opposite directions. Roy focuses not only on the motion but also the sound. He has developed escapements that are either nearly silent or that produce the soft clicking of wood on wood. A few incorporate wind chime tubes.

Tendon loading is often applied during cadaver experiments to simulate natural stabilizing joint compression in the wrist joint. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of tendon loading on carpal kinematics in-vitro. A cyclic movement was imposed on 7 cadaveric forearms while the carpal kinematics were acquired by a 4 -dimensional rotational X-ray imaging system. The extensor- and flexor tendons were loaded with <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>springs</b> of 50 N, respectively. The measurements were repeated without a load on the tendons. The effect of loading on the kinematics was tested statistically by using a linear mixed model. During flexion and extension, the proximal carpal bones were more extended with tendon loading. The lunate was on the average 2. 0 degrees (p= 0. 012) more extended. With tendon loading the distal carpal bones were more ulnary deviated at each angle of wrist motion. The capitate was on the average 2. 4 (p= 0. 004) more ulnary deviated. During radioulnar deviation, the proximal carpal bones were more radially deviated with the lunate 0. 7 degrees more into radial deviation with tendon loading (p < 0. 001). Conversely, the bones of distal row were more flexed and supinated with the capitate 1. 5 degrees more into flexion (p= 0. 025) and 1. 0 more into supination (p= 0. 011). In conclusion, the application of a constant load onto the flexor and extensor tendons in cadaver experiments has a small but statistically significant effect on the carpal kinematics during flexion-extension and radioulnar deviation.

40|$|Key {{point of}} this thesis is the {{numerical}} investigation of the static and dynamic behaviour of an unfolded lightweight radarantenna, a so called gossamer structure. These structures are special deployable and lightweight for the use in space. They are constructed to unfold from a packed state for storage and transport into orbit to a deployed state for the use in orbit. This special an-tenna {{will be used for}} synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to monitor the earth and its activities, e. g. glacier movements, tectonic activities or changes in its vegetation. For this use, the antenna shall comply with very strict atness requirements after uncoiling from convoluted state. This project is currently carried out by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) at its laboratories in Brunswick, Germany. The unfolding process is very precarious for the structure. Therefore, the design has to avoid any possible damage to the structure resulting from the deployment. Dynamic problems were investigated to obtain the best possible structural damp-ing in a micro- to zero gravitation condition. Before any dynamical behaviour of the antenna could be investigated, the static behaviour has to be understood at _rst. This is necessary to determi-nate the forces in the frame around the heart of the antenna, which is formed by a multiple Kap-ton membrane layer. A planar and at state without any wrinkling in the Kapton membrane is vital for the function. After the static simulation of the stress conditions in the boom and membrane the dynamic behaviour can be simulated. Main part of the modelling was to _nd a suitable way to build up a _nite element model of shell and beam elements for the frame. Naturally they both have some restrictions in usage which can be eliminated via intelligent modelling.

On Neurolab, a virtual environment display system was used to conduct five interrelated experiments, which quantified: (a) how the direction of each person's subjective vertical depends on {{the orientation of the}} surrounding visual environment, (b) whether rolling the virtual visual environment produces stronger illusions of circular self-motion (circular vection) and more visual reorientation illusions than on Earth, (c) whether a virtual scene moving past the subject produces a stronger linear self-motion illusion (linear vection), and (d) whether deliberate manipulation of the subjective vertical changes a crewmember's interpretation of shading or the ability to recognize objects. None of the crew's subjective vertical indications became more independent of environmental cues in weightlessness. Three who were either strongly dependent on or independent of stationary visual cues in preflight tests remained so inflight. One other became more visually dependent inflight, but recovered postflight. Susceptibility to illusions of circular self-motion increased in flight. The time to the onset of linear self-motion illusions decreased and the illusion magnitude significantly increased for most subjects while free floating in weightlessness. These decreased toward one-G levels when the subject 'stood up' in weightlessness by wearing <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>springs.</b> For several subjects, changing the relative direction of the subjective vertical in weightlessness-either by body rotation or by simply cognitively initiating a visual reorientation-altered the illusion of convexity produced when viewing a flat, shaded disc. It changed at least one person's ability to recognize previously presented two-dimensional shapes. Overall, results show that most astronauts become more dependent on dynamic visual motion cues and some become responsive to stationary orientation cues. The direction of the subjective vertical is labile in the absence of gravity. This can interfere with the ability to properly interpret shading, or to recognize complex objects in different orientations...|$|R

DEAPs are attractive in the aerospace community {{due to their}} light weight, low electrical power consumption and no noise. A biasing mechanism is needed to supply the DEAP actuator with an optimal pre-load, and its design has {{a major impact on}} the overall actuator performance. The biasing elements considered are a conventional linear positive-stiffness bias (PSB) <b>spring,</b> and a <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> bias (CFB) <b>spring.</b> These biasing elements are paired with a roll DEAP actuator and experimentally tested under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions with a focus on the stroke and blocked force capabilities. The experimental results indicate improvement in stroke using a CFB element but at the cost of blocked force. Work potential is found higher using a PSB than a CFB mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Artificial gravity (AG) {{created by}} short-radius {{centrifugation}} is a promising countermeasure to the physiological de-conditioning {{that results from}} long-duration spaceflight. However, as on Earth, gravity alone does not ensure fitness. We will need to supplement passive exposure to AG with physical exercise to achieve a comprehensive countermeasure. Before AG exercise can be deemed safe and effective, we must understand how Coriolis accelerations and a gravity gradient affect our biomechanics and how centrifuge-based exercises differ from Earth-upright ones. Two experiments were designed to investigate the squat biomechanics while upright in the laboratory and while lying supine on a horizontal, clockwise-rotating short-radius centrifuge at speeds up to 30 revolutions per minute. <b>Constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>springs</b> provided additional resistive force up to 25 % of body weight. Dependent measure included the three-dimensional position of {{the left and right}} knee, left and right foot reaction forces, and muscle activity. We investigated the Coriolis-induced mediolateral knee perturbations and the sensory-motor after-effects from a multiple repetition protocol. The upright and centrifuge biomechanics were compared for similarities and differences between them. In addition, a two-dimensional kinematic model was developed to predict foot reaction forces, Coriolis accelerations, and joint torques. (cont.) Our results show that mediolateral knee travel during the AG squats was 1. 0 to 2. 0 centimeters greater than Earth-upright squats. Increasing the rotation rate or adding resistive force did not affect the results. The peak foot forces increased with rotation rate, but rarely exceeded 200 % body weight. The ratio of left-to-right foot force during centrifugation was non-constant and approximately sinusoidal, suggesting a postural correction for the Coriolis accelerations. There was a qualitative difference in the foot force vs. knee angle profile between upright and centrifuge-supine because of the centripetal acceleration. Muscle activity, however, was qualitatively similar between the conditions. The kinematic model was used to evaluate the exercise safety and extend the results to larger-radius centrifuges. We conclude that centrifugation provides a unique and challenging environment for exercise and that a brief artificial gravity squat can be carried out safely. The results are extended to cycle ergometry, when possible, and recommendations are made for future AG squat protocols.

Restriction set on 16. 03. 2017 by SC, Graduate schoolThe original aim of {{the research}} project was to investigate the mechanism of power capture from sea waves and to optimise the performance of a vee-shaped floating Wave Energy Converter, the Floating Clam, patented by Francis Farley. His patent was based on the use of a pressurised bag (or ‘reservoir’) to hold the hinged Clam sides apart, so that, as they moved under the action of sea waves, air would be pumped into and out of a further air reservoir via a turbine/generator set, in order to extract power from the system. Such “Clam Action” would result in the lengthening of the resonant period in heave. The flexibility of the air bag supporting the Clam sides was an important design parameter. This was expected to lead to a reduction in the mass (and hence cost) of the Clam as compared with a rigid body. However, the present research has led {{to the conclusion that the}} Clam is most effective when constrained in heave and an alternative power take-off is proposed. The theoretical investigations made use of WAMIT, an industry-standard software tool that provides an analysis based on potential flow theory where fluid viscosity is ignored. The WAMIT option of Generalised Modes has been used to model the Clam action. The hydrodynamic coefficients, calculated by WAMIT, have been curve-fitted so that the correct values are available for any chosen wave period. Two bespoke mathematical models have been developed in this work: a frequency domain model, that uses the hydrodynamic coefficients calculated by WAMIT, and a time domain model, linked to the frequency domain model in such a way as to automatically use the same hydrodynamic and hydrostatic data. In addition to modelling regular waves, the time domain model contains an approximate, but most effective method to simulate the behaviour of the Clam in irregular waves, which could be of use in future control system studies. A comprehensive series of wave tank trials has been completed, and vital to their success has been the modification of the wave tank model to achieve very low values of power take-off stiffness through the use of <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> <b>springs,</b> with negligible mechanical friction in the hinge mechanism. Furthermore, the wave tank model has demonstrated its robustness and thus its suitability for use in further test programmes. The thesis concludes with design suggestions for a full-scale device that employs a pulley/counterbalance arrangement to provide a direct connection to turbine/generator sets, giving an efficient drive with low stiffness and inherently very low friction losses. At the current stage of research, the mean annual power capture is estimated as 157. 5 kW, wave to wire in a far from energetic 18 kw/m mean annual wave climate, but with scope for improvement, including through control system development...|$|R
