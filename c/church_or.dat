5|$|A <b>church,</b> <b>or</b> group, that {{is unable}} to fully provide for the {{religious}} needs of its members is called a mission. Missions are dependent on a congregation which is administered by a minister. A group of several congregations with their missions form a district. The Church in each nation is divided into multiple districts. In Mexico, several districts form together into five jurisdictions that act as legal entities.|$|E

5|$|During Hygeberht's archbishopric, joint synods for {{the provinces}} of Lichfield and Canterbury were held, presided over by both archbishops. These gatherings were canonically irregular, as the usual {{procedure}} was for each province to hold its own synod. The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear; {{they may have been}} a manifestation of Offa's desire to supervise the entire southern <b>church,</b> <b>or</b> an attempt by the archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{the sacrament}} of {{initiation}} into the visible <b>church,</b> <b>or</b> body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial only to those who have faith in Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E

5|$|Maribojoc Church, {{also known}} as Santa Cruz Parish <b>Church</b> <b>or</b> Holy Cross Parish Church, was a Roman Catholic Church in the {{municipality}} of Maribojoc, Bohol, Philippines, under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tagbilaran. The parish was first established by the Jesuits in 1767 or 1768 with Father Juan Soriano, SJ as its first parish priest. The Augustinian Recollects later administered the community until 1898.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland has no {{official}} state religion, {{though most of}} the cantons (except Geneva and Neuchâtel) recognise official churches, which are either the Roman Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>or</b> the Swiss Reformed Church.

5|$|Two {{groups were}} excluded. Roman Catholics who {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} Pope would not be tolerated. They were, in fact, regarded as traitors, because the Pope had refused to accept Elizabeth as Queen of England. Roman Catholics were given the hard choice of being loyal either to their <b>church</b> <b>or</b> their country. For some priests it meant life on the run, in some cases death for treason.|$|E
5|$|Why Æthelberht {{chose to}} convert to Christianity is uncertain. Bede {{suggests}} that the king converted strictly for religious reasons, but most modern historians see other motives behind Æthelberht's decision. Certainly, given Kent's close contacts with Gaul, {{it is possible that}} Æthelberht sought baptism in order to smooth his relations with the Merovingian kingdoms, or to align himself with one of the factions then contending in Gaul. Another consideration may have been that new methods of administration often followed conversion, whether directly from the newly introduced <b>church</b> <b>or</b> indirectly from other Christian kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of churches that existed in Visby during the Middle Ages is unknown, there were {{certainly}} more than in any other Swedish city, and at least twelve within the city walls. Visby grew to become an important trading port during the Middle Ages, and most of the churches in the city were built during the 12th and 13th centuries. The churches were not, as in the countryside, only parish churches. Some belonged to abbeys, almshouses or served groups of traders of a specific nationality, such as the Russian <b>Church</b> <b>or</b> present-day Visby Cathedral, which was originally a church used by German traders.|$|E

5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from the aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main <b>church</b> <b>or</b> its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory was rebuilt three times; {{the ruins}} visible today are principally {{those of the}} third rebuild. The site was {{occupied}} in Anglo-Saxon times {{by at least one}} structure, possibly a timber-framed <b>church</b> <b>or</b> boundary wall, indicated by a number of postholes. It is believed there was a Saxon settlement in the vicinity as late-Saxon potsherds and an 8th-century coin have been found buried under the remains of the priory's west nave. The site was abandoned at some point {{and by the time the}} priory was built the land on which it stood was mostly under cultivation. Part of it was used as a graveyard in the early 12th century and an early Norman building was erected in the vicinity, possibly a temporary church.|$|E

While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station.

For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish <b>church</b> <b>or</b> the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave.|$|E

5|$|Recognized for its {{architectural}} {{and cultural}} significance, the Danebod Historic Complex, at 101 Danebod Court, was {{listed on the}} U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June30, 1975. The complex includes four historic buildings: the Folk School (built in 1888, rebuilt in 1917), Stone Hall (1889), Cross <b>Church</b> <b>or</b> Danebod Lutheran Church (1893), and Gym Hall (1904). Most of these buildings survived the disastrous fire of 1917, except for the Folk School, which burned down and was rebuilt the same year. These buildings also stood through the devastating 1918 tornado, which killed 36 people in the community.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was greatly injured by the Danes in 988, and again (by Gruffydd ab Llewelyn) in 1038. Portions {{of an earlier}} structure were alleged {{to be included in}} the present edifice, which is of early English style. This is, however, unlikely, as stone church construction in Wales has been conventionally dated to the twelfth century and later, and the earlier buildings were probably wooden, although we know that a new tower and porch were built around 1115. Much evidence which might have shown whether there was any fabric dating from before the thirteenth century reconstruction, and even as far back as late Celtic (or Romano-British) times, was lost with the extensive late-Victorian reconstruction, particularly of the nave, is hidden beneath the present <b>church,</b> <b>or</b> is in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|The chapel's Collegiate Gothic design evokes an English {{church of}} the Middle Ages, {{although}} several aspects of it, including the vault and its supports, recall French churches. The chapel is cruciform and is built {{on the scale of}} a large parish <b>church</b> <b>or</b> a small cathedral. The only precedent for a university chapel of this size was King's College Chapel, and {{only a small part of}} that chapel was used regularly. Stillwell cites Exeter Cathedral and the Octagon tower of Ely Cathedral as precedents for the architectural detail, but notes that the Princeton chapel's detail nonetheless differs significantly from these.|$|E
