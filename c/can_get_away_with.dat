This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E

[...] This is the kind of kitschy album that you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> having because Spears is such a prevalent component of pop culture." [...] James Gashinski of The Gazette said that [...] "As a time capsule, My Prerogative does its job well," [...] but [...] "Added together, the pop hits on this album are somewhat less than the sum of their parts". He explained, [...] "Even if it isn't as great a listen as a cohesive album, My Prerogative does work as a portrait of the time when Britney Spears was the defining figure of American pop culture". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed with Gashinski, but added [...] "if you compare it to The Immaculate Collection, which captured the time when Madonna was the defining figure of American pop culture and does work as an album, it's clear that a cultural artifact isn't necessarily the same thing as great music".|$|E

500|$|Kesha's second studio album Warrior used {{considerably}} less autotune, although it still showed {{in a number}} of songs. The album's piano and guitar-driven ballads such as [...] "Love Into The Light", [...] "Wonderland" [...] and [...] "Past Lives" [...] display Kesha's vocal ability. Kesha also uses a trademark talky [...] "white-girl" [...] rapping style with exaggerated discordant phrasing and enunciation. Her vocal technique has led her to be credited as a rapper, a topic she disagreed with until fellow rappers André 3000, Wiz Khalifa, and Snoop Dogg endorsed her. On the subject, she said: [...] "The first time someone called me a rapper, I started laughing. I was shocked, and thought it was hilarious. It's crazy and funny to me." [...] The New York Times said Kesha [...] "threatens to become the most influential female rapper of the day, or at least the most popular. Pretending Kesha isn't a rapper is no longer feasible." [...] "Crazy Kids" [...] and [...] "C'Mon" [...] took greater shifts into [...] "party rap". Most of her lyrics chronicle her relationships and partying; the lighthearted subject matter of the latter and her unfiltered language saw many critics criticizing her for releasing frivolous and crass music. Jonah Weiner of Slate, however, stated that her jarring lyrics allowed her songs to become more memorable. In [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] and [...] "Boots & Boys", she objectifies men to poke fun at how male fronted rock bands and rappers <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> objectifying women and not vice versa. The title track to her debut, [...] "Animal", is more aspirational and is intended to inspire people to embrace their individuality. Much more experimental than Animal, her second album, Warrior, contains dubstep elements and explores erotic experiences Kesha encountered with ghosts on the song [...] "Supernatural". Overall, Kesha said the theme of Warrior is magic.|$|E
500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm". Shields aimed to use [...] "very simple minimal effects" [...] which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, [...] "The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely like that. That way you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> a lot more when you mess around with the contents". In a 1992 Guitar World interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on [...] "I Only Said" [...] by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually. The interviewer asked if Shields could have achieved the same effect more easily by simply using a wah-wah pedal, to which the guitarist replied, [...] "In attitude toward sound, yes.

500|$|The video {{stood out}} conspicuously to Aguilar for its chaotic texture through the rapid editing of the {{multiple}} shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an [...] "apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation", she added. Since chaos has traditionally {{been associated with the}} female ontogenetic principle as opposed to male principle of order, the video in turn came to be associated with duality between order/chaos, male/female, good/evil, light/dark etc. Aguilar also drew parallel between Metropolis and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work. However, unlike Metropolis which portrayed repression of a rebellious proletariat, the chaotic nature of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] video showed freedom instead. Caryn James from The New York Times added that [...] "asked about the video, [...] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.' You don't have to buy Madonna's next loopy bit of symbolism—'I was chained to my desires'—to believe the feminist subtext she finds in the video. 'I do everything by my own volition. I'm in charge, O.K.' Madonna in chains, though, is far removed from those unfortunate women who don't know that they have options." [...] Madonna also complained about the feminist criticisms of her [...] "crotch-grabbing", saying that [...] "if male singers like Michael Jackson <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it, why can't women?" [...] Theorist Douglas Kellner further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end. According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images {{in the beginning of the}} video, but contrasted them with her [...] "crotch-hugging" [...] male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position. As feminist author Susan Bordo pointed out, [...] "it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition." ...|$|E
500|$|Webb {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself." [...] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to. As in the early comic books, the character [...] "is a science whiz. If you look {{back to the early}} Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses," [...] said Webb. He explained [...] "the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [...] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context." [...] Garfield compared his Spider-Man façade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, [...] "You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the [...] @#!*% [...] he likes, and he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> anything." [...] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels [...] "are the strongest human beings on the planet." [...] He said Parker is [...] "a human hero [...] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [...] want more power than they feel they have." [...] He believes Parker represents [...] "a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness—and {{how difficult it is to}} be good—but how worth it it is." [...] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father. Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero [...] "embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses". Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that [...] "his struggles involve real people—and real lives." ...|$|E
