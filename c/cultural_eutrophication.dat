The expansion of aquaculture, with production of biomass and increase of nutrients in water may cause acceleration of productivity of algae, changing {{the ecology of}} aquatic systems. In addition, these waste water may present a risk to health through the transfer of pathogens from manure, plant residues, composted material, among others that are major sources of organic waste in some farming systems. Depending on the trophic level of fish ponds, which are dynamic environments, different planktonic species with short reproductive cycle and adapted to the changes contained in these systems can appear in high abundance. Water quality in the systems for raising fish is related to several factors, such as water source, management (liming, fertilizing, cleaning), cultivated species and quantity and composition of exogenous food.

50|$|Nutrients are {{important}} to the growth and survival of living organisms, and hence, are essential for development and maintenance of healthy ecosystems. Humans have greatly influenced the phosphorus cycle by mining phosphorus, converting it to fertilizer, and by shipping fertilizer and products around the globe. Transporting phosphorus in food from farms to cities has made a major change in the global Phosphorus cycle. However, excessive amounts of nutrients, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, are detrimental to aquatic ecosystems. Waters are enriched in phosphorus from farms' run-off, and from effluent that is inadequately treated before it is discharged to waters. Natural eutrophication is a process by which lakes gradually age and become more productive and may take thousands of years to progress. <b>Cultural</b> or anthropogenic <b>eutrophication,</b> however, is water pollution caused by excessive plant nutrients; this results in excessive growth in the algal population; when this algae dies its putrefaction depletes the water of oxygen.Such eutrophication may also give rise to toxic algal bloom.Both these effects cause animal and plant death rates to increase as the plants take in poisonous water while the animals drink the poisoned water. Surface and subsurface runoff and erosion from high-phosphorus soils may be major contributing factors to this fresh water eutrophication. The processes controlling soil Phosphorus release to surface runoff and to subsurface flow are a complex interaction between the type of phosphorus input, soil type and management, and transport processes depending on hydrological conditions.|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{evaluation of}} aquatic eutrophication in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) expresses {{the contribution of}} nitrogen and/or phosphorus emissions to biomass production {{in terms of the}} equivalent emission of a reference substance. This assessment does not address environmental mechanisms (fate, exposure or effects), neither spatial differentiation. In order to improve the accordance between the actual impact of aquatic eutrophication and the impact predicted in LCA, characterisation factors need to model site dependent environmental mechanisms. Following this principle, Potting et al. (2004) developed fate-exposure factors from nitrogen and phosphorus sources for European inland and marine waters. The present research aims to complete the modelling of the environmental mechanisms by defining spatial differentiated effect factors that can later be use to calculate the characterisation factors. Nitrogen and phosphorus compounds contribute mainly to <b>cultural</b> aquatic <b>eutrophication</b> and are major nutrients that limit aquatic plant growth. A too large input of these nutrients lead to ecological cause-effect chain and oxygen depletion is one of the effects. Oxygen depletion can be the result of oxygen-consuming processes, e. g. decomposition of phytoplankton excess (direct effects), and at the same time, it may lead to final effects on plant and animal communities, e. g. loss of habitats, fish kills and phosphorus releases. Oxygen depletion is an effect closer to the endpoints of the cause-effect chain of aquatic eutrophication and by defining it as the category indicator, the assessment of aquatic eutrophication in LCA becomes more relevant. In order to calculate the effect (oxygen depletion) factors, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water has to be modelled. The model uses the basic principle of mass balance and includes the process of reareation from the atmosphere and the biochemical reactions of dissolved oxygen: photosynthesis, phytoplankton respiration, organic matter oxidation and nitrification. The eutrophication components are dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, phytoplankton and organic matter. Three main assumptions are defined to obtain the effect factors. Firstly, because LCA does not address temporal aspects, the dissolved oxygen concentration in water is modelled under steady state conditions. Nutrient limitation is the second assumption: phosphorus limits biomass growth in inland waters, whereas nitrogen does it in marine waters. Thirdly, the magnitude of the emissions of nutrients from a product lifecycle contribute marginal to the reference concentrations in the aquatic systems. Following this assumptions and defining the oxygen depletion with respect to the saturation level, the effect factor Effs,e after substance s is emitted to water e, is calculated as the ratio of oxygen depletion per substance concentration in the water. Finally, the characterisation factors are the aggregation of the multiplications between the fate-exposure factors and the effect factors here calculated for all waters (inland or marine waters) per country. The discussion is done {{at the level of the}} DO model definition, the data used, the assumptions in the calculation of the effect factors and the results. Attention is given to physical process and components that are not included in the model and that can have a relevant influence in the effect of oxygen depletion in waters. The used values of the variables and the assumptions are discussed in order to obtain more accurate site dependent effect factors. For example, the limiting factor of light intensity can include site dependent water depths, while the limiting factor of nutrients can address spatial differentiated limiting nutrients, especially in seas where the limitation of nitrogen stays unclear. ...|$|R
50|$|These {{nutrients}} {{result in}} an excessive growth of plant life known as an algal bloom. This can change a lake's natural food web, and also {{reduce the amount of}} dissolved oxygen in the water for organisms to breathe. Both these things cause animal and plant death rates to increase as the plants take in poisonous water while the animals drink the poisoned water. This contaminates water, making it undrinkable, and sediment quickly fills the lake. <b>Cultural</b> <b>eutrophication</b> is a form of water pollution.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>eutrophication</b> also {{occurs when}} {{excessive}} fertilizers run into lakes and rivers. This encourages {{the growth of}} algae (algal bloom) and other aquatic plants. Following this, overcrowding occurs and plants compete for sunlight, space and oxygen. Overgrowth of water plants also blocks sunlight and oxygen for aquatic life in the water, which in turn threatens their survival. Algae also grows easily, thus threatening other water plants no matter whether they are floating, half-submerged, or fully submerged. Not only does this cause algal blooming, it can cause an array of more long-term effects on the water such as damage to coral reefs and deep sea animal life. It also speeds up the damage of both marine and also affects humans if the effects of algal blooming is too drastic. Fish will die {{and there will be}} lack of food in the area.

50|$|While {{the water}} cycle {{is itself a}} {{biogeochemical}} cycle, flow of water over and beneath the Earth is {{a key component of}} the cycling of other biogeochemicals. Runoff is responsible for almost all of the transport of eroded sediment and phosphorus from land to waterbodies. The salinity of the oceans is derived from erosion and transport of dissolved salts from the land. <b>Cultural</b> <b>eutrophication</b> of lakes is primarily due to phosphorus, applied in excess to agricultural fields in fertilizers, and then transported overland and down rivers. Both runoff and groundwater flow play significant roles in transporting nitrogen from the land to waterbodies. The dead zone at the outlet of the Mississippi River is a consequence of nitrates from fertilizer being carried off agricultural fields and funnelled down the river system to the Gulf of Mexico. Runoff also plays a part in the carbon cycle, again through the transport of eroded rock and soil.|$|E

A consequence of the increased population (based on agriculture) has been large-scale <b>cultural</b> <b>eutrophication.</b> This process has accompanied all major civilisations.

40|$|We {{studied a}} {{complete}} Holocene sediment record from shallow (zmax = 9. 7 m) Lake Harris, Florida (USA) to infer the historical {{development of the}} lake and its current eutrophic status. We used (210) Pb and (14) C to date the 5. 9 -m sediment sequence (core LH- 6 - 13) and determined accumulation rates for bulk sediment, organic matter, calcium carbonate, phosphorus fractions and biogenic silica fractions. The chronology of changes in sediment characteristics for LH- 6 - 13 is consistent with the general paleoenvironmental framework established by core studies from other Florida lakes. Lake Harris began to fill with water in the early Holocene, ca. 10, 680 cal a BP. A shift from carbonate-dominated to organic-rich sediments ca. 5, 540 cal a BP corresponds to a transition to wetter climate in the middle Holocene. A rapid increase in diatom biogenic silica concentrations and accumulation rates ca. 2, 600 cal a BP signals that the lake had deepened to its modern limnetic state. In LH- 6 - 13, an up-core decrease in rates of accumulation for several sediment variables indicates time-course oligotrophication of the lake through the Holocene.

40|$|The {{coastal waters}} of Hong Kong have been {{influenced}} by a number of anthropogenic factors, including <b>cultural</b> <b>eutrophication,</b> land reclamation and dredging. The effects of climatic variability on phytoplankton dynamics may be difficult to discern in coastal ecosystems due to the interaction of climatic variability with anthropogenic effects. In this study, the influence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) on phytoplankton dynamics in Hong Kong coastal waters was examined from 1986 - 2004. Weak correlations were found to exist between chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) and the multivariate ENSO index and PDO index. However, strong correlations were found to exist between the NPGO index and Chl. The NPGO has been proposed to influence Chl concentration in the North Pacific through its influence on upwelling and nutrient concentrations. In the coastal waters of Hong Kong, which are highly impacted by <b>cultural</b> <b>eutrophication,</b> we propose a different mechanism. The NPGO is locally forced by surface wind variability and we have found a strong negative correlation between NPGO and wind speed in Hong Kong. By destabilizing the water column, high wind speeds are detrimental to phytoplankton growth and therefore we hypothesize that the relationship between the NPGO and phytoplankton dynamics is as a result of wind speed variability.

However, simply reverting to conditions ~ 150 years ago is generally insufficient since both human activities and natural climate changes have influenced the landscape and nutrient levels of rivers and lakes for several millennia. Limnological, geochemical and terrestrial ecological records (μXRF, LOI, pollen, macrocharcoal and diatom analyses) were collected from an annually laminated lake sediment (sampled at a contiguous 15 yr resolution) to investigate the resilience of lake ecosystems under natural and pre-industrial conditions. We focus on a sediment section that contains ~ 1600 years and which includes an abrupt transition to darker, organic-richer sediments at 4800 cal. yrs BP (Copper Age). Pollen and diatom records suggest minimal changes in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems prior to the transition.

40|$|Nitrogen {{often is}} the {{limiting}} nutrient {{for the growth}} of algae and phytoplankton in estuaries and surface waters in California. To control <b>cultural</b> <b>eutrophication</b> (i. e., excessive growth of algae and plankton related to anthropogenic sources) regulatory agencies often focus on the control of point source discharges, including municipal wastewater effluent. Recent attempts to control <b>cultural</b> <b>eutrophication</b> in nitrogen-limited systems have focused on the simultaneous control of all forms of inorganic nitrogen with the underlying assumption that inorganic and organic nitrogen are equally bioavailable. To assess the validity of this assumption, algal growth bioassays were conducted using denitrified wastewater effluent samples that contained mainly organic nitrogen. The growth assays were performed with a species of algae (Selenastrum Capricornutum) that is commonly used for regulatory compliance monitoring. Results of the study indicate that the wastewater-derived dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is not bioavailable to the algae in the absence of bacteria. However, approximately half of the wastewater-derived organic nitrogen was available to the algae in the presence of bacteria during a two-week incubation. In conjunction with the experiments on bioavailability, the nature and properties of wastewater-derived organic nitrogen was characterized by measuring concentrations of free and combined amino acids and by subjecting wastewater effluent samples to ultrafiltration. Results of these experiments indicate that most of the wastewater-derived organic nitrogen was associated with unidentified compounds that are capable of passing through a 1 kDa ultrafilter. Wastewater-derived organic nitrogen also {{plays an important role in}} the formation of the carcinogenic disinfection byproduct, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). NDMA is formed when wastewater effluent is disinfected with chlorine. It also can be formed when surface water or groundwater that has been impacted by wastewater effluent discharges undergoes disinfection in drinking water treatment plants. Recently, concerns associated with NDMA have caused great concern among utilities that practice indirect potable water reuse. Most of the attention to date has focused on the removal of NDMA from the treated wastewater effluent. However, the presence of NDMA precursors also could be a problem if the NDMA precursors in drinking sources are stable after they are discharged because they could result in NDMA formation during drinking water treatment. To assess the stability of NDMA precursors associated with wastewater-derived organic nitrogen, NDMA precursor concentrations were measured in effluent samples before and after incubation with bacteria under aerobic conditions. Results of the experiments indicate that the NDMA precursors are stable for at least 30 days. These results suggest that wastewater-derived organic nitrogen consists of complex compounds that are not very reactive. However, under certain conditions, wastewater-derived organic nitrogen species can serve as a source of nutrients in nitrogen-limited systems and as disinfection byproduct precursors. The results of this research will be useful in the development of indirect potable water reuse systems and the design of watershed protection plans designed to protect aquatic ecosystems from the effects of <b>cultural</b> <b>eutrophication...</b>|$|E
40|$|Lakes {{are in a}} {{continuous}} state of change. Some changes occur over very {{short periods of time}} on the order of hours and minutes. Other changes mark long-term trends in the biological and physical condition of a lake. Among the long-term trends in many lakes are a decrease in depth and an increasing productivity in a process called eutrophication. Typically, eutrophication occurs over a time scale of centuries. However, man-made changes to the watershed of a lake may result in a rapid acceleration of eutrophication such that significant changes in the water quality of the lake are noticed in a time span of a few years. Anthropogenic acceleration of eutrophication, known as <b>cultural</b> <b>eutrophication,</b> is due to agricultural, urban, and recreational development in the watershed of a lake which causes an increase in the nutrient loading to a lake.

40|$|Chesapeake Bay {{has been}} the subject of {{intensive}} research on <b>cultural</b> <b>eutrophication</b> and extensive efforts to reduce nutrient inputs. In 1987 a commitment was made to reduce controllable sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) by 40 % by the year 2000, although the causes and effects of eutrophication were incompletely known. Subsequent research, modeling, and monitoring have shown that: (i) the estuarine ecosystem had been substantially altered by increased loadings of N and P of approximately 7 - and 18 -fold, respectively; (ii) hypoxia substantially increased since the 1950 s; (iii) eutrophication was the major cause of reductions in submerged vegetation; and (iv) reducing nutrient sources by 40 % would improve water quality, but less than originally thought. Strong public support and political commitment have allowed the Chesapeake Bay Program to reduce nutrient inputs, particularly from point sources, by 58 % for P and 28...|$|E
