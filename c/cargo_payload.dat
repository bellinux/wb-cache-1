25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the TBM seats {{a pair of}} flying crew. According to Flying Magazine, even in the {{standard}} configuration, the cockpit is provided with a generous suite of avionics and equipment.

Pilots can enter the cockpit either from the main cabin or via a small pilot's door on the left hand side, forward of the wing; in a cargo configuration, the pilot's door eliminates the need to clamber over the <b>cargo</b> <b>payload.</b> The pilot's door is an optional extra, and is not installed upon all aircraft. From the TBM 700B onwards, an enlarged cabin entry door was introduced, which later became standard upon subsequent models.|$|E
2500|$|A {{design study}} {{utilizing}} Constellation launch vehicles, known as Design Reference Architecture 5.0, {{was completed in}} 2009. In DRA 5.0, a Mars mission would have involved multiple launches of an Ares V rocket, {{as well as an}} Ares I to launch the crew. In the first Mars launch window, two cargo payloads would be launched into Earth orbit, as well as a nuclear thermal rocket stage for each payload, in order to boost them to Mars. Alternatively, chemical (specifically liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen) propellant stages could have been used, although this would have required more launches. One <b>cargo</b> <b>payload</b> would include a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), as well as In-situ resource utilization equipment to generate propellant for the MAV. The second <b>cargo</b> <b>payload</b> would be a habitat that the astronauts would live in during the stay on the surface. In the next launch window, 26 months after the first, the crew would go to Mars in an interplanetary transfer vehicle with nuclear thermal rocket and propellant modules assembled in Earth orbit. Once at Mars, the crew would rendezvous with the Mars habitat in orbit, land on Mars, and explore for 500 days. The crew would use the MAV to return to their interplanetary vehicle in Mars orbit, which would then be used to return to Earth. The mission would conclude with the re-entry and landing of the Orion capsule.|$|E

50|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} generation, the TownAce was sold by Daihatsu as the B20 series Daihatsu Delta Wide van/wagon between November 1982 and January 1992.

50|$|As intended, the Hermes was a {{reusable}} launch {{system that}} would have been used to transport both astronauts and moderate-size <b>cargo</b> <b>payloads</b> into low Earth orbit (LEO) and back again. In basic concept and operation, the Hermes bears a resemblance to other reusable space vehicles, such as the American Space Shuttle. However, unlike the Space Shuttle, Hermes had no ambition to carry heavy cargoes as this role was to be performed by the unmanned and automated Ariane 5 launcher instead. In the configuration envisioned prior to the project's termination, Hermes was to have been capable of transporting a maximum of three astronauts along with a 3,000 kg pressurized payload. The final launch weight would be 21,000 kg, which was viewed as being the practical upper limit of what an extended Ariane 5 launcher would be capable of lifting.|$|R

50|$|For the International Space Station, {{there have}} been periods of time when downmass {{capability}} was severely restricted.

The Soyuz cargo downmass capability was limited as the entire space capsule was filled to capacity with the three ISS crew members who return on each Soyuz return.
