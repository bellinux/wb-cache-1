25|$|Railway {{operations}} are vulnerable during high winds {{and there have}} been several de-wirements over the years due to the unusually wide spacing (up to 75 m) between the supporting masts of the overhead lines. The other cost-reduction measure was the use of headspan <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> systems over the quadruple track sections – as employed in the Weaver Junction to Glasgow Electrification on the WCML during the 1970s. Headspans do not have mechanically independent registration (MIR) of each electrified road and thus are more complex to set up, compared to TTC (two-track cantilever) and portal style support structures, during installation. In the event of a de-wirement of a given road, headspans result in the need to correctly set up the OLE of adjacent roads before the line can reopen to electric traction. This was a result of extreme pressure from the Department for Transport to reduce avoidable costs when the line was originally electrified between 1985 and 1990.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} plans {{called for}} electrification {{of the line}} from Gdańsk to Pruszcz Gdański, but this plan was abandoned in the 1950s when it was realized that it would require moving some <b>catenary</b> <b>supports</b> which had been placed {{too close to the}} track. These <b>catenary</b> <b>supports</b> had been part of a railway line in Sudetenland electrified by the German Railways, then confiscated by the Soviet Red Army and brought to Poland. This former German equipment was subsequently moved to the Gdańsk - Nowy Port line and to the vicinity of Gdynia Postojowa where it remains in use today. Later plans in the 1960s for building new tracks to Pruszcz Gdański would have required demolition of the historic Gdańsk Główny railway station and replacing it with a postmodern concrete-block structure. This plan was not carried out.|$|R
50|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad <b>catenary</b> <b>supports</b> remain, {{operated}} by Amtrak under easement, to supply electricity from Safe Harbor Dam to the Parkesburg traction substation. Ironically, {{while they were}} one of the last parts of the line to be installed (c. 1938), they are the only remaining structure supporting railroad operations. The original transmission lines were replaced by Amtrak in 2011. See Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system#Conestoga to Atglen transmission line.|$|R

The <b>catenary</b> (<b>supporting)</b> wire is made of bronze, with a circular cross-section of 65 mm2. The contact wire is made of copper, and has a cross-section of 150 mm2. The cross-section of the contact wire is circular with a flat section on the contact side.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrangement}} of <b>catenary</b> <b>supports</b> and transmission wires gives the overhead structure along former Pennsylvania Railroad lines its characteristic 80 ft-tall 'H'-shaped structure. They are much {{taller than the}} overhead electrification structures on other electrified American railroads due to the 138 kV transmission lines. Catenary towers and transmission lines along former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad lines and Amtrak's New England division are much shorter, and are recognizable due to different design and construction.|$|R
25|$|Plans for {{restoring}} the old line north into Westchester County failed. For a few years, the line retained the 11,000 Volt catenary on the express tracks in case service to Westchester was resumed. After the Dyre Avenue line was opened, using the outer tracks, tracks Y1 and Y2, {{and once it}} was certain that service to Westchester would not be revived the superfluous trackage from NYW days was removed, along with the <b>catenary</b> <b>supports,</b> for the World War II scrap drive of 1943.|$|R
50|$|The Federal Reserve moved {{two blocks}} away on Marquette Avenue to a {{building}} now known as Marquette Plaza, which is constructed much like a suspension bridge with cables strung between pillars at the ends carrying the load. It is noted as the first (and perhaps only) building ever made to use <b>catenary</b> <b>support.</b> Design problems, along with asbestos contamination, led the Federal Reserve to decide {{to move into a}} new complex and sell the old structure. The new owner rehabilitated the building and added on, and the building temporarily housed the central Minneapolis Public Library while its new building was under construction. The building was designed to accommodate another cable to complete the circle, which was never built.|$|E
50|$|The Reading {{electrification}} system {{was designed for}} suburban MU operations {{and did not have}} to support the main line passenger or through freight operations of the rival Pennsylvania Railroad. While a complex system of high-voltage transmission lines was not necessary, the system was large enough to require the use of distribution feeders from the 25 Hz power supply at Wayne Junction. The feeders were set at 24 kV, double the traction voltage. Most of the rail lines would carry one or two feeders attached {{to the top of the}} <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> masts. These 24 kV substation feeders can be distinguished from 12 kV traction feeders by the use of four-segment insulators as opposed to three-segment ones.|$|E
50|$|On September 29, 2012 (Saturday), IC 2312 {{departed}} from track 10 (yes, same as above). It consisted of one leading control car, seven more passenger cars, one dining car, two other passenger cars and a trailing DB Class 101 engine. The speed limit of 40 km/h (on signal Hp 2) was fully utilized. The engine {{and the three}} adjacent cars derailed.The train took down two <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> masts, thus tearing down part of the catenary, which had then to be switched off. The tracks also had to be closed for the rescue to begin, and both actions separated the entire station from the network for hours. Several tracks were reopened on the same day, allowing to return to service, but many long distance trains had to bypass the station on this day. Eight persons received minor injuries. The damage was determined as €6,482,000.|$|E
5000|$|On the Pennsylvania Railroad, phase breaks were {{indicated}} by a position light signal face with all eight radial positions with lenses and no center light. When the phase break was active (the catenary sections out of phase), all lights were lit.

Metal signs were hung from the <b>catenary</b> <b>supports</b> with the letters [...] "PB" [...] created by a pattern of drilled holes.|$|R
50|$|The commune of Modane {{is home to}} an {{international}} railway station, the Gare de Modane, in which receives trains from Turin in Italy, through the Fréjus Rail Tunnel, and with trains to Chambéry, {{as well as the}} TGV on the Milan (Italy) to Paris route. The whole of the French part of the line is owned by the Réseau Ferré de France (RFF), the upstream network is managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, society of FS (Ferrovie dello Stato), the lower part and the station being under the management of the SNCF. There is therefore an electrical disconnection and signaling changes upstream (<b>catenary</b> <b>supports</b> also bear inscriptions in Italian).|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} {{issue with}} AT equipment is that, if balance weights {{are attached to}} both ends, the whole tension length will be free to move along track. To avoid this a midpoint anchor (MPA), close to {{the centre of the}} tension length, restricts movement of the messenger/catenary wire by anchoring it; the contact wire and its suspension hangers can move only within the constraints of the MPA. MPAs are sometimes fixed to low bridges, otherwise anchored to vertical catenary poles or portal <b>catenary</b> <b>supports.</b> A tension length {{can be seen as a}} fixed centre point, with the two half tension lengths expanding and contracting with temperature.|$|R

50|$|Two factory {{train for}} {{renewing}} overhead line equipment on the West Coast Mainline was ordered in 1999, and delivered in 2000. Each train-consist {{was made up}} of five separable autonomous units (four of which were single-ended MPVs); the entire train is fitted for multiple working allowing self powered transportation to a work site. In operation the train-consist splits into five sub-trains: the first unit is used to dismantle and recover previously installed wire; the second unit replaces <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> wires ("droppers"), the third and fourth units install new wire and droppers, and the fifth unit is used for quality control - measuring and recording the new installation. To allow slow speed control the MPVs were fitted with hydrostatic drives. A Windhoff MPV was also used as the basis of a piling train - used to install catenary masts. The piling train including MPV mounted piling hammers (Fambo AB), and installation cranes (Hap, Palfinger).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many {{problems}} require making sequential decisions. For these problems, {{the benefit}} of acquiring further information must be weighed against the costs. In this paper, we describe the <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> vector machine (catSVM), a margin-based method to solve sequential stopping problems. We provide theoretical guarantees for catSVM on future testing examples. We evaluated the performance of catSVM on UCI benchmark data and also applied it {{to the task of}} face detection. The experimental results show that catSVM can achieve a better cost tradeoff than single-stage SVM and chained boosting. ...|$|E
5000|$|A special {{category}} of phase break {{was developed in}} American practice, primarily by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Since its traction power network was centrally supplied and only segmented by abnormal conditions, normal phase breaks were generally not active. Phase breaks that were always activated were known as [...] "Dead Sections": they were often used to separate power systems (for example, the Hell's Gate Bridge boundary between Amtrak and Metro North's electrifications) that would never be in-phase. Since a dead section is always dead, no special signal aspect was developed to warn drivers of its presence, and a metal sign with [...] "DS" [...] in drilled-hole letters was hung from the <b>catenary</b> <b>supports.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Construction {{work for}} the {{electric}} catenary started in the early 1960s. The construction of the facilities between Freiberg and Werdau was relatively unproblematic. However, the electrification between Dresden and Freiberg, especially around Edle Krone, was more difficult because restricted clearances hindered {{the construction of the}} catenary. The most important building project in this section was the widening of the Edle Krone tunnel, since the lowering of the tracks was impossible because of bridges connecting directly to the tunnel. Many catenary masts had to be constructed as special constructions with <b>catenary</b> <b>supports</b> over both tracks. The overhead was opened between 1963 and 1966 in sections starting from Werdau: ...|$|R
50|$|The Ivy City project {{resulted}} in the installation of two 4.5 MVA transformers in a 138/12 kV substation on the northeast edge of the Ivy City yard complex and 5.2 mi of 138 kV transmission line to augment the overstretched facilities at Landover. Since the original <b>catenary</b> <b>supports</b> along this section of track were only high enough for the 12 kV catenary wire, the 138 kV lines were installed on new steel monopod poles installed along the right-of-way. Except {{for the fact that}} the new poles only carry four conductors rather than the typical six for a utility line, the new line appears as a typical medium voltage power line rather than the typical PRR style H-shaped structure.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally {{materials}} used for <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> structures are steel, concrete or even wood, {{in combination with}} the use of insulators. The development of new materials such as Fibre Reinforced Plastics (FRP) makes a new revolutionary design possible. The use of FRP is expanding rapidly at the moment, being applied already in bridges, lock-doors and the design of High-Voltage towers [1]. A benefit of FRP from a mechanical point of view is that, due to the reduced Young modulus, the design is mainly determined by the stiffness of the construction, therefore the resulting strength of the structure is very high. The insulating properties of the material make it possible to omit the use of insulators. This leads to the following benefits in catenary design: - Environmental friendly as no zinc or paint is required for conservation; - FRP is easy to be recycled; - Cost reduction as no insulators are required; - Reduced height of civil structures as no space is required for insulators; - Reduced maintenance costs, since FRP does not corrode; - Reduced weight of <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> structure simplifying foundation design; - For d. c. systems no voltage limiting devices are needed, therefore reducing stray currents and reducing impact of the railway on other structures such as pipelines (provided that the construction meets the requirements for reinforced insulation in accordance with [5]; - Number of construction parts is reduced, leading to easier and faster construction. As the mechanical properties of FRP are well known at present, the main interest concerns the electrical properties, especially in relation to ageing and pollution. Therefore, conductivity measurements have been performed on a FRP beam which has been in use in the railway environment for 20 years. Also measurements have been conducted on a reference sample in a High- Voltage laboratory. Three situations have been studied: - Original state; - Cleaned; - After salt-spray test. Based on the measurements it can be concluded that the conductivity, even after being in use for 20 years, is sufficient for the intended use. Conductivity can be attributed mainly {{to the surface of the}} material, and is probably due to the deposition of carbon and metal particles from pantograph, catenary and moisture. It can be concluded that the use of FRP in <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> structures, without insulators is a promising new technology, with benefits for both costs as well as the environment...|$|E
40|$|This book {{describes}} the wave characteristics of contact lines taking wind into consideration and discusses new methods for detecting catenary geometry, pantograph slide fault, and <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> system faults. It also introduces wire-irregularity detection methods for catenary estimation, and discusses modern spectrum estimation tools for catenary.

40|$|Overhead rail current {{collector}} systems for railway traction offer certain features, such as low installation height and reduced maintenance, which make them predominantly {{suitable for use}} in underground train infrastructures. Due to the increased demands of modern catenary systems and higher running speeds of new vehicles, a more capable design of the conductor rail is needed. A new overhead conductor rail has been developed and its design has been patented [13]. Modern simulation and modelling techniques {{were used in the}} development approach. The new conductor rail profile has a dynamic behaviour superior to that of the system currently in use. Its innovative design permits either an increase of <b>catenary</b> <b>support</b> spacing or a higher vehicle running speed. Both options ensure savings in installation or operating costs. The simulation model used to optimise the existing conductor rail profile included both a finite element model of the catenary and a three-dimensional multi-body system model of the pantograph. The contact force that appears between pantograph and catenary was obtained in simulation. A sensitivity analysis of the key parameters that influence in catenary dynamics was carried out, finally leading to the improved design...|$|E

40|$|Overhead rigid {{conductor}} {{arrangements for}} current collection for railway traction have some advantages compared to other, more conventional, energy supply systems.

In this paper, the authors present a dynamic analysis of overhead conductor rail systems focused on the design of a new conductor profile with a dynamic behaviour superior to that of the system currently in use. This means that either an increase in running speed can be attained, which at present does not exceed 110 km/h, or an increase in the distance between the rigid <b>catenary</b> <b>supports</b> with the ensuing saving in installation costs.

Each mooring line consists of two or more segments with a buoy attached to each connection point. The first segment is anchored to the sea bed, and part of it, of variable length, is in contact with the sea bed modeling touchdown effects. The ensuing system results in a model for mooring in deep and waters. The {{mathematical model}} consists of three equations of motion in the horizontal plane - surge, sway, and yaw - for the slow motion dynamics of the vessel, and three equations of motion in surge, sway and heave for each of the buoys in the system.

50|$|A {{stressed}} {{ribbon bridge}} (also stress-ribbon bridge or catenary bridge) is a tension structure (similar {{in many ways}} to a simple suspension bridge). The suspension cables are embedded in the deck which follows a <b>catenary</b> arc between <b>supports.</b> Unlike the simple span, the ribbon is stressed in traction, which adds to the stiffness of the structure (simple suspension spans tend to sway and bounce). The supports in turn support upward thrusting arcs that allow the grade to be changed between spans (where multiple spans are used). Such bridges are typically made from concrete reinforced by steel tensioning cables. Where such bridges carry vehicle traffic {{a certain degree of}} stiffness is required to prevent excessive flexure of the structure, obtained by stressing the concrete in compression.|$|R
