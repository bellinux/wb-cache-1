5|$|Relationships among lemur {{families}} have also {{proven to be}} problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.|$|E
5|$|The Burial Council's core <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> the city's {{decision}} {{to conduct an}} archaeological survey of the rail line's route in phases, meaning construction on {{a majority of the}} line will be complete by the time the survey in the Kakaako area is performed, which in turn increases the likelihood that any remains discovered will be moved instead of being allowed to remain in situ. In response to the Burial Council's concerns, the city agreed to begin conducting an archaeological survey of the area in 2010, two years earlier than originally planned. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources later signed the city's programmatic agreement on January 15, 2011, over the continuing concerns of the Burial Council.|$|E
25|$|Deirdre McCloskey {{has argued}} that many {{empirical}} economic studies are poorly reported, and she and Stephen Ziliak argue that although her critique has been well-received, practice has not improved. This latter <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> controversial.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>contentions</b> <b>were</b> raised.|$|R
50|$|A {{point of}} <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> the venue for the finals matches.|$|R
60|$|The judges {{decided that}} his <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> just {{and must be}} allowed.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Contention</b> <b>is</b> both a {{reported}} text {{and an early}} draft of 2 Henry VI. This theory has been gaining increasing support from {{the latter half of}} the 20th Century, and is championed by many modern editors of the play.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Contention</b> <b>is</b> {{an early}} {{draft of the}} play that was {{published}} in the 1623 Folio under the title The second Part of Henry the Sixt. Originated by Edmond Malone in 1790 as an alternate to Johnson's memorial report theory. Supported today by critics such as Steven Urkowitz.|$|E
25|$|Sina’s <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> that Islam {{promotes}} {{hate and}} disunity, and thus poses {{an impediment to}} peace. According to his website, he has issued a challenge that should anyone prove him wrong he will publicly acknowledge his error and withdraw his charges against Islam, and will pay $50,000 to that person.|$|E
60|$|To Minikin it {{appeared}} that if such <b>contention</b> <b>were</b> allowed girls might as well shut up shop.|$|R
50|$|The second <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> {{whether the}} President has {{unfettered}} powers to issue Proclamation under Article 356(1) of the Constitution.|$|R
50|$|Another {{source of}} <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> John's {{position}} as surveyor for Topsfield. Border disputes between Salem and Topsfield {{came out in}} Topsfield's favor.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Contention</b> <b>is</b> a reconstructed {{version of}} a {{performance}} of what we today call 2 Henry VI; i.e. a bad quarto, an attempt by actors to reconstruct the original play from memory and sell it. Originated by Samuel Johnson in 1765 and refined by Peter Alexander in 1929. Traditionally, {{this is the most}} accepted theory.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue of}} <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> {{the status of}} the Russian {{language}}. Russian today is defined as a foreign language by the Law on State Language. Ethnic Russians and other Russian speakers have protested against plans to require 60% of secondary school subjects to be taught in the Latvian language. Some representatives of the Russian-speaking community in Latvia claim discrimination by the country's authorities with these calls frequently supported by Russia.|$|E
25|$|Most Islamic traditions, {{save for}} a few, categorically deny that Jesus {{physically}} died, either on a cross or another manner. The <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died, {{while the majority of}} subsequent Hadith and Tafsir have elaborated an argument in favor of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view.|$|E
50|$|While the Soviets {{were out}} of medal <b>contention,</b> Canada <b>was</b> playing for the gold medal, and were leading 4-2 {{at the time of}} the brawl. The gold medal {{ultimately}} went to Finland, hosts Czechoslovakia took the silver and Sweden, who had previously been eliminated from medal <b>contention,</b> <b>was</b> awarded the bronze.|$|R
50|$|Mario Andretti {{continued}} to dominate, with Danny Sullivan now in second. Also, high in <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> Emerson Fittipaldi, Al Unser, Jr. and Al Unser, Sr.|$|R
6000|$|Silence reigned for a moment; then, as if {{the bone}} of <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> {{forgotten}} in the pleasant recollections called up by familiar objects, Nan said suddenly: ...|$|R
25|$|One {{main point}} of <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> whether the {{translation}} should follow the literal {{meaning of the}} title or to describe the roles of that title's holder. As the Chinese bureaucracy developed, the responsibilities of an office changed {{and the names of}} positions changed, not necessarily at the same time. An office from the Zhou dynasty might share the same title as an office from the Qing dynasty, but with completely different powers, scope, and responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{critical}} opinion {{has tended}} to favour the first theory; that The <b>Contention</b> <b>is</b> a bad quarto, a memorial reconstruction, perhaps by the actor who had played Suffolk and/or Cade in early performance. Samuel Johnson put forth this theory in 1765, but was challenged by Edmond Malone in 1790, who suggested that The Contention could be an early draft of 2 Henry VI. Malone's view was the dominant one until 1929, when Peter Alexander and Madeleine Doran, working independently of one another, re-established {{the dominance of the}} bad quarto theory.|$|E
60|$|The {{paper was}} in the fire by the time Demi arrived and he at once calmed down, seeing that the bone of <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> out of the way.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, another {{dispute between}} WICB and West Indian Players Association (WIPA) {{led to the}} team's Indian tour being curtailed. The bone of <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> a {{protracted}} payment structure.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Republicans in Congress demanded deficit {{reduction}} {{as part of}} raising the debt ceiling. The resulting <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> resolved on 2 August 2011 by the Budget Control Act of 2011.|$|R
25|$|Aubrey Diller {{has shown}} that the clima {{calculations}} which Strabo preserved from Hipparchus were performed by spherical trigonometry with the sole accurate obliquity known to have been used by ancient astronomers, 23°40'. All thirteen clima figures agree with Diller's proposal. Further confirming his <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> the finding that the big errors in Hipparchus's longitude of Regulus and both longitudes of Spica agree to a few minutes in all three instances with a theory that he took the wrong sign for his correction for parallax when using eclipses for determining stars' positions.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clearly}} stated in {{proceedings}} from the Australian Senate and policy {{statements from the}} government that the Australian emission reductions include land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) with the form of inclusion remaining undecided and whilst acknowledging that {{they are subject to}} the forming of accounting guidelines from this Copenhagen conference. In <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> the Australian Government's preference for the removal of non-human induced LULUCF emissions – and perhaps their abatement – from the account, such as from lightning induced bushfires and the subsequent natural carbon sequestering regrowth.|$|E
25|$|The {{next issue}} of <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> the Sacred Games for Princess Lymsleia's hand in marriage, being held {{somewhat}} {{early for the}} ten-year-old Lymsleia. The two main contestants, both representing themselves with a champion, hail from rival noble houses: The foppish Euram Barows, and Sialeeds' former fiance, the charismatic Gizel Godwin. The royal family, however, favors the mysterious outsider Belcoot, as a neutral option less likely to cause strife; the Prince attempts to aid Belcoot quietly with Ferid's approval. However, Gizel successfully rigs the Games to his advantage, and his champion Childerich defeats a drugged Belcoot while the Barow's champion is disqualified.|$|E
50|$|Ekland's {{relationship}} with Rod Stewart lasted {{for over two}} years during which time a continual <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> Stewart's Scrooge like attitude towards money. Ekland is scathing of this aspect of Stewart's character.|$|R
60|$|Rollo and Lucy {{would both}} have been ashamed of their <b>contention,</b> <b>were</b> it not that the pear looked so very rich and tempting, that they were both very eager to have it.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} that if the <b>contention</b> <b>were</b> a good one, it was not {{desirable}} to have an expensive and time-consuming trial just to have it acquitted on technical grounds at the end.|$|R
25|$|Another {{source of}} <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> that the Brown crime scene {{fingerprint}} has {{the appearance of}} having been rolled, which is the practice of taking a person's inked finger and rolling it on an index card, and not the smudged, bloody and unreadable print as originally reported. Traditionally, after the fingertip is covered in ink from either the suspect's hand being pressed {{on top of an}} ink pad or an ink roller being run across it, the finger is placed on the card on one edge. It is rolled once from one edge to the finger's other edge to produce a large, clear print.|$|E
25|$|The William J. Benson <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> {{essentially}} {{that the}} legislatures of various states passed ratifying resolutions {{in which the}} quoted text of the Amendment differed from the text proposed by Congress in terms of capitalization, spelling of words, or punctuation marks (e.g. semi-colons instead of commas), and that these differences made the ratification invalid. Benson makes other assertions including claims that one or more states rejected the Amendment and that the state or states were falsely reported as having ratified the Amendment. As explained below, the Benson arguments have been rejected in every court case {{where they have been}} raised, and were explicitly ruled to be fraudulent in 2007.|$|E
25|$|After Walters's innings I {{wrote that}} with one {{necessary}} qualification I {{thought he would}} be come to be rated as the best bat produced by Australia since Neil Harvey proclaimed himself with his famous hundred at Headingley in 48. The reservation concerned his ability against really fast bowling, as to which I had no evidence...Only Lawry and Simpson have made more runs and had records to compare if one is to make a quantitative judgement. Any all events my <b>contention</b> <b>is</b> at least arguable. Doug has made eleven hundreds for Australia, some of extreme brilliance, and if he ever played a dull innings I never saw it.|$|E
5000|$|Naturally, {{there was}} a cost for such a ship. Part of Cuniberti's <b>contention</b> <b>was</b> that this colossus was {{available}} only to a [...] "navy {{at the same time}} most potent and very rich".|$|R
25|$|The {{composer}} Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart died on 5 December 1791 {{at the age}} of 35. The {{circumstances of}} his death have attracted much research and speculation. Some principal sources of <b>contention</b> <b>are</b> as follows.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 32 seats were contested. Also up for <b>contention,</b> <b>was</b> the new office of Mayor of Singapore, {{which would be}} awarded to {{the leader of the}} {{political}} party with the majority of seats won.|$|R
