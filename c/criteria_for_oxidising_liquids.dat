40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{an original}} numerical coupling between surface mechanics of a gradually oxidizing liquid metal surface, and a supporting annular MHD flow, {{in the general}} layout of the classical annular viscometer, originally developed by Mannheimer et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 32 (1970) 195 - 211]. A purely hydrodynamic interplay between a main azimuthal flow (induced by a rotating floor) and a secondary overturning flow generated by centrifugation {{is found to be}} strongly affected by both surface viscous shear and surface viscous dilatation. When centrifugation competes with electromagnetic effects, advection of the main flow by the secondary flow is proved to affect significantly the core MHD flow, leading to original MHD flow patterns. The latter phenomenology reveals to be relevant to characterise the surface viscosities of a gradually <b>oxidising</b> <b>liquid</b> metal surface...|$|R

An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst <b>for</b> <b>oxidising</b> ammonia to nitrogen oxides, but this {{has been replaced by}} an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.|$|R
40|$|A few {{aspects of}} the EMEP Unified (Eulerian) model have been {{evaluated}} by analysing the deposition parameterisation for acidifying compounds and the concentration and deposition of SOx, NOx, and NHx in the Netherlands. Evaluation was also carried out by analysing the source-receptor matrices for the Netherlands and the geographical distribution of the emissions, comparing results with both the OPS model and measurements. The picture given of the Netherlands by the EMEP Unified model was found for most acidifying compounds to be a fair one. The source-receptor matrices calculated by the EMEP and OPS models were seen {{to be in good}} agreement <b>for</b> <b>oxidised</b> sulphur, and in reasonable agreement for reduced nitrogen. Large discrepancies between the models were found <b>for</b> <b>oxidised</b> nitrogen. The contribution of the Dutch emissions to local deposition in the Netherlands came to a factor of 4 higher in the OPS model, compared to the EMEP model. The contributions of Belgium and Germany to deposition are also much higher in the OPS model. These differences {{can be traced back to}} the lower concentration and dry deposition, along with higher wet deposition, of NOx in the EMEP model. <b>For</b> <b>oxidised</b> nitrogen, there was a large difference in the influence of the boundary and initial conditions on the source-receptor matrix. The EMEP model suggests that almost 30 % of the deposition is due to sources outside Europe. The SO 2 concentrations in the Netherlands calculated with the EMEP model are close to the measurements, while the NOx concentrations are about 40 % lower and the NH 3 concentrations 30 % to 40 % lower than the measurements...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors' {{goal was}} to {{validate}} the clinical <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia of the State of California Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC), the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN), DSM-IV, and ICD- 10. METHOD: Sensitivity and specificity were assessed by comparing the clinical with the neuropathological diagnosis of 89 autopsied patients with dementia from a geriatric and psychiatric hospital. All cases were reviewed by a clinician and a neuropathologist who were blind to each other's findings. RESULTS: Neuropathologically there were 20 cases of vascular dementia, 23 cases of mixed dementia, and 46 cases of Alzheimer's disease among the autopsied patients. The sensitivity was 0. 50 <b>for</b> DSM-IV <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia, 0. 70 <b>for</b> ADDTC <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia, 0. 55 <b>for</b> NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia, 0. 20 <b>for</b> ICD- 10 <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia, 0. 25 <b>for</b> ADDTC <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia, and 0. 20 <b>for</b> NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia. Specificity was 0. 84, 0. 78, 0. 84, 0. 94, 0. 91, and 0. 93, respectively. The proportion of cases clinically classified as vascular dementia ranged from 0 % to 13 % for neuropathologically confirmed cases of Alzheimer's disease and 9 % to 39 % for neuropathologically confirmed cases of mixed dementia. There was no statistically significant relationship between the neuropathological diagnosis {{and three of the}} clinical criteria sets studied (ICD- 10 <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia and ADDTC and NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia are not interchangeable. The ADDTC <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia are the most sensitive for the detection of vascular dementia; however, the DSM-IV <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia and the NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia may be more effective in excluding mixed dementia. Given their inability to detect the vast majority of cases of vascular dementia, the ICD- 10 <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia and the ADDTC and NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia should be revised...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently, the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) {{published}} {{an adaptation of}} the previous United Kingdom Brain Bank Society (UKBBS) <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). OBJECTIVES: This article presents {{the changes in the}} current clinical diagnostic <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> IPD. Furthermore, the new MDS <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> prodromal iPD are discussed. RESULTS: The recently introduced MDS <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> the clinical diagnosis of iPD include useful novel features (e. g. postural instability is no longer listed as a cardinal symptom, familiar history of iPD and intake of neuroleptics at the first visit no longer lead to exclusion of the diagnosis) and red flags do not lead to exclusion of the diagnosis; however, they must be counterbalanced by the presence of supportive <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> iPD. The <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> identification of persons in the prodromal stage are currently established only for scientific investigations. CONCLUSION: The new MDS <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> the diagnostics of iPD should help to improve the sensitivity and specificity...|$|R
