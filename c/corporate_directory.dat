Using signaling theory as a conceptual framework, we describe how certain ‘signals ’ in various social software are hard to fake, and are thus more reliable indicators of expertise. Multi-level regression analysis revealed that participation in social software, social connection information, and selfdescribed expertise in the <b>corporate</b> <b>directory</b> were significantly helpful in the decision to contact someone for expertise. Qualitative analysis provided further insights regarding the interpretations people form of others’ expertise from digital artifacts. We conclude with suggestions on differentiating various types of information available within online profiles and implications for the design of expertise locator/recommender systems.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{dependence on}} information technology (lT) and rise of security threats in organizations {{have led to}} the growing awareness of the need for adopting formal lT governance practices. However, how organizations perceive lT governance importance and how successful they are in implementing these practices remain unknown at least in the local Malaysian context. Thus, this research seeks to investigate the perception of lT governance importance and the effective implementation in Malaysian private organizations. The unit of analysis of the research is organization. The study was conducted using a cross-sectional survey research targeting highest ranking lT personnel, from various industries as research participants and as the key informant. Mail survey strategy was adopted in this research. The population comprises Malaysian private organizations drawn from four major Malaysian <b>corporate</b> <b>directories.</b> The results from descriptive analysis yield interesting findings. The average level of observed importance and effectiveness of lT governance is 5. 28 and 4. 91 respectively. Though Malaysian private organizations perceive lT governance as important but implementation of effective lT governance is below the effective level. The paper has also presented the gap for effectiveness and importance which suggests that there is room for improvement that practitioners can identify from the elements of lT governance. The findings from this study provide an insight for practitioners at both top and middle level management, particularly, those who are leading the lT function, a better understanding of lT governance importance and effectiveness. Moreover, practitioners may consider adopting appropriate actions to foster an environment that promotes lT governance effectiveness...|$|R

Simply searching the Web for pages with addresses [...] - [...] such as <b>corporate</b> staff <b>directories</b> or membership lists of professional societies [...] - [...] using spambots can yield thousands of addresses, most of them deliverable. Spammers have also subscribed to discussion mailing lists for the purpose of gathering the addresses of posters. The DNS and WHOIS systems require the publication of technical contact information for all Internet domains; spammers have illegally trawled these resources for email addresses. Spammers have also concluded that generally, for the domain names of businesses, all of the email addresses will follow the same basic pattern and thus are able to accurately guess the email addresses of employees whose addresses they have not harvested. Many spammers use programs called web spiders to find email addresses on web pages. Usenet article message-IDs often look enough like email addresses that they are harvested as well. Spammers have also harvested email addresses directly from Google search results, without actually spidering the websites found in the search.|$|R
40|$|Web Services for Remote Portals (WSRP) are visual, user-facing web {{services}} centric components that plug-n-play with portals or other intermediary web applications that aggregate content or applications from different sources. They {{are designed to}} enable businesses to provide content or applications {{in a form that}} does not require any manual content- or application-specific adaptation by consuming intermediary applications. As Web Services for Remote Portals include presentation, service providers determine how their content and applications are visualized for end-users and to which degree adaptation, transcoding, translation etc may be allowed. WSRP services can be published into public or <b>corporate</b> service <b>directories</b> (UDDI) where they can easily be found by intermediary applications that want to display their content. Web application deployment vendors can wrap and adapt their middleware for use in WSRP-compliant services. Vendors of intermediary applicatios can enable their products for consuming Web Services for Remote Portals. Using WSRP, portals can easily integrate content and applications from many internal and external content providers. The portal administrator simply picks the desired services from a list and integrates them, no programmers are required to tie new content and applications into the portal.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} {{identify}} novel chemical classes of β-secretase (BACE- 1) inhibitors, an alternative scoring protocol, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), was proposed to summarize {{most of the information}} from the original scoring functions and re-rank the results from the virtual screening against BACE- 1. METHOD: Given a training set (50 BACE- 1 inhibitors and 9950 inactive diverse compounds), three rank-based virtual screening methods, individual scoring, conventional consensus scoring and PCA, were judged by the hit number in the top 1 % of the ranked list. The docking poses were generated by Surflex, five scoring functions (Surflex_Score, D_Score, G_Score, ChemScore, and PMF_Score) were used for pose extraction. For each pose group, twelve scoring functions (Surflex_Score, D_Score, G_Score, ChemScore, PMF_Score, LigScore 1, LigScore 2, PLP 1, PLP 2, jain, Ludi_ 1, and Ludi_ 2) were used for the pose rank. For a test set, 113, 228 chemical compounds (Sigma-Aldrich® <b>corporate</b> chemical <b>directory)</b> were docked by Surflex, then ranked by the same three ranking methods motioned above to select the potential active compounds for experimental test. RESULTS: For the training set, the PCA approach yielded consistently superior rankings compared to conventional consensus scoring and single scoring. For the test set, the top 20 compounds according to conventional consensus scoring were experimentally tested, no inhibitor was found. Then, we relied on PCA scoring protocol to test another different top 20 compounds and two low micromolar inhibitors (S 450588 and 276065) were emerged through the BACE- 1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. CONCLUSION: The PCA method extends the conventional consensus scoring in a quantitative statistical manner and would appear to have considerable potential for chemical screening applications...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the use of}} Safety Management Systems {{and procedures}} in high-risk industries is being studied, focusing on the following research questions: 1 : How is Safety Management System defined in the safety literature? 2 : How is Safety Management System used in a petroleum producing company? 3 : How can end user involvement improve the {{development and use of}} procedures and Safety Management System? 4 : What kind of training in the use of procedures and Safety Management System are the workers in two different companies given? How can the training be improved? The empirical data was collected by conducting qualitative in-depth interviews with 27 staff members of two different companies in the Norwegian gas and petroleum producing sector. In this thesis Safety Management Systems are defined as IT-based systems which purpose is to code and share good practices, and to create <b>corporate</b> knowledge <b>directories</b> for the organization. Safety Management Systems and the procedures are here regarded as a form of communication; designed at an executive level in the organization and communicated to the lower levels in the organization`s hierarchy. There is no guarantee that the employees will perceive, understand and interpret the procedures and system as intended by the management. Executives in this study generally regard Safety Management Systems and procedures as important tools for all work, while many of the workers were less enthusiastic. The informants with a good use of the system and the procedures saw them as helpful, {{and as a result of}} industrial experience accumulated over many years. The informants with a poor use of the procedures acknowledged the need for safety measures, but saw their own experience as more important for safety than the Safety Management System. Several of the challenges with using the Safety Management System in the two companies are related to communication and to the organizational context; how the workers relate to computers, information overload, and dealing with highly detailed procedures, the development of informal procedures, the workers ideals of professionalism, and how to ensure a good two-way communication, and staff training...|$|R
50|$|Historically, many {{evolutions}} of {{the world}} wide web have been adopted and used in internal webs. Just like the web evolved from a text-based system to a web of multimedia and online services, intrawebs now include multimedia resources and, for instance, corporate forms moved from online static copies to dynamic front-ends of web applications directly linked to the corporate information system. Even latest web tools meet application scenarios on corporate webs: wikis can be used to edit and maintain <b>corporate</b> documents and <b>directories</b> in a very simple way, blogs can be used for news and technological watch, web services are being used to allow enterprise application integration and workflow management, semantic web frameworks are used for information and data integration and exchanges for instance to materialize corporate memories as corporate semantic webs, etc.Intrawebs are webs dedicated to the community of a corporation. Being on a private network of the company, intrawebs can include a whole family of applications that could not be made available on the public web for confidentiality reasons: corporate applications. The corporation is an existing community that needs to set up and maintain collaboration to attain professional objectives. Web technologies propose shared application supporting communities of practice, of interest, and more generally speaking, knowledge management. They can support collaborations: synchronous communication, expert matching, internal FAQ, collaborative document edition, case-based memories, project management, workflows, etc. Within a company the existence of such community and of its shared professional interests makes the intraweb a selected place to develop and experiment new web-based solutions.Historically {{there has always been a}} synergy between World Wide Web evolutions and intra-webs experiments. Many evolutions of the World Wide Web have been adopted and used in internal webs and, vice versa, many local initiatives on intrawebs turned out to be seeds of new web applications.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a relational database with estimates of annual production capacity for all mill {{locations in the}} United States where paper, paperboard, or market pulp were produced from 1970 to 2000. Data for more than 500 separate mill locations {{are included in the}} database, with annual capacity data for each year from 1970 to 2000 (more than 17, 000 individual data records). Numeric code, company name, city, state, region, and local postal ZIP code are included in the database. Capacity estimates are given for each of 12 principal categories of paper or paperboard commodities as well as different categories of market pulp. Capacity data at each mill location are further differentiated by process type within each category of paper or paperboard; for example, capacity based on recycled fiber is differentiated from capacity based on wood pulp. Estimates of mill capacity by process were derived from industry <b>directories,</b> <b>corporate</b> reports, trade journal articles, and other sources. This report provides documentation of the capacity database and a summary of capacity trends by commodity category, process, and region. The report includes tabulations and charts of annual capacity trends and also maps of capacity by commodity, process, and location for 1970 and 2000. By illustrating shifts in capacity, the report describes some of the more significant changes that have occurred in pulp and paper technology during the past several decades.
