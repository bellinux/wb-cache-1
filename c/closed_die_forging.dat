50|$|The {{most common}} thought of forging {{equipment}} is the hammer and anvil. The principles behind the hammer and anvil are still used today in drop-hammer equipment. The principle behind {{the machine is}} very simple, raise the hammer and then drop it or propel it into the workpiece, which rests on the anvil. The main variations between drop-hammers is {{in the way that}} the hammer is powered; the most common being air and steam hammers. Drop-hammers usually operate in the vertical position. The main reason for this is because excess energy (energy that isn't used to deform the workpiece) that isn't released as heat or sound needs to be transmitted to the foundation. Moreover, a large machine base is needed to absorb the impacts.To overcome some of the shortcomings of the drop-hammer the counterblow machine or impactor is used. In a counterblow machine both the hammer and anvil move and the workpiece is held between them. Here excess energy becomes recoil. This allows for the machine to work horizontally and consist of a smaller base. Other advantages include less noise, heat and vibrations. It also produces a distinctly different flow pattern. Both of these machines can be used for open die or <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging.</b> A forging press, often just called a press, is used for press forging.|$|E

The simulation results have used in the neural network and the genetic algorithm has been employed to optimize the forging force. The neural network was used in three stages for modeling the system. Stage 1 stands for achieving preform shape by open <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> and in stage 2 it has been used to <b>close</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> for attaining the force and in stage 3 for the filling of the die cavity. Geometrical parametric design was used for accelerating the operation. The guideline of simulating operation and optimization has been suggested in a flow chart. An aeronautical forging component has been selected as a case study. Results show a small difference (0. 3 %) between neural network and direct simulation results. A final reduction of forging force 50 % was obtained by optimizing the preform shape. Key words: Optimization • neural network • genetic algorithm • forging • forc...|$|R

40|$|Lifting hooks may be flat-die or <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forged</b> or else made of {{a series}} of shaped plates. After forging and {{machining}} operations, hooks are annealed and cleaned from scale. Lifting hooks in crane handling mechanisms are used safely handle and lift the loads during the lifting operation. Appropriate solution of shape and materials of hooks enables the increase of loading capacity of hoisting machines. The inner diameter of hooks should be sufficient to accommodate two strands of chains or rope which carry the load. More often than not hooks have a trapezoidal section, made wider on the inside. The 3 -D modeling and finite element model of the simple hook is formed by means of computer-aided engineering software and directly analyzed applying finite elements.

40|$|Demand for {{lighter and}} stiffer {{products}} {{has been increasing}} {{in the last few}} years especially in automobile manufacturing. The <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process of Metal Matrix Material (MMC) is presented as possible solution, since it produces parts with good mechanical properties and lighter weight. A computational modeling of <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process using finite element method and optimization techniques makes the design optimization faster and more efficient, decreasing the use of conventional trial and error methods. In this study, the application of commercial finite element software (ANSYS) has been used to model cold <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process. The model has been developed using ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) to simulate a single stage axi-symmetry <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process for H cross sectional shape. The material used is AlMgSi matrix with 15 % SiC particles. Its flow curve and fractural strain are obtained from the literature. ANSYS Optimizer is used to obtain the maximum height in which the material can flow in the rib by changing Design Variables (DV) and State Variables (SV). Normally design variables are geometrical parameters such as, rib height to width ratio, web height to rib height ratio, fillet radii, draft angle and billet radius. State Variables (SV) are some parameters that depend on the design variables such as, the equivalent strain which must be below the fracture strain of the MMC material, and an acceptable contact gap (within the allowable tolerances range). Optimization method called Sub-Problem Approximation Method was used to find out the optimal design set. The technique used in this study can be used for newly developed materials to investigate its forgeability for much complicated shapes in <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process...|$|E
40|$|<b>Closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> is a {{very complex}} process, and {{measurement}} of actual forces for real material is difficult and time consuming. Hence, the modelling technique has taken the advantage of carrying out the experimentation with the proper model material which needs lesser forces and relatively low temperature. The results of experiments on the model material then may be correlated with the actual material by using the theory of similarity. There are several methods available to resolve the complexity involved in the <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process. Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM) are relatively difficult as compared to the slab method. The slab method is very popular and very widely used by the people working on shop floor because it is relatively easy to apply and reasonably accurate for most of the common forging load requirement computations...|$|E

40|$|<b>Closed</b> <b>die</b> hot <b>forging</b> {{process is}} one of the most adopted methods for forming complex shaped parts with {{satisfactory}} geometrical accuracy. Over sixty percent of the forgings are processed through this route. Forged parts, though required in many engineering sectors, play a vital role in the automotive sector. The majority of the crucial load bearing structural components as well as safety critical items are processed via the forging route. This is mainly due to the inherent strength to weight ratio and dimensional accuracy that can be combined into the components. Faster production of complex shapes with least wastage of material are some of the other benefits. The metal flow analysis of the process is complex due to the involvement of a large number of parameters. A number of experimental testings and production-trials are being done in the industry in order to develop a robust manufacturing process. Such practices however involve huge investments in tooling and raw materials, including a great deal of development time and effort. In recent years, finite element method has emerged as a suitable tool for virtual process trials and simulation based design. This would lead to an improvement in overall efficiency of the process at a lower cost. Through the present study, an attempt has been made to gain an insight into the process parameters influencing the <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> hot <b>forging</b> and their interaction. As a sample case, a real life automotive driveline component, a flange yoke, is taken for investigation.

40|$|Abstract. Both open <b>die</b> and <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> powder compact <b>forging</b> can be {{used for}} the {{consolidation}} of Ti and pre-alloyed Ti 6 Al 4 V powders produced by a hydride-dehydride (HDH) process. The approach used is initial cold or warm compaction into cylindrical shapes, or into a specific pre-form shape appropriate for achieving a particular final forged shape. The economic benefit is near net-shape processing with minimum machining required after forging. Manufacturing costs are also minimised by forging a compact, with a sufficiently high enough density, in air, without a protective atmosphere. The challenge, from a manufacturing point of view, is the operation of a manufacturing route which gives rapid and qualified compaction to meet production demands and batch sintering to achieve a high enough density prior to final forging to shape. In addition to this the final product has to have the right level of mechanical properties. This paper reviews some key findings from powder compact production, through to sintering and forging. These will be presented in terms of alpha-beta phase distribution in the microstructure, the degree of porosity, heat treatment and their effects on mechanical properties...|$|R
