40|$|Good {{governance}} {{is an area}} {{of increasing}} concern and interest in both the private and the public and nonprofit sectors. Over the last decade, {{in the wake of a}} series of major corporate scandals of which the likes of Enron and Worldcom are only two of the latest, there has been a growing concern to make board stewardship of public companies more effective. During this period in the UK there have been a string of major reports and reforms aimed at improving the self-regulation of companies by their boards (e. g. Cadbury, 1992; Greenbury, 1995; Hampel, 1998). The most recent (Higgs, 2002) proposes a number of changes to strengthen the role of non-executive directors in the interests of increased effectiveness and accountability. Similar concerns exist about the effectiveness of nonprofit boards. Successive British governments, in their attempts to modernize and improve the provision of services have put public and non-profit organizations under pressure to improve their effectiveness through the imposition of performance measures, quality <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> <b>audits,</b> and through reforms to governance structures. It has become the practice of the government to compose ‘league tables’ of performance and to publicize the performance of all. This has created new kinds of pressures for organizations and their governing bodies – being ‘named and shamed’. Schools for example if deemed to be failing will be put into what is known as ‘special measures’ where the threat of having a ‘superhead’ brought in to sort it out will hang over the governing body for up to two years. Similar procedures have now been introduced for ‘failing hospitals’. At the same time government has increasingly drawn the voluntary sector into the role of providing public services and there are moves towards greater quality checks and performance measurement for their work too. The recent UK central government Strategy Unit report (2002) Private Action, Public Benefit for example proposes more stringent requirements on larger charities (income over £ 1 m) to complete a standard information return that will focus attention on the measurement of impact, achievement, stakeholder involvement, governance and trustee selection and abilities. But at the same time, running alongside this concern for increased effectiveness, is a concern on the part of government for wider public involvement and participation. Recruitment to many public bodies emphasizes the need for these to be representative of the communities or stakeholders they serve and in the voluntary and nonprofit sectors values of service user participation and involvement in governance are strongly held by many organizations. It seems to us that these concerns sit in tension with one another and may lead to particular challenges when problems arise in the organization. For example in one of our cases, a large disability charity, the organizational recovery process was rendered more complex by the concerns of members of the governing body about the impact of the changes on their children or themselves. (XXXXXXXXX 2002). In another case the lack of development of a board, composed of largely of local residents, contributed directly to the difficulties that arose, when an organization’s funding increased suddenly and dramatically in the wake of the urban regeneration agenda of a Regional Development Authority. This paper is one of a series exploring issues of crisis, failure and recovery in public and nonprofit organisations (XXXXX 2002, XXXXXX 2002. XXXXX 2003). However, little is known about the dynamics of non-profit boards during crises, which is the main focus of this paper. We are interested in what happens in boards and other governing bodies when things go wrong. What do boards do that help or hinder organisational recovery? What are the dynamics of the process and what skills and competences do board members need to lead or assist the process of recovery? One issue that is under-researched is whether different types of boards experience different kinds of crises. One factor that differentiates nonprofit governance from corporate governance is the emphasis in many of the former of representativeness and on issues of social inclusion and diversity. How are these issues likely to impact on the way the board members approach their roles? What impact does the agenda of diversity and social inclusion have on board performance when serious problems arise? The paper is theoretical and exploratory in orientation. We will review the literature and use evidence from some pilot research interviews giving accounts of a variety of crises and failures in the public and nonprofit fields to build theory about what may be the challenges in achieving recovery for different types of boards, particularly those with an emphasis on community and service user participation. It aims to develop a theoretical framework for trying to understand how different types of non-profit boards react to crises and to generate a number of research questions to guide further research...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports and}} {{reflects}} on the pilot application of an 11 -step policy learning protocol that was developed by Cashore and Lupberger (2015) based on several years of Cashore’s multi-author collaborations. The protocol was applied {{for the first time}} in Peru in 2015 and 2016 by the IUFRO Working Party on Forest Policy Learning Architectures (hereinafter referred to as the project team). The protocol integrates insights from policy learning scholarship (Hall 1993, Sabatier 1999) with Bernstein and Cashore’s (2000, 2012) four pathways of influence framework. The pilot implementation in Peru focused on how global timber legality verification interventions might be harnessed to promote local land rights. Legality verification focuses attention on the <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> <b>auditing</b> of forest management units in order to verify that timber is harvested and traded in compliance with the law. We specifically asked: How can community legal ownership of, and access to, forestland and forest resources be enhanced? The protocol was designed as a dynamic tool, the implementation of which fosters iterative rather than linear processes. It directly integrated two objectives: 1) identifying the causal processes through which global governance initiatives might be harnessed to produce durable results ‘on the ground’; 2) generating insights and strategies in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. This paper reviews and critically evaluates our work in designing and piloting the protocol. We assess what seemed to work well and suggest modifications, including an original diagnostic framework for nurturing durable change. We also assess the implications of the pilot application of the protocol for policy implementation that works to enhance the influence of existing international policy instruments, rather than contributing to fragmentation and incoherence by creating new ones...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigated Hong Kong Chinese undergraduate students’ conceptions {{and experiences}} of academics’ care and examined its pedagogical implications within a higher education context. Three purposes framed this study: 1) To explore the conceptions of academics’ care amongst Hong Kong Chinese undergraduate students; 2) To investigate Hong Kong Chinese undergraduate students’ perceived attributes of academics’ care and the perceived effects of academics’ care on learning and development in Hong Kong; and 3) To draw the implications of caring pedagogy for Hong Kong Chinese undergraduate students’ learning and academic development in Hong Kong. The empirical {{data were collected from}} final-year students in the naturalistic setting of a Hong Kong university. By applying a qualitative research design, purposive sampling was used to select students who had experienced academics’ care during their university study. Data sources included in-depth interviews, write-up accounts and researcher’s notes. Thematic analysis was used to identify the themes emerged from the informants’ narrative accounts of academics’ care. Data quality procedures, included triangulation, member <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> trail, were followed to ensure research rigour. Results indicated that academics’ care was conceptualized as a continuum of care, moving along the continuum from “Pedagogical Care” to “Holistic Care” and then to “Sustainable Care”. This continuum featured a deepening of mutuality, responsiveness and reciprocity. A dual overarching theme of “Safety Net” and “Sustainable Bonding” were identified in conceptualizing academics’ care in a university context. This thesis thus proposed a model of caring in higher education rested on three overlapping domains of the relational zone, attachment behaviour and the socio-cultural context. This thesis has contributed to an under-researched area of caring pedagogy in a university context. The significant role of academics’ care in students’ learning, development and well-being has been discerned as a key construct of the socio-culture of care within the Chinese context. Implications were thus offered for future research on caring pedagogy, and for policymakers, university administrators and teachers in further exploring the opportunities presented by integrating care into teaching practices. ...|$|R

50|$|The command-and-control {{approach}} dictates how {{the radio}} spectrum will be segmented and which consumers {{will be eligible}} to use it. In the United States, the FCC is the centralized authority that regulates spectrum allocation and use. So far, the command-and-control approach {{has been the most}} commonly used method for spectrum management. Over the past decade, there has been a substantial increase in the technological innovations, mobile devices, and wireless services that use the radio spectrum. The command-and-control approach was useful for addressing the issues related to older wireless communication devices and services. With the new technologies and their increased demand for the radio spectrum, the command-and-control approach was simply at a disadvantage for spectrum management. In October 2001, Chairman Michael Powell, the FCC Chairman at that time, shared the difficulties that the government officials were experiencing {{when it came to the}} allocation and alignment of the radio spectrum to address the new emerging spectrum needs and services. In June 2002, the FCC Chairman established the Spectrum Policy Task Force to assist the FCC in evaluating changes in the spectrum, reevaluating the command-and-control approach, and helping to migrate it to a more consumer-oriented model. The command-and-control approach comprises the duties of allocating and segmenting the spectrum for specific types of services, e.g. radio, and ensuring that the services that use these bands adopt the service rules and technical standards. command-and-control also requires that the equipment from the major federal systems that use the spectrum be certified by the NTIA in order to evaluate the impact of the system on the spectrum. The certification includes properly researching the system, selecting the frequency bands used by the system, and then filing for review by the NTIA for federal systems. (The FCC reviews non-federal systems.) After the certification process is complete and the technical standards have been authorized, a portion of the radio spectrum is allocated to the individual entity or service provider and its use is allowed within a certain geographical area. Lastly, the command-and-control approach requires the NTIA and FCC to have proper measures in place to monitor the allocated spectrum, address any interference issues, keep the technical standards in <b>check,</b> <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> the geographic spectrum assignments. The goal from here onward was to create a more consumer-oriented model that would encourage the optimum use of the spectrum, lead growth in technological innovations, and provide effective and efficient communication technologies and services.|$|R

The construction industry will need to offer innovation, value for money and other benefits that associate with the collaborative procurement movement, which has been gathering pace since the 1990 s. The aim of the research is to develop a framework to evaluate collaborative practice in Higher Education Property and Estates’ departments in England. The work is practitioner research that relates to a real world problem. The objectives include: construct a suitable framework; develop the framework using a particular institution; and assess the framework in the wider context of England. The research philosophy has foundations in both constructionism and pragmatism. The work develops the initial framework using literature. A Primary Case Study tests, relates and develops the framework in practice. To an extent, the literature review is able to provide transferability of the maturity model, particularly in relation to the implementation and motivation themes. Where the literature review could not provide transferability, a pragmatic approach is undertaken to improve the transferability of the research findings, which uses data from 44 estate strategies, 6 auxiliary case studies, 11 tender notices and industry sources. Data is generally qualitative and from such sources as interviews and documentation. The work uses thematic content analysis to explore organisations and summative content analysis to improve transferability.

Faculty used eight rituals: Preparation, Tracking, Discourse, Closet, Repast, Selection, Maneuver, and Documentation, and three types of actions: Teaching, Role Modeling, and Caretaking to transmit their values. Teaching was utilized 55 {{percent of the time}} and involved questioning, instructing, guiding, correcting and observing. Role Modeling, used 22 percent, embodied promoting independence, helping, intervening, kidding and admitting fallibility. Caretaking was evidenced 23 percent of the instructor's time and included caring, praising, diffusing anger, allowing mistakes and sharing self. Over one hundred student behaviors and characteristics that faculty valued were identified and collapsed into six descriptors, listed in descending order: assertive, therapeutic, compliant, knowledgeable, disciplined, and skillful. Faculty placed emphasis on human, interactive skills versus knowledge and psychomotor skills, and responded to students with very caring behaviors. They utilized compassion as a way of effecting conformity, and their use of caring behaviors for the exercise of their power was evident...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTParliaments <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> {{agencies}} have critical and complementary {{roles in the}} oversight of the budget and the enforcement of government accountability. Yet, the nexus between parliaments <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> agencies {{is one of the}} weakest links in the accountability chain, generating an accountability gap in the budget process. This articles analyses the interactions between parliaments <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> agencies in the oversight of government finances during the latter stages of the budget process. Using proxies to evaluate the quality of those linkages, such as the follow-up to <b>audit</b> findings <b>and</b> the discharge of government, it shows important dysfunctions in the interactions between parliaments <b>and</b> <b>audit</b> agencies due to a combination of technical capacity constraints and political economy disincentives. It suggests that the effective functioning of the system of <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances in public budgeting critically hinges on the agility of the linkages between accountability institutions. As such, the failure of budget accountability is due to systemic dysfunctions in the systems of accountability, rather than the failure of an individual accountability institution acting in isolation. In addition, the effectiveness of the horizontal accountability architecture depends on the political economy incentives shaping the budget process, which are generated by the interactions between the choice of institutional design and budget rules, with the degree of political competition and electoral rules...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a manufacturer using a Request For Quotes reverse auction {{in combination with}} supplier qualification screening to determine which qualified supplier will be awarded a contract. Supplier qualification screening is costly for the manufacturer, for example involving reference <b>checks,</b> financial <b>audits,</b> <b>and</b> on-site visits. The manufacturer seeks to minimize its total procurement costs, i. e. the contract payment plus qualification costs. While suppliers can be qualified prior to the auction (pre-qualification), we allow the manufacturer to delay {{all or part of}} the qualification until after the auction (post-qualification). Using an optimal mechanism analysis we analytically explore the tradeoffs between varying levels of pre- and post-qualification. While using post-qualification causes the expected contract payment to increase (bids from unqualified suppliers are discarded) we find that standard industrial practices of pre-qualification only can be improved upon by judicious use of post-qualification, particularly when supplier qualification screening is moderately expensive relative to the value of the contract to the buyer...|$|R

Following the resource based theory, {{the purpose of this}} multiple case study was to explore what capital growth strategies 6 small women-owned business leaders in the defense industry in Dayton, Ohio used to ensure business sustainability beyond the initial start-up period of 1 year. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and company documents. Methodological triangulation, member <b>checking,</b> reflexivity, <b>and</b> an <b>audit</b> trail were used to strengthen credibility and trustworthiness. Based on thematic analysis of the data, emergent themes included growth strategies, risk, and cultivate relationships. Participants pursued low-cost slow-growth strategies to remain viable in a highly competitive marketplace; mitigated risk by aligning business decisions with their strategic plans and diversifying their business and customer base; and cultivated relationships with government agencies, customers, partners, and employees to obtain capital to sustain and grow their businesses. The implications for positive social change include the potential to provide women-owned small business leaders with strategies to obtain growth capital necessary for sustainability, contributing to economic growth of businesses, employees, employees 2 ̆ 7 families, and communities...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Office of General Counsel (OGC) procedures do not sufficiently ensure that accredited representatives have good character and knowledge. While GAO's analysis shows that VA follows its procedures for reviewing initial accreditation applications, VA relies on limited self-reported information to determine whether applicants have a criminal history or their character could be called into question, which in turn leaves VA vulnerable to accrediting individuals who may not provide responsible assistance. For example, when GAO conducted additional checks on a non-representative sample of accredited individuals, GAO found that some individuals had histories of bankruptcies or liens, information which could help develop a more complete picture of applicants' character and prompt further inquiry by VA into their background. VA's procedures also do not ensure that representatives have adequate program knowledge. For example, VA's initial training requirements are minimal and VA does not consistently monitor whether representatives meet additional continuing education requirements. As a result, some accredited representatives may not have adequate program knowledge to effectively assist clients with their claims. After being briefed on GAO's findings in May 2013, VA's OGC announced plans to take additional steps toward conducting background <b>checks</b> on applicants <b>and</b> <b>auditing</b> ongoing character <b>and</b> training requirements. ...|$|R
