40|$|The United States Coast Guard {{adopted the}} Planning- Programming-Budgeting System {{as the process}} for {{justification}} of its fiscal year 1968 budget request. The adopted system did not allocate the cost of <b>capital</b> <b>outlays</b> to the programs and program elements that would benefit from the investment in facilities. Full implementation of the Planning-Programming- Budgeting System calls for such allocation. The problems and difficulties that will arise in allocating the costs of <b>capital</b> <b>outlays</b> need consideration. If the problems can be overcome without an expense greater than the value of eliminating them, the Coast Guard should endeavor to allocate the cost of <b>capital</b> <b>outlays.</b> The results of solving the problems and fully implementing the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System are also worthy of consideration.
