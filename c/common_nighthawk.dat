5000|$|Up {{until the}} early 19th century, the <b>common</b> <b>nighthawk</b> and the {{whip-poor-will}} {{were thought to be}} one species. The latter's call was explained as the nocturnal expression of the <b>common</b> <b>nighthawk.</b> Alexander Wilson, [...] "The Father of American Ornithology", correctly made the differentiation between the two species.|$|E

50|$|On their 18th day, {{the young}} {{will make their}} first flight; by days 25-30, they are flying proficiently. The young are last seen with their parents on day 30. Complete {{development}} is shown between their 45-50th day. At day 52, the juvenile will join the flock, potentially migrating. Juvenile birds, in both sexes, are lighter in colour and have a smaller white wing-patch than adult <b>common</b> <b>nighthawks.</b>|$|R
50|$|During migration, <b>common</b> <b>nighthawks</b> may travel 2500 to 6800 km. They migrate by day {{or night}} in loose flocks; {{frequently}} numbering in the thousands, no visible leader has been observed. The enormous distance travelled between breeding grounds and wintering range {{is one of the}} North America's longer migrations. The northbound journey commences at the end of February and the birds reach destinations as late as mid-June. The southbound migration commences mid-July and reaches a close in early October.|$|R
5|$|Birds are {{the animals}} most {{often seen in}} the monument. Included {{among the more than}} 50 species {{observed}} are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, <b>common</b> <b>nighthawks,</b> and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor's center include rufous hummingbirds, Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches. Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, black-billed magpies, and other birds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>{{nighthawk}}</b> resembles {{both the}} Antillean nighthawk and the lesser nighthawk and occurs at least seasonally {{in the entire}} North American range of both of these species. The lesser nighthawk is a smaller bird and displays more buffy on the undertail coverts, where the <b>common</b> <b>nighthawk</b> shows white. Common nighthawks and Antillean nighthawks exhibit entirely dark on the basal portion of the primary feathers, whereas lesser nighthawks have bands of buffy spots. Common and Antillean nighthawks have a longer outermost primary conveying a pointier wing tip than the lesser nighthawk. The <b>common</b> <b>nighthawk</b> forages higher above ground than the lesser nighthawk and has a different call. The only reliable way to distinguish Antillean nighthawk without disturbance is also by the differences in their calls. Visually, they may only be distinguished as different from the <b>common</b> <b>nighthawk</b> once in the hand. Subtle differences are reported {{to be a challenge}} in field identification.|$|E

50|$|Females {{choose the}} nest site {{and are the}} primary {{incubators}} of the eggs; males will incubate occasionally. Incubation time varies but is approximately 18 days. The female will leave the nest unattended during the evening in order to feed. The male will roost in a neighbouring tree (the spot he chooses changes daily); he guards the nest by diving, hissing, wing-beating or booming at the sites. In the face of predation, <b>common</b> <b>nighthawks</b> do not abandon the nest easily; instead they likely rely on their cryptic colouration to camouflage themselves. If a departure does occur, the females have been noted to fly away, hissing at the intruder or performing a disturbance display.|$|R
2500|$|Birds {{living in}} the Central Coast Range include a variety of smaller and larger bird species. These include winter wrens, chestnut-backed chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, varied thrushes, several swallow species, red crossbills, evening grosbeaks, brown creepers, olive-sided flycatchers, Hammond's flycatchers, gray jays, western wood-pewees, and western tanagers. Some of the larger species in the range include the red-breasted sapsucker, common ravens, {{peregrine}} falcons, the pileated woodpecker, turkey vultures, wood duck, <b>common</b> <b>nighthawks,</b> and the red-tailed hawk. Birds in lower numbers include Vaux's swifts, the endangered spotted owl, bald eagles, the downy woodpecker, hairy woodpeckers, the pine siskin, the hermit warbler, Pacific-slope flycatchers, golden-crowned kinglets, and ruffed grouse. One of the more common avian wildlife is the American dipper, which live mainly near rivers and streams. These birds build nests from six to nine inches (229mm) [...] in diameter out of moss.|$|R
40|$|McConnell Air Force Base (AFB) {{experiences}} a unique bird/aircraft hazard problem with migrating <b>common</b> <b>nighthawks</b> from August to October. Nighthawks {{are the most}} commonly struck species at McConnell AFB, representing about 38 % of reported bird/aircraft strikes. During August and September, nighthawks represented 82 % of the bird strikes found on the airfield. Approaches for managing nighthawks on and around airfields are limited because of the night environment, logistics and an incomplete understanding of nighthawk behavior. We determined the number of nighthawks using McConnell AFB and associated foraging, loafing and roosting areas, analyzed their food habits, and developed a translocation management strategy to reduce hazards to aircraft. During 1998, 1999 and 2000, we observed 600, 540 and 920 nighthawks, respectively, on the airfield. The greatest activity on the airfield occurred from September 27 - 30 in 1998, September 9 - 14 in 1999, and September 6 - 8 in 2000. The peak number of nighthawks observed using the airfield during these periods was 142, 90 and 118, respectively. Nighthawks foraged around the airfield mainly between 1800 and 2200 and usually roosted on the airfield about 1800 with a peak between 2200 and 0200. During one 2 -hour survey period in 1999 and 2000, 37 and 59 nighthawks, respectively, were flushed from the airfield. Thirty-seven nighthawks collected during the study consumed mostly corn earworm moths (Noctuidae) and beetles (Scarabaeidae). Management of nighthawks on McConnell AFB has been difficult because commonly used hazing techniques seem to be ineffective; these birds usually return to the same roosting location after being flushed, which can present an even greater risk to aircraft. We developed and evaluated a unique technique for capturing and translocating nighthawks from the airfield. Only 1 of 214 nighthawks translocated 88 km from McConnell AFB returned. Nighthawk/aircraft strikes at McConnell AFB declined from 9 in 1998, when no translocation was conducted, to 0 in 1999 and 3 in 2000...|$|R

40|$|McConnell Air Force Base (MAFB) {{experiences}} a unique bird/aircraft hazard problem with migrating <b>common</b> <b>nighthawks</b> (Chordeiles minor) from August-October. Nighthawks {{are the most}} commonly struck species at MAFB, representing about 38 % of total reported bird/aircraft strikes and 82 % of the strikes from August-October. Factors that contribute to an over abundance of nighthawks on MAFB are: abundant foraging opportunities {{in close proximity to}} the airfield, available roosting habitat for nighthawks on and around the airfield, the lack of a Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard program to address nighthawks, and the location of MAFB on a nighthawk migration route. Approaches for managing nighthawks on and around airfields are limited because of their nocturnal behavior, logistics, and an incomplete understanding of nighthawk behavior. At MAFB, we determined the number of nighthawks using the airfield; their foraging, loafing and roosting areas; and their feeding habits. Based on this information, we developed a management strategy to reduce the nighthawk hazard to aircraft. From August-October in 1999 and 2000, we recorded 540 and 920 observations, respectively, of nighthawks using the airfield. The number of individuals increased rapidly during August and September, reaching a peak between 9 - 14 September in 1999 and 27 - 30 September in 2000. During one 2 -hour survey period each in 1999 and 2000, 37 and 59 nighthawks, respectively, were flushed from the airfield. Most nighthawk foraging activity at the airfield occurred between 1800 - 2200. Nighthawks started roosting on the airfield about 1800 with a peak between 2200 - 0200. Thirty-seven nighthawks collected during the study period consumed a variety of insects, consisting mostly of corn earworm moths (Noctuidae— 47 % of stomach contents) and beetles (Scarabaeidae). Insect sweeps of the airfield indicated a low density of these species of insects, suggesting that most nighthawks foraging activity occurred away from the airfield. Management of nighthawks on MAFB has been difficult because commonly used hazing techniques seem to be ineffective. Furthermore, nighthawks have a behavior of returning to the same roosting location after being flushed which can present an even greater risk to aircraft. We developed and evaluated a unique live-capture technique for nighthawks using the airfield for the purpose of evaluating nighthawk relocation. During 1999 and 2000, 215 nighthawks were captured and relocated to sites 44 km north and 88 km south from MAFB. Only one nighthawk returned to MAFB after being relocated 44 km north. The nighthawk returned after 11 days to within 100 m of its capture location. Relocation of nighthawks from MAFB in 1999 and 2000 reduced nighthawk/aircraft strikes from 9 in 1998 when no relocation was conducted to 0 in 1999 and 3 in 2000...|$|R
5000|$|The five-position {{knife switch}} <b>common</b> to all <b>Nighthawks</b> {{provides}} five tone settings (or pickup combinations), {{but on the}} three-pickup models, the tone knob includes a push-pull feature that provides access to {{a second set of}} five, for a total of ten tones. It is often said that when the knob is pulled out, the humbuckers' coils are split, but this is somewhat misleading. All Nighthawks have a mixture of humbucking and split-coil tones whether or not they have the push-pull feature. On the two-pickup models, only positions two and five use both coils of the same pickup; the other three positions are split-coil. On the three-pickup models, one or both humbuckers are split in positions one, two, four, and five with the tone knob pulled up, and in position five with the tone knob pushed down.

5000|$|The <b>common</b> <b>nighthawk</b> (Chordeiles minor) is a {{medium-sized}} [...] crepuscular or nocturnal bird within the nightjar family, whose presence and identity are best revealed by its vocalization. Typically dark (grey, black and brown), displaying cryptic colouration and intricate patterns, this bird {{is difficult to}} spot {{with the naked eye}} during the day. Once aerial, with its buoyant but erratic flight, this bird is most conspicuous. The most remarkable feature of this aerial insectivore is its small beak that belies the massiveness of its mouth. Some claim appearance similarities to owls. With its horizontal stance and short legs, the <b>common</b> <b>nighthawk</b> does not travel frequently on the ground, instead preferring to perch horizontally, parallel to branches, on posts, on the ground or on a roof. The males of this species may roost together but the bird is primarily solitary. The <b>common</b> <b>nighthawk</b> shows variability in territory size.|$|E
