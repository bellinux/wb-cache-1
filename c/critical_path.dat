5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the <b>critical</b> <b>path</b> of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Meeting {{power and}} {{performance}} requirement is a challenging task in high speed ALUs. Supply voltage scaling is promising because it reduces both switching and active power {{but it also}} degrades robustness. Recently, researchers have proposed novel design technique for linear time complexity adders that maintain high yield and high clock frequency even at scaled supply voltage. The idea {{is based on the}} fact that the <b>critical</b> <b>paths</b> of arithmetic units are exercised rarely. The technique (a) predicts the set of <b>critical</b> <b>paths,</b> (b) reduces the supply voltage to operate non-critical paths at rated frequency, and; (c) avoids possible delay failures in the <b>critical</b> <b>paths</b> by dynamically stretching the clock period (to say, two-cycles assuming all standard operations are single-cycle), when they are activated. This allows circuits to operate at scaled supply with minimal performance degradation. The off-critical paths operate in single clock cycle while <b>critical</b> <b>paths</b> are operated in stretched clock period. Different classe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{technology}} scales, gate {{sensitivity to}} noise in-creases due to supply voltage scaling and limited scaling of the voltage threshold. As a result, power supply noise plays {{a greater role}} in sub- 100 nm technologies and creates signal integrity issues in the chip. It is vital to consider supply voltage noise effects (i) during design validation to apply sufficient guardbands to <b>critical</b> <b>paths</b> and (ii) during path delay test to ensure the performance and reliability of the chip. In this paper, a novel layout-aware pattern generation procedure for maximizing power supply noise effects on <b>critical</b> <b>paths</b> while considering local voltage drop impacts is proposed. The proposed pattern generation and validation flow is implemented on the ITC’ 99 b 19 benchmark. Experimental results for both wire-bond and flip-chip packaging styles are presented in this paper. Results demonstrate that our proposed method is fast, significantly increases switching around the functionally testable <b>critical</b> <b>paths,</b> and induces large voltage drop on cells placed in the <b>critical</b> <b>paths</b> which results in increased path delay. The proposed method eliminates the very time consuming pattern validation phase that is practiced in industry...|$|R

500|$|Construction {{started on}} August 13, 1963, with an {{elaborate}} ceremony hosted by Mayor Drapeau on barges {{anchored in the}} St. Lawrence River. Ceremonially, construction began when Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson pulled a lever that signalled a front-end loader to dump the first batch of fill to enlarge Saint Helen's Island, and Quebec premier Jean Lesage spread the fill with a bulldozer. Of the 25 million tons of fill needed to construct the islands, 10-12% {{was coming from the}} Montreal Metro's excavations, a public works project that was already under construction before Expo was awarded to Montreal. The remainder of the fill came from quarries on Montreal and the South Shore, however even with that it was insufficient and so bodies of water on both islands were added (lakes and canals) {{to reduce the amount of}} fill required. Expo's initial construction period mainly centered on enlarging Saint Helen's Island, creating the artificial island of Notre Dame Island and lengthening and enlarging the Mackay Pier which became the Cité du Havre. While construction continued, the land rising out of Montreal harbour was not owned by the Expo Corporation yet. After the final mounds of earth completed the islands, the grounds that would hold the fair were officially transferred from the City of Montreal to the corporation on June 20, 1964. This gave Colonel Churchill only 1042 days to have everything built and functioning for opening day. To get Expo built in time, Churchill used the then new project management tool known as the <b>critical</b> <b>path</b> method (CPM). [...] On April 28, 1967, opening day, everything was ready, with one exception: Habitat 67, which was then displayed as a work in progress.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—VLSI {{circuits}} usually allocate {{excess margin}} {{to account for}} worst-case process variation. Since most chips are fabricated at process conditions better than the worst-case corner, adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) is commonly used to reduce power consumption whenever possible. A typical AVS setup relies on a performance monitor that replicates <b>critical</b> <b>paths</b> of the circuit to guide voltage scaling. However, {{it is difficult to}} define appropriate <b>critical</b> <b>paths</b> for an SoC which has multiple operating modes and IPs. In this paper, we propose a different methodology for AVS which matches the voltage scaling characteristics of a circuit rather than the delays of <b>critical</b> <b>paths.</b> This fundamental change in monitoring strategy simplifies the monitoring circuitry as well as the calibration flow of conventional monitoring methods. To enable the proposed methodology, we study voltage scaling characteristics of digital circuits. Based on our analyses, we develop design guidelines as well as design monitoring circuits which have tunable voltage scaling characteristics. Our experimental results show that this methodology can be used for AVS with a simplified calibration flow. I...|$|R
