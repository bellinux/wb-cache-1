The degree of biofilm activity varied depending upon both the isolate and the pellicle. Significantly increased biofilm activity on the pellicle (particularly serum) <b>coated</b> <b>strips</b> was observed with three isolates of C. albicans and another of C. glabrata on protein-coated acrylics, with increasing concentration of serum in the pellicle. Similar trends were observed with one isolate of C. albicans and C. glabrata, although the effects of pellicles were not significant. In contrast, with all three isolates of C. tropicalis and a single isolate of C. glabrata, although the biofilm activity on the protein-free control strips {{was significantly higher than}} that of saliva- <b>coated</b> <b>strips,</b> the increase in activity of pellicle-admixed biofilm depended upon the serum concentration. Candidal biofilm formation on acrylic surfaces is essentially promoted with increasing concentration of serum in the pellicle. This suggests that inflammation in the oral environment would facilitate fungal colonization on denture acrylic. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid {{optical fiber sensor}} system for {{simultaneously}} sensing the strain, temperature, and thermal strain of composite materials. The hybrid fiber optic sensor system involves a combination of three sensors: 1) a polarimetric sensor based on an acrylate coated polarization maintaining photonic crystal fiber (PM-PCF); 2) a <b>coating</b> <b>stripped</b> PM-PCF sensor; and 3) a fiber Bragg grating sensor (FBG). Temperature is sensed using the FBG sensor, axial strain is sensed using the acrylate coated PM-PCF sensor, and thermal strain is sensed using the <b>coating</b> <b>stripped</b> PM-PCF. The hybrid sensor system presented operates in the intensity domain by converting the polarization and wavelength information from the polarimetric sensors and the FBG, respectively, into detectable linear intensity variations. Subsequently, by deriving a characteristic matrix for the hybrid sensors, information about temperature, axial strain, and thermal strain can be simultaneously determined. An experimental demonstration of the hybrid sensor system is described based on a glass fiber reinforced composite material sample within which the three different sensors are embedded. The proposed sensor configuration can be employed in composite material structural health monitoring application...|$|R

40|$|The {{residual}} stresses in a TiN film deposited by a reactive ion coating process on a 316 {{stainless steel sheet}} were determined by the sin $ X-ray diffraction method, at temperatures from 15 - 800 “C. Using specially designed nickel clips, the <b>coated</b> <b>strip</b> was heated by {{the passage of a}} resistive current, in conjunction with a surround heater, and the temperature was measured by a Pt/Pt-lO%Rh thermocouple welded to the under surface of the strip. Compressive stresses of the order of- 4 GPa were observed at room temperature. On heating to 475 “C, the compressive {{residual stresses}} were progressively reduced to zero. On further heating, the stresses became tensile in form, and increased to 6. 8 GPa at 800 “C. The deviation from linearity of the Ad/dn versus si& $ plots indicated that microstresses were also present in the deposited film and this effect was confirmed by profile breadth measurements. These microstresses were relieved by heating to 800 °C. After this treatment the compressive residual stress at room temperature was reduced to- 3 GPa, confirming the relief of point defects introduced during the growth of the coating. Surface discolouration and lattice parameter changes also indicated that nitrogen loss occurred from the TiN film during the high temperature treatment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new assessment technique {{to monitor the}} quality of coated steel sheet surfaces, mainly used in the construction industry, e. g. as cladding for commercial buildings, external surface composite panels or even domestic applications, so clearly the visual appearance is critical. Normally, these types of steel sheets are coil coated onto steel strips. After curing the coating is soft, when it has cooled to approximated 60 C it can be embossed with a pattern by application of pressure by a roller with the appropriately pattered surface. After embossing and further cooling the <b>coated</b> <b>strip</b> can be coiled and stored. However during the storing process {{the weight of the}} coil (of the order of several tonnes), can damage the soft surface by creating visible pressure marks. Sometimes the surface will relax back to the original embossed shape some time after the pressure has been relieved or with the help of heat treatment. On occasion however the surface does not recover and a visual defect remains, which leads to customer rejection. In this paper, a new way to characterize coated surface of steel sheets, which combines wavelet filtering [1] with decomposed numerical analysis techniques [2] is presented. The wavelet filtering is based on complex wavelet, and it has very good metrological characteristics in the scale domain and provides shift-invariance and directions sensitive properties. In this research, this wavelet model is used to extract the information of structured texture of coated steel surfaces within the original emboss. The decomposed numerical description is used to qualify the variation phenomena of surface texture during storage and transportation. The results can be feedback to steel industry to significantly improve their coating techniques, storage and transportation...|$|E

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{critical}} issues of the influence of the thermal expansion of composite materials on embedded polarimetric sensors for measurements of strain and temperature are studied in this paper. A composite material sample with polarimetric fiber sensors embedded in two distinct layers of a multi-layer composite structure is fabricated and characterized. The polarimetric fiber sensors used in this study are based on Panda type fiber and polarization maintaining photonic crystal fiber (PM-PCF). The temperature sensitivities of polarimetric fiber sensors with acrylate buffer <b>coated</b> and buffer <b>stripped</b> polarization maintaining optical fibers are measured in free space and compared with those for sensors embedded in the composite material. It is found that a polarimetric fiber sensor with an acrylate coating embedded in the composite material shows the same response as the one in free space while the <b>coating</b> <b>stripped</b> fiber polarimetric sensor shows significant temperature sensitivity when embedded in the composite material. This is due to the stress induced change in birefringence created by the thermal expansion of the composite material, while {{in the case of a}} buffer coated fiber, the effect is considerably reduced as the thermal stress is largely eliminated by the buffer coating. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that thermal expansion of the composite material is the main source of error in strain and temperature measurement using embedded polarimetric fiber sensors and that more accurate strain and temperature measurements can be obtained with buffer coated polarimetric fiber sensors. 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
