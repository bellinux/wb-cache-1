40|$|The Multicenter European Radiofrequency Survey (MERFS) {{retrospectively}} analysed {{the incidence}} of procedure-related complications in 4463 patients who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation in 69 European institutions between 1987 and 1992. Of these 4463 patients, 880 underwent modification of the atrioventricular node to cure atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. This report presents {{a detailed analysis of}} {{the incidence of}} <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> with respect to the target site and the number of patients reported per institution. The most common complication of modification of the atrioventricular node was the unintended induction of <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> (41 of 880 patients, 4. 7 %). In 684 of 880 patients (78 %), detailed information about the approached target site for modification of the atrioventricular node was available. <b>Complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> occurred significantly more often in patients who underwent ablation of the fast pathway (19 / 361, 5. 3 %) or in whom ablation of the slow and fast pathway was attempted after failure al the initial site (4 / 25, 16 %) than in patients who underwent slow pathway ablation (6 / 298, 2. 0 %, P 30 patients (group II: n= 354; 2. 3 %; P< 0. 05). In addition, in those patients in whom the target site was available, the incidence of <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> after fast pathway ablation was significantly higher in group I (n= 168 patients) when compared to group II (n= 193 patients) (7. 7 % vs 3. 1 %, P< 0. 05) and also tended to be higher after slow pathway ablation in group I (2. 4 % in group I vs 1. 5 % in group II; P=ns). Conclusions: In this analysis of collaborative data, radiofrequency catheter modification of the atrioventricular node carried a risk of approximately 5 % of <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block.</b> The incidence of <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> was significantly higher in patients who underwent fast pathway ablation or fast and slow pathway ablation after failure at the initial site compared with slow pathway ablation.

40|$|CONTEXT: Patients with Alport's {{syndrome}} (causing 5 % of end-stage renal disease) have {{a higher}} risk of heart conduction abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Alport's syndrome developing <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> during renal transplantation.

40|$|Abstract. A well {{described}} {{interaction between}} an anti-bradycardia pacemaker and a ventricular de®brillator is sensing of pacemaker stimuli by the ventricular de®brillator. This report describes {{an interaction between}} an atrial demand pacemaker and a ventricu-lar de®brillator that resulted in ventricular asystole and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. In this case, the ventricular de®brillator sensed atrial pacing stimuli when <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> with a slow ventricular escape rate developed. De®brillator-based ventricular demand pacing was inhibited, result-ing in prolonged periods of ventricular asystole, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and multiple de®brillator shocks. Ventricular de®brillator sensing of atrial pacemaker stimuli {{in the setting of}} <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> and ventricular asystole cannot be simulated during de®brillator implantation when atrioventricular conduction is intact. Therefore, a pacemaker programmed to atrial demand pacing in a patient with a ventricular de®brillator can result in inappropriate inhibition of ventricular pacing in the setting of complete heart block. Furthermore, this interaction can be avoided with a dual-chamber pacing ventricular de®brillator.

RESULTS: Logistic regression showed a greater incidence of bundle branch block in male sex (odds ratio = 1. 87, 95 % CI = 1. 02 - 3. 42), age over 70 years (odds ratio = 2. 31, 95 % CI = 1. 68 - 5. 00), anterior localization of the infarction (odds ratio = 1. 93, 95 % CI = 1. 03 - 3. 65). There was a greater incidence of <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> in inferior infarcts (odds ratio = 2. 59, 95 % CI 1. 30 - 5. 18) and the presence of cardiogenic shock (odds ratio = 3. 90, 95 % CI = 1. 43 - 10. 65). Use of a thrombolytic agent was associated with a tendency toward a lower occurrence of bundle branch block (odds ratio = 0. 68) and a greater occurrence of <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> (odds ratio = 1. 44). The presence of bundle branch block (odds ratio = 2. 45 95 %, CI = 1. 14 - 5. 28) and of <b>complete</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>block</b> (odds ratio = 13. 59, 95 % CI = 5. 43 - 33. 98) was associated with a high and independent probability of inhospital death.
