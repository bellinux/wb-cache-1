5|$|Chemically, scandium, yttrium and {{lutetium}} (and presumably lawrencium) {{behave like}} trivalent {{versions of the}} group 1–2 metals.

In this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches their position in the f-block.

5|$|It has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n = 34, which is unusual for the genus Drosera {{and closer to the}} diploid {{chromosome number}} of the Venus flytrap (Dionaeamuscipula), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable chromosome <b>counts</b> <b>for</b> Dionaea from multiple studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known chromosome counts, most are a multiple of x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. Exceptions to this base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E
5|$|Reports on {{the number}} of killed and wounded aboard Chesapeake during the battle vary widely. Broke's after-action report from 6July states 70killed and 100wounded. Contemporary sources place the number between 48–61killed and 85–99wounded. Discrepancies in the number of killed and wounded are {{possibly}} caused by the addition of sailors who died of their wounds in the ensuing days after the battle. The <b>counts</b> <b>for</b> Shannon have fewer discrepancies with 23killed; 56wounded. Despite his serious injuries, Broke ordered repairs to both ships and they proceeded on to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Captain Lawrence died en route and was buried in Halifax with military honors. The British imprisoned his crew. Captain Broke survived his wounds and was later made a baronet.|$|E
5|$|The La and Ac variant {{remains the}} most common in the literature, despite some calls for a change to the Lu and Lr variant. In terms of {{chemical}} behaviour, and trends going down group 3 for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium are similar to their group 1–2 counterparts.

50|$|In basketball, {{effective}} {{field goal percentage}} is a statistic that adjusts field goal percentage {{to account for the}} fact that three-point field goals <b>count</b> <b>for</b> three points while field goals only <b>count</b> <b>for</b> two points. It is abbreviated eFG%.|$|R

5000|$|Points are earned through hits, sinks, and knockovers. There are {{two primary}} {{variations}} <b>for</b> <b>counting</b> scoring and declaring {{the winner of}} a game. In the five-point game, hits <b>count</b> <b>for</b> one point, sinks <b>count</b> <b>for</b> two points, and knockovers <b>count</b> <b>for</b> five points. In the five-point game, whenever a team earns points, both players of that team are expected to drink one fifth of the total volume of their cup for each point. In the four-point variation of the game, hits <b>count</b> <b>for</b> one point, sinks <b>count</b> <b>for</b> up to two points, and knockovers <b>count</b> <b>for</b> up to two points. If a cup is half-full and gets sunk or knocked-over, that counts as only one point. Players in a four-point game are expected to drink half of a single cup for each point. A team cannot lose on a serve. If a team has only one point left, they cannot have the last point scored through their own ineptitude. However, if both teams have only a single point left, a team may [...] "serve out" [...] if others are waiting to play a subsequent game. In a five-point game, {{the first team to}} earn five points loses. In a four-point game, the first team to earn four points loses.|$|R

Known column <b>counts</b> <b>for</b> the two species are: 51 to 53columns per maxilla and 48 to 49 per dentary (teeth of the upper jaw being slightly narrower than those in the lower jaw) for E. regalis; and 52columns per maxilla and 44 per dentary for E. annectens (an E. saskatchewanensis specimen).|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} the highway {{like all other}} state trunkline highways under its jurisdiction. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its highways. These surveys are expressed using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the traffic <b>counts</b> <b>for</b> a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that 692vehicles a day used the segment near the state park. Through the middle section in Garden, the peak volume was 892vehicles daily which dropped to 878at the USjunction. The commercial AADT was 54trucks for the entire highway. M-183 has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The USAD {{requires}} {{a diversity of}} achievement within each team; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by GPA. The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade <b>counts</b> <b>for</b> face value {{regardless of whether it}} is from an advanced placement, honors, regular or remedial class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.|$|E

5|$|The result, as {{confirmed}} by Russell, also contains {{the distribution of}} solution <b>counts</b> <b>for</b> the 44 equivalence classes.

The number of completions for each class is consistently {{on the order of}} 100,000,000, while the number of Band1 permutations covered by each class however varies from 4 – 3240. Within this wide size range, there are clearly two clusters. Ranked by size, the lower 33 classes average ~400 permutations/class, while the upper 11 average ~2100. The disparity in consistency between the distributions for size and number of completions or the separation into two clusters by size is yet to be examined.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of the ten}} {{events is}} worth 1,000 points, for a {{possible}} 10,000-point individual total. Only the top two scores from the Honors, Scholastic and Varsity divisions are counted for the team score. Until 2013, 60,000 was the maximum possible team score. In 2013, Super Quiz became a 10,000 point event that only <b>counts</b> <b>for</b> the team score, making the maximum possible team score 70,000. With the exception of math and Super Quiz, the objective tests each have 50 questions worth 20 points a piece. The math test is weighted more heavily, with 35 questions worth approximately 28.6 points per question. Until 2013, the Super Quiz written test contained 40 questions, each worth 15 points. Depending on the state director, the relay component of Super Quiz contained either 5 or 10 questions, each worth 80 or 40 points respectively. Starting in 2013, the Super Quiz contained only the relay component with 5 or 10 questions, each worth approximately 333.3 or 166.7 questions respectively. The written test was sometimes omitted {{at the state level}} even before 2013 if a state director wished to weigh the Super Quiz Relay more heavily. Perfect scores of 1,000 in events are recorded regularly, and there have been cases of dozens of medal winners for a single event because of perfect and near-perfect scores. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded in each event and for each division (Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity). All tying participants are awarded medals.|$|E
