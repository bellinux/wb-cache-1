40|$|Real {{ecosystems}} {{are influenced by}} random fluctuations of environmental parameters, such as temperature, food resources, migrations, genetic changes. This caused, during last decades, an increasing interest on {{the role played by}} the noise in population dynamics. In systems governed by nonlinear dynamics the presence of noise sources can give rise to counterintuitive phenomena like stochastic resonance, noise enhanced stability, resonant activation, noise delayed extinction. Therefore, the stability of biological systems in the presence of noise sources {{has become one of the}} most relevant topics both in experimental and theoretical investigations on complex systems. In this work we consider the dynamics of three interacting species, two preys and one predator, in the presence of two different kinds of noise sources. To describe the spatial distributions of the species we use a model based on Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations. A correlated dichotomous noise acts on β, the interaction parameter between the two preys, and a multiplicative white noise affects directly the dynamics of each one of the three species. Using low levels of multiplicative noise we analyze the system dynamics for two different values of β, β_down and β_up, which determines respectively the coexistence and exclusion regimes for the system. Successively we consider β as a stochastic process governed by a periodical driving force in the presence of a dichotomous noise. This causes the interaction parameter β to switch quasi-periodically between β_down and β_up. As a consequence, a dynamical regime appears where coexistence and exclusion alternatively take place. In this condition we study the time behaviour of the three species in a single compartment system, for different values of the multiplicative noise intensity. Afterwards we consider a spatially extended system formed by a two-dimensional spatial domain, i. e. a square lattice with N x N sites, and we write the three species equations adding a diffusion term. Then, by applying a mean field approach, we obtain the corresponding moment equations in Gaussian approximation. Within this formalism we get the time behavior of the first and second order moments for different values of the multiplicative noise intensity, according to the procedure followed in the single <b>compartment</b> <b>case...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{project has}} been {{preformed}} as a master degree thesis in the engineering program Ergonomic Design and Production at Luleå University of Technology (LTU). The project was assigned by Volvo Car Corporation (VCC) in Gothenburg and carried out at Cross Design AB. The purpose {{of the project was}} to investigate how storage in the front part of the Volvo models S 80, V 70, XC 70 and XC 90 could be improved and optimised. The project should result in one storage solution concept. The procedure of the project was based on a combined methodology of the Sirius Masterplan Design Process and Systematic Problem Solving. To find the existing needs in car storage a survey was performed on a group of 20 car drivers who represented the target group of potential buyers. To make sure to receive extensive information both questionnaires, interviews and observations were carried out. In order to incorporate inspiration and an overview of the range of products on the market the team carried out a benchmarking of most of the leading car makes in Sweden. Related technologies were also studied to find new angles of approach and {{to increase the number of}} ideas. An analysis of how the car will be used in the future was performed as well as a general trend analysis of peoples life styles and habits. In the surveys it was found that people are spending more and more time in their cars and that it is becoming important to provide for other needs than the traditional. The studied cars are often used for longer trips at work or on vacation. This creates a need for possibilities for storing office equipment and to have easy access to beverage and food. The idea generation was carried out through the methods of brainstorming, categorising and and adjusted form of the Delphi method and resulted in a wide range of storing solutions. To narrow down the project it was decided to focus only on the glove compartment, the area in the middle of the dashboard, and on the area behind the centre stack. Several concepts were put together for each of these areas on the basis of the previously developed ideas. It was decided to proceed with the development of the glove compartment concepts. These were to be applied on the coming XC 90 which has the largest glove compartment volume of VCC’s cars. The glove compartment concepts were compared to previously stated product demands and wishes as well as to each other. The ones with the most innovative ideas and best scores were extracted and supplemented with good ideas from other concepts. The selection specially focused on flexibility, organisation and individualisation possibilities as well as innovation. A combination of concepts ended up with a notch and a case concept, which both could be supplemented with a so called sleigh for easier access. Since both concepts and combinations lived up to the demands the final concept choice was based on calculated scores as well as which was considered to be the most innovative. On these grounds the case concept, called the Glove <b>Compartment</b> <b>Case</b> (GCC), was elected. The GCC consists of two removable cases: one cooling unit and one organised unit. The concept fulfils the wishes of flexibility, organisation and individuality since it allows the user to organise the glove compartment after occasion and stored items.

40|$|In chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL), the microenvironment influences gene expression patterns; however, knowledge is limited regarding {{the extent to which}} methylation changes with time and exposure to specific microenvironments. Using high-resolution 450 K arrays, we provide the most comprehensive DNA methylation study of CLL to date, analyzing paired diagnostic/follow-up samples from IGHV-mutated/untreated and IGHV-unmutated/treated patients (n = 36) and patient-matched peripheral blood and lymph node samples (n = 20). On an unprecedented scale, we revealed 2239 differentially methylated CpG sites between IGHV-mutated and unmutated patients, with the majority of sites positioned outside annotated CpG islands. Intriguingly, CLL prognostic genes (for example, CLLU 1, LPL, ZAP 70 and NOTCH 1), epigenetic regulator (for example, HDAC 9, HDAC 4 and DNMT 3 B), B-cell signaling (for example, IBTK) and numerous TGF-beta and NF-kappa B/TNF pathway genes were alternatively methylated between subgroups. Contrary, DNA methylation over time was deemed rather stable with few recurrent changes noted within subgroups. Although a larger number of non-recurrent changes were identified among IGHV-unmutated relative to mutated cases over time, these equated to a low global change. Similarly, few changes were identified between <b>compartment</b> <b>cases.</b> Altogether, we reveal CLL subgroups to display unique methylation profiles and unveil methylation as relatively stable over time and similar within different CLL compartments, implying aberrant methylation as an early leukemogenic event.

Cases of isolated radiographic lateral compartment knee OA were defined on baseline radiographs as Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) Grade ≥  2 and joint space narrowing (JSN)  >  0 in the lateral compartment and JSN =  0 in the medial compartment; isolated medial compartment knee OA had K/L ≥  2 and JSN >  0 medially with JSN =  0 in the lateral compartment. Controls had K/L <  2 and JSN =  0 in both compartments. Controls were frequency matched to cases by sex and 10 -year age intervals. We characterized the shape of the proximal femurs on radiographs using Active Shape Modeling (ASM) and determined the association of proximal femur shape with knee OA using logistic regression. ResultsThere were 168 lateral <b>compartment</b> knee OA <b>cases</b> (mean body mass index (BMI) 29. 72  ±  5. 26), 169 medial <b>compartment</b> knee OA <b>cases</b> (mean BMI 29. 68  ±  4. 83) and 168 controls (mean BMI 26. 87  ±  4. 2).
