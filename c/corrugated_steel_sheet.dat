50|$|A blister hangar {{is a novel}} arched, {{portable}} {{aircraft hangar}} designed by notable British airport architect Graham R Dawbarn patented by Miskins and Sons in 1939. Originally made of wooden ribs clad with profiled steel sheets, steel lattice ribs and <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> cladding later became the norm. It {{does not require a}} foundation slab and can be anchored to the ground with iron stakes. Numerous examples were manufactured for military use in World War 2 and various different sizes were available. Many found post-war use as agricultural or industrial buildings and some still remain in use on airfields such as Fairoaks, Redhill, Coal Aston and White Waltham today. Denham Aerodrome still uses their blister hangar to house the only fixed wing flying school on the field, The Pilot Centre.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThin-walled {{cold formed}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> with embossments, used in {{composite}} steel concrete slab, {{is a modern}} and effective construction. The steel sheet {{is used as a}} permanent formwork and as a load bearing member after hardening of concrete as well. The prestressed embossments are crucial to ensure a composite action. However, its load bearing capacity is influenced by many factors and {{it is not possible to}} be determined without using expensive and time consuming tests of the whole slab in laboratory. This paper is focused on composite action using this type of shear connection and its behaviour under different types of loading. Four-point bending tests and vacuum tests were performed on the whole span slab. Additional small-scale shear test help us to understand the shear behaviour of thin-walled steel sheet in ultimate limit state. The data from the tests make possible to set up and calibrate numerical models. These models can then facilitate pointing out the main factors which influence the load bearing capacity of this type of structure...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{performance}} of {{light gauge steel}} framed (LSF) walls sheathed with gypsum plasterboards has been investigated using experimental and numerical studies by many researchers in the past. Provision of cavity or external insulation, improving the thermal-mechanical properties of plasterboard, and changing the stud geometry are several options previously employed to enhance the Fire Resistance Level (FRL) of such wall systems. Past studies of steel sheathed cold-formed steel (CFS) framed walls {{have shown that the}} use of steel sheathing improves the shear strength of LSF walls. However, such studies have not investigated the possible improvements to the fire {{performance of}} LSF walls due to the use of steel sheathing in addition to plasterboards. This numerical study investigates the thermal performance of three common LSF wall configurations sheathed with steel sheets on both sides under fire conditions. Three steel sheathing configurations (internal and/or external sheathing) were considered for each LSF wall. Thermal Finite Element (FE) models were developed and used to simulate the heat progression across the walls, following validation using previous experimental studies. The walls were exposed to ISO 834 - 1 standard fire curve on one side. Results were then compared with those from LSF walls sheathed only with plasterboards. Internal steel sheathing was found to be capable of reducing the ambient side temperatures compared to plasterboard only walls due to the lower emissivity of steel, whereas external steel sheathing increased them further. Although the stud hot flange (HF) temperatures are generally increased with the addition of steel sheets, provision of back-blocking was able to eliminate this deficiency. A novel arrangement is proposed for back-blocking which is found to significantly delay the stud temperature rise and improve the FRL. The use of <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> profiles is found to reduce both the stud and ambient side plasterboard temperatures. The results from this study give useful information to develop load bearing and non-load bearing LSF walls with superior fire performance. This paper presents the details of this numerical study and the results...|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} ‘The Behaviour Of Profiled Steel Sheet Folded Plate Structure With Door Opening’ {{was carried out}} in the Civil Engineering Laboratory. The {{selected}} profiled steel sheets for the testing are namely called ‘Bondek II’ (<b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet)</b> and the specimen models was made by BHP Steel Building Products (M) Sdn. Bhd. Shah Alam. The Bondek II steel sheeting is roll-formed from hotdipped, zinc coated, and chromate passivated high-strength grade BHP Zinc Hi- Ten steel strip. Bondek II (corrugated sheet) has sheet thickness t = 1 mm, depth of fold /* = 54 mm, sheet width a = 600 mm and length of models is / = 1000 mm. A compressive test was carried on the Bondek II specimen models. The experimental investigation was on four full-scale models of profiled sheet subjected to in-plane axial compressive loading, P. The model tested included two models without door opening. The size of door opening is 180 mm width and 700 mm height which has been converted from the standard door size of 900 mm width x 2100 mm (3 ft x 7 ft). The results of specimens without opening obtained from the experimental work are used as guide to the specimens with door opening. The parameters measured and determined are lateral deflection, buckling and ultimate load capacity. From the experimental test, the load displacement curve and stress-strain pattern was plotted and identified. From this study, the ultimate load capacity of compressed profiled steel with door opening was identified to be smaller than that without opening. This may be because the opening reduced the carrying capacity of the models. The openings also tend to increase the deflection of the models. The specimen with opening is noticed to buckle much faster than without opening. It was also found that the buckling shape occurred at different location for each specimen. The average ultimate load capacity for the specimens without opening determined from the experimental test carried out is 159. 95 kN and the ultimate load capacity for the specimens with door opening is 109. 15 kN. The average percentage different of ultimate load between specimens without opening and with opening is approximately 32 percent...|$|E
