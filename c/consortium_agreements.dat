30|$|Sponsors and {{principal}} investigators of international collaborations, {{such as the}} Centre for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI) and Grand Challenges in Global Health (GCGH) Initiative, typically hail from affluent countries. These parties usually assume the responsibility for drafting and driving data sharing or <b>consortium</b> <b>agreements.</b> Intellectual Property (IP) regulatory and guidance frameworks typically have a European or North American basis. Moreover, there is often no or poor intellectual property expertise available to consortium partners from developing countries. Accordingly, data sharing or <b>consortium</b> <b>agreements</b> drafted by PIs or sponsors from affluent countries are sometimes perceived by consortium partners in developing countries as being biased in favour {{of the interests of}} their consortium partners from the developed world. PIs from affluent countries should accordingly ensure that their colleagues from the developing world are prospectively involved in the drafting of consortium or data-sharing agreements. Such an approach could see data access and research output issues explicitly and meaningfully governed. Such an agreement should describe the management of intellectual property rights related to the proposed project, including plans for sharing data, information, and materials resulting from the award. The policy must also clearly govern the timing and means of data release, and any constraints on release.

40|$|Organisations {{collaborate}} with one another. And {{they appear to}} do so more and more frequently in the recent decades. At the same time many of these efforts fail to deliver what the collaboration was set up for. This combination creates {{the basis for the}} fascinating and stimulating research field of inter-organisational relations – a field which is still very much in development. In this thesis the focus is on meta-organisations, associations in which organisations are members. The steering of such inter-organisational structures appears to need a novel approach, a collective, multi-level engagement which I set out to examine. The thesis is structured to foreground the process of the research and the development of my thinking. The study is conducted on R&D consortia funded as Networks of Excellence by the European Commission under Framework Programme 6. The study is based primarily on five case studies, by way of documentation and interviews. In addition, the study draws on data collected on 101 consortia and <b>consortium</b> <b>agreements</b> from 50 consortia. The thesis develops the theoretical understanding of meta-organisations and their organisational conditions and implications. Meta-organisation theory, thus far, has focused mainly on the implications following from having organisations as members. This thesis suggests adding to this theory the implications created by constitutional membership, that is, members that constitute the organisation. Constitutional membership makes a difference in three ways: it creates a clear boundary of the meta-organisation; it assumes collective ownership of the meta-organisation; and it makes possible the utilising of indirect resources – the resources of the member organisations, and most importantly their personnel – by the meta-organisation. In addition, the thesis develops a conceptual framework of steering processes, combining governance, management and administration. This framework shows how both decisions and mutual adjustment in top-down, bottom-up, and horizontal directions steer meta-organisations. The framework may, however, be fruitfully used to study other organisations as well. The findings from the analysis of the steering processes show that the utilisation of indirect resources decentralises the governance, management and administration of activities to the participants of member organisations who are undertaking these activities. The results also demonstrate that the governance, management and administration of undivided tasks centralises to those with formal management responsibility. In addition, the analysis shows how control and granting are avoided, externalised or formalised to deal with lack of hierarchical authority. These and other findings of the study seek to refine and extend the hypothesised conditions of meta-organisation theory...|$|E

30|$|The legal {{organisation}} of multi-constituent revenue-seeking endeavours {{not only}} matters, but remains—for {{a large number}} of reasons (among others, predictability, enforceability, participation rights and responsibilities, resource allocation, asset partitioning, and the accounting, distribution and taxation of profits)—a core necessity for efficient collective productivity. Legal organisation happens—either proactively and by design (i.e. through proper advance planning) or reactively and by default (i.e. through post-investment statutory or common-law ‘gap-filling’ of incomplete contracts). Accordingly, for the current purpose of conceptualising triple helix intermediation organisationally, this article posits, as a secondary systems-theoretical hypothesis and assumption, that efficient triple helix trilateral network collaboration in action also critically requires an internal sphere- 1 intermediator ‘meeting platform’ (Suvinen et al. 2010 : 1369) which, as an institutionalised legal substructure specifically and exclusively works the interstitial spaces of a given triple helix trilateral network. To date, such organisational function has not been accomplished (nor been sufficiently analysed) from a legal perspective. Rather, it appears that the legal organisation of university-industry-government collaborations is pre-dominantly adapted from contractual, market-based mechanisms traditionally used for ‘simple [commercial and arm’s-length] supply-chain collaborations’ (Fitjar et al. 2014 : 2). For example, in the UK, the so-called Lambert toolkit, which has been in place since 2005 (Andersen et al. 2013; Eggington et al. 2013), is intended ‘for universities and companies that wish to undertake collaborative research projects with each other’ (UK Intellectual Property Office 2014) and ‘to help [the] potential collaborators negotiate deals, lower the transaction costs of the negotiations, and provide examples of best practice’ (Wrobel 2013). The toolkit includes five bilateral model research collaboration agreements, four multilateral model <b>consortium</b> <b>agreements,</b> a decision guide, and related guidance materials (UK Intellectual Property Office 2014). A 2013 research study (Eggington et al. 2013) commissioned by the UK Intellectual Property Office in order to empirically test awareness, adoption and overall utility of the Lambert toolkit among British universities and industry reported that the toolkit ‘is most suitable [only] for a minority of university-business interactions,’ further concluded that ‘industrial support for the toolkit has been lacking [because] large companies are more likely to view the Lambert agreements as biased towards universities,’ and finally estimated that ‘less than 10 or 15  % by value of collaborative research between universities and business in the UK is based on a Lambert-like agreement’ (Eggington et al. 2013 : 3 – 4; see also Andersen et al. (2013 : 45)). In other words, the UK government’s contract-based and market-paradigmed solution to the intermediation of university-industry collaborations turned out to be ‘little used[,] seen as straightjacketing relationships between industry and academics, rather than enabling and supporting them[, and] not support[ing] open innovation’ (Wrobel 2013).|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in academic library consortia has recently grown: {{this seems to}} indicate the necessity of collaboration for academic libraries, particularly in spite of increasing costs of collection materials and electronic resources. Furthermore, libraries now need new guidelines for conducting cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses and benchmarks for making decisions. Instruments and practices are needed to assess whether users are really satisfied with the resources libraries provide. Academic libraries need more and more reliable, comparative, quantitative baseline data across disciplines and institutions as a context for interpreting qualitative and quantitative data, {{in order to understand}} what is happening locally and how to improve services. Given for granted the importance of such issues, this research intends to focus on the use of a library consortium service, the Emeroteca Virtuale, at the University of Calabria, Italy. The purpose is also to better understand users’ satisfaction with this particular consortium service and their expectations as regards the library system’s electronic services. A short, introductory but important analysis is reported in this research, concerning the online services that some main editors provide users with. This allows the reader to better understand the state-of-the-art of online services related to e-journals. Some details are given in this research, underlining the most important services currently available on the international market for both researchers and librarians. Then, after having defined a literature review, in order to get usable results both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used, according to the observing and questioning technique so to obtain triangulation. For each methodology that was used, purposes, advantages and limitations for this research are clearly stated. First of all, after a focus group that meant to gather illuminative and generalized data, a questionnaire was carefully prepared and then submitted to patrons, choosing a sample made of 1, 350 people. The questionnaire, composed of twenty questions, was submitted both on person (meeting people, not only at libraries but also at laboratories, faculty departments and other places around the campus) and via e-mail. Then, twenty of them were also interviewed and important findings were gathered. Quotes from users are reported in this research, showing feelings and observations that will certainly help us to better manage a future change in the e-journals service provision at our campus. The questionnaire’s response rate was quite good (41. 48 %), as 560 people over 1, 350 answered the questionnaire. This research shows how, notwithstanding a good familiarity xii with the Library System web page (43 % of users), 64 % of respondents do not use the Emeroteca Virtuale in their study or research activity. Frequency of use, as well as reasons for use and non use of this tool were investigated and results are reported in this research, which also shows what are the main problems users face while performing their searches in the Emeroteca Virtuale. Furthermore, thanks to this research, we now know what kind of suggestions users can give in order to improve the use of the Emeroteca Virtuale, while their research habits were investigated. The questionnaire also intended to measure users’ satisfaction with the services provided by the Emeroteca Virtuale and to evaluate the impact on users of some initiatives that the Library System could propose. Results reported in this research are quite interesting and they demonstrate not only that users are interested in having more journal titles available and an improved service for remote access, but also that they would be particularly satisfied if more information and more training on the use of electronic tools were provided at the libraries. What is more, a usability test was performed, involving 5 people from different categories, in order to assess the ease of use and the usefulness of the Emeroteca Virtuale. The participant observation intended to focus on this digital tool, while comments from users were carefully noticed by the researcher, outlining users’ behaviour while performing the scheduled three different tasks. Furthermore, the number of clicks of the mouse and time needed to perform each task were also measured. Finally, a post-test questionnaire was submitted and results show that most users find it easy to perform searches in the Emeroteca Virtuale. The final analysis led to the drawing up of logical findings and conclusions based on data. Results of the whole investigation are reported using graphs and citing quotes from interviewed users, adding a qualitative perspective to the research. Results finally allow us to define the level of users’ satisfaction with the electronic services at our campus and, in particular, with the Emeroteca Virtuale. Recommendations for further research are also given, together with a definition of the limitations of this research. Finally, since no previous study had been done at our University, this work can be considered useful in order to fill the gap and is a good starting point for further improvements:we know our patrons deeper and we are now prepared to manage new changes to improve access to e-journals at our campus especially through <b>consortium</b> <b>agreements,</b> as well as to improve new services in order to meet users’ satisfaction...|$|E
