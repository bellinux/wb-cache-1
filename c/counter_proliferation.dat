25|$|One of {{the very}} {{interesting}} features of Indo-USA relations of recent times is the changes on the terms of engagement {{between the two countries}} on the issue of nuclear proliferation. While earlier, in the USA strategic thinking on nuclear proliferation, India figured mainly because of American concern about latter's nuclear and missile programmes, in the twenty-first century, however, American strategic thinking on the issue of nuclear proliferation has undergone major reorientation. Now, the Americans are increasingly realising the futility of insisting on a rollback of India's nuclear programme.

50|$|CEDS {{is caused}} by {{homozygous}} mutations in caspase-8. Caspase-8 is a 51 kb gene with 13 exons encoding for a 496 amino acid protein that maps to 2q33.1. Caspase-8 {{is involved in the}} initiation of the cell death signal cascade. Cell death <b>counters</b> <b>proliferation</b> of lymphocytes, allowing the immune system to achieve dynamic homeostasis whereby it can defend against pathogens and avoid autoimmunity. The two reported siblings have C>T transitions, causing R248W loss-of-function mutations in the gene. The mutations lead to functional caspase-8 deficiency by destabilizing the caspase-8 protein and inactivating its enzymatic capacity.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn p 53 -dependent {{apoptosis}} {{in response}} to genotoxic and hypoxic stress, a fraction of induced wild-type p 53 rapidly translocates to mitochondria, triggering a rapid first wave of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis that is later fortified by the transcriptional program of p 53. However, whether this direct mitochondrial program also occurs upon oncogenic stress is unknown. In normal cells, oncogenic signals can induce a p 53 -dependent fail-safe mechanism to <b>counter</b> uncontrolled <b>proliferation</b> by engaging p 53 -dependent apoptosis. To address whether mitochondrial p 53 contributes to oncogene-induced fail-safe apoptosis, p 53 translocation was determined in primary human epithelial and endothelial cells overexpressing c-Myc, E 1 A or E 2 F 1. Serum starvation of these cells, but not of control cells, triggered rapid p 53 accumulation at mitochondria, accompanied by cytochrome c and SMAC release and followed by apoptosis. Our data establishes {{the contribution of the}} transcription-independent mitochondrial p 53 pathway to apoptosis of primary cells {{in response to}} deregulated oncogenes...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. This thesis analyzes the potential effectiveness of preventive war, preventive strikes, and interdiction as tools for the United States to <b>counter</b> the <b>proliferation</b> {{of weapons of}} mass destruction (WMD). Examination of these three counterproliferation techniques is important because the George W. Bush administration has given more prominence to military operations to deal with WMD threats. Six historical cases of preventive war, preventive strikes, and interdiction, against adversarial WMD programs are examined to show the conditions that make military options desirable and effective and the issues that make their implementation difficult. These case studies reveal that interdiction and preventive strikes are viable and can be effective under very limited legal, political, and military circumstances. Although the United States successfully conducted a preventive war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, this strategy is not likely to succeed in the cases of Iran and North Korea.

The Regulation includes the so-called “EU dual-use control list” integrating the lists of dual-use items defined by the international regimes and requires also the control on intangible technology transfers as foreseen by UN Security Council Resolution 1540.

40|$|This paper explores issues {{arising from}} the recent {{published}} inquiries into aspects of British intelligence assessment procedures on WMD threats. Drawing on the Butler and Hutton inquiries, and on interviews with former officials, it concludes that {{the process by which}} the Cabinet Office Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) was drawn into producing an intelligence assessment for publication in September 2002 was a new departure in British government. It also argues that the drafting exercise disclosed by the Hutton and Butler inquiries was, incidentally if not deliberately, one in which two fundamentally distinct processes became entangled: what was published as an unvarnished professional intelligence assessment – in essence a conventional JIC assessment for once brought immediately into the public domain - was compromised by the government’s presentational imperatives. This paper will be followed by a second reflecting on the difficulties faced by the wider international community in judging what weight to put on evidence produced by the world’s major intelligence powers to argue for particular courses of action to <b>counter</b> WMD <b>proliferation,</b> terrorism, and other threats to international security and order.
