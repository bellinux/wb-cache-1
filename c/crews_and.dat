5|$|These four boats {{remained}} under {{commission in}} the German Imperial Navy, retained German <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> commanders, and received {{orders from the}} German flotilla commander at Pola.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} attack there {{followed}} {{several hours of}} quiet as Nos. 10 and 11 Groups and Luftflotte 2 and 3 recovered. On {{both sides of the}} Channel, unit commanders now phoned round to establish whether missing <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> aircraft had landed safely elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had five}} <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> 68 passengers on board. Four <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> 62 passengers were {{killed at the}} accident. One <b>crew</b> member <b>and</b> six passengers survived.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had three}} <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> eight passengers on board. All <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> passengers {{lost their lives}} at the crash.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} had 7 <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> 60 {{passengers on}} board. 47 passengers were killed, all the <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> 13 passengers survived the accident with injuries.|$|R
5|$|Manning Camp Campground is {{the main}} staging area for firefighters, trail-maintenance <b>crews,</b> <b>and</b> {{scientists}} working in the RMD. Their supplies are brought in by pack mules that are kept in corrals at the site. Runoff from a nearby spring, the largest in Rincons, provides water for the livestock.|$|E
5|$|The Glorious First of June {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} the major problems inherent in the French and British navies {{at the start of the}} Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded <b>crews,</b> <b>and</b> they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square before it is re-opened to the public the following morning. Few traces of the previous night's celebration remain after the cleanup process is completed: following the 2013â€“14 drop, the New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that by 8:00a.m., it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square, using 190 workers from their own <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> the Times Square Alliance.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of the accident, there were 14 <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> 108 {{passengers}} on board. The aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair. 2 cockpit <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> 9 passengers (all non-Japanese) were reported injured.|$|R
50|$|In {{artillery}} batteries, {{the firing}} platoon consists of six artillery sections, each containing one gun with its <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> prime mover (i.e., a truck to tow the artillery piece and transport the gun <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> baggage).|$|R
5|$|Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an {{effective}} method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and expensive {{for the protection of}} civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may also be used for high-altitude parachute jumps.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.|$|E
5|$|Hip-hop {{dance is}} not a studio-derived style. Street dancers {{developed}} it in urban neighborhoods without a formal process. All of the early substyles and social dances were brought about {{through a combination of}} events including inspiration from James Brown, DJ Kool Herc's invention of the break beat, the formation of dance <b>crews,</b> <b>and</b> Don Cornelius' creation of the television show Soul Train.|$|E
50|$|The inquiry heard {{testimony}} from {{a total of}} 61 witnesses: 24 <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> officers of Empress of Ireland (including Captain Kendall); 12 <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> officers of Storstad (including Captain Andersen); 5 passengers of Empress of Ireland; and 20 other persons including 2 divers, 2 Marconi Operators at Father Point, 2 naval architects, the Harbour Master at Quebec, <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> officers of several other ships whose involvement {{either directly or indirectly}} was deemed pertinent.|$|R
50|$|The all {{volunteer}} <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> {{staff of}} 400 people, represent over 60 different countries. Unlike the crew during her original {{use as a}} car ferry, <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> staff normally join the organisation to live on board for two years as volunteers.|$|R
50|$|An initial {{investigation}} by the United States Shipping Commissioners indicated the Admiral Sampson was carrying 55 passengers <b>and</b> 65 <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> that eight <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> three passengers were killed. Later reports corrected the tally to seven passengers killed of 160 aboard, and 16 total deaths.|$|R
5|$|In 1785 Barbary pirates, {{most notably}} from Algiers, began to seize American {{merchant}} {{vessels in the}} Mediterranean. In 1793 alone, eleven American ships were captured and their <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> stores held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the Naval Act of 1794. The act provided funds to construct six frigates, but included a clause that if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers, {{the construction of the}} ships would be halted.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced {{crews were}} siphoned off to Malta, to undertake ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942. The leftover crews, some 75 percent, were {{far off the}} 200 operational hours considered for a pilot to be experienced. Efficiency fell among squadrons. The mixing of experienced <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> the inexperienced damaged morale and accident rates increased.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 1954 {{the airline}} began {{international}} flights, carrying 18 passengers from Tokyo to San Francisco on a Douglas DC-6B City of Tokyo via Wake Island and Honolulu. The flights between Tokyo and San Francisco are still Flights 1 and 2, to commemorate its first international service. The early flights were advertised as being operated by American <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> serviced by United Air Lines in San Francisco.|$|E
5000|$|Shaun Parkes as George Merry, {{a former}} member of Flint's <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> {{boatswain}} (and later mate) of the Hispaniola and a mutineer. In the book he is a simple crewman (although also {{a former member}} of Flint's <b>crew)</b> <b>and</b> leads the discontent against Silver's leadership.|$|R
50|$|Experts {{believe that}} the {{accident}} may {{have been caused by}} weak coordination between ATC, the tow truck <b>crew,</b> <b>and</b> Flight 7703's <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> stated that if Flight 7703 was travelling at high speed, the incident could have been similar to the Tenerife Airport disaster in 1977.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Dougal has {{encountered}} the television <b>crew,</b> <b>and</b> because Ted has {{told them that}} he is the island's only priest, they assume he is Father Ted. From his elevated position, Ted sees Dougal being interviewed by the TV <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> is so dismayed that he falls off.|$|R
5|$|On November2, {{following}} an investigation, President Corazon Aquino ordered Sulpicio Lines temporarily closed {{while the government}} was asked to inspect the company's <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> ships. Company officials felt that the indefinite closing was unfair and argued it would disrupt shipping across the island nation, and that the inspection can take place without shutting the entire company down. Typhoon Ruby {{was the first of}} three tropical cyclones to affect the island chain in a span of a mere two weeks; Ruby was followed by Tropical Storm Tess and Typhoon Skip in early November1988.|$|E
5|$|Operation Chronicle, the {{landings}} at Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands, was the VII Amphibious Force's first operation, presented {{no great}} difficulty as the islands {{were known to}} be unoccupied. However half the assault troops experienced seasickness, problems were encountered with clearing the sand bar at the entrance to Guasopa Harbor, and Barbey's decision to land at night and withdraw before dawn in order to avoid encountering Japanese aircraft highlighted the inexperience of his <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> deficiencies in their training. Unloading activities on the coral-fringed Kiriwina dragged on for a fortnight.|$|E
5|$|Royal Navy Lynxes {{worked in}} {{combination}} with US Seahawks during the Gulf War. The American helicopters lacked an effective anti-ship missile, but had superior surveillance capability compared to the British Lynx. They would locate hostile boats for the British helicopters, which would then attack the target with its Sea Skua missiles. In total, Lynx helicopters flew nearly 600sorties during the Gulf War, while their <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> engineers maintained flying rates three times their norm.|$|E
50|$|Officially, out of 73 {{officers}} <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> 191 passengers, only 46 {{were rescued}} (16 <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> 30 passengers), while 217 died. The exact number remains unknown since, at the time, it was customary {{to board the}} ship without a ticket, which would be issued upon sailing.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the laboratories and technical resources, JOIDES Resolution contains a conference room, offices, cabins {{for members of the}} <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> science parties, a galley and mess hall. A gym, movie room, and lounge with a small library are provided for recreation of the <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> science teams.|$|R
2500|$|Ares I was {{the crew}} launch {{component}} of the Constellation program. Originally named the [...] "Crew Launch Vehicle" [...] or CLV, the Ares name was chosen from the Greek deity Ares. Unlike the Space Shuttle, where both <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> cargo were launched simultaneously on the same rocket, the plans for Project Constellation outlined having two separate launch vehicles, the Ares I and the Ares V, for <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> cargo, respectively. Having two separate launch vehicles allows for more specialized designs for the <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> heavy cargo launch rockets.|$|R
5|$|Several Gemini Ferry {{spacecraft}} were {{proposed to}} provide transportation of <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> cargo to NASA and USAF space stations in low Earth orbit. NASA contracted McDonnell {{to conduct a}} study into what modifications {{would be needed to}} allow the Gemini spacecraft to support this. Three spacecraft were envisioned; a manned spacecraft to transport crew to the stations, a manned spacecraft with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned spacecraft to resupply the station every three or four months.|$|E
5|$|The Fat Man {{design was}} {{tested in the}} Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. Project Y {{personnel}} formed pit <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> assembly teams for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and participated in the bombing as weaponeers and observers. After the war ended, the laboratory supported the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. A new Z Division was created to control testing, stockpiling and bomb assembly activities, which were concentrated at Sandia Base. The Los Alamos Laboratory became Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The RNLI's {{lifeboat}} <b>crews</b> <b>and</b> lifeguards {{have saved}} more than 140,000 lives since 1824. The RNLI makes {{a distinction between}} people aided and lives saved. There were 8,462 lifeboat launches in 2014, rescuing 8,727 people, including saving 460 lives. Lifeguards helped or rescued 19,353 people. Flood rescuers deployed seven times. In 2015 crews rescued on average 22 people a day.|$|E
