5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, <b>consuming</b> alcohol near bedtime, and <b>consuming</b> large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, {{but it also has}} been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} are {{disturbed}} {{by the appearance of}} lentigines, cryosurgery may be beneficial. Due to the large number of lentigines this may prove time <b>consuming.</b> An alternative treatment with tretinoin or hydroquinone creams may help.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{researchers}} reported that adding {{large amounts of}} zinc to a urine sample masked detection of drugs. The researchers did not test whether orally <b>consuming</b> a zinc dietary supplement could have the same effect.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{rather than}} being predatory, tiger attacks on human seem to be {{territorial}} in nature. At least in one case, a tigress with cubs killed eight people entering her territory without <b>consuming</b> them at all.|$|E
5|$|Services are inseparable; {{the act of}} {{supplying}} {{a service}} is inseparable from the customer's act of <b>consuming</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Two {{elderly people}} {{developed}} a transient pancreatitis after <b>consuming</b> L. volemus in central Anatolia in Turkey. Both had eaten the mushroom, which they knew as Tirmit, many times before. The condition resolved spontaneously.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} {{can act as}} one or {{all three of these}} components at the same time. The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is not involved in the processing of the specified calculation. Xgrid is targeted towards time <b>consuming</b> computations that can be easily segregated into smaller tasks, sometimes called embarrassingly parallel tasks. This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps.|$|E
5|$|A {{criticism}} of New Age often made by leftists {{is that its}} focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism. This perspective regards New Age {{as a manifestation of}} consumerism which promotes elitism and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through <b>consuming</b> New Age products and therapies.|$|E
5|$|After the {{retirement}} of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, the Davis Cup team was now dependent on Murray having to win three matches, though Henman had told him how wearing and time <b>consuming</b> that can be. While the LTA was funding Brad Gilbert, Murray was obligated to play for his country, but in November, Murray finished with Brad Gilbert as his coach.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and <b>consuming</b> the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by <b>consuming</b> fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid <b>consuming</b> blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous. The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, {{but because of the}} nature of the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than one type of mushroom consumed.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the most}} frugivorous {{members of the}} family Lemuridae, <b>consuming</b> an average of 74–90% fruit, ruffed lemurs also consume nectar (4–21%), and {{supplement}} the rest of their diet with young leaves (3–6%), mature leaves (1%), flowers (3–6%), and some seeds. Ruffed lemurs have also been reported to come to the ground to eat fungi and exhibit geophagy.|$|E
5|$|Blood lead {{concentrations}} in poisoning victims {{have ranged from}} 30->80µg/dL in children exposed to lead paint in older houses, 77–104µg/dL in persons working with pottery glazes, 90–137µg/dL in individuals <b>consuming</b> contaminated herbal medicines, 109–139µg/dL in indoor shooting range instructors and as high as 330µg/dL in those drinking fruit juices from glazed earthenware containers.|$|E
5|$|Both Innocence and Innocence R {{focus on}} Luca, a merchant's son who {{encounters}} a fugitive named Illia. In rescuing her, he discovers he has inherited supernatural powers {{from his past}} life. He teams up with Illia and multiple others who have gained similar powers from past lives. The group {{become involved in the}} wars <b>consuming</b> the world, along with events pertaining to their past lives and the future of their world.|$|E
5|$|Coimbre died on November 4, 1989, when he {{was trapped}} in a house fire. The fire {{originated}} in the house's kitchen while he was cooking, <b>consuming</b> the structures wooden frame. When Coimbre tried to escape {{he was unable to}} open the front door, because he had locked it with a padlock.|$|E
5|$|Feral zerg are zerg {{not under}} the control of any higher entity. These zerg will simply devolve into predatory behavior: acting on the lowest {{intellectual}} level, <b>consuming</b> other animals for nourishment, attack everything around them. Control can be re-asserted over feral zerg by a Broodmother or other command strains however.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} heavy metals, including toxic ones, from polluted soil. For this reason, <b>consuming</b> mushrooms {{harvested from}} potentially contaminated sites—such as near roadsides subject to heavy traffic—is not recommended. In a Turkish study of various edible mushroom species collected from lawns, near roads, {{and the inner}} parts of forests, the fruit bodies of L.sanguifluus were determined to have accumulated high levels of zinc, manganese, nickel, cobalt, cadmium, and lead.|$|E
5|$|Hensley's theology, {{with the}} {{exception}} of his snake handling, was typical of other fundamentalist Pentecostal churches. His teachings on personal holiness bore a resemblance to doctrines of the Wesleyan Holiness tradition. In his sermons he condemned a number of practices as sinful, including gambling, <b>consuming</b> alcohol, wearing lipstick, and playing baseball.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Atari Inc. {{released}} {{their version}} of Namco's hit arcade game Pac-Man for its Atari 2600 video game console. Like the original arcade version, the player controls the title character with a joystick. The object is to traverse a maze, <b>consuming</b> all the wafers within while avoiding four ghosts.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Barr {{revealed}} she {{has been}} diagnosed with both macular degeneration and glaucoma, and thus is gradually losing her eyesight and expects to eventually go blind; she is <b>consuming</b> medical marijuana to decrease her intraocular pressure that is a feature of these diseases.|$|E
5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} navigates {{a series of}} {{two-dimensional}} planes with an aquatic microorganism that evolves by <b>consuming</b> other microorganisms. The game's design is based on Chen's research into dynamic difficulty adjustment at the University of Southern California, and on psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theoretical concept of mental immersion or flow. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 22, 2007.|$|E
5|$|In general, blue-staining red-pored boletes {{should be}} avoided for consumption. Thiers warned this species may be toxic after being alerted to severe {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms in one who had merely tasted it. Years later, in 1994, a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus and the husband died as a result. A subsequent autopsy revealed {{that the man had}} suffered an infarction of the midgut. Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated in the death of someone <b>consuming</b> it, It is known to contain low levels of muscarine, a peripheral nervous system toxin. until 2005. A report from Australia records a fatality from muscarinic syndrome after <b>consuming</b> a mushroom from the genus Rubinoboletus.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by <b>consuming</b> nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants {{on the surface of the}} ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E
5|$|Many pets {{have escaped}} or been {{released}} into the Everglades from the surrounding urban areas. Some find the conditions quite favorable and have established self-sustaining populations, competing for food and space with native animals. Many tropical fish have been released, but blue tilapias (Oreochromis aureus) cause damage to shallow waterways by creating large nests and <b>consuming</b> aquatic plants that protect native young fish.|$|E
5|$|Marceline's father moves {{throughout}} Ooo, <b>consuming</b> {{the souls}} of all living creatures that he can find. Finn and Marceline first try to crush him with a rock, but the resulting skirmish between father and daughter merely infuriates Hunson Abadeer. He assumes that Marceline is trying to kill him {{to take over the}} Nightosphere, but she merely wants her bass guitar back.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets vary {{in their}} diets; some like the tawny mole cricket are herbivores, others are omnivores, feeding on larvae, worms, roots, and grasses, and others like the {{southern}} mole cricket are mainly predacious. As well as <b>consuming</b> roots underground, mole crickets leave their burrows at night to forage for leaves and stems which they drag underground before consumption.|$|E
5|$|Non-native plants {{sometimes}} threaten {{native species}} by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most {{commonly found in}} areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, {{both of which are}} time <b>consuming</b> and expensive.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2004, the {{principal}} use of palladium in jewelry was {{the manufacture of}} white gold. In early 2004, when gold and platinum prices rose steeply, China began fabricating volumes of palladium jewelry, <b>consuming</b> 37 tonnes in 2005. Changes in the relative price of platinum after 2008 lowered demand for palladium to 17.4 tonnes in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Shiva – The main {{character}} in the story. He is a Tibetan immigrant to Meluha and {{the chief of the}} Guna tribe. On arriving in Meluha and <b>consuming</b> the Somras (a potion), his throat turns blue making him the Neelkanth of the Meluhan legend, which speaks of the appearance of Neelkanth as a destroyer of evil. The Meluhans end up believing that Shiva would be their saviour.|$|E
5|$|Space is also crisscrossed with {{continuum}} fluxes, coordinate pairs {{that allow}} instantaneous travel between them without <b>consuming</b> fuel. Travel via fluxes cuts down significantly on fuel costs and travel time, though it causes {{all but the}} most accomplished navigators to lose their bearings.|$|E
5|$|Tales of supernatural beings <b>consuming</b> {{the blood}} or {{flesh of the}} living {{have been found in}} nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. The term vampire did not exist in ancient times. Blood {{drinking}} and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire.|$|E
5|$|The Pangaré Brumbies {{appear to}} have adapted well to their coastal environment, where they are <b>consuming</b> saltbush, which they {{do not appear to}} be damaging. The Department of Environment and Conservation and the Outback Heritage Horse Association of Western Australia (OHHAWA) are {{monitoring}} these particular Brumbies to ensure the careful management of these unusual feral horses.|$|E
5|$|The pudús are herbivorous, <b>consuming</b> vines, {{leaves from}} low trees, shrubs, {{succulent}} sprouts, herbs, ferns, blossoms, buds, tree bark, and fallen fruit. They can survive without drinking water {{for long periods}} due to the high water content of the succulent foliage in their diets.|$|E
5|$|The snoring rail catches crabs in {{highland}} streams, {{and these}} crustaceans {{may be a}} major dietary item. It also forages in muddy areas, and has been recorded as <b>consuming</b> lizards. Nothing is known of its breeding behaviour other than a report of an adult seen feeding with two chicks in August 1983, but the original report gives no details of the claimed sighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} has been hunted for its body parts {{for use in}} {{traditional}} medicine, for amusement, and for sport, though this is rare, as the species is generally not considered attractive. There is fossil evidence of humans in Middle Pleistocene Europe butchering and presumably <b>consuming</b> spotted hyenas. Such incidences are rare in modern Africa, where most tribes, even those known to eat unusual kinds of meat, generally despise hyena flesh.|$|E
