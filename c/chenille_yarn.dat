5000|$|According to textile historians, chenille-type yarn is {{a recent}} invention, dating to the 18th century and {{believed}} to have originated in France. The original technique involved weaving a [...] "leno" [...] fabric and then cutting the fabric into strips to make the <b>chenille</b> <b>yarn.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chenille</b> <b>yarn</b> is {{manufactured}} by placing short lengths of yarn, called the [...] "pile", between two [...] "core yarns" [...] and then twisting the yarn together. The edges of these piles then stand {{at right angles}} to the yarnâ€™s core, giving chenille both its softness and its characteristic look. Chenille will look different in one direction compared to another, as the fibers catch the light differently. Chenille can appear iridescent without actually using iridescent fibers. The yarn is commonly manufactured from cotton, but can also be made using acrylic, rayon and olefin.|$|E
5000|$|Standards of {{industrial}} production were not introduced until the 1990s, when the Chenille International Manufacturers Association (CIMA) was formed {{with the mission}} to improve and develop the manufacturing processes. [...] From the 1970s each machine head made two chenille yarns straight onto bobbins, a machine could have over 100 spindles (50 heads). Giesse {{was one of the}} first major machine manufacturers. Giesse acquired Iteco company in 2010 integrating the <b>chenille</b> <b>yarn</b> electronic quality control directly on their machine. Chenille fabrics are also often used in Letterman jackets also known as [...] "varsity jackets", for the letter patches.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{examines}} the twist design of <b>chenille</b> <b>yarns</b> from theoretical consideration. Four kind of <b>chenille</b> <b>yarns</b> {{were selected for}} practice validation. The results indicate {{that there was little}} deviation between the twist under theoretical approach and the actual tested values; linear density of centre yarn and pile yarn, pile yarn density have significant effects on the twist design of <b>chenille</b> <b>yarns...</b>|$|R
50|$|One of the {{problems}} with <b>chenille</b> <b>yarns</b> is that the tufts can work loose and create bare fabric. This was resolved by using a low melt nylon in the core of the yarn and then autoclaving (steaming) the hanks of yarn to set the pile in place.|$|R
50|$|The soft, fuzzy {{surface of}} <b>chenille</b> <b>yarns,</b> which {{resemble}} pipe cleaners in appearance, {{can be created}} in several ways. Most commonly, a fabric is first produced and then cut into narrow strips resembling a yarn. Then, when the fabric is cut, the raw edges become very fuzzy and produce the chenille appearance. Other chenilles are created by trimming a loosely attached effect fiber to create the fuzzy appearance. Still other chenilles are created by attaching or gluing fibers to the yarn.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pipe cleaner}} {{is made of}} two lengths of wire, called the core, twisted {{together}} trapping short lengths of fibre between them, called the pile. Pipe cleaners are usually made two at a time, as the inner wires of each pipe cleaner have the yarn wrapped around them, making a coil, the outer wires trap the wraps of yarn, which are then cut, making the tufts. <b>Chenille</b> <b>yarn</b> is made {{in much the same}} way, which is why craft pipe cleaners are often called [...] "chenille stems". The word chenille comes from French meaning caterpillar. Some pipe cleaner machines are actually converted chenille machines. Some machines produce very long pipe cleaners which are wound onto spools. The spools may be sold as-is or cut to length depending on the intended use. Other machines cut the pipe cleaners to length as they come off the machines. Smoking pipe cleaners are usually 15 - 17 cm (6 - 7 inches) long. Craft ones are often 30 cm (12 inches) and can be up to 50 cm (20 inches).The diameter comes in 4 mm; 6 mm; and 15 mm sizes Jumbo pipe cleaners have a 30 mm diameter with lengths of 18 inches and 6.5 feet.|$|E
40|$|Chenille yarns are {{traditionally}} {{used in the}} manufacture of furnishing fabrics, fashion knitwear, and as decorative threads in many types of broad and narrow fabrics. <b>Chenille</b> <b>yarn</b> has a very distinct weakness-it does not have very good inherent abrasion resistance. When the yarns are in use, clearly the abrasion resistance of the <b>chenille</b> <b>yarn</b> is crucially important. Either during further processing or during the eventual end-use, any removal of the effect yarn forming the beard will expose the ground yarns, which in turn will result in a bare appearance. To avoid this undesirable result, several options are available. Therefore, the studies on this area are about the investigation of the influences of some material types and machine parameters on the abrasion resistance of chenille yarns and fabrics produced with these yarns. In this paper, the experimental studies about the abrasion properties of chenille yarns in yarn, knitted and woven fabric forms are summarized...|$|E

5000|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Dalton in Northwest Georgia {{became the}} tufted {{bedspread}} {{capital of the}} US thanks to Catherine Evans (later adding Whitener) who initially revived the handcraft technique in the 1890s. Hand-tufted bedspreads with an embroidered appearance became increasingly popular and were referred to as [...] "chenille" [...] a term which stuck. With effective marketing, chenille bedspreads appeared in city department stores and tufting subsequently became important to the economic development of North Georgia, maintaining families even through the Depression era. Merchants organised [...] "spread houses" [...] where products tufted on farms were finished using heat washing to shrink and [...] "set" [...] the fabric. Trucks delivered pattern-stamped sheets and dyed <b>chenille</b> <b>yarns</b> to families for tufting before returning to pay the tufters and collect the spreads for finishing. By this time, tufters {{all over the state}} were creating not only bedspreads but pillow shams and mats and selling them by the highway. The first to make a million dollars in the bedspread business, was Dalton County native, B. J. Bandy {{with the help of his}} wife, Dicksie Bradley Bandy, by the late 1930s, to be followed by many others.|$|R
40|$|The basic {{parameters}} describing {{the structure of}} chenille fancy yarns produced on a che-nille yarn machine have been characterised. The effect of {{the properties of the}} component yarns, and that of machine parameters on the final count of the chenille yarns, have been studied. For this purpose chenille yarns were produced in different pile lengths, twist lev-els, yarn counts of component yarns, and an expression is derived to determine the final count of these chenille yarns. Correlation analysis confirmed a strong linear relationship with a high value of correlation coefficient (above 0. 95) between the final count values of <b>chenille</b> <b>yarn</b> samples obtained from the expression (formula) and that obtained from the measurements...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{knitting}}, the binding weave knitting is mainly used for technical textiles, where the textiles have a high performance require- ment. Weave knit is constructed by placing an inlay thread between the knitting rows {{in a similar manner}} as a weft thread in a woven tex- tile. This work sets out to design three-dimensional weave-knitted tex- tiles in combination with intarsia and partial knit with the intention to develop surface pattern on three-dimensional shapes. The material used are effect yarn, monofilament and <b>chenille</b> <b>yarn,</b> which improve the properties of the textile. The three techniques enhance each other by their characteristics and give the possibility of formability. The re- sult shows an installation of textiles with three-dimensional character- istics, meant for spatial contexts which have the ability to function with light. The value of this work lies in the combination of the techniques and the application area in which the work is set...|$|E
