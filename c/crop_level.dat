Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard could be manipulated through rootstocks and <b>crop</b> <b>level.</b> Cabernet Sauvignon, grafted on 5 C Teleki (V. berlandieri Planch. x V. riparia Michx), 1103 Paulsen, 140 Ruggeri, and 110 Richter (V. berlandieri Planch. x V. rupestris Scheele), was used in a trial carried out in 1997 and 1998 in an 8 - year-old vineyard near Oakville, California. Four levels of crop were imposed by winter pruning all vines to fourbud spurs and cluster thinning at veraison: treatment 1 (100 %), or double crop, no thinned vines with ~ 26 shoots and 40 clusters per vine; treatment 2 (75 %), in which 25 % of clusters were thinned; treatment 3 (50 %), the standard <b>crop</b> <b>level</b> in the study area or control, in which 50 % of clusters were thinned and one cluster per shoot was retained; and treatment 4 (25 %), in which 75 % of clusters were thinned and one cluster every two shoots was retained. The time required to reach 23. 5, 24. 0, and 25. 0 Brix was linearly dependent on <b>crop</b> <b>level</b> with a rate of about one day per each ton of grapes.

It is often implemented in the field with little or no specificity, and its practicality has been questioned because of increased production costs and lost yields. A new analytical model was introduced that combines grapevine yield and cost data with an assessment of wine quality and willingness to pay (WTP). The model was applied to two separate but concurrent field studies whereby <b>crop</b> <b>levels</b> of 1 (low), 1. 5 (medium), and 2 (high) clusters per shoot established by cluster thinning (CT) were compared to non-thinned (control) Riesling vines over a three year period in the Finger Lakes of New York.

Consumer wine sensory trials revealed that lower cropped vines (crop load below 5) produced wines with different aromatic attributes and lower likability ratings than wines from higher <b>crop</b> <b>levels.</b> The reduced financial net returns experienced by grape growers at lower vine <b>crop</b> <b>levels</b> could only be offset by substantial increases over base market price for grapes.

40|$|A {{broad range}} of factors {{influence}} wine grape quality and manipulation of these factors has stimulated interest among grape growers, wine makers, and research scientists alike. One such factor affecting wine grape quality is <b>crop</b> <b>level,</b> particularly for Pinot noir. Since the capacity of a vine to ripen fruit depends largely on the rate of photosynthesis and accumulation of carbohydrates, it follows that a quantitative <b>crop</b> <b>level</b> may be related qualitatively to fruit composition. Heat summation {{plays an important role}} in the accumulation of sugar and the rate of other metabolic processes occurring during ripening. In cooler climate regions, some cultivars are slow to ripen and cluster thinning may be employed to advance ripening (13, 17). Moreover, of all factors affecting fruit ripening, <b>crop</b> <b>level</b> is the most important one which growers can manipulate (17). Many experiments have been conducted to determine the ideal crop load of several varieties grown in various climates (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17). Results from these studies showed that the vines exhibited yield compensation, producing larger clusters with bigger berries, a trait not necessarily desirable to wine makers. To avoid yield compensation, clusters should be thinned at veraison (Candolfi-Vasconcelos, 1998. Personal communication), after the final number of cells per berry has been established. At this point, further growth is by cell enlargement due to the import of sugars and water. This growth is accompanied by other changes in fruit composition such as a decrease in acid levels, an increase in anthocyanin levels, and changes in aroma and flavor compounds, each contributing to the quality of the grape...|$|E

In particular, the functional form allows the variance of output to increase or decrease as one input is increased. Our estimates suggest the following assessment of the Soviet planners' agricultural policies during the command economy days: First, the extension of farming in Kazakhstan with generally inferior soils and climate resulted in lower <b>crop</b> <b>levels</b> (with identical input applications). Second, the massive inflow of capital resources and sharp rise in fertilizer use in agriculture during the Brezhnev years (1964 - 1982) did not contribute significantly to <b>crop</b> <b>levels</b> in the two republics.

40|$|Copyright © 2009 Cambridge University PressUnderstanding the {{compensatory}} {{responses of}} crops to pest damage {{is important in}} developing pest thresholds. Compensation for pest damage in crops can occur at the plant level, where the architecture, growth dynamics and allocation patterns of damaged plants are altered, allowing them to recover or, at the <b>crop</b> <b>level,</b> where differential damage between plants may alter plant-to-plant interactions. We investigated growth and yield of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) following non-uniform manual defoliation of seedlings. This partially replicates real pest damage and is valuable in understanding crop-level responses to damage {{because it can be}} inflicted precisely. Damage distributions included damaging 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100 % of the plants. Damage intensity for the damaged plants was varied by removing 100 or 75 % of each true leaf when plants had two, four and six true leaves. At the <b>crop</b> <b>level,</b> yield loss increased as the proportion of plants damaged and intensity of damage per damaged plant increased. Neighbour interactions occurred; undamaged plants with damaged neighbours grew larger and yielded better than undamaged plants with undamaged neighbours, while the converse applied for damaged plants with undamaged neighbours. Neighbour interactions were influenced by the intensity of damage and were stronger when 100 % of the leaf area was removed than when 75 % was removed. At the <b>crop</b> <b>level,</b> when compared with yield estimates based on yield of plants from uniformly damaged or undamaged plots, these interactions resulted in higher yield than expected (+ 8 %).

40|$|Rice {{productivity}} can {{be limited}} by available photosynthetic assimilates from leaves. However, the lack of significant correlation between crop yield and leaf photosynthetic rate (A) is noted frequently. Engineering for improved leaf photosynthesis has been argued to yield little increase in crop productivity because of complicated constraints and feedback mechanisms whenmoving up from leaf to <b>crop</b> <b>level.</b> Herewe examined {{the extent to which}} natural genetic variation in A can contribute to increasing rice productivity. Using the mechanistic model GECROS,we analysed the impact of genetic variation inAon crop biomass production, based on the quantitative trait loci for various photosynthetic components within a rice introgression line population. We showed that genetic variation in A of 25 % can be scaled up equally to <b>crop</b> <b>level,</b> resulting in an increase in biomass of 22 – 29 % across different locations and years. This was probably because the genetic variation in A resulted not only from Rubisco (ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) -limited photosynthesis but also from electron transport-limited photosynthesis; as a result, photosynthetic rates could be improved for both light-saturated and light-limited leaves in the canopy.

We designed a series of field experiments in Sardinia, Italy that were aimed at comparing the stomatal conductance and stomatal conductance-related traits (i. e., carbon-isotope discrimination and infrared canopy temperature) of durum wheat and triticale on different environments to evaluate the differences between these two species and the impacts of these differences on leaf transpiration efficiency and on water- and radiation-use efficiency at the <b>crop</b> <b>level.</b> A large variation in stomatal conductance was observed between species, although differences decreased as development proceeded. The greater stomatal conductance of triticale before anthesis did not imply a greater soil water depletion because the good water availability allowed the development of dense canopies exerting a relevant aerodynamic resistance on water vapor fluxes. The greater radiation-use-efficiency of triticale associated with its greater stomatal conductance in pre-anthesis resulted in a greater biomass than durum wheat in correspondence with similar amounts of radiation intercepted and of water used. Transpiration efficiency of triticale was also higher at the <b>crop</b> <b>level,</b> in spite of similar transpiration efficiency at the leaf level. The remarkable greater stomatal conductance of triticale confers an advantage to this species in terms of both water and radiation use-efficiency in spite of the typical terminal drought affecting winter cereal crops in this Mediterranean environment...|$|E

Crop choice and cropland allocation patterns are examined using the generalized least square (GLS) model within which the control function approach is applied to control for endogeneity arising from having access to fertilizer subsidy. In this study, the access to fertilizer is used as a binary endogenous regressor in the crop choice/cropland allocation and crop diversification equations. The Simpson’s index of crop diversification is used as the dependent variable in the assessment of the relationship between farm households’ access to fertilizer subsidy and <b>crop</b> diversification <b>level.</b> This relationship is analyzed using the treatment effect model in order to overcome the endogeneity problem. Model estimations are based on pooled panel data. Empirical results indicate that farm households’ cropland allocation patterns and the subsequent <b>crop</b> diversification <b>levels</b> are sensitive to fertilizer subsidy program. In particular, the results showed that farm households’ access to fertilizer subsidy is associated with a decrease in the cropland allocation to maize and pulses while there is an increase in cropland allocation to ground nuts, roots-tubers and tobacco. In terms of crop diversification, the study findings suggest that farm households’ access to fertilizer subsidies promote crop diversification. The results illustrate that fertilizer subsidies to maize positively contribute to promoting farm households’ <b>crop</b> diversification <b>levels</b> through intensified maize production.

40|$|The {{response}} of the whole crop to environmental conditions is {{a critical factor in}} agriculture. It can only be understood if the organization of the crop system is taken into account. A popular view in modern science is that genomics (and other `omics¿) will provide knowledge and tools to allow the characteristics of the crop to be altered for improved actual and potential crop yields, increased resource use efficiency and enhanced crop system health. As a result of this view, (molecular) plant systems biology has been considered as an approach to assist crop improvement for increased production, via modelling `how things work¿ in (sub-) cellular units. However, phenotypes at the <b>crop</b> <b>level,</b> for example, as expressed in grain yields, are extremely complex, and not only achieved by molecular pathways but also through multiple intermediate metabolic and physiological processes. These processes are controlled by numerous genes whose effects and expression are highly dependent on environmental perturbations.

This crop systems biology approach honours the combined role of modern functional genomics and traditional sciences (such as crop physiology and biochemistry) in understanding and manipulating crop phenotypes relevant to agriculture. A stepwise routine for the development of crop systems biology models is proposed.

40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, {{variation}} in Oregon vineyard yields has come from two main causes: winter injury and inconsistent fruit set. Together these factors have caused significant yield variation in almost every Oregon vineyard. In 1991, a research project was started at Oregon State to develop and evaluate a method of reducing yield variability. The project grew out of previous research trials on yield prediction, canopy management, and yield-quality relationships. These trials had demonstrated three key points: 1) yields could be predicted with an adequate level of accuracy by using cluster counts and estimates of cluster weight at lag phase of berry development, 2) the temporary presence of extra canes can reduce the growth and canopy of the remaining canes, and 3) divided canopies could produce wines comparable to single canopies at higher yields. Using this information we developed a modification of the Scott Henry Trellis system, a vertically divided canopy that is easy to establish in a vertically trained vineyard. The system uses the bottom canopy of the Scott Henry Trellis as a yield buffer. In low yield years the bottom canopy is retained and the system is treated just like a normal Scott Henry system. In high yield years the lower canopy is partially or wholly removed based on yield estimates. The presence of the lower canopy, even for {{only part of the}} season in a high yield year, will reduce the vegetative growth on the upper canopy. This should result in wine quality improvements.

Measured Cd levels in brown rice were predicted very well (R- 2 > 0. 8) based on Cd and Zinc in a 0. 01 M CaCl 2 extract or a soil-plant transfer model using the reactive soil Cd content, pH, and cation exchange capacity. In contrast to current soil quality standards used in Taiwan, such models are effective in identifying soils where Cd in rice will exceed food quality standards. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
