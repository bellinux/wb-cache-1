They will also develop their natural color, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The {{forewings}} of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E

5|$|The senior project {{consists}} of four main P's project, paper, portfolio and presentation. The {{students are required to}} work on a project outside of class that takes at least 15 hours of their time. This project <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything.</b> Their paper then has to relate in some way to their project, so if the project is creating a bird house the paper could be able the best type of bird house. The portfolio then brings everything together with evidence to prove that the project was completed. The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all of the items together. All the projects are judged throughout the year, and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education.|$|E

25|$|Instead {{of showing}} that the Boolean laws are satisfied, we can instead {{postulate}} a set X, two binary operations on X, and one unary operation, and require that those operations satisfy the laws of Boolean algebra. The elements of X need not be bit vectors or subsets but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> at all. This leads to the more general abstract definition.|$|E
25|$|Q-Q plot— is {{a plot of}} the sorted {{values from}} the data set against the {{expected}} values of the corresponding quantiles from the standard normal distribution. That is, it's a plot of point of the form (Φ−1(pk), x(k)), where plotting points pk are equal to pk=(k−α)/(n+1−2α) and α is an adjustment constant, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> between 0 and1. If the null hypothesis is true, the plotted points should approximately lie on a straight line.|$|E
25|$|In many {{patients}} with ADPKD, kidney dysfunction is not clinically apparent until forty or {{fifty years of}} life. There is, however, an increasing body of evidence that suggests the formation of renal cysts starts in utero. Cysts initially form as small dilations in renal tubules, which then expand to form fluid-filled cavities of different sizes. Factors suggested to lead to cystogenesis include a germline mutation {{in one of the}} polycystin gene alleles, a somatic second hit that leads to the loss of the normal allele, and a third hit, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> that triggers cell proliferation, leading to the dilation of the tubules. In the progression of the disease, continued dilation of the tubules through increased cell proliferation, fluid secretion, and separation from the parental tubule lead to the formation of cysts.|$|E

25|$|The Duck Race is {{a long-running}} {{event in the}} village. It is held each year, on the May Day bank holiday. Entrants pay a small fee (usually £1) to enter their 'duck' into the race. The duck has to travel along the river Darent from the war {{memorial}} in the village, to the bridge before the old Mill. A 'duck' <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from a shop-bought rubber duck to a model made by the entrant(s). Actual ducks are forbidden. It is a large event {{in the village and}} several hundred people turn out each year to line the riverbanks and watch. Anyone can enter and there is a prize for the 'Best Duck in Show' (awarded before the race begins) and the 'First placed Duck.' The money raised goes towards charitable organisations in the village.|$|E
25|$|For {{calculating the}} power of a reactor (in which the {{reaction}} rate is determined by the D-D step), we count the - fusion energy per D-D reaction as Efus = (4.03MeV + 17.6MeV)×50% + (3.27MeV)×50% = 12.5MeV and the energy in charged particles as Ech = (4.03MeV + 3.5MeV)×50% + (0.82MeV)×50% = 4.2MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV, (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from 2/25 to 2/25. For ET=1.01MeV this gives a range from 1.44MeV to 6.73MeV. so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0MeV (a specific energy of about 225 million MJ per kilogram of deuterium).|$|E
25|$|Nearly all DAPs {{consists}} {{of some kind}} of display screen, although there are exceptions, such as the iPod Shuffle, and a set of controls with which the user can browse through the library of music contained in the device, select a track, and play it back. The display, if the unit even has one, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from a simple one or two line monochrome LCD display, similar to what are found on typical pocket calculators, to large, high-resolution, full-color displays capable of displaying photographs or viewing video content on. The controls can range anywhere from the simple buttons as are found on most typical CD players, such as for skipping through tracks or stopping/starting playback to full touch-screen controls, such as that found on the iPod Touch or the Zune HD. One of the more common methods of control is some type of the scroll wheel with associated buttons. This method of control was first introduced with the Apple iPod and many other manufacturers have created variants of this control scheme for their respective devices.|$|E

25|$|Fly tying {{material}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> used {{to construct}} a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer. Whereas lead wire was the traditional method of weighting flies, today's weighting materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead. Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.|$|E

The donation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything,</b> regardless of its size, cost, tangibility, or even existence. Examples of donations include a yeti, the Battle of Waterloo, and absolutely nothing. Lloyd and the curator then decide what form the exhibit could take and where in the museum it could be displayed. In series one, the programme ended either with Lloyd and Bailey reading audience suggestions for additional exhibits or asking the audience curious questions [...] Bailey ended the show by giving a humorous comment on a Bertrand Russell quote. Both of these ideas were dropped in series two.|$|E

500|$|The grey jay is a [...] "scatterhoarder", caching {{thousands}} of food items {{during the summer}} for use the following winter, and enabling the species to remain in boreal and subalpine forests year round. Any food intended for storage is manipulated in the mouth and formed into a bolus that is coated with sticky saliva, adhering to anything it touches. The bolus is stored in bark crevices, under tufts of lichen, or among conifer needles. Cached items <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from carrion to bread crumbs. A single grey jay may hide {{thousands of}} pieces of food per year, to later recover them by memory, sometimes months after hiding them. Cached food is sometimes used to feed nestlings and fledglings.|$|E

The song then progresses into the chorus: [...] "I {{can be good}} / I can be sex / I <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> / I can be everything / I can be mom." [...] A male vocalist accompanies the singer's lyrics, [...] "Unless {{you want to be}} man / Unless you want to hold hands / Unless you want to be dad". After Gaga sings [...] "I'm gonna drink my tears and cry / 'cos I know you love me baby" [...] during the techno-inspired bridge, she alludes to the alleged affair between Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy with the lyrics [...] "Put your hands on me / John F. Kennedy / I'll make you squeal baby", singing in an impassive and monotonous manner.|$|E
500|$|Any two human genomes {{differ in}} {{millions}} of different ways. [...] There are small variations in the individual nucleotides of the genomes (SNPs) {{as well as many}} larger variations, such as deletions, insertions and copy number variations. Any of these may cause alterations in an individual's traits, or phenotype, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from disease risk to physical properties such as height. Around the year 2000, prior to the introduction of GWA studies, the primary method of investigation was through inheritance studies of genetic linkage in families. This approach had proven highly useful towards single gene disorders. However, for common and complex diseases the results of genetic linkage studies proved hard to reproduce. A suggested alternative to linkage studies was the genetic association study. This study type asks if the allele of a genetic variant is found more often than expected in individuals with the phenotype of interest (e.g. with the disease being studied). Early calculations on statistical power indicated that this approach could be better than linkage studies at detecting weak genetic effects.|$|E
