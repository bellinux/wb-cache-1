It must be possible {{to distinguish between the}} machine-directional and <b>cross-directional</b> deviation and the residual deviation as the control system handles these three deviations separately and in different ways. The earlier systems calculated a long-term average profile to filter the profile. As several quality profiles can be adjusted automatically it is important to get the right profile data with high resolution quickly to the control system. This is especially important during changes, after breaks and during grade changes. In advanced systems, algorithms are used to calculate the profile data.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} one of {{the fundamental}} issues in design and analysis of sampled multidimensional systems - that of uncertainty modeling and robust stability analysis. Methods of structured uncertainty analysis (-analysis) are extended towards systems with dynamical and non-causal spatial coordinates. The stability is understood in a broad sense and includes decay (localization) of system response along the noncausal spatial coordinates. Robustness of dynamical stability and spatial localization of response and boundary effects are addressed in a unified way. The main technical condition enabling the technical results of the paper is that the feedback loop including a multidimensional plant and controller does not have a feedthrough in the dynamical (time) coordinate sense. As an example, the paper applies the multidimensional structured uncertainty analysis to closed-loop control of a <b>cross-directional</b> paper machine process. The paper formulates multidimensional models of the process, its controller, and a structured uncertainty.

40|$|The {{effect of}} scarification, {{ploughing}} and <b>cross-directional</b> plouhing on temperature {{conditions in the}} soil and adjacent air layer have been studied during 11 consecutive growth periods by using an unprepared clear-cut area as a control site. The maximum and minimum temperatures were measured daily in the summer months, and other temperature observations were made at four-hour intervals {{by means of a}} Grant measuring instrument. The development of the seedling stand was also followed in order to determine its shading effect on the soil surface. Soil preparation decreased the daily temperature amplitude of the air at the height of 10 cm. The maximum temperatures on sunny days were lower in the tilts of the ploughed and in the humps of the <b>cross-directional</b> ploughed sites compared with the unprepared area. Correspondingly, the night temperatures were higher and so the soil preparation considerably reduced the risk of night frost. In the soil at the depth of 5 cm, soil preparation increased daytime temperatures and reduced night temperatures compared with unprepared area. The maximum increase in monthly mean temperatures was almost 5 Â°C, and the daily variation in the surface parts of the tilts and humps increased so that excessively high temperatures for the optimal growth of the root system were measured from time to time. The temperature also rose at the depths of 50 and 100 cm. Soil preparation also increased the cumulative temperature sum. The highest sums accumulated during the summer months were recorded at the depth of 5 cm in the humps of <b>cross-directional</b> ploughed area (1127 dd.) and in the tilts of the ploughed area (1106 dd.), while the corresponding figure in the unprepared soil was 718 dd. At the height of 10 cm the highest temperature sum was 1020 dd. in the hump, the corresponding figure in the unprepared area being 925 dd. The incidence of high temperature amplitudes and percentage of high temperatures at the depth of 5 cm decreased most rapidly in the humps of <b>cross-directional</b> ploughed area and in the ploughing tilts {{towards the end of the}} measurement period. The decrease was attributed principally to the compressing of tilts, the ground vegetation succession and the growth of seedlings. The mean summer temperature in the unprepared area was lower than in the prepared area and the difference did not diminish during the period studied. The increase in temperature brought about by soil preparation thus lasts at least more than 10 years...|$|E

A filter is used to obtain robustness to model error and insensitivity to measurement noise. The tuning of the noise filter and different methods for handling actuator constraints are studied in detail. The three different constraint-handling methods studied are: the weighting of actuator movements in the objective function, explicitly adding constraints to the control algorithm, i. e. constrained model predictive control, and scaling infeasible control actions calculated from an unconstrained control law to be feasible. Actuator constraints, measurement noise, model uncertainty, and the plant condition number are investigated to determine which of these limit the achievable closed loop performance. From knowledge of how these limitations affect the performance we find how the plant could be modified to improve the process uniformity. Also, because identification of model parameters is time-consuming and costly, we study how accurate the identification must be to achieve a given level of performance. The theory developed throughout the paper is rigorously verified though simulations and experiments on a pilot plant. The effect of interactions on the closed loop performance is shown to be negligible for this pilot plant.

The tuning method is based on identification of the process model, identification of the disturbance model and tuning the feedback controller by minimizing the paper property variations. To obtain a longer disturbance realization sequence and increase data available for identification of the process disturbance, 2 -dimensional process identification residuals are used for identifying an integrated moving average disturbance model.

The primary motivation for the testbed is to explore control design and analysis for interconnected systems. These systems are comprised of many similar units that interact directly with their nearest neighbors, and that have sensing and actuating capabilities at every unit.

Because CD controllers can operate with a significant level of mismapping, both the dynamic and steady-state responses of the closed-loop system are often degraded.

Studies on the cellular mechanisms of working memory demonstrated that neurons in {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} (dPFC) exhibit directionally tuned activity during an oculomotor delayed response. To determine the particular contributions of pyramidal cells and interneurons to spatial tuning in dPFC, we examined both individually and in pairs the tuning properties of regular-spiking (RS) and fast-spiking (FS) units that represent putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. Our main finding is that FS units possess spatially tuned sensory, motor, and delay activity (i. e., âmemory fieldsâ) {{similar to those found}} in RS units. Furthermore, when recorded simultaneously at the same site, the majority of neighboring neurons, whether FS or RS, displayed isodi-rectional tuning, i. e., they shared very similar tuning angles for the sensory and delay phases of the task. As the trial entered the response phase of the task, many FS units shifted their direction of tuning and became <b>cross-directional</b> to adjacent RS units {{by the end of the}} trial. These results establish that a large part of inhibition in prefrontal cortex is spatially oriented rather than being untuned and simply regulating the threshold response of pyramidal cell output.

Despite evidence indicating that goal conflict may have a detrimental effect on subjective well-being, {{little is known about}} the effects of goal conflicts in a context of pain. The current study wished to experimentally investigate whether different types of goal conflict are associated with changes in pain-related fear and pain-related decision-making. Therefore, forty-six participants completed a <b>cross-directional</b> movement task in which participants first learned to associate movements in one direction (e. g. left) with pain, and movements in the opposite direction (e. g. right) with safety. Next, participants learned that movements in another direction (e. g. up) were associated with reward, and movements in the opposite direction (e. g. down) with loss. In the test phase, both phases were combined, creating different types of goal conflict: approach-approach, approach-avoidance, and avoidance-avoidance conflict. The results show that participants reported highest fear and least willingness to perform movements associated with two concurrent avoidance goals, and the least fear and highest willingness to perform movements associated with two concurrent approach goals. Participants reported intermediate levels of fear and willingness for approach-avoidance conflicts. Choice latencies indicate that participants were slower to make a choice when presented with an avoidance-avoidance conflict compared to approach-approach and avoidance-approach conflicts. status: publishe...|$|E

This approach {{is based on the}} 2 Ì 7 overall balance 2 Ì 7 principle in the computation of the convection and diffusion fluxes at a control-volume interface. The overall balance method realizes that the profiles of the dependent flow variable and its derivative at an interface in a given coordinate direction are governed by the governing conservation equation itself, as a whole. The governing multidimensional conservation equation is rewritten as a steady one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation with a source, where the unsteady, <b>cross-directional</b> transport, and source terms are lumped together in that source. The exact solution to this one-dimensional problem is then used to compute the convection and diffusion fluxes at the interface.

40|$|A contextual inquiry was {{conducted}} at the airlineâs Systems Operations Control (SOC) from the 13 - 15 th of November 2006. A total of 26 hours of direct observation were conducted with {{various members of the}} SOC Staff including several of the Operations Coordinators, the ATC Coordinators, and the Operations Manager. During the inquiry a wide variety of situations occurred: unscheduled maintenance delays, estimated ready time slips, multiple hub ground delay programs, severely reduced arrival rates due to <b>cross-directional</b> winds, ground delay program revisions, and diversions of international flights. The vast majority of these situations were handled as if they were no different from routine operations; however, there were moments when the key SOC personnel were fully involved in the situation and the normal coordination and collaboration between the ATCCs, OCs, MOC and crew coordinators reverted to top down command and control. Thus the workload is not evenly distributed across all SOC personnel because of the geographic distribution of responsibilities. In addition to these observations this inquiry identified three issues with specific design implications, all centered around the OCâs work practices: overly involved coordination sessions with MOC, lack of control of printer output, and the use of schedule printouts as a primary source of solution information. All three of these issues lead to inefficiencies in the SOC operation, despite which, however, the SOC in general and the OCs in particular are able to remain effective. This report suggests that the OCs could become more efficient by shedding some of their printer maintenance tasks, extended MOC coordination sessions, and more effectively using software tools. In order to achieve this high level of effectiveness the SOC personnel actively adapt their roles and the balance of power depending on the level of operational disruption. With the addition of an MOC representative in the SOC or the availability of key maintenancerelated scheduling data, increased effectiveness may also be achievable under conditions of limited disruption. Changing the flow of messages from the printer to an on-screen system will help minimize the âbusyâ work associated with maintaining the printer and keeping up with the printouts.

40|$|Nowadays, Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) sheet bonding {{method has}} been rapidly {{introduced}} for reinforcing and/or retrofitting {{of the existing}} Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures. Due to bonding normal FRP sheet onto the tension-side surface of the RC members, the effects due to bonding the FRP sheet can be expected after rebar yielding. However, cracking and rebar yielding loads cannot be much improved. Recently, {{in order to increase}} not only the ultimate load-carrying capacity of the RC members but also cracking and rebar yielding loads, pre-tensioned FRP sheet bonding method has been developed. In the previous studies, metal system was applied as anchoring devices of the sheet. Even though the premature failure at the ends of the sheet can be prevented by applying the metallic anchoring system, the installation of the system into RC members is not easy task because of its heavy weight. Also, stainless steel must be used to be anti-corrosive when FRP sheet is applied. Then, in order to easily apply the pre-tensioned FRP sheet bonding method for reinforcing RC members, the anchoring system should be simplified without any dropping of anchoring performance. From this point of view, here, a flexural reinforcing method using pre-tensioned AFRP sheet without metallic device was proposed. In this method, to distribute the concentrated anchoring stresses of pre-tensioned AFRP sheet, the base <b>cross-directional</b> non-pre-tensioned AFRP sheet was bonded to the concrete surface around the anchoring area. In addition, to decrease gradients of bonding stresses near the anchoring area, a strain relaxation polymer (with low youngâs modulus) was used as a bonding material. The applicability of the method was discussed by conducting four-point loading test of the flexural reinforced RC beams with pre-tensioned AFRP sheet and comparing the experimental results with the numerical ones. The analytical portion of the research is employed to describe the flexural behavior of the all tested beams. A multi-section method was applied to analytically estimate the load-displacement relation and the axial strain distribution of AFRP sheet used for flexural reinforcing each RC beam. This research is divided into three studies as follows; (1) Strengthening Study of RC beams; this study examined the behavior of flexural pre-tensioned AFRP strengthening systems without anchoring device, hence investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a proposed anchoring method. The variables used in the experimental program included the pre-tension force ratio introduced to the AFRP sheet (0, 20, and 40 %) and the main reinforcement steel ratio (0. 79 and 1. 24 %). From this study, the results show that the proposed anchoring method is effective and feasible because the load-carrying capacity increased considerably. A good agreement between experimental and analytical methods was achieved up to ultimate state with somewhat a perfect bonding between the AFRP sheet and concrete surface. (2) Strengthening Study of pre-cracked RC beams; this study investigated the load-carrying behavior of pre-cracked RC beams strengthened with pre-tensioned sheet compared to non-pre-cracked ones. Pre-tension force ratio introduced to the AFRP sheet (0 and 40 %) and level of prior loading (Level 1 is up to main rebar yielding; Level 2 is up to average point between main rebar yielding and ultimate load) were taken as variables. From this study, it is observed that due to introducing pre-tension force into the sheet, flexural capacity and durability of the pre-cracked RC beams can be improved and the width of cracks can be decreased. This implies that a new anchoring method is effective and feasible. Numerical results can better match the experimental results for non-pre-cracked beams but not for pre-cracked beams subjected to high prior loading because the existing cracks and the stiffness of putty used for flattening the bonding surface were not considered in numerical analysis. (3) Repair Study of pre-cracked RC beams; this study examined the effectiveness of pre-tensioned AFRP systems to restore capacity of repaired pre-cracked RC beams reinforced with pre-tensioned sheet. Pre-tension force ratio introduced to the AFRP sheet (0 and 40 %), with/without existing cracks and with/without repairing the cracks by injection epoxy resin were taken as variables. From this study, it can be concluded that : 1) flexural load-carrying capacity of the pre-cracked RC beams can be significantly improved by bonding the pre-tensioned AFRP sheet onto the tension-side surface; 2) by repairing the existing cracks, the sheet rupture can be prevented because the opening of cracks and also large strains occurring in the sheet due to the opening can be rationally restrained; and 3) numerical results can better match the experimental results for non-pre-cracked beams but not for pre-cracked ones. å®¤è­å·¥æ¥­å¤§å­¦ (Muroran Institute of Technology) åå£«ï¼å·¥å­¦...|$|E
