50|$|Callebaut is a Belgian <b>couverture</b> <b>{{chocolate}}</b> manufacturer. <b>Couverture</b> <b>chocolate</b> is chocolate {{with a high}} {{cocoa butter}} content used by gourmet and culinary professionals. Many professionals who use Callebaut <b>couverture</b> <b>chocolate</b> use it for its workability and typical taste, which has remained constant over the decades.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{manufacturers}} {{develop their}} own [...] "signature" [...] blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark <b>chocolate</b> <b>couvertures</b> contain at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white <b>chocolate</b> <b>couvertures</b> contain only about 35% cocoa butter.|$|R
50|$|More than 500,000 bars of {{chocolate}} leave the production premises in Buchs/Aargau daily. Annualised, this {{means more than}} 41,000 tons spread over 2,400 different products. In addition to chocolate and pralines, Chocolat Frey AG’s core products, the company manufactures semi-finished products (<b>couvertures,</b> <b>chocolate</b> and cocoa powders and liquors, fillings etc.) for further processing in industry and trade, chewing gum under the brands Skai and Candida as well as private labels.With a market share of approximately 35% (according to Chocosuisse, 2015), Frey is the leading chocolate manufacturer on the Swiss market. The company employs more than 1000 members of staff and in 2015 achieved a gross turnover of CHF 396 million.|$|R
5000|$|A cheaper {{alternative}} to <b>couverture</b> <b>chocolate</b> is chocolate-flavored syrup, also called [...] "chocolate coating". Chocolate coating {{is already in}} liquid form and costs much less than <b>couverture</b> <b>chocolate</b> - although many {{would argue that the}} extra expense of gourmet Belgian <b>couverture</b> <b>chocolate</b> is more than worth it. Another alternative is to use dark chocolate, such as 70% cocoa chocolate. This contains much less sugar, so it isn't so sticky; a small quantity of hot water may be added to thin it further.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2006, {{the blog}} DallasFood.org {{published}} a ten-part {{series on the}} company's chocolate products that detailed the company's marketing claims and noted its refusal, unlike many other similar firms, to reveal the source of its <b>couverture</b> (the <b>chocolate</b> from which finished confections are made). It presented research on available couvertures that matched NoKA's descriptions of its product and concluded that NōKA sold an essentially unaltered version of couvertures produced by the French company Bonnat Chocolates while charging more than ten times the price asked by Bonnat. [...] Coverage of the series noted that when purchased directly from Bonnat, these couvertures carried [...] "a price tag substantially under what the credulous pay for NoKA." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Couverture</b> <b>chocolate</b> {{is a very}} {{high-quality}} chocolate {{that contains}} {{a higher percentage of}} cocoa butter (32-39%) than baking or eating chocolate.

50|$|After Octaaf Callebaut’s death, his {{daughter}} Marie and his nephew Charles Callebaut {{took over the}} company in 1945.

5000|$|City Bakery makes what {{it calls}} [...] "Real Hot Chocolate" [...] from {{high-quality}} <b>couverture</b> <b>chocolate,</b> melted to create an intensely rich chocolate drink. It established the City Bakery Annual Hot Chocolate Festival, held every February, with a different flavor of hot chocolate {{every day of the}} month. The New York Times attributed a trend in high-quality hot chocolate in city eateries to the influence of City Bakery: [...] " ... what is no mystery is the effect Mr. Rubin's hot chocolate had on the city's hot chocolate landscape. He opened the floodgates for the sea of serious hot chocolate contenders that exist in New York today." [...] City Bakery also offers savory foods, salad, sandwiches, pizzas and soup.|$|E
50|$|Melted {{chocolate}} is very temperamental, so rich <b>couverture</b> <b>chocolate,</b> which {{is high in}} cocoa butter, is commonly used to ensure consistent flow. If the cocoa butter content of the {{chocolate is}} too low, an additive must be mixed in to decrease viscosity. (Vegetable oil is most commonly used to do this.) But even couverture chocolate—unless specifically designed for fountains—often still requires an additive to make it flow smoothly. Because of this, it is highly recommended that chocolate formulated specifically for fountains be used to avoid {{the need for the}} addition of vegetable oil, as the oil gives a slimy, gritty taste and texture to the chocolate. Few chocolate fountains are capable of melting chocolate directly in the basin, so chocolate is typically melted in a microwave or double boiler before pouring it into the fountain.|$|E
