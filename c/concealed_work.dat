40|$|Abstract: CFG pile {{has been}} widely applied {{as one of the}} common ground {{treatment}} techniques. As a <b>concealed</b> <b>work,</b> the construction quality of pile foundation not only relates {{to the success of the}} project, but also concerns the benefits of thousands of households. Only strengthening the supervision and management during the construction and strictly designing and specifying CFG pile can ensure the construction quality of CFG pile. But most researches focus on operating mechanism and theoretical analysis, and there are fewer researches about the construction of CFG pile. The real construction of CFG pile has no specified operation and lacks of the construction guidance, which not only causes great problems and has great influence on the intensity of CFG pile, but also makes the real pile body have great difference from the design requirements. Therefore, the study on construction of CFG pile in the paper has great significance. Construction Method and Range of CFG Pile Composite Foundation The construction of CFG pile should select the construction technology according to the design requirements, feature of subsoil, groundwater level, if there are residents around the site and if there are equipments which are sensitive to vibration. The following construction techniques are generally selected...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} long {{acknowledged}} that Lucian employs {{various forms of}} allusion to the Iliad and Odyssey across his writings. This thesis builds on previous studies — which have produced taxonomic analyses of allusion, (mis) quotation and parody — to explore more fully the intertextual richness and complexity of Lucian’s writing that such approaches can paradoxically <b>conceal.</b> <b>Works</b> such as Charon, Hercules, Alexander {{and several of the}} miniature dialogues are examined in depth, especially those which have received less attention previously and those in which Lucian can be most clearly seen engaging with the Homeric text, whether at the level of whole scenes, through quotation of short passages, by the construction of parodies and centos, or in drawing attention to lexical details. This examination reveals how such techniques are used to signal Lucian’s close familiarity with the author who was the ultimate talisman of sophistic paideia. Lucian is revealed as re-reading and re-presenting Homer in clever, mischievous, even ‘postmodern’ ways to produce striking effects which make his work both accessible and amusing to ancient audiences across a range of levels of education, from those who knew the main features of Homeric stories and language to those who were intimately familiar with allegorical interpretations of Homer and Alexandrian scholarly controversies over textual minutiae. This is complemented by analysis of Lucian’s presentation of material from the biographical traditions about Homer as man and poet, a topic which has been less studied but which leads to consideration of the role played by Homer both in Lucian’s reflections on truth and lying and in the examination, by this Greek-speaking Syrian, of cultural relations between Greeks and non-Greeks in the cosmopolitan Mediterranean world of the second century...|$|R
