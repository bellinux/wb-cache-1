Despite {{the influence that}} the long-term behaviour of joints has on the mechanical behaviour of a timber–concrete structure and consequently on its design, {{there is still a}} lack of research in this area. This paper presents experimental research, carried out at the University of Coimbra and Delft University of Technology, on seven joint configurations using different types of fasteners and different materials. For each joint configuration, either four or ten tests were performed resulting in a total of forty tests. A comprehensive description of the test specimens and test setup is given. The experimental creep–time curves were fitted to a creep–time model and used to predict joint <b>creep</b> <b>values</b> over longer timeframes (10 and 50 years).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the possible causes of wheel squeal on Roslagsbanan, a narrow gauge (891 mm) suburban railway system in Stockholm, Sweden. Simulation of the dynamic behaviour of vehicles negotiating curves {{was carried out by}} means of the Swedish multibody simulation software GENSYS [1]. Wheel squeal may arise due to insufficient radial steering capability of the vehicles in curves causing too high levels of creep (relative sliding) in the wheel/rail-contact. Based on this theory, an advanced model of the creep-creep force relation was introduced. In this model the creep force decreases after creep reaches a certain level, called critical creep. It is believed that wheel squeal occurs after the creep level exceeded the critical <b>creep</b> <b>value.</b> Measured rail profiles of the curve together with measured wheel profiles were used as wheel/rail geometry input data. Other interesting parameters for the simulations, such as friction coefficient, primary suspension stiffness and damping, vehicle speed, braking/acceleration were varied and their effects on the outcome were tested. Worn wheels on newly grinded and worn rails under dry conditions are most likely to generate curve squeal. We believe the long term solution for Roslagsbanan is to grind the rail profiles into a shape more similar to the 50 E 3 with inclination 1 / 40. This will give a more even wheel wear over the whole wheel surface. However, curves below ca 300 m cannot be negotiated without wheel squeal, why all curves on the track tighter than ca 300 m have to be lubricated...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the creep {{behaviors}} of composite panels used in library shelves were investigated. For this purpose, {{two types of}} wood-composite panels (medium density fiberboard and particleboard), and three types of covering including synthetic laminates, natural veneer, and without cove, and two types of wood joints (fixed and detachable) were used. Dimensions of the book-shelves were in actual shelf size, that is, 1, 000 × 300 mm. Totally, 48 shelf specimens were prepared. For the creep test, a 23. 5 kg loading level was applied in the center part of the shelves. Measurements on the creep behavior were carried out over 155 days at different intervals. Results indicated {{that the type of}} wood-composite as well as the type of veneer had statistically significant effect on the creep {{behaviors of}} panels. The lowest creep was observed in MDF panels. Moreover, those panels covered with natural veneer demonstrated significantly lower <b>creep</b> <b>values.</b> The type of joint also had a significant effect on the creeping behavior of the shelves, though not as conspicuous as the type of panels and veneers. Based on {{the results of the present}} research project, it is suggested that in order to increase the service life of library shelves it would be better to produce the shelves from MDF panels covered with natural veneers; these shelves should be fixed on supports...|$|R
40|$|The {{biodegradation}} {{of solid}} waste materials, {{the main cause of}} secondary settlement in landfills, has {{a significant impact on the}} post-closure performance of landfill capping systems. Excessive settlement may in turn lead to water ingress and enhanced leachate generation, significantly increasing the risk of harm to the environment. Large-scale long-term laboratory experiments were conducted to identify the rate and magnitude of waste settlement using three purpose-designed test reactors (consolidating anaerobic reactors (CARs)). This paper presents a detailed characterisation of the waste, its associated chemical and physical properties, and the overall volume changes associated with degradation over time. The total magnitudes of settlement after 919 days were 27 · 6 % in CAR 1 (under 150 kPa pressure) and 25 · 0 % in CAR 2 (50 kPa). Long-term secondary settlement was found to be dependent on waste depth—that is, stress dependent. Increased stress (150 kPa) led to a 20 % increase in the rates of long-term secondary compression in comparison with a stress level of 50 kPa. Secondary settlement due to biodegradation was found to be of comparable magnitude to the component of secondary settlement caused by mechanical <b>creep</b> (<b>values</b> of 11 · 1 – 13 · 7 %). If the settlement behaviour in the CARs approximates to full-scale observations, this data set could be used for validation of quantitative landfill settlement model...|$|R
