50|$|Plastic cases {{loaded with}} small steel darts called flechettes were issued {{on a limited}} trial basis during the Vietnam war. Cartridges {{manufactured}} by Western Cartridge Company contained twenty flechettes 18.5 mm long and weighing 7.3 gr g each. The flechettes were packed in a plastic <b>cup</b> with <b>granulated</b> white polyethylene to maintain alignment with the bore axis, and supported by a metal disk to prevent penetration of the over-powder wad during acceleration down the bore. Cartridges manufactured by Federal Cartridge Company contained 25 flechettes. Tips of the flechettes are exposed in the Federal cartridges, but concealed by a conventional star crimp in Western cartridges. Flechettes had flatter trajectory over longer ranges than spherical buckshot, but combat effectiveness did not justify continued production.|$|R
