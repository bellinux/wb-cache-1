40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the factors for adopting Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) delivered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) among small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The authors conducted a two phases' qualitative-methodology: interviews with 20 experts from SaaS vendor (Microsoft) and a case-study with executives in three organizations which implemented vendor's ERP as SaaS (customers). The vendor identified 10 factors for adoption - <b>Costs,</b> <b>Security,</b> Availability, Usability, Implementation, Ubiquity, Flexibility, Compatibility, Analytics and Best-practices, where <b>costs,</b> <b>security</b> and availability were {{considered the most}} important factors. The three customers identified 3 additional factors: the trust in the Solution partner, Data integrity, and level of Integration of cloud platforms. Considering all 13 factors, Cost, trust in the Solution partner and Availability were identified {{as the most important}} for customers, which gave much less importance to the others factors. These results will help professionals and researchers to improve understanding and accelerate ERP adoption as SaaS among SMEs...|$|R

This paper proposes an efficient <b>security</b> <b>cost</b> analysis method, and describes its implementation using a 3 -tier client/server architecture and up-to-date web technologies. The proposed <b>security</b> <b>cost</b> {{analysis is}} based on a System Security Index and its sensitivities with respect to certain system parameters. The web implementation allows easy and effective access by all market participants to make competitive decisions based on the <b>security</b> <b>costs</b> and sensitivity information obtained through the proposed <b>security</b> <b>cost</b> analysis techniques. The web implementation of the proposed method is successfully tested on a 6 -bus system and a 129 -bus system.
