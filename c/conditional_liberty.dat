25|$|In October 2003, Berenson married Aníbal Apari Sánchez, 40, {{whom she}} had met in 1997 {{when they were both}} incarcerated at Yanamayo prison. Apari Sánchez was convicted of {{being a member of the}} MRTA. When {{released}} in 2003 on <b>conditional</b> <b>liberty</b> (parole) in Lima, his travel was restricted. Due to this, he was not present at the wedding in Cajamarca and had to be represented by his father. Later, her husband was allowed conjugal visits. Apari Sánchez is now a practicing attorney in Lima and directs a non-governmental organization (NGO) that assists individuals formerly imprisoned on charges of assisting or being members of the MRTA in their rehabilitation into society. He is also co-founder of a political party, Patria Libre, that intends to participate in the 2011 national elections.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Maconochie, a Scottish {{geographer}} and {{captain in}} the Royal Navy, introduced the modern idea of parole when, in 1840, he was appointed superintendent of the British penal colonies in Norfolk Island, Australia. He developed a plan {{to prepare them for}} eventual return to society that involved three grades. The first two consisted of promotions earned through good behaviour, labour, and study. The third grade in the system involved <b>conditional</b> <b>liberty</b> outside of prison while obeying rules. A violation would return them to prison and they would start all over again through the ranks of the three-grade process. He reformed its ticket of leave system, instituting what many consider the world's first parole system. Prisoners served indeterminate sentences from which they could be released early if they showed evidence of rehabilitation through participation in a graded classification system based on a unit of exchange called a mark. Prisoners earned marks through good behavior, lost them through bad behavior, and could spend them on passage to higher classification statuses ultimately conveying freedom.|$|E

50|$|Wiseman {{was born}} in Essex, England and became a {{lighterman}} on the Thames. He was employed by the British government to carry spies to France. On 30 October 1805 he {{was found guilty of}} stealing wood from a lighter and was sentenced to death. This was commuted to Transportation for Life and he was sent to New South Wales where he arrived in August 1806 on the Alexander. He traveled with his wife Jane and two sons, in a cabin rather than with the other convicts. On arrival he was almost immediately given <b>conditional</b> <b>liberty</b> and assigned to his wife. In 1810 he was given his ticket of leave and in 1812, a pardon.|$|E

5000|$|Not being a lawyer, he {{unexpectedly}} {{intervened in}} debates that ventilated legal {{issues such as}} the Bill on Partnership and the Bill on <b>Conditional</b> <b>Liberty</b> for Prisoners. In the midst of monumental parliamentary controversies, Liongson demonstrated a profound knowledge and understanding of both medical and juridical sciences. [...] In these debates, he was able to move members of the Senate to vote his way on the merits of his principled arguments. He, however, failed to convince his party mates when the Divorce Bill was deliberated on. Acting on his conscience and on the overwhelming sentiment of his constituents, Liongson opposed his own majority party's sponsored bill and gained the public's admiration when he openly declared that he would prefer death to the passage of the law that would destroy the base of the Filipino family.|$|E
50|$|Judicial {{warrants}} {{are required}} for arrest. Complainants normally deliver warrants, which stipulate {{when a person is}} scheduled to appear at a police station. However, police sometimes served warrants, generally in response to an influential relative of the complainant or if they received a bribe. In cases involving a monetary debt, the arrested person frequently resolved the case at the police precinct, and the police received a portion of the recovered money. The law provides that suspects must be charged or released within 48 hours and that they are entitled to counsel; however, in practice detainees were not always charged within the 48‑hour period. Limited rights of bail or the granting of <b>conditional</b> <b>liberty</b> exist, particularly for minor crimes and civil matters. On occasion authorities released defendants on their own recognizance. Detainees have the right to a lawyer of their choice or a state-provided lawyer if indigent, but administrative backlogs and an insufficient number of lawyers often prevented prompt access. Detainees were allowed prompt access to family members.|$|E

5000|$|Initially French Jews {{enjoyed a}} certain level of {{protection}} under the so-called [...] "Vichy-Régime" [...] in the Free zone, but as the Germans tightened their grip all Jews - whether French or foreign - faced the constant threat of arrest and deportation to the death camps in Germany. Frenkel's first weeks in Vichy France were spent living in Avignon, after which she moved on to Nice. Her book described a Kafkaesque succession of encounters with demoralised and confused bureaucrats: each day she was called upon to obtain a new identity document or temporary residence permit. Information provided by officials was never complete, regulatory requirements changed every day, and the overall experience was characterised by a constantly changing mixture of acute anxieties, hopes and disappointments. Eventually a friend arranged for a Frenchman to marry her in order to provide her with entitlement to permanent residence, but the scheme dissolved into tragi-comic farce when {{it turned out that the}} selected husband wanted not just the payment agreed, but also the woman. It appears from at least one source that Françoise Frenkel had applied for and obtained a visa for Switzerland soon after her arrival in France in 1939, but having set her mind on living in France she did not attempt to make her way to Switzerland for another couple of years. [...] By that time, making her way to Switzerland while living in hiding and trying to avoid discovery and deportation by the Gestapo and their Vichy régime collaborators was no easy undertaking. It may have been events in August 1942, when she narrowly avoided capture and deportation, that persuaded her that attempting to enter Switzerland was nevertheless a less life threatening option than remaining in Vichy France. On 26 August 1942 the police carried out a raid on the little [...] "Hotel Arche de Noe" [...] ("Noah's Ark Hotel") where she was living. However, by the time they arrived she was out shopping in the town. As she walked back towards the hotel she looked up to wave to her Viennese neighbour at her fourth floor window, but the neighbour was not there. [...] On a third floor balcony, however, her Polish neighbour, a Mr. Sigismund, was gesticulating along the street towards the hotel. Following the direction in which he was indicating, in the distance she spotted all the hotel's other Jewish guests being escorted into police trucks. [...] It was only with extreme difficulty that she resisted a mad urge to show solidarity with the other Jews and deliver herself to the policemen escorting the group, but resist it she did. After this, as she spells out in some detail in her book, she lived [...] "underground" [...] and was dependent for survival on those French citizens who had not been infected by the antisemitic propaganda of the Vichy government. As she later recalled, she met good French people and she met bad French people. And quite a lot of each. [...] There were those who put their bourgeois existence on the line in order to protect Jews from the clutches of the gendarmes. Others revealed themselves as opportunists or even as fanatical Jew hunters. Frenkel offers the conclusion that [...] "a sadistic core may well be hiding hide inside every person" [...] ("Ein sadistischer Kern muss wohl in jedem Menschen stecken"). [...] National defeat in the summer of 1940 profoundly traumatised the national psyche, and she permits herself the speculation that the manifestation of national weakness caused some of the young men to react by taking out their mental hurt on people demonstrably weaker than themselves. [...] On the administrative front, Frenkel's final months in occupied France were further complicated by a change whereby the eastern strip of the Free zone (including Nice/Nizza) was transferred to Italian control, as the Vichy based puppet régime had its powers ever more diminished.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:France_map_Lambert-93_with_regions_and_departments-occupation_evolution.PNG Under the Italian officials Frenkel's presence even, at one stage, was granted a level of legal status. Friends organised a Swiss visa for her. However, she was still Jewish, which meant that from the perspective of the authorities in occupied France, she was not permitted to cross the French frontier [...] Her first attempt led to capture while she sat on the local bus waiting at the border crossing, and a brief prison sentence served in Annecy, followed by a probationary period at <b>conditional</b> <b>liberty.</b> She nevertheless made a second attempt to cross the frontier but was thwarted by an Italian border soldier, who then let her go. She made her third attempt to cross the frontier into Switzwerland in June 1943, just a few days before the expiry of her Swiss visa. This time she succeeded. [...] Rolling down a high snow covered hillside slope in the mountains by Annecy, her black dress by now bloodied and torn, she was grabbed by a soldier who delivered a reassuring message: [...] "Stehen Sie auf, Madame, Sie sind nicht verletzt." [...] ("Get up, Madame, you're not wounded. See, you are in Switzerland.").|$|E
