5000|$|It {{was painted}} for Don Pedro de Arce, huntsman to King Philip IV. [...] It entered the royal {{collection}} in the eighteenth century, and was probably damaged by the fire at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in 1734. New sections were added at the sides (37 cm in total) and over 50 cm {{to the top of}} the canvas. The painting remains at the extended size but is currently (in November 2013) displayed behind a screen with a frame added over a <b>cut-away</b> <b>section</b> revealing only the original dimensions.|$|E
50|$|The command flag {{of an air}} {{commodore}} has one narrow red band {{running through}} the centre and is rectangular with a <b>cut-away</b> <b>section</b> giving it two tails. It is the only RAF command flag of this shape and it is similar in shape {{to that of a}} Royal Navy commodore's broad pennant. The vehicle star plate for an air commodore depicts a single white star (air commodore is equivalent to a one-star rank) on an air force blue background. RAF air commodores are classed as air officers and as such have two rows of gold oak leaves on the peak of their service dress hats.|$|E

40|$|A {{honeycomb}} core with half-circular <b>cut-away</b> <b>sections</b> at the spine (the adjoining cell walls) is designed and developed and numerically tested under axial dynamic load condition. The parametric study is invoked {{to identify the}} effect of various circular cut-away dimensions. In one embodiment a half-circular shaped cuts are removed {{from the top of}} the cell where the cell is impacted and its radius decreases toward the trailing edge of the cell. Numerical (FE) analysis was performed using explicit ANSYS/LS-DYNA and LS-DYNA codes to investigate the crushing performance, where impact angles 30 ° and 90 ° was combined with velocity of 5 : 3 m/sec. The crushing strength and internal energy absorption of the modified {{honeycomb core}}s with <b>cut-away</b> <b>sections</b> are then monitored to define the design parameters. The representative Y-section (axisymmetric model) is used for numerical analysis which simulates the honeycomb crushing performance. The numerical results of these innovative models show cyclic buckling effect in which crushing strength increases linearly as the rigid wall passes through. The FE results are validated with corresponding published experiments of the original unmodified honeycomb core (without cut-away) ...|$|R
40|$|It was {{recently}} discovered that significant erosion/corrosion occurs with machinable tungsten {{when exposed to}} water, particularly when the water has dissolved oxygen present. The problem was first discovered about 1 1 / 2 years ago when extensive corrosion was found inside the cooling channels of the L 5 - 80 white-beam slits located in sector 3 -ID-A. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show <b>cut-away</b> <b>sections</b> of the tungsten slit; the water passages are severely corroded from the cooling water used to cool the slit. The problem {{was brought to the}} attention of the world's two largest manufacturers of machinable tungsten, Mi-Tech Metals from Indianapolis, IN and Kulite Tungsten Corp. from East Rutherford, NJ. Neither company had any experience with this problem and were unaware that water could cause such significant corrosion, apparently the APS was the first customer to ever use the material in this fashion...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{objects are}} Muisky cavity. Bodaibo region and Eastern Sayan. The {{aim is to}} develop the methods and to improve the geophysical researches for volumetric mapping, composition study and forecasting of the phosphatic raw minerals. The generalized petrophysical model of the technogenic-active layer for Eastern Siberia has been developed; the errors arising at study of the vertical <b>cut-away</b> drawing <b>sections</b> by the microseismic logging(MSL) and vertical seismic profiling methods have been calculated; {{the analysis of the}} spectral oscillation composition at KMPV has been performed. The software package permitting to process the KMPV and MSL data has been developed; the regressive equations connecting the physical-mechanical properties according to the data of geophysical methods have been obtainedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
5000|$|A U-nut is {{very similar}} to a J-nut except that both legs are the same length. Because of this a {{retaining}} clip is usually formed on the leg without the threads. This helps keep the nut in place while not screwed down. The thread may be of a speed nut style, integrated nut, or have an extruded portion that is tapped.There are [...] "standard" [...] and [...] "wide-panel" [...] versions; the standard version has a solid hinge section, whereas the wide-panel version has a longer hinge with the center <b>section</b> <b>cut-away</b> to allow for easier installation.|$|R
50|$|Armed with {{a single}} 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine gun {{as well as a}} 37 mm Baldwin cannon firing through the {{propeller}} hub; the cockpit had ¼-in (6.3 mm) armour. The wings were dissimilar, with a wide-chord upper wing with ailerons, and a closely spaced narrow-chord lower plane with dihedral that placed the tips close to the upper wing. The upper wing was mounted close {{to the top of the}} fuselage with a <b>cut-away</b> forward <b>section</b> to accommodate the cockpit, and attached to the lower plane via V-type struts.Power was to have been provided by the eight-cylinder, water-cooled 330 hp Wright K-2 engine but the first two prototypes were fitted with 346 hp Packard 1A-1116 units due to delays in clearing the K-2 for flight testing. A third prototype was also built and testing was eventually carried out using both the K-2 and Packard 1A-1237 at McCook Field. Prototype aircraft suffered disappointing performance, high levels of vibration and poor visibility. The aircraft had a tendency to spin when stalled. Development was abandoned in 1922.|$|R
