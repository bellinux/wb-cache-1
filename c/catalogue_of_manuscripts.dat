Information technology has enabled not only to provide better opportunity to preserve the content <b>of</b> the <b>manuscripts</b> for posterity but also helped to provide efficient access from remote areas to these <b>manuscripts.</b> Towards digitalization <b>of</b> the content <b>of</b> <b>manuscript,</b> Metadata standards are necessary. Although {{attempts have been made}} in this direction, no single standard has been adopted for <b>cataloguing</b> <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts.</b> This leads to a situation where inconsistency and non-uniformity in <b>cataloguing</b> practices <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts</b> exists.

The standards available for description <b>of</b> <b>manuscripts</b> such as 'Digital Scriptorium' and 'Text Encoding Initiative' (TEI-MSS) are critically examined and compared...|$|R
