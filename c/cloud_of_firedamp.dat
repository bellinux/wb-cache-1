5000|$|Alongside firedamp, other damps include blackdamp (carbon {{dioxide and}} other gases), poisonous, {{explosive}} stinkdamp (hydrogen sulfide), with its characteristic [...] "rotten egg" [...] odour, and the insidiously lethal afterdamp (carbon monoxide and other gases) produced following explosions <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> or coal dust.|$|R
5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities <b>of</b> <b>firedamp,</b> a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|R

50|$|Within {{the coal}} mining industry, {{this type of}} coal is known for {{releasing}} the largest amounts <b>of</b> <b>firedamp,</b> a dangerous mixture of gases that can cause underground explosions.

5000|$|Afterdamp - The {{gas from}} an {{explosion}} <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> or coal dust.

Afterdamp may be a bigger killer following an explosion than the explosion itself.|$|R
50|$|One {{advantage}} of Stephenson's design over Davy's {{was that if}} the proportion <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> became too high, his lamp would be extinguished, whereas Davy's lamp could become dangerously hot.

5000|$|Blackdamp or Chokedamp - Nitrogen {{and carbon}} dioxide with no oxygen. Formed by {{complete}} combustion <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> or occurring naturally.

40|$|In {{retreating}} faces, dilution <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> flowing out <b>of</b> the goaf area at {{the junction}} of face and retum roadway is problematic. Despite important flowrates and high CH 4 drainage efficiencies, {{it has been observed}} that 2 / 3 <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> evacuated by the air stream concentrate in this particular place. So äs to progress in preventing such difficulties, it is necessary to better understand the repartition of gas fluxes in the goaf. This has obviously a benefit on firedamp drainage efficiency, but also on the choice of nitrogen injection points and flowrates in case of spontaneous combustion in the goaf. The use of a CFD code, PHOENICS, has allowed Simulation of circulation of three gases : air, CH 4, and N 2. Influence of the face dip on the repartition of CH 4 patterns in the goaf area has been qualitatively demonstrated...|$|R
