These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques.

Kinetic analysis of the Fe 2 +-Mg intracrystalline reaction, {{on the basis of}} Mueller's theory [1, 2], was carried out using the method developed by Ganguly [3] to measure the cooling rates of the host rock, assuming both asymptotic and exponential models. The determined ordering states yield cooling rates, near their <b>closure</b> <b>temperatures,</b> of approximately 0. 17 and 0. 05 degrees C per day for Acapulco and ALHA 81261 respectively, slightly slower than that measured for the FRO 90011 lodranite [4].

Apatite Fission Track (AFT) data suggest three time periods in which exhumation induced basement cooling of the Ranges into AFT <b>closure</b> <b>temperatures</b> (~ 60 - 120 °C) : Approximately 470 - 440 Ma, 340 - 290 Ma and 200 - 180 Ma. The Carboniferous and Jurassic exhumation episodes are supported by additional zircon (ZHe) and apatite (AHe) (U-Th-Sm) /He results respectively. We interpret the first pulses of rapid cooling {{as a result of}} the final pulses of the Delamerian and/or start of the Alice Springs Orogeny. Erosion and sedimentary burial during the Devonian brought the basement rocks back to ZHe <b>closure</b> <b>temperatures</b> (~ 200 - 180 °C). Shortly after, during the Carboniferous, the Ranges were exhumed to the surface which is likely a result of the final pulse of the Alice Springs Orogeny (~ 300 Ma). The presence of the Mount Margaret Surface during the Late Permian provides independent geological evidence that the Ranges were exposed at the surface at that time. During the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic, the Ranges were once again reheated to AFT <b>closure</b> <b>temperatures,</b> however, the lack of preserved sedimentary rocks of age suggests that this may not be simply due to burial. Alternatively, the Ranges could have been affected by a well-documented and widespread hydrothermal pulse, which reheated the rocks without significant sedimentary burial. Cretaceous AHe ages coupled with the presence of coarse-grained terrigeneous rocks at that time indicate that the ranges were shallowly buried during this time before Late Cretaceous exhumation (potentially caused by the rifting of Antarctica from Australia), exhumed the Ranges back to the surface. One additional Miocene AHe age was obtained near the fault-escarpment of the Davenport Range. This was thought to be related with enhanced fault activity at that time and finalised the exhumation history of the Ranges. Thesis (B. Sc.

40|$|AbstractWe {{analyzed}} the compositional profiles of coexisting orthopyroxenes and spinels in six diogenite {{samples from the}} Antarctic meteorite collection and used the data to constrain their thermal histories. The <b>closure</b> <b>temperatures</b> of Fe 2 +-Mg exchange between spinel and orthopyroxene in these samples vary between ∼ 630 and 830 °C. However, those in other diogenite samples, for which the compositional data {{are available in the}} literature, extend up to ∼ 1125 °C. This wide range of <b>closure</b> <b>temperatures</b> suggests repeated excavation of the diogenites from their original sites over a long time interval during cooling. The orthopyroxene grains were found to be homogeneous in composition while two of the relatively large spinel grains in the samples Elephant Moraine (EET) 87530 and Thiel Mountains (TIL) 82410 showed compositional zoning near the rim. Modeling of the spinel zoning in TIL 82410 suggests that it developed during cooling under a regolith or ejecta blanket, possibly at a depth of ∼ 80120 m, and that the spinel composition was homogeneous at ∼ 900 °C. A nonlinear cooling model in which the cooling rate is given by ηT(K) 2, with η = 5. 8 × 103 K 1 Ma 1, leads to simulated retrograde zoning profile in spinel which match the observed profile in TIL 82410 very well...|$|R

50|$|The <b>closure</b> <b>temperature</b> of {{a system}} can be {{experimentally}} determined in the lab by artificially resetting sample minerals using a high-temperature furnace.

50|$|The rate of {{diffusion}} {{increases with}} temperature as atoms are moving faster.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in microanalytical {{tools such as}} the ion and laser microprobe have revealed spatial distributions of radiogenic isotopes in minerals which cannot be explained by a simple volume diffusion mechanism. Although {{it is known that}} diffusion of a substance along extended defects (such as dislocations, exsolution lamellae, micropores, microfractures, fission tracks, etc.), which may serve as high-diffusivity pathways in a crystal, can significantly influence the bulk diffusivity of a mineral, this has largely been ignored in the field of geochronology. A general numerical model has been developed, which solves coupled multipath diffusion equations that describe the simultaneous diffusion of a solute species through both the crystal lattice (via volume diffusion) and high-diffusivity pathways (via short-circuit diffusion) under non-steady state conditions. Addition of a radioactive source term to the appropriate equations further allows for the modelling of integrated cooling ages and <b>closure</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and has direct pertinence to geochronological and thermochronologial studies. Three key criteria can be used to distinguish multipath diffusion mechanisms from volume diffusion mechanisms: (a) non-Fickian concentration profiles, (b) enhanced solute diffusivity with increasing mineral grain size, and (c) a lack of any correlation between <b>closure</b> <b>temperatures</b> (and cooling ages) and larger grain sizes. With multipath diffusion, the effective diffusion dimension a for certain minerals appears to remain on the order of the grain size, and the model can adequately explain observed increases in the bulk diffusion coefficient Db with a in the hydrothermal bomb data of previous Ar diffusion studies. Arrhenius diagrams of a multipath diffusion Db vs 1 /T will consist of curves that have a kink in them, reflecting a continuous change in the relative importance of the different diffusion mechanisms with temperature. The most important consequence of multipath diffusion is that the overall bulk diffusion coefficient Db of a diffusing species can be enhanced significantly above its volume diffusion coefficient Dv. As a result, integrated ages and effective <b>closure</b> <b>temperatures</b> (Tc) can be much lower than those predicted assuming only a volume diffusion mechanism, to the extent that minerals normally characterized by low volume-diffusion Tc may potentially have older integrated ages that minerals normally associated with higher volume-diffusion Tc. 23 page(s...|$|R
