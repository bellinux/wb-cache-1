5|$|Kilham, Coldsmouth and Thompson's Walls, Howtel and Pawston {{were four}} of 15 townships {{in the ancient}} parish of Kirknewton, {{one of the largest}} parishes in England. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, parishes were grouped into unions: Glendale Poor Law Union was created in 1837. Under the Public Health Act 1848 the area of the poor law union became Glendale Rural Sanitary District, which from 1889 formed a second tier of local {{government}} under Northumberland County Council. The four townships became civil parishes in their own right, separate from Kirknewton but within the sanitary district, in 1866, and under the Local Government Act 1894 became part of Glendale Rural District. Coldsmouth and Thompson's Walls, Howtel and Pawston were amalgamated into Kilham in 1955. Glendale Rural District was abolished in 1974, and became part of the newly created Borough of Berwick upon Tweed, which was in turn abolished {{as a result of the}} Northumberland (Structural <b>Change)</b> <b>Order</b> 2008, under which Northumberland became a unitary authority in 2009.|$|E

25|$|The {{strategic}} bombing proponents {{within the}} USAAF, called the Bomber Mafia by their ideological opponents, had {{established in the}} early 1930s a policy against research to create long-range fighters, which they thought would not be practical; this kind of research was not to compete for bomber resources. Aircraft manufacturers understood {{that they would not}} be rewarded if they installed subsystems on their fighters to enable them to carry drop tanks to provide more fuel for extended range. Lieutenant Kelsey, acting against this policy, risked his career in late 1941 when he convinced Lockheed to incorporate such subsystems in the P-38E model, without putting his request in writing. It is possible that Kelsey was responding to Colonel George William Goddard's observation that the US sorely needed a high-speed, long-range photo reconnaissance plane. Along with a <b>change</b> <b>order</b> specifying some P-38Es be produced without guns but with photo reconnaissance cameras, to be designated the F-4-1-LO, Lockheed began working out the problems of drop tank design and incorporation. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, eventually about 100 P-38Es were sent to a modification center near Dallas, Texas, or to the new Lockheed assembly plant B-6 (today the Burbank Airport), to be fitted with four K-17 aerial photography cameras. All of these aircraft were also modified to be able to carry drop tanks. P-38Fs were modified as well. Every Lightning from the P-38G onward was drop tank-capable off the assembly line.|$|E

40|$|<b>Change</b> <b>orders</b> impact {{many areas}} of a {{construction}} project. However, the impacts that <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> have on labour efficiency are much harder to quantify than other impacts and therefore are a significant risk to contractors. Little research has been completed in the past quantifying these impacts, so disputes are common between owners and contractors regarding the actual cost of change. This study used data from 43 projects to develop a linear regression model that predicts the impact of <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> on labour efficiency. The input factors needed for the model are (1) total actual project hours, (2) total estimated change hours, (3) impact classification, and (4) timing of change. The model calculates the labour loss in efficiency for a particular project so that owners and contractors will better understand the true impact of change on labour efficiency.

40|$|<b>Change</b> <b>orders</b> in {{construction}} projects are very common {{and result in}} negative impacts on various project facets. The impact of <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> on labor productivity is particularly difficult to quantify. Traditional approaches are inadequate to calculate the complex input-output relationship necessary to measure the effect of <b>change</b> <b>orders.</b> This study develops the Evolutionary Fuzzy Support Vector Machines Inference Model (EFSIM) to more accurately predict change-order-related productivity losses. The EFSIM is an AI-based tool that combines fuzzy logic (FL), support vector machine (SVM), and fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA). The SVM is utilized as a supervised learning technique to solve classification and regression problems; the FL is used to quantify vagueness and uncertainty; and the fmGA is applied to optimize model parameters. A case study is presented to demonstrate and validate EFSIM performance. Simulation results and our validation against previous studies demonstrate that the EFSIM predicts the impact of <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> significantly better than other AI-based tools including the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and evolutionary support vector machine inference model (ESIM) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a computer model}} for quantifying the adverse impact of <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> on construction productivity. In order to provide an in-depth analysis of <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> and develop a reliable model, a comprehensive field study was carried out. The field study was conducted at a Montreal based firm, specialized in project management and construction claims. A total of 117 actual projects, constructed in Canada and the USA between 1990 and 1998, were initially analyzed for possible use in the developments made in this thesis. Only 33 work-packages from these projects were utilized {{in the development of}} the present model. These work packages have an original total value of more than $ 110 M, planned direct hours of 1, 023, 583 for the original scope of work and a total of <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> direct hours of 166, 002. Additional cases, obtained from the literature, were used to supplement the collected data in order to improve the reliability of the developed model.
