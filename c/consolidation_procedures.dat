40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the position of the landowner and his/her degree of influence on land consolidation in general and specially within the municipality of Pedersöre. This study is divided into two fields: a) the decision-making and the degree of influence of a private landowner and b) the general development of land consolidation. This study emphasizes the real possibilities the landowner has of influencing land consolidation and how these possibilities appear in practise. The continuity of Finnish land consolidation activity is also investigated. The aim was to find out if the land reform process has been a slow and long lasting or if the cadastral procedures have been separate technical procedures. The empiric data for this study was collected from land consolidation records and articles published in a local newspaper from Pedersöre during the 20 th century. The method used in this study was a qualitative content analysis. Financial measures taken by the state in land <b>consolidation</b> <b>procedures</b> has, according to this study stimulated the implementation of land <b>consolidation</b> <b>procedures.</b> But this alone has not been sufficient to start the land consolidation process. Opinion leaders among the landowners and the economic results of the procedures have been central internal factors. These have also influenced the implementation of land <b>consolidation</b> <b>procedures.</b> The long duration of land <b>consolidation</b> <b>procedures</b> has made it significantly difficult for a landowner to estimate the economic outcome of land consolidation. This study suggests that there has been a long lasting and almost continuous land reform within the research area (Pedersöre).

40|$|Large-scale {{infrastructure}} projects require {{the acquisition of}} appropriate land for their construction and maintenance, while they often cause extensive fragmentations of the affected landscape and land plots as well as significant land loss of the immediately affected land owners. A good practice in this field comes from Germany. In Germany, the so-called “land consolidation for large-scale projects” is used to distribute the land loss among a larger group of land owners and to reduce the damages caused by land dissection. In this article, the results of detailed analyses of the land consolidation for large-scale projects’ procedures in Germany are presented.

In {{this part of the}} country, holdings are very fragmented and scattered, made up {{of a large number of}} small surface area plots located far from the headquarters of the holding. The aim of the article is to present actions that can help improve rural spatial structure and validity of the land register. The authors have, therefore, analysed the problems that may result in both spatial and social conflicts. The following were analysed in particular: discrepancies between data in the LPR and the existing factual state, plots without access to public roads, property ownership structure, the necessity to regulate property boundaries, and problems with the procedure for taking land out of agricultural production. The article presents both positive and negative effects of the land consolidation and exchange process, modernisation of the Land and Property Register, and their impact on socio-spatial conflicts. Its results indicated that the land <b>consolidation</b> <b>procedure</b> and LPR modernisation have a significant impact on socio-spatial relations in rural areas.

Patients and Methods: Patients were younger than 55 years and {{had at least one}} adverse prognostic factor. Induction treatment was that of the LNH 84 protocol with an open randomization on the anthracycline. Patients in complete remission were further randomly assigned to receive either <b>consolidation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Results: After induction treatment, 464 patients were assessable for the consolidation phase. With a median follow-up duration of 28 months, the 3 -year disease-free survival rate was 52 % (95 % confidence interval, 45 % to 59 %) in the sequential chemotherapy arm and 59 % (95 % confidence interval, 52 % to 66 %) in the autologous transplant arm (P =. 46, relative risk = 0. 90). The 3 -year survival rate did not differ between sequential chemotherapy and autotransplantation, at 71 % (95 % confidence interval, 64 % to 78 %) and 69 % (95 % confidence interval, 62 % to 76 %), respectively (P =. 60, relative risk = 1. 11).

40|$|The Danish land {{consolidation}} tradition {{has its roots}} in the land reform launched in the 1780 s. The first “modern ” {{land consolidation}} law was adopted in 1924. The land <b>consolidation</b> <b>procedure</b> is today basically the same as the system which was introduced in 1955. Until 1990, land consolidation was used as an instrument for agricultural development (i. e. mainly through reduction of land fragmentation and increase in agricultural holding sizes). In 1990, the objective of implementing land consolidation was broadened. It was explicitly included in the preamble of the land consolidation law that the objective is both to contribute to agricultural development and to the implementation of nature and environmental projects as well as to provide land as compensation for agricultural holdings affected by such projects. Since 1990, the land consolidation and land banking instruments have proven to be absolutely essential in the process of reaching voluntary agreements with the landowners affected by nature projects. Public funding of the traditional land consolidation projects with agricultural development as main objective was discontinued in 2006. At the same time, the land consolidation projects implemented in recent years (after a public initiative often in connection with the implementation of a nature project) may only include land transactions which contribute to the implementation of the public initiated project. Thus, the multi-purpose potential which could be expected after the amendment of the land consolidation law in 1990 has so far not been realized. The volume of the Danish land consolidation program has in the last years been reduced more than half compared to the previous decades.
