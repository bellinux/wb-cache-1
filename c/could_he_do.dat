5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were {{the days when the}} British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
60|$|What else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Not even to God's elect {{does the}} sky always send down manna.|$|E
60|$|But what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> In actual cash Mother and he {{had less}} than seven dollars in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! but, Uncle William, how can I? How can I ever? Mother {{could do}} things I never <b>could!</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> care for her! <b>He</b> <b>does</b> {{not care for}} me!' ...|$|R
60|$|THE SERPENT. Because if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> without Eve.|$|R
60|$|HON. So I will. He said, To {{have to do}} {{with other}} men's wives had been practiced by David, God's beloved; and {{therefore}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>He</b> said, To have more women than one was a thing that Solomon practiced; and therefore <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>He</b> said that Sarah lied, and so did Rahab; and therefore <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>He</b> said that the disciples went at the bidding of their Master, and took away the owner's ass; and therefore <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so too. <b>He</b> said that Jacob got the inheritance of his father in a way of guile and cheating; and therefore <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so too.|$|R
60|$|What <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Talk it {{over with}} Soames? That would only make matters worse. And, after all, {{there was nothing in}} it, he felt sure.|$|E
60|$|What else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> He locked them in, and was, {{through the}} failure of the man, in a quandary which made clear {{reflection}} necessaryâ€”and impossible.|$|E
6000|$|Hodder was silent. The thought {{struck him}} with {{tremendous}} force. Had he suggested it? And how--why? Could it be done? <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it or begin it? ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{the only}} {{sensible}} thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> {{sat down and}} took a good rest, and afterward began walking along the road.|$|R
6000|$|HON. So I will. He said, To {{have to do}} {{with other}} men's wives, had been practised by David, God's beloved; and {{therefore}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>He</b> said, To have more women than one, was a thing that Solomon practised; and therefore <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>He</b> said, That Sarah and the godly midwives of Egypt lied, and so did saved Rahab; and therefore <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>He</b> said, That the disciples went at the bidding of their Master, and took away the owner's ass; and therefore <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so too. <b>He</b> said, That Jacob got the inheritance of his father in a way of guile and dissimulation; and therefore <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so too.[223] ...|$|R
60|$|Macheson was to {{some extent}} relieved. At any rate there was nothing further that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> bent over the girl kindly.|$|R
6000|$|Tense {{questions}} {{pierced the}} dark chaos of Slone's mind--what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Run the King down! Make 'him kill Lucy! Save her from horrible death by fire! ...|$|E
6000|$|It would mean, for instance, that he {{must think}} no more of Rosamund. <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> this {{for the sake of}} the welfare of his soul in some future state? ...|$|E
6000|$|Scoutbush was {{honestly}} shocked. Who {{would have}} dreamed it? No {{one had ever}} {{told him that the}} cholera had really been there before. What <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Send for Thurnall? ...|$|E
50|$|Alf Kumalo {{was born}} in Utrecht near Newcastle in the {{province}} of KwaZulu Natal. He first worked in a garage doing various jobs and then started freelancing for various publications, selling his photographs where <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> a lot of work for the Bantu World.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, all right. Come ahead," [...] {{returned}} the youngest Rover. He spoke as lightly as <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> {{not wish to}} let the others know his true feelings. There was a strange bitterness in his heart, and for the moment he wished {{that he had never}} come on this tour.|$|R
60|$|And an obstinacy in him {{made him}} {{put his arm}} round her and draw her to the shadow. She submitted: let him try what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> Let him try what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> leaned {{against the side of}} the stack, holding her. The stack stung him keenly with a {{thousand}} cold, sharp flames. Still obstinately he held her.|$|R
6000|$|Hector {{was all in}} one flush, almost choking, as he {{told that}} he was Mr. Ernescliffe's brother, and gave {{his hand to the}} sailor. [...] "What <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> for him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Again, what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> by way {{of earning}} a living? He did not {{know much about the}} City and its ways, but he knew enough to {{understand}} that summary dismissal from a bank is not the best recommendation one can put forward in applying for another job. And if he did not get another job in the City, what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> If it were only summer, he might get taken on somewhere as a cricket professional. Cricket was his line. He could earn his pay at that. But it was very far from being summer.|$|E
6000|$|... "And all mine is yours, of course. But, Celia, how <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it? He can't pick locks, I know, for we fussed over my desk together, and had {{to break}} it after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bes was {{faithful}} and clever, {{but what could}} a single dwarf do among all these black-hearted fiends? And if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing, oh! if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing! ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{was very}} fond of Kenny as an actor, {{although}} he wasn't particularly versatile. What <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> very well. His strengths were his ability to portray charm; basically he was the officer returning from the war and he was superb {{in that kind of}} role. The minute that kind of role went out of existence, he began to go down as a box office star." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is born mit dose cannon in him. He tondt haf to do noding, his chenius do all de vork. Of he is asleep, {{and take}} a pencil in his hand, out come a cannon. Py crashus, of <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a clavier, of <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a guitar, of <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a vashtub, it is a fortune, heiliger Yohanniss it is yoost a fortune!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> {{better than}} disappear? I suppose I {{shall have to}} make him an {{allowance}} some of these days, and if he can live and keep himself dark I will do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{the young}} man answered, with a tone of natural assent. [...] "To be sure he hates you. How <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> otherwise? You are Korong. You may any day be his enemy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Captain Horn {{gave up the}} {{treasure}} as lost. The Dunkery Beacon was probably shaping her course for the coast of Africa, {{and even if he}} had a swifter vessel and could overhaul her, what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hark at the innocent!" [...] rejoined Lenoir, with a sneer. [...] "What <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done?</b> Patriots, friends, brothers, I ask you, what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{very good}} little boy once who wanted to go to sea. And the captain asked him what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the multiplication-table {{backward}} and paste sea-weed in a book; that he knew how many times the word [...] "begat" [...] occurred in the Old Testament; and could recite [...] "The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" [...] and Wordsworth's [...] "We Are Seven." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, isn't that {{a trifle}} unreasonable? What <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done</b> that <b>he</b> hasn't <b>done?</b> <b>He</b> was ill and worn out, but he wouldn't even stay {{a day after}} he got the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the king}} {{went to his}} chief adviser and asked what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do.</b> And the chief adviser bade him to give another ball, {{and this time he}} said, [...] "Give it to poor as well as rich." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{bitterness}} in poor Ian's spirit, for {{grizzly bears}} {{were not to}} be fallen in with every day, and it might be that he would never have another opportunity. Even if he had, what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{looked back}} at him, openly and frankly. The moment was {{critical}} for our interview. <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it? Were we {{the kind of person}} that he could give it to? Could we get it if he did? ...|$|E
50|$|When Corman {{got back}} to California, Wynorski asked him to send down the biggest lady wrestler <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> and Wynorski filmed the Queen Kong scene.|$|R
50|$|Duncombe {{was plagued}} by a {{bronchial}} condition that would eventually kill him. Between 1847 and 1850 he was often too sick to attend Parliament regularly. But when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and gaunt and emaciated, this dandified child of privilege continued to stand up in the House {{for the rights of}} the less visible and less fortunate, and chair the long and arduous meetings of trade unionists.|$|R
2500|$|James Brown {{has also}} {{specifically}} cited Jordan {{as a major}} influence because of his multifaceted talent. In the 1992 documentary Lenny Henry Hunts the Funk, Brown said that Jordan had influenced him [...] "in every way. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> sing, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> dance, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> act. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it all." ...|$|R
