The mean <b>camber</b> <b>lines</b> for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 651 - 412 and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LS(1) - 0413 airfoils were calculated. Numerical analysis was conducted using thin-airfoil theory and finite-wing theory. Airfoil variables included zero-lift angle of attack and centre-of-pressure location. Wing variables encompassed induced and effective angles of attack, lift and drag coefficients, and lift-to-drag ratio. Modelling consisted of variations in wing aspect ratio and the integration of end plates and a Gurney flap. A tapered rectangular planform is quasi-elliptical and attains near-unity Oswald efficiency. The NASA LS(1) - 0413 airfoil is stall resistant and produces high downforce at the expense of extra drag because of factors related to camber, profile thickness, leading edge radius, and concave pressure recovery.

5000|$|A {{laminar flow}} wing has a maximum {{thickness}} {{in the middle}} <b>camber</b> <b>line.</b> Analyzing the Navier-Stokes equations in the linear regime shows that a negative pressure gradient along the flow has the same effect as reducing the speed. So with the maximum camber in the middle, maintaining a laminar flow over {{a larger percentage of}} the wing at a higher cruising speed is possible. However, some surface contamination will disrupt the laminar flow, making it turbulent. For example, with rain on the wing, the flow will be turbulent. Under certain conditions, insect debris on the wing will cause the loss of small regions of laminar flow as well. [...] Before NASA's research in the 1970s and 1980s the aircraft design community understood from application attempts in the WW II era that laminar flow wing designs were not practical using common manufacturing tolerances and surface imperfections. That belief changed after new manufacturing methods were developed with composite materials (e.g., graphite fiber) and machined metal methods were introduced. NASA's research in the 1980s revealed the practicality and usefulness of laminar flow wing designs and opened the way for laminar flow applications on modern practical aircraft surfaces, from subsonic general aviation aircraft to transonic large transport aircraft, to supersonic designs.|$|E

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{theory for}} steady irrotational flow through {{a cascade of}} thin cambered airfoils is developed. Isolated thin airfoils have only slight camber is most applications, and the well known methods that replace the source and vorticity distributions of the curved <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> by similar distributions on the straight chord line are adequate. In cascades, however, the camber is usually appreciable, and significant errors are introduced if the vorticity and source distributions on the <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> are approximated by the same distribution on the chord line. The calculation of the flow field becomes very clumsy in practice if the vorticity and source distributions are not confined to a straight line. A new method is proposed and investigated; in this method, at each point on the <b>camber</b> <b>line,</b> the vorticity and sources {{are assumed to be}} distributed along a straight line tangent to the <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> at that point, and corrections are determined to account for the deviation of the actual <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> from the tangent line. Hence, the basic calculation for the cambered airfoils is reduced to the simpler calculation of the straight line airfoils, with the equivalent straight line airfoils changing from point to point. The results of the approximate method are compared with numerical solutions for cambers as high as 25 per cent of the chord. The leaving angles of flow are predicted quite well, even at this high value of the camber. The present method also gives the functional relationship between the exit angle and the other parameters such as airfoil shape and cascade geometry. </p...|$|E

By applying the "streamline condition " that there 1 s no veloczty component perpendicular to the wing surface, and integrating over the chord, the equation of a <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> is obtained. The initial vorticlty distribution contains two parameters which {{are related to the}} amount of camber and the chordwise position of the maximum ordinate, and thus define a doubly infinite family of camber lines. Expressions are found for the effect of these camber lines on the zero lift angle, lift distribution and centre of pressure at all spanwxe positions. Simple charts are provided from which may be read the equxvalent incidence and pltchmg. moment at zero lift of any <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> of the family at any spanwse position on a wing of any sweep. A detailed description 1 s given of the method of calculating the loading on a given cambered swept wing.

The correct matching of camber and tv&st over the whole wing is thus of fundamental importance.

40|$|It was {{considered}} that existing methods for calculating the optimum incidence of aerofoils in cascade are so empirical {{that they could}} not be extended to new profiles without considerably more supporting test work. A more fundamental approach involving less empiricism was therefore sought.

40|$|A load-dependent passive camber control {{concept is}} {{introduced}} for alleviating load fluctuations on wind turbine rotor blades {{with the overall}} goal of reducing fatigue and increasing durability and turbine lifetime. The passive change of the <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> is realized through kinematically coupled leading and trailing-edge flaps. The leading-edge flap is actuated by the increased pressure forces due to the change in angle of attack. The trailing-edge flap is kinematically coupled to {{the rotation of the}} leading-edge flap. This combined motion results in an increase or decrease in airfoil camber dependent on the pressure difference along the airfoil and the restoring force applied at the leading-edge flap. This concept works fully passive, i. e. its characteristics are determined solely by the fluid-structure interaction. The quantification of these aerodynamic characteristics is the objective of the present study. The concept has been studied experimentally and numerically. The numerical simulations consider quasi-steady aerodynamics and the combined flap motion is described by one degree of freedom. The concept has been confirmed experimentally under quasi-steady conditions in the large scale low-speed wind tunnel at TU Darmstadt. The structural parameters which characterize the flap deflections are investigated systematically. The results show how the lift curve slope can be adjusted by the preload moment, the stiffness and the coupling ratio between the leading and trailing-edge flap. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} keep the lift coefficient constant due to the self-adaptive <b>camber</b> <b>line.</b> The numerical model is compared to the experimental results. The model is able to predict the effects revealed through the wind tunnel measurements. In the second part the numerical model of the airfoil section with leading and trailing-edge flaps is extended to consider also the bending and torsional degree of freedom. The results show that although the dynamic behavior of the blade changes significantly, load reduction is achieved and a flexible <b>camber</b> <b>line</b> is advantageous for the dynamic response of the rotor blade. Finally the concept is evaluated with the wind turbine simulator FAST. The underlying look-up tables are modified to incorporate the flapped airfoil characteristics. The results provide a baseline for the evaluation of the concept in conjunction with the aerodynamics encountered by wind turbines...|$|E
