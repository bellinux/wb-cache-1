5|$|Harry asked printer James E. James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> a hot pie at four in the morning. Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E
25|$|Crouch/Moody becomes {{noted for}} {{teaching}} and demonstrating normally higher-level topics to Harry's fourth-year class (such as the Unforgivable Curses). He is a demanding teacher who expects students to work. He puts up with very little, for example punishing Draco Malfoy by transforming him into a ferret to stick up for Harry when Malfoy was tormenting him. And yet, he can be compassionate; he takes Neville Longbottom off for a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> a talk after Neville is badly shaken by the demonstration of the Cruciatus Curse.|$|E
25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> {{again for}} a cup of tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
60|$|It {{was only}} when they were {{embarked}} upon <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> had a little refreshed themselves, that she carried the talk further.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} in the library but a few moments when Aunt Martha entered, {{followed}} by Alice, who bore a tray containing three very large <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> some biscuit.|$|R
60|$|John, who had {{thoroughly}} {{enjoyed his}} exercise, {{sat in a}} low chair by her side, drank innumerable small <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea,</b> <b>and</b> ate buttered toast in thin strips. When they had finished, Lady Hilda rose.|$|R
500|$|The album's title {{comes from}} a saying which Fanning {{explained}} to The Age as [...] "you offer someone tea and sympathy, you sit down with them, have a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> you just talk." [...] He noted {{that there is a}} credit on an album by The Rolling Stones for the provision of [...] "tea and sympathy". [...] The album cover photography and album inlay photography is by Ami Barwell ...|$|E
500|$|Barrett made a final public {{acknowledgement}} of his musical past in 2002, his first since the 1970s, when he autographed 320 copies of photographer Mick Rock's book Psychedelic Renegades, which contained {{a number of}} photos of Barrett. Rock was perhaps the last person {{in the music industry}} with whom Barrett kept in contact. In 1971, Rock conducted the final interview of Barrett before his retirement from the music industry a few years later, and Barrett subsequently turned up on Rock's London doorstep [...] "four, maybe five times" [...] for a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> conversation through 1978, before Barrett moved back to Cambridge. They had not spoken in more than twenty years when Rock approached Barrett to autograph his photography book, and Barrett uncharacteristically agreed. Having reverted to his birth name [...] "Roger" [...] from his stage name [...] "Syd" [...] many years before, he had autographed the book simply [...] "Barrett." ...|$|E
500|$|Morgan {{admitted}} giving Figard a lift on {{the afternoon}} of 19 December 1995. He claimed that the pair had consensual sex after chatting and flirting, developing a rapport and halting at a lay-by where he made her a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> asked her for what he described as a [...] "Christmas kiss". He said afterwards he drove her to Southampton, where they exchanged contact details before he left her, and that she was [...] "smiling and happy". He did not come forward after police appealed for details of the driver who had given her a lift because he did not want his wife to learn of his infidelity. He claimed her photographs and other belongings were in his possession because she had left them in his truck, and the mattress had become stained with blood because a man had lain on it after gashing his leg while the vehicle was on loan to another driver in 1994.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the kettle}} began to sing, she poured out the two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea,</b> <b>and</b> in handing him his their fingers touched, {{and she gave}} a little outcry. [...] "Oh! Madeline's {{precious}} cup! I {{thought it was going}} to drop!" ...|$|R
50|$|A related {{phenomenon}} {{arose in}} the early 1990s when PG Tips released a series of tea-based pogs, with pictures <b>of</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> chimpanzees on them. Tetley's tea released competing pogs but never matched {{the popularity of the}} PG Tips variety.|$|R
50|$|On the April 17, 2011 {{broadcast}} of CBS News' 60 Minutes, correspondent Steve Kroft alleged inaccuracies in Mortenson's books Three <b>Cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tea</b> <b>and</b> its sequel, Stones into Schools: Promoting Peace with Books, Not Bombs, in Afghanistan and Pakistan {{as well as}} financial improprieties {{in the operation of}} the Central Asia Institute.|$|R
2500|$|Reddy {{became a}} {{naturalized}} American citizen in 1974, subsequently availing herself {{of the opportunity}} to maintain dual American/Australian citizenship when the opportunity was made available. [...] "I feel like I'd like to have a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> a good cry," [...] Reddy said after the ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Don Ritchie, {{a former}} Second World War Naval veteran and retired {{insurance}} agent, {{was awarded a}} Medal of the Order of Australia for preventing suicides at The Gap. From 1964, Ritchie saved 164 people from jumping from the cliffs by crossing the road from his property and engaging them in conversation, often beginning with the words, [...] "Can I help you in some way?" [...] Afterwards Ritchie would invite them {{back to his home}} for a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> a chat. Some would return years later to thank him for his efforts in talking them out of their decision. Ritchie, who was nicknamed the [...] "Angel of The Gap", died in May 2012.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1998, Essam Marzouk and Mohammed Zeki Mahjoub {{were also}} {{introduced}} {{to each other}} at the home of Khadr's in-laws while he was in Toronto. Also that year, Mahmoud Jaballah met Khadr, having invited him to share a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> discuss their mutual experiences in Peshawar, Pakistan, after Khadr's mother-in-law took his wife grocery shopping. At some point, Mohammad Harkat met Khadr in Ottawa {{and the two of them}} shared a van back to Toronto. Harkat claims that he met Khadr through his roommate Mohamed El Barseigy, and that Khadr was silent during most of the trip, and his only advice to Harkat was [...] "tell the truth to immigration authorities". Harkat and Jaballah would both later be jailed on security certificates which cited their contact with Khadr as a factor in their detention.|$|E
60|$|It {{was exactly}} twenty minutes after their {{entrance}} into the teashop when the woman finished her monologue. She began to draw on her gloves again. Before them were two untasted <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> an untouched plate of bread and butter. From {{a corner of the}} room the waitress was watching them curiously.|$|R

50|$|Among the {{thousands}} of graduates from the University of South Dakota, notable alumni {{in the field of}} journalism include Al Neuharth, founder of the USA Today B.A., 1946; Greg Mortenson, author <b>of</b> Three <b>Cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tea</b> <b>and</b> Stones into Schools B.A., 1983; Tom Brokaw, American broadcaster and longtime NBC Nightly News anchor B.A., 1964.|$|R
2500|$|Ryan, one of {{the last}} actors to be cast, was invited because Iñárritu had seen her in the play Detroit. Lindsay Duncan had vast {{experience}} in the theatre world too, and decided to accept the offer to play the critic because {{of the quality of the}} script. [...] "It's delicious because of the writing." [...] But like Shiner's character, Iñárritu found casting Laura difficult. Riseborough met him on a street corner for a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea,</b> <b>and</b> recalling the event, said [...] "I told him that I would crawl across hot coals to work with him". Iñárritu described Laura as [...] "a very wacky, quirky role", but said [...] "when [...] did it I knew that it was her, because she did it right in the tone, and she understood who she was – she was not judging".|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began at Island Records' newly opened Basing Street Studios, London, {{at the same}} time as Jethro Tull's Aqualung in December 1970. Upon the recommendation of Fleetwood Mac, the band then moved to Headley Grange, a remote Victorian Estate house in East Hampshire, England, to conduct additional recordings. Here they used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Jimmy Page later recalled: [...] "We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do." [...] This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band. As is explained by Dave Lewis, [...] "By moving into Headley Grange for the whole period of recording, many of the tracks [...] were made up on the spot and committed to tape almost there and then." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Hitchhiker's Guide to Technology" [...] {{claims that}} if you make {{yourself}} a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> attempt to get an object working and the tea goes cold before you finish, {{you are dealing with}} technology. Other guides include the Hitchhiker's Guide to Blogging, the Hitchhiker's Guide to Deadlines and the Hitchhiker's Guide to How to be Cool which discusses how an individual can truly be cool, instead of by following crowds, but concludes by suggesting the listener attend a showing of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Guide to Websites, which only appeared on the official UK movie website, described a website as [...] "a wonderful new invention that allows people you neither know nor care about to inform you what they had for breakfast this morning, without all that tedious mucking about in the postal system". The Guide to Fanboys, written by Touchstone Pictures' copywriters as part of their promotion of the movie, only ever appeared as website text. Though released {{at the same time as}} the iTunes entries, it was never intended to be recorded and is otherwise unconnected with the Fry/Talbot/Browse works.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2015, the BBC’s Mark Savage reported: [...] "Firmin {{said the}} Clangers surrealism {{had led to}} accusations that Postgate was taking hallucinogenic drugs". Firmin told Savage: [...] "People used to say, Ooh, whats Oliver on, {{with all of these}} weird ideas? And we used to say, Hes on <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> biscuits." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{married his}} {{secretary}} Moira Creamer in 1966. His younger brother Harold {{worked as a}} promotion man for EMI Music Publishing.Franz would consume copious <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> cigarettes {{at any time of}} day, but especially during recording sessions. He was proud of his Rolls Royce car which he bought from Harry Secombe, another successful artist of the 1950s and 1960s that Franz had produced.|$|R
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his return from Italy, Etty had a very limited social life. In a typical day he would wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he would take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he would drink two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea,</b> <b>and</b> go to bed at midnight.|$|R

5000|$|Lynne McGranger, who portrays Roberts, {{said of her}} role, [...] "Having to {{play that}} 'losing your mind' stuff was really a stretch for {{something}} like Home And Away, and for someone like Irene, who's very comfortably swanning around Summer Bay for 13 or 14 years, making people <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> solving their problems...Sometimes {{you get a little}} too comfortable and that really jolted me out of my comfort zone. It was exhausting but exhilarating." ...|$|R
50|$|For over 80 {{years the}} family-run firm of Smith and Pepper {{produced}} gold jewellery {{from the factory}} that is now the Museum of the Jewellery Quarter, with very few changes in working practices, equipment or {{the appearance of the}} workshop. When the elderly owners retired in 1981, they simply locked the door. Everything was left as it was: tools on benches, overalls hanging on coat hooks, even <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> jars <b>of</b> jam and Marmite.|$|R

[...] "Stones Into Schools..." [...] is a follow-up to Three <b>Cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tea</b> <b>and</b> explores the progress of Mortenson's seventeen-year effort to promote female literacy and education, {{with an emphasis on}} the expansion of his efforts into Afghanistan, and his expressed admiration to help the U.S. military to promote peace and build relationships with the Afghan shura (leaders).|$|R

50|$|Bob Franklin {{introduced}} a single pre-recorded sketch, {{with a live}} introduction around the coffee table covered with a full complement <b>of</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> cucumber sandwiches. As the weeks progressed, the evening supper expanded to include cakes {{and an array of}} other finger food, even doilies. Paul Hester became caught up in the elegant atmosphere and began serving the refreshments in an apron, in an effeminate manner. One particularly hilarious sketch involved Stephen Curry being gunned down for using sandwich bread when making toast.|$|R
60|$|He was {{an early}} riser, often before daybreak in the winter when the nights were long. On such {{occasions}} he lit his own fire and wrote or read by candle-light. He breakfasted at seven in summer, at eight in winter. Two small <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> three or four cakes of Indian meal (called hoe cakes), formed his frugal repast. Immediately after breakfast he mounted his horse and visited {{those parts of the}} estate where any work was going on, seeing to every thing with his own eyes, and often aiding with his own hand.|$|R
