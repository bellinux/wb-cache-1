5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, <b>collisions</b> between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, <b>collisions</b> can be more common. Such <b>collisions</b> can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} <b>collisions</b> of cometary debris during the {{formation}} period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of <b>collisions</b> early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is {{only a small part of}} the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|Dust and {{possibly}} water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a {{process by which}} stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the Poynting–Robertson effect. At the same time, these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual <b>collisions.</b> The time scale {{for all of the}} dust in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani's estimated age. Hence, the current dust disk must have been created by <b>collisions</b> or other effects of larger parent bodies, and the disk represents a late stage in the planet-formation process. It would have required <b>collisions</b> between 11 Earth masses' worth of parent bodies to have maintained the disk in its current state over its estimated age.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the development of}} <b>collision</b> avoidance control for tele-operated dual robotic arm. The main aim of this project was to develop <b>collision</b> avoidance control to minimize the <b>collision</b> in human robot interaction. In absence of work cell mapping, <b>collision</b> checking in tele-operated robotic arm is commonly performed based on the motor current or torque. However, the <b>collision</b> checking based on motor current or torque cannot predict the <b>collision.</b> To overcome this issue <b>collision</b> avoidance based on proximity sensor and <b>collision</b> checking based on the unified robot description file are presented in this thesis. Test results obtained from <b>collision</b> checking using sonar sensors are presented. The {{findings suggest that the}} performance of the <b>collision</b> avoidance control is effective in minimizing risk of <b>collision</b> in tele-operation...|$|R

5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and <b>collisions.</b> Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in <b>collisions.</b> For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E

Previous researches on <b>collision</b> detection of humanoid robots which reduce <b>collision</b> pairs or simplify a shape of a robot has disadvantages such as increasing the dangerousness or decreasing range of movement. However our self <b>collision</b> detection system uses detailed geometric model and <b>collision</b> pairs as many as possible. We have experimentally evaluated <b>collision</b> detection li-braries on a real-time self <b>collision</b> detection application of a humanoid robot. This experiment suggests that AABBs based method is much faster than conventional OBBs based method.

40|$|Long-standing {{concerns}} about the accuracy of stochastic particle <b>collision</b> algorithms in Monte Carlo simulations {{have given rise to}} hybrid <b>collision</b> algorithms, which incorporate ideas from deterministic <b>collision</b> calculations in order to improve the realism of the <b>collision</b> calculation. Some hybrid <b>collision</b> algorithms have spread across commercial and research computational fluid dynamics codes without prior validation. The current work focuses on the predicted incidence of <b>collision,</b> using mathematical analyses and computational tests to validate the stochastic and hybrid concepts. Employing simplified cases permits direct mathematical evaluation of the accuracy of the candidate algorithms. Results indicate that hybrid <b>collision</b> algorithms fail if the predicted <b>collision</b> probability does not scale proportionally to the <b>collision</b> cross-section, relative velocity, number of computational particles and computational time-step. Based on these findings, a general guideline for proper hybridization of deterministic <b>collision</b> algorithms is given. Following these guidelines, hybrid <b>collision</b> algorithms are as accurate as stochastic <b>collision</b> algorithms, with some specific benefits and disadvantages...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{new method}} in robot path {{generation}} is presented using {{an analysis of}} the characteristics of multi-robot <b>collision</b> avoidance. The research is based on the concept of the <b>collision</b> map, where the <b>collision</b> between two robots is presented by a <b>collision</b> region and a crossing curve TLVSTC (traveled length versus servo time curve). Analytic <b>collision</b> avoidance is considered by translating the <b>collision</b> region in the <b>collision</b> map. The 4 different translations of <b>collision</b> regions correspond to the 4 parallel movements of the actual original robot path in the real world. This analysis is applied to path modifications where the analysis of <b>collision</b> characteristics is crucial and the resultant path for <b>collision</b> avoidance is generated. Also, the correlations between the translations of the <b>collision</b> region and robot paths are clarified by analyzing the collision/non-collision areas. The influence of the changes of robot velocity is investigated analytically in view of <b>collision</b> avoidance as an example...|$|R

5|$|On Midway Atoll, <b>collisions</b> between Laysan {{albatross}} {{and aircraft}} {{have resulted in}} human and bird deaths as well as severe disruptions in military flight operations. Studies {{were made in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s that examined the results of control methods such as the killing of birds, the levelling and clearing of land to eliminate updrafts and the destruction of annual nesting sites.

5|$|The {{evolution}} of the asteroid belt after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by <b>collisions.</b> Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In the asteroid belt this usually is not the case.
