5|$|Following her husband's death, Reagan {{remained}} {{active in}} politics, particularly relating to stem cell research. Beginning in 2004, she favored what many {{consider to be}} the Democratic Party's position, and urged President George W. Bush to support federally funded embryonic stem cell research, in the hope that this science could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Although she failed to change the president's position, she did support his <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second term.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a trustee}} of both the National Gallery and Tate Gallery. His {{proposal}} that a wing of the latter should be devoted to his sculptures aroused hostility among some artists.

5|$|In 1913, {{representative}} William J. Hughes of Whatcom County {{proposed the}} formation of a commission to adopt the state flag, consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, and Adjutant General. Governor Ernest Lister became a supporter of the idea, issuing a call for designs from the state's citizens and city organizations. The <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> state flag, however, was opposed by patriotic groups like the Sons of the American Revolution and Sons of Veterans, finding the use of a state flag to be detrimental to the national flag.|$|E

5|$|In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 {{were found}} guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court martial of the Korean War. The Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the {{sentences}} and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved.

5|$|In his <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fourth term, Johnson {{concentrated}} on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent, Nathaniel G. Taylor, in August 1849, {{with a greater}} margin of victory than in previous campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded {{the formation of the}} majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat Howell Cobb was elected.|$|E

5|$|On December 23, 2009, Duhalde {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run for the presidency in the 2011 presidential elections. Néstor Kirchner had been succeeded by Cristina Kirchner in the presidency, staying as a highly influential figure, and it was still unclear which of the Kirchners would run in 2011. Many mayors of the Buenos Aires province were unsure whether to support Duhalde or the Kirchners. Duhalde organized the Federal Peronism faction, with members of the PJ opposing the Kirchners. Néstor Kirchner died in October 2010; the subsequent state funeral halted the <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few months.|$|E

He faced Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives Robert N. Stanfield in the May 1918 Republican primary. McNary defeated Stanfield 52,546 to 30,999. In the November general election, he defeated a friend and former governor, Oswald West, 82,360 to 64,303, to win a full, six-year term in the Senate. Meanwhile, Frederick W. Mulkey won the election to replace McNary and finished Lane's original term, which would end in January 1919, and Mulkey took office on November 6, 1918, replacing McNary in that seat.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Andrew was appointed commander of the 22nd Battalion, which he led during the Battles of Greece, Crete and {{the early part of the}} North African <b>Campaign.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> short period in late 1941 he commanded an infantry brigade of the 2nd New Zealand Division, and received the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership.

5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, {{if they did not}} name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} months in New Guinea, Whitehead {{concentrated}} on {{building up the}} infrastructure there. He obtained additional engineer units and construction equipment. New airfields were developed, along with roads, housing, taxiways and revetments to protect his aircraft from the frequent Japanese air raids. He also attempted {{to build up the}} morale and leadership of his units. These months coincided with the Kokoda Track <b>campaign.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> time, despite the efforts of his airmen and the ground troops, the Japanese advanced steadily on Port Moresby, but they ultimately turned back short of it. For his part in the Papuan campaign, Whitehead was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The Australian government made him an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent MacDowall, {{had played}} a major role in subduing the North-West Rebellion at the end of his term in office. He would not run for {{re-election}} instead choosing to <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> seat in the Canadian House of Commons. Dr. Porter attempted to win a seat by running for office a second time. Porter was challenged by Captain Owen E. Hughes, a business man from Duck Lake. Hughes had been the captain of the Prince Albert militia unit that was disbanded by the Federal Government prior to the start of the North-West Resistance. Many of his former unit, including his lieutenant, Gabriel Dumont, were among the Metis who drove the loyalist forces back at the Battle of Fish Creek.|$|E
5|$|Khan's {{selection}} {{as a candidate}} was {{seen as part of}} a wider move towards the left in Labour that emerged during the 2015 leadership election that followed Miliband's resignation. Key policies that Khan proposed included a London 'living rent'; a quota system for ethnic minority officers in the Metropolitan Police; increased home building; and a <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> London Living Wage. Commentators raised Khan's Muslim religion as a potential barrier to election, after a poll (not mentioning Khan by name) suggested that 31% of Londoners would be 'uncomfortable' with a Muslim mayor. Khan, who was London's first Muslim MP, argued that the election of a Muslim could encourage London to become recognised as a more cosmopolitan city. While Khan had stated that he would serve a full term as MP for Tooting if he were to become Mayor of London, he later announced that would stand down as MP for Tooting if he were elected Mayor.|$|E
