40|$|Intercreditor equity {{represents}} one of the main objectives of bankruptcy proceedings. Yet, recent restructurings of sovereign debt suggest that violation of intercreditor equity is common. While existing contractual provisions, and guidelines issued by creditor committees, establish fundamental principles about creditor treatment, they seem to remain too vague to guide debt restructuring processes effectively. The paper focuses on distribution, and argues that lack of clear guidelines for distribution may complicate and delay the resolution process and induce undue uncertainty about the predictability and viability of the restructuring outcome. The paper discusses and proposes parameters which may contribute to establishing explicit principles for the assessment of intercreditor equity in distribution.

40|$|This paper assesses Serbia and Montenegro’s First Review Under the Extended Arrangement (EA). Serbia and Montenegro’s {{economic}} and policy performance has remained good {{under the current}} EA, but daunting challenges lie ahead. Macroeconomic policies need to be carefully calibrated to address potential risks to macro{{economic and}} financial instability, while the task of economic restructuring will be increasingly difficult. The IMF staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to address delays in the adoption of reform legislation that led to nonobservance of some structural benchmarks and notes the need to avoid new slippages.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the macro-stabilization programs, the {{negative}} growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995-1997. Croatia began its independence with a relatively low external debt because the debt of Yugoslavia was not shared among its former republics at the beginning. In March 1995 Croatia agreed with the Paris Club of creditor governments and took 28,5% of Yugoslavia's previously non-allocated debt over 14 years. In July 1996 an agreement was reached with the London Club of <b>commercial</b> <b>creditors,</b> when Croatia took 29,5% of Yugoslavia's debt to commercial banks. In 1997 around 60 percent of Croatia's external debt was inherited from former Yugoslavia.|$|R

To date, only a handful of countries (Costa Rica, Mexico, Uruguay, and Venezuela) have successfully concluded their debt reduction negotiations through a Brady Plan with <b>commercial</b> <b>creditors.</b> Others, such as the Philippines, have engaged in Brady-type debt reduction for part of their outstanding commercial debt.
