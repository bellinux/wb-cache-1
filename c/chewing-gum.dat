25|$|Food and sucrose have a demineralizing {{effect upon}} enamel {{that has been}} reduced by adding calcium lactate to food. Calcium lactate added to {{toothpaste}} has reduced calculus formation. One study has shown that calcium lactate enhances enamel remineralization when added to xylitol-containing gum, but another study showed no additional remineralization benefit from calcium lactate or other calcium compounds in <b>chewing-gum.</b>|$|E
500|$|However, {{a couple}} of days after the station opened, there were some {{problems}} in and around the station, which multiple news outlets criticized. An escalator broke down on September 14, just a day after the station's opening. In an unrelated September 16 incident, a straphanger got injured while walking up another escalator at the 34th Street station. Earlier that day, the New York Post reported on signal problems in the brand-new tunnels around the station, while riders complained about the delays on Twitter and Reddit. A Wall Street Journal commentator remarked that [...] "it's only a matter of months (make that weeks) before the gleaming station ... is pockmarked with <b>chewing-gum</b> spots, urban scrawl and litter." [...] Overall, however, the station received positive acclaim during its first few days of service. In an article in several newspapers distributed by NYC Community Media, Lenore Skenazy writes that many riders have praised the station's design, its cleanliness, and its climate-controlled platforms, and noted herself that the station looked and felt [...] "as uplifting as a cathedral".|$|E
50|$|In {{the book}} Deviant, author Harold Schechter {{mentions}} that American serial killer Ed Gein chewed Black Jack gum during his sanity hearing.In the TV series Homeland, Saul Berenson {{is fond of}} those <b>chewing-gums.</b> Black Jack gum was also used in the television show Boardwalk Empire. It was featured in Nucki's flashbacks in Season 5, Episode 6.|$|R
40|$|Seventeen {{subjects}} {{with more than}} 3 x 10 (5) mutans streptococci per millilitre of saliva completed this randomised, cross-over study. Four different <b>chewing-gums,</b> containing: (1) 70 % xylitol, (2) 35 % xylitol + 35 % sorbitol, (3) 17. 5 % xylitol + 52. 5 % sorbitol, and (4) 70 % sorbitol, were tested. The participants used 12 pieces of each gum per day for 25 days. During the four experimental periods, they wore a removable palatinal plate containing two demineralised enamel samples, and brushed their teeth with a non-fluoridated toothpaste. The results showed that an increased concentration of xylitol in the gum resulted in a lower number of mutans streptococci in both saliva and dental plaque, although the decreases were only significant in the saliva samples (p < 0. 01). The pH drop in plaque, measured in vivo after a 1 -min mouthrinse with a 10 % sorbitol solution, was least pronounced after the 70 % xylitol gum and most pronounced after the 70 % sorbitol gum period (p < 0. 01). No {{significant differences were found}} after a mouthrinse with a 10 % sucrose solution. All demineralised enamel samples lost mineral during the experimental periods. However, the lesion depth as well as the mineral loss values, assessed microradiographically, did not differ significantly between the four <b>chewing-gums...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to present {{chemical}} structure and basic characteristics of some active substances in medical plants which are used in stomatology. Considering their chemical content and pharmacological effects, all active substances of herbal origin are divided in four groups tannins, flavonoids, aetheric oils and the group of herbal species which show immunostimulating effect. Tannins are active substances of medical plants whose function are primarily based on precipitation of proteins and are used for disinfection of skin and oral mucose {{as well as for}} haemostatic purposes. Flavonoids are herbal pigments. They work as diuretics, and in dentistry they could be used as antiinflammatory agents. Essential oils are part of herbal species and are used as korigens of taste and smell. For their antiseptic and disinfective effects, essential oils are used in dentistry as preparations like toothpastes, mouth wash and <b>chewing-gums.</b> Immunostimulators of herbal origin are especially interesting in the decreasing immunity treatment for their slight toxic characteristics...|$|R
500|$|Critics have {{sometimes}} struggled {{to define the}} immense public appreciation for the film. In an interview, Freeman said, [...] "About everywhere you go, people say, The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw [...] " [...] and that such praise [...] "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, [...] "I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, {{there are people who}} say, 'That movie changed my life' ". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, [...] "If that isn't the best , it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it." [...] In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was [...] "a <b>chewing-gum</b> movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe".|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{sentencing}} inside the courtroom, news channel Tv2 recorded Kristiansen reaction {{while he had}} a {{grin on his face}} while chewing <b>chewing-gum.</b> They later aired the video-tape during the evening news, after Kristiansens lawyer told the media that Kristiansen had been [...] "absolutely devastated" [...] by the verdict. In a 2008 interview, Kristiansen explained his reaction, saying that he was smiling at the mere [...] "absurdity of the situation", he also accused the media of using the clip to portray him as a [...] "cold-blooded monster without emotions". This incident sparked a long legal conflict between Tv2 and the court, due to a law, banning recording of defendants inside court-rooms. Tv2 was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 The CW {{entered into}} a {{partnership}} with the makers of Stride brand <b>chewing-gum</b> to give viewers the opportunity to create their own Smallville digital comic, titled Smallville: Visions. The writers and producers developed the comic's beginning and end, but allowed viewers to provide the middle. The CW began this tie-in campaign with the March 13, 2008 episode [...] "Hero", where Pete develops superhuman elasticity after chewing some kryptonite-infused Stride gum. Going to The CW's website, viewers vote on one of two options—each adding four pages to the comic—every Tuesday and Thursday until the campaign ended on April 7, 2008. For season seven, Smallville again worked with Sprint, bringing its customers [...] "mobisodes" [...] featuring Clark's cousin Kara, titled Smallville Legends: Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program was to determine a new way in caries and erosion prevention. To achieve this target was analyzed the more effective anti-caries and anti-erosive bio-active molecules of natural origin, in order to elaborate a new novel chewing gum device. The under discussion molecules were plant polyphenols and casein-phosphopeptides. The research project has been divided in three parts: initially, was analyzed in vitro, through SEM inspection and pH analysis, the remineralizing effect of casein-phosphopeptides against cola drink dental erosion. In the second part, a microbiological assay of effects of Plantago lanceolata tea on oral bacteria was assessed: initially, the P. lanceolata tea was chemical analyzed for its polyphenolic content; then, the MIC and MBC were determined for P. lanceolata extracts against cariogenic bacteria; subsequently, a controlled random clinical study was conducted on 44 volunteers to evaluate a P. lanceolata-based mouth rinse on cariogenic bacteria content in saliva. In the third part, in vitro experiments were performed using a specifically designed chewing apparatus to test the release in artificial saliva of Calcium (derived from CPP) and Quercetin included in gums, during the chewing time; while the in vivo experiments required a two sessions clinical trial, performed by 10 volunteers, in order to analyze the in vivo performance of the experimental <b>chewing-gums...</b>|$|R

The four of them went by taxi to a Chinese restaurant in Regent Street. There Billy asked her to come outside and according to Heinberg, when Kempton returned her mouth was twitching. Heinberg asked if Kempton was eating something to which Kempton replied [...] "I have been drugged ...

2500|$|His {{business}} quickly grew as Mac Robertson Steam Confectionery Works. [...] By {{the late}} 1880s the business employed thirty people. [...] The company introduced <b>chewing-gum</b> and fairy floss to Australia {{as well as}} well known confectionery [...] names including Freddo Frog, Cherry Ripe, Old Gold Chocolates, Milk Kisses and Columbines. [...] By 1900, it had become the largest confectionery works in Australia with agencies in every state. [...] As part of his marketing strategy, Macpherson maintained a distinctive whiteness to everything he could - the buildings in the Fitzroy factory complex were all painted white {{and all of his}} several thousand employees wore white uniforms.

2500|$|The growing Carmichael family, which {{included}} Hoagy, Ruth, and their sons, Hoagy Bix (born in 1938) and Randy Bob (born in 1940), {{moved into the}} former mansion of <b>chewing-gum</b> heir William P. Wrigley, Jr. in Los Angeles in 1942, when the United States entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Carmichael, a Republican, had voted for Wendell Willkie for U.S. president in 1940, and was often aghast at the left-leaning political views of his Hollywood friends. His contribution {{to the war effort}} was similar to other patriotic efforts by Irving Berlin ("This Is the Army, Mr. Jones"), Johnny Mercer ("G.I. Jive"), and Frank Loesser ("Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition"). Carmichael's wartime songs (most with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) included [...] "My Christmas Song for You," [...] "Don't Forget to Say 'No' Baby," [...] "Billy-a-Dick," [...] "The Army of Hippocrates," [...] "Cranky Old Yank," [...] "Eager Beaver," [...] "No More Toujours l'Amour," [...] "Morning Glory," [...] and the never-completed [...] "Hitler Blues."

2500|$|Attack {{training}} {{took place}} on ground marked to show the German defences and officers of flanking battalions attended training sessions to ensure that plans were compatible. A scale model of the ridge was built by the IX Corps Chief Engineer on the Scherpenberg Hill between Locre and La Clytte, with boards around the edges for about a company of men to examine the model together. To assist with communication a message map was devised with the map {{on one side and}} a form on the other containing a list of the information needed by the recipient to act on it. Supply dumps for the 36th, 16th and 19th divisions were established at Lindenhoek crossroads and on the Lindenhoek–Neuve Eglise road and beyond these was an advanced dump a brigade dump and one for each of the six attacking battalions. A pack-transport system and [...] packs for carriers were issued, along with plans to carry up a hot meal to the front line on the midnight before the attack. Oranges, Oxo cubes, <b>chewing-gum</b> and lime juice were issued to each man and every fourth man had a tin of solidified alcohol for cooking.|$|E

60|$|They are terribly {{anxious for}} the villain {{to get his}} bullet, and that I take to be a humane and proper sentiment. They spend freely the ten cents that is not saved without a struggle.

6000|$|With exclamations of [...] "Well, by golly!" [...] and [...] "You {{got to go}} some to {{beat this}} dump!" [...] Babbitt admired the Chateau.

6000|$|Nelly {{was very}} {{pleasant}} to Mr. Wrenn, but {{she called him}} neither Billy nor anything else, and mostly she talked to Miss Proudfoot, smiling at him, but saying nothing when {{he managed to get}} out a jest about Mrs. Arty's <b>chewing-gum.</b> When he moved to her side with a wooden plate of cream-cheese sandwiches (which Tom humorously termed [...] "cold-cream wafers") Mr. Wrenn started to explain how he had come to enter Istra's room.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Comrade Windsor," [...] he said, [...] "let us stroll gently homewards {{down the}} Great White Way. What matter though it be fairly stiff with low-browed bravoes in tall-shaped hats? They cannot harm us. From me, if they search me thoroughly, they may scoop {{a matter of}} eleven dollars, a watch, two stamps, and a packet of <b>chewing-gum.</b> Whether they would do any better with you I do not know.

6000|$|... "Why, whoever rubs {{the lamp}} or the ring. They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they've {{got to do}} {{whatever}} he says.
