40|$|<b>Coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} diseases to treat in the modern dairy industry. Curative therapy with antibiotics remains only moderately effective and depends on the stage at which the disease is treated, The most successful strategies for combating <b>coliform.</b> <b>mastitis</b> appear to be prevention by hygienic management or prophylactic immunization. The severity of clinical symptoms of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> has been shown to be reduced by immunization with the Escherichia coli J 5 vaccine. However, although the J 5 vaccine has been licensed in the United States for about 10 years, the immunological basis of its mechanism of action is still unknown. Until now, protection by J 5 vaccination has often been explained by a straight forward mechanism of enhanced antibody production resulting in increased opsonization of coliform bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The possibility that J 5 vaccination could decrease risk factors for <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> such as impaired blood polymorphonuclcar neutrophil leukocyte (PMN) diapedesis has never been investigated. This review provides arguments to support the hypothesis that J 5 vaccination may reduce the severity of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> by inducing a condition of mammary gland hyper-responsiveness, characterized by a T helper 1 (Th 1) response and mediated by memory cells inside the mammary gland, finally resulting in enhanced PMN diapedesis upon an intramammary infection...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGram-negative {{bacteria}} that commonly cause bovine mastitis {{are classified as}} environmental pathogens. The point sources of coliform {{bacteria that}} cause infections include bedding materials, soil, manure and other organic matter in the environment of cows. Rates of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> increase during climatic periods that maximize populations in the environment. The portal of entry into the mammary gland for Gram-negative bacteria is the teat canal. Once in the gland, bacteria must utilize available substrates in the mammary secretion to replicate and evade host defenses. Rates of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> are greater during the transitional phases of the non- lactating period than during lactation. The ability to infect the non-lactating gland {{is directly related to}} the ability of bacteria to acquire iron from the mammary secretion. The primary host defense against <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> during lactation is the elimination of bacteria by neutrophils migrating into the gland in response to inflammation. Damage to the host is mediated by the release of endotoxin. The severity and duration of clinical signs associated with <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> are reduced by the use of core-antigen bacterins...|$|E

40|$|Non-saleable milk (waste milk, WM) is {{contaminated}} with an undefined spectrum of potentially harmful pathogens and antimicrobial residues. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the impact of feeding bulk milk (BM) or WM - both pasteurized or not - on calf performance, health and the antibiotic resistance of specific faecal bacteria. A total of 114 calves from a large-scale dairy were housed outdoors in individual hutches and were randomly assigned to one of four feeding groups. The calves were fed either WM, pasteurized WM (pWM), BM or pasteurized BM (pBM) from day 3 to 56 of life. Milk samples taken from the pasteurizer and calves' nipple buckets were investigated at regular intervals for total plate count and counts of thermoduric bacteria, <b>coliforms</b> and <b>mastitis</b> pathogens. Faecal samples were taken on days 2, 14, 28 and 56 of life from randomly selected calves of the WM, pWM and BM groups (each N =  8 - 9) and processed to obtain from each sample preferably two isolates of Escherichia (E.) coli and Enterococcus spp. respectively. Isolates were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents by broth microdilution. Daily weight gain, milk and calf starter intake and health parameters did not differ significantly between the calves of the four feeding groups. The proportion of resistant E. coli isolates was significantly higher in calves fed WM and in calves fed pWM (most pronounced for cephalosporins) than in calves receiving BM. No differences in resistance were found for Enterococus spp. Thus, the concerns for selecting resistant faecal bacteria by feeding WM seem to be justified. Nonetheless, pasteurized WM of cows not treated with antimicrobials represents an acceptable feed for young calves...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{expression}} of several acute phase cytokines, such as IL 1, IL 8 and TNF-α, have been {{positively correlated with}} the most severe clinical symptoms often associated with <b>coliform</b> or endotoxin-induced <b>mastitis.</b> Very little information is available on buffalo transcriptome. No information is available on mastitis related genes in buffaloes thus, the main aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the buffalo transcriptome for extracting sequence of mastitis related genes (IL- 1 B, IL 6, IL 8 and IL- 12 B), the {{expression of}} these genes across various tissues using RNA-Seq, analyse the functional pathways and confer the phylogenetic relationship of these Interleukin genes with other species. IL 1 B revealed high expression in lungs while IL 8 in mammary gland and IL 12 B in kidney respectively. The phylogenetic analysis revealed a clear homology between buffalo and cattle ILs. The results were confirmed by constructing gene and species tree. In species tree, Bos taurus was nearest to Bubalus bubalis followed by Ovis aries thereby grouping the whole Bovidae family together. The gene tree constructed with the help of Maximum likelihood methods clearly clustered IL 1 B and IL 8 in one clade. This may be attributed to structural and functional relationship of IL 8 induced after exposure to a variety of inflammatory stimuli including bacteria, oxidative stress, LPS, TNF and IL 1 B. Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate IL genes provided insights into their patterns and process of gene evolution...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Mastitis is {{one among}} the top three threats faced by dairy farmers. The study was carried out to assess sub-clinical mastitis, {{management}} practices and associated risk factors for mastitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} Chandreshwor and Archalbot VDCs of Lamjung district taking 63 dairy livestock randomly each from a herd along with questionnaire survey to respective owner. Tem ml of milk sample from each quarter was taken in a sterilized syringe for further laboratory investigation. California Mastitis Test (CMT) was performed at farmer’s shed. Organisms were identified based on colony characteristics, Gram's staining and various biochemical tests. RESULTS: On CMT, subclinical mastitis was 46. 1 % (n= 29) and 30. 15 % (n= 76) on animal and quarter basis respectively, however, culture showed, 28. 6 % and 24. 2 %. Streptococcal mastitis was the commonest (11. 1 %) followed by coliform (9. 5 %) and staphylococcal (7. 9 %). Mastitis was highest in left fore quarter (34. 92 %) followed by left hind (31. 76 %), right hind (28. 57 %) and right fore (25. 39 %). <b>Coliform</b> & Staphylococcal <b>mastitis</b> was highest in left fore and right hind quarter respectively. Most of dairy animals (86 %) were on zero grazing, 30 % (n= 19) of the farmers had forage trees and only 29 % (n= 18) had known about subclinical mastitis. The average milk production was 3. 5 ± 1. 47 liters. Subclinical mastitis was associated significantly (p< 0. 01) with livestock yielding more than 3 lt per lactation. CONCLUSIONS: There was high prevalence of subclinical mastitis in dairy livestock at Lamjung due to poor management, unhygienic shed, and little knowledge on subclinical mastitis...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} factors associated with <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> in sows, determined at herd level, by applying the decision-tree technique. <b>Coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> represents an economically important disease in sows after farrowing that also affects the health, welfare and performance of the piglets. The decision-tree technique, a data mining method, may be an effective tool for making large datasets accessible and different sow herd information comparable. It is based on the C 4. 5 -algorithm which generates trees in a top-down recursive strategy. The technique can be used to detect weak points in farm management. Two datasets of two farms in Germany, consisting of sow-related parameters, were analysed and compared by decision-tree algorithms. Data were collected over the period of April 2007 to August 2010 from 987 sows (499 CM-positive sows and 488 CM-negative sows) and 596 sows (322 CM-positive sows and 274 CM-negative sows), respectively. Depending on the dataset, different graphical trees were built showing relevant factors at the herd level which may lead to <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis.</b> To our understanding, this is the first time decision-tree modeling was used to assess risk factors for <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis.</b> Herd specific risk factors for the disease were illustrated what could prove beneficial in disease and herd management...|$|E

40|$|Concurrent data on {{antimicrobial}} use (AMU) {{and resistance}} {{are needed to}} contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria. The present study examined a herd-level association between AMU and AMR in Escherichia coli (n= 394) and Klebsiella species (n= 139) isolated from bovine intramammary infections and mastitis cases on 89 dairy farms in 4 regions of Canada [Alberta, Ontario, Québec, and Maritime Provinces (Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick) ]. Antimicrobial use data were collected using inventory of empty antimicrobial containers and antimicrobial drug use rate was calculated to quantify herd-level AMU. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using Sensititre National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) gram-negative MIC plate (Trek Diagnostic Systems Inc., Cleveland, OH). Isolates were classified as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. Intermediate and resistant category isolates were combined to form an AMR category, and multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine herd-level odds of AMR to tetracycline, ampicillin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination, sulfisoxazole, streptomycin and kanamycin in E. coli isolates. In the case of Klebsiella species isolates, logistic regression models were built for tetracycline and sulfisoxazole; however, no associations between AMU and AMR in Klebsiella species were observed. Ampicillin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolates were associated with herds that used intramammarily administered cloxacillin, penicillin-novobiocin combination, and cephapirin used for dry cow therapy [odds ratios (OR) = 26, 32, and 189, respectively], and intramammary ceftiofur administered for lactating cow therapy and systemically administered penicillin (OR= 162 and 2. 7, respectively). Use of systemically administered penicillin on a dairy farm was associated with tetracycline and streptomycin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolates (OR= 5. 6 and 2. 8, respectively). Use of cephapirin and cloxacillin administered intramammarily for dry cow therapy was associated with increasing odds of having at least 1 kanamycin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolate at a farm (OR= 8. 7 and 9. 3, respectively). Use of systemically administered tetracycline and ceftiofur was associated with cefoxitin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli (OR= 0. 13 and 0. 16, respectively); however, {{the odds of a}} dairy herd having at least 1 cefoxitin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolate due to systemically administered ceftiofur increased with increasing average herd parity (OR= 3. 1).

40|$|The {{potential}} protective {{and therapeutic}} effects of bST during <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> in periparturient cows were evaluated. In a first study, 19 cows, classified as moderate or severe responders {{based on the}} respiratory burst activity of blood neutrophils, were treated with recombinant bST or vehicle 48 h after intramammary inoculation of Escherichia coli. Clinical status and changes in milk production and composition were compared in the four groups. In a second study, 8 cows received bST or vehicle 7 d before bacterial challenge. During mastitis, losses in milk production and compositional changes were most pronounced in infected glands and in severe responders. Milk production of bST cows recovered better than that of placebo cows. Recovery of milk components was accelerated in severe responders treated with bST, but not in moderate responders. Pretreatment of severe responders with bST enhanced milk production before infection, protected the mammary glands from excessive loss of milk during the subsequently induced <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis,</b> and accelerated normalization of milk composition. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of bST upon normalization of milk production and composition in periparturient cows suffering from <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> seem to be restricted to the severe responders. In severe responders that had been treated with bST, changes observed during mastitis resembled those in moderate responders treated with the placebo...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> {{has been}} a primary focus of dairy cattle disease {{research}} due to staggering affiliated losses, severe systemic complications arising from host inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide, and the poor response of coliform pathogens to antimicrobials. Reliable biomarkers are needed to evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive therapies {{for the treatment of}} inflammation associated with <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis,</b> and to aid in the approval of new veterinary drugs. The aims of the current analyses were to utilize proteomic methodologies to evaluate protein expression in whey from cows with experimentally induced <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis,</b> and to employ label-free quantification strategies to estimate changes in relative abundance of proteins identified in milk over the course of clinical infection. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI- TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) resulted in the identification of complement factors, antimicrobial proteins, and acute phase proteins in mastitic milk. Analysis using liquid chromatography (LC) inline with electrospray ionization - quadrupole TOF tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) resulted primarily in the identification of abundant whey and casein proteins, and the transient detection of proteins related to host response. Nano-LC- nanospray-MS/MS using a linear ion trap, however, led to the robust discovery of over fifty inflammatory proteins in whey from mastitic milk, including the novel markers kininogen- 2 and inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain- 4. Normalized spectral counts were compared to enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) for select proteins to assess the accuracy of the spectral count data. Similar expression patterns were detected using spectral counts and ELISA. Results indicate that proteomic methodologies can detect biomarkers of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> in bovine milk during clinical infections, and that spectral counts are a viable means of evaluating relative changes in protein biomarkers of mastitis, including those for which no antibody currently exists...|$|E

40|$|In the sow, acute <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> is {{the major}} cause of {{dysgalactia}} at parturition, a period when normal milk production is paramount {{for the survival of}} newborn piglets. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) that phagocytose and kill bacteria is the first line of defence by the immune system against E. coli infection in the mammary gland. The overall aim of this thesis was to elucidate this aspect of the sow immune system around parturition in order to gain a better background understanding of the disease. The course of events regarding the number and function of leukocytes in the blood circulation and locally in the mammary gland was described in healthy sows around parturition. At parturition, PMN reached a peak in both blood and mammary secretion. The phagocytic capacity per PMN showed no change, nor did opsonic activity in serum, while the opsonic activity in mammary secretion increased after parturition. The sum effect of the variations on mammary gland defence mechanisms is not clear. The concentrations of oestradiol- 17 β and cortisol were determined, and variations were seen in blood and mammary secretion. Directed migration and phagocytosis of PMN in colostrum and milk were compared. Chemoattractant properties of the two types of secretion were similar, while the phagocytic capacity of PMN was lower in colostrum, which may make sows more susceptible to <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> during the early postparturient period. The concentrations of oestradiol- 17 β and cortisol were greater in colostrum. In a study of experimentally induced mastitis, prepartum opsonic activity in serum and functional capacity of PMN in the blood circulation were compared between sows that remained clinically healthy and sows that developed <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> after intramammary E. coli inoculation at parturition. The pre-inoculation chemotaxis, phagocytosis and expression of CD 18 adhesion molecules did not differ between the two groups of sows. In contrast, the pre-inoculation opsonisation of E. coli tended to be better in serum from non-affected sows. Thus specific opsonins likely contribute to local protection of the mammary gland. Possibly, prepartum opsonic activity in serum can be used to predict predisposition to develop clinical mastitis in the peripartal sow. To conclude, no clear-cut evidence for a markedly depressed function of PMN was found in the mammary gland at parturition. No impaired functional capacity of PMN in the circulation was found before parturition in sows that developed mastitis after inoculation. However, the same sows had less opsonic activity for E. coli in serum before inoculation than non-affected sows, which might contribute to a susceptibility to clinical <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis...</b>|$|E

Thirty-five cases of clinical <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> were diagnosed, six in vaccinated cows and 29 in unvaccinated cows. Bacteria isolated from the clinical cases included 15 E. coli five Klebsiella pneumoniae, three K. oxytoca, three K. ozaenae, five Enterobacter aerogenes, three Serratia marcescens and one Serratia spp. Four control cows were culled, three of them because of chronic <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> and one because of postcoliform infection agalactia.

Twenty-eight elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ce, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, and Pb) were detected by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Significant differences were observed in serum K, Fe, Zn, and Br concentrations, but not in those of the remaining twenty-four elements. Furthermore, serum Fe concentrations (0. 751 ± 0. 583 μg/ml, n ＝ 18) were significantly lower in dairy cattle with a poor prognosis than in those with a good prognosis (0. 945 ± 0. 393 μg/ml, n ＝ 35, P ＜ 0. 05) and healthy controls (1. 458 ± 0. 391 μg/ml, n ＝ 39, P ＜ 0. 01).

Escherichia coli was the most common coliform species identified in milk samples from cows with mild to moderate clinical mastitis, followed by Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. At enrollment, a milk sample from the affected quarter was taken and used for on-farm culture or submitted to the laboratory. For cows in the treatment group, treatment was initiated with ceftiofur hydrochloride via intramammary infusion at 24 -h intervals for 5 d according to label standards.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} in vivo {{study was}} to examine the effect of intramammarily {{administered}} endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) on the expression of L-selectin (CD 62 L) and the beta(2) -integrin subunits CD 11 b and CD 18 on circulating bovine PMN. Six early lactating cows were infused with Escherichia coli LPS. The adhesion molecules under study were stained at the cell surface and analyzed flow cytometrically. In addition, some of the clinical parameters associated with adhesion molecule mobilization such as fever, blood cortisol levels, somatic cell count (SCC), and total and differential blood leukocyte count were measured. In analogy with observations during clinical <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis,</b> a progressive decrease of CD 62 L expression levels was observed early after LPS infusion, concomitantly with a continuous rise of CD 11 b and CD 18 density. However, no correlation was found between the kinetics of CD 11 b and CD 18 density. The initial changes in adhesion molecule expression paralleled the decrease in blood PMN numbers, together with the increase in rectal temperature, cortisol levels, SCC, and number of circulating immature PMN. In conclusion, intramammarily administered LPS seems to play an important role in modulating adhesion receptor expression on circulating bovine PMN. Interestingly, in contrast to <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis,</b> the net CD 18 variation is not principally influenced by CD 11 b upregulation during endotoxin administration.

Statistical analysis of risk factors showed, cows with 6 - 9 years of age (P= 0. 046; Odds ratio (OR), + 1. 414; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 006 - 1. 988 and 60. 7 %), cows with 4 - 7 calves (P= 0. 028; OR, + 1. 502; 95 % CI= 1. 044 - 2. 160 and 62. 2 %), and cows in late stage of lactation (P= 0. 039; OR, + 1. 947; 95 % CI= 1. 023 - 3. 702 and 68 %), were more susceptible to SCM. All the 115 organisms from SCM milk samples and 103 Escherichia coli from CM samples were confirmed by PCR techniques. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results revealed that E. coli isolates were resistant to penicillin group (93 - 99 %), fluoroquinolones (40 - 74 %), cephalosporins (54 - 66 %), oxytetracycline (91 %), gentamycin (82 %), SUL-TRM (88 %) and were sensitive to florfenicol.

The culture extract of one endophytic fungus Glomerella acutata EF 15 was found to be potent antibacterial agent against pathogenic coliform bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli responsible for causing clinical mastitis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the ultrastructural alteration in the cells of K. pneumoniae and E. coli when treated with crude ethanolic extract of G. acutata. The ethanolic extract of the endophytic fungus revealed potential to be bioprospected as antibacterial agent against pathogens causing <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis,</b> the existing havoc of dairy industries...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{mastitis}} undermines udder health, jeopardizes milk production, and entails prohibitive costs, {{estimated at}} $ 2 {{billion per year}} in the dairy industry of the United States. Despite intensive research, the dairy industry has not managed to eradicate the 3 major bovine mastitis-inducing pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, and Escherichia coli. In this study, the antimicrobial efficacy of a newly formulated biphenomycin compound (AIC 102827) was assessed against intramammary Staph. aureus, Strep. uberis, and E. coli infections, using an experimental mouse mastitis model. Based on its effective and protective doses, AIC 102827 applied into the mammary gland was most efficient to treat Staph. aureus, but also adequately reduced growth of Strep. uberis or E. coli, indicating its potential as a broad-spectrum candidate to treat staphylococcal, streptococcal, and <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> in dairy cattle...|$|E
40|$|A high {{proportion}} of intramammary coliform infections present at parturition develop disease characterized by severe inflammatory signs and sepsis during the first 60 to 70 d of lactation. In the lactating bovine mammary gland, the innate immune system plays {{a critical role in}} determining the outcome of these infections. Since the beginning of the 1990 s, research has increased significantly on bovine mammary innate defense mechanisms in connection with the pathogenesis of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis.</b> Neutrophils are key effector cells of the innate immune response to intramammary infection, and their function is influenced by many physiological events that occur during the transition period. Opportunistic infections occur when the integrity of the host immune system is compromised by physical and physiological conditions that make the host more susceptible. The innate immune system of many periparturient cows is immunocompromised. It is unlikely that periparturient immunosuppression {{is the result of a}} single physiological factor; more likely, several entities act in concert, with profound effects on the function of many organ systems of the periparturient dairy cow. Their defense system is unable to modulate the complex network of innate immune responses, leading to incomplete resolution of the pathogen and the inflammatory reaction. During the last 30 yr, most efforts have been focused on neutrophil diapedesis, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing. How these functions modulate the clinical outcome of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis,</b> and how they can be influenced by hormones and metabolism has been the subject of intensive research and is the focus of this review. The afferent (sensing) arm of innate immunity, which enables host recognition of a diverse array of pathogens, is the subject of intense research interest and may contribute to the variable inflammatory response to intramammary infections during different stages of lactation. The development of novel interventions that modulate the inflammatory response or contribute to the elimination of the pathogen or both may offer therapeutic promise in the treatment of mastitis in periparturient cows...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{incidence}} of clinical mastitis in high-yielding cows during early lactation has {{been attributed to}} a depressed functional capacity of the immune system. Sympathoadrenal factors are known {{to play an important role}} in modulating the host susceptibility and resistance to infectious diseases. Of primary importance in combating acute intramammary infections are polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), as they represent one of the early lines of immunological defense. The release of stress hormones at parturition and during the first weeks of lactation has been proposed to partly contribute to the impaired function of PMN. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the stress-induced peripheral effectors, i. e. the limbs of the sympathetic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, on PMN function around parturition and during <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis.</b> The questions as to whether and how stress induced secretion of glucocorticoids and catecholamines might affect the lactating dairy cow's udder health will be addressed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> (CM) {{represents}} an economically very important disease complex in sows that also affects the health, welfare, {{and performance of}} the piglets. Most research has concentrated on the husbandry-influenced occurrence of CM. The pathogenesis of CM suggests a prominent role for Escherichia coli and its endotoxins, although other Enterobacteriaceae species have been isolated from affected animals. Most studies on CM were conducted between 1970 and 1990. It is time {{for a closer look}} at this disease, particularly with respect to the economic damage it causes and the lack of recent literature. Treatment and use of body temperature as a single indicator for diagnosis of CM must be regarded critically. A combination of appropriate criteria should be applied to achieve a proper diagnosis and to minimize use of antibiotics. Additional approaches, for instance, incorporating knowledge concerning virulence factors of E coli, are promising tools for future prevention...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{neutrophils}} {{contain the}} enzyme acyloxyacyl hydrolase, which hydrolyzes the acyloxyacyl linkage {{of the two}} nonhydroxylated fatty acyl chains to two 3 -hydroxy fatty acids in the highly conserved lipid A part of endotoxins with high specificity. This hydrolysis decreases the toxicity of lipid A, but the immunostimulatory capacity of endotoxins is largely maintained. In two trials, we studied the activity of acyloxyacyl hydrolase in neutrophils that had been isolated from the blood of 18 dairy cows around parturition. Between 10 and 26 d after parturition, the activity of acyloxyacyl hydrolase in neutrophils decreased approximately 20 % below prepartum activity. At about 2 mo after parturition, acyloxyacyl hydrolase activity returned to prepartum values. Changes in acyloxyacyl hydrolase activity could not be attributed to changes in binding of lipopolysaccharides by the CD 14 molecules on neutrophils or monocytes. We hypothesize that decreased acyloxyacyl hydrolase activity in neutrophils shortly after parturition is a factor that increases the susceptibility of dairy cows to <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> during early lactation...|$|E
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> {{is described in}} a dairy herd from the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. During a four-month period 14 fatal cases of Klebsiella pneumoniae-related mastitis were observed in a herd of 104 lactating cows. The symptoms included peracute enterotoxemia in which the cows died 6 to 12 h after the detection of mastitis by CMT. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus agalactiae were also isolated although could not be associated with cases of acute fatal mastitis. Milking practices were also evaluated. The milking machine was being used correctly and adequate precautions for hygiene and pre-milking and post-milking teat dipping were used. The organism was sensitive to gentamicin. Therapy for acute toxic mastitis required early action {{for the treatment of}} infections, involving corticosteroids and fluid therapy. The use of a Klebsiella vaccine produced from the microorganisms isolated from the herd, associated with hygiene measures, resulted in the control of the outbreak...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{consistency of}} the relationship between intramammary infection (IMI) and somatic cell score (SCS) across several classes of cow, herd, and sampling time variables. Microbial cultures of composite milk samples were performed by New York Quality Milk Production Services from 1992 to 2004. SCS was from the most recent Dairy Herd Improvement test before IMI sampling. Records were analyzed from 79, 308 cows in 1, 124 commercial dairy herds representing a broad range of production systems. Three binary dependent variables were presence or absence of contagious IMI, environmental IMI, and all IMI. Independent variables in the initial models were SCS, SCS 2, lactation number, days in milk, sample day milk yield, use of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> vaccine, participant type (required by regulation or voluntary), production system (type of housing, milking system, and herd size), season of sampling, year of sampling, and herd; also the initial models included interactions of SCS and SCS 2 with other independent variables, except herd and milk yield. Interaction terms characterize differences in the IMI-SCS relationship across classes of the independent variables. Models were derived using the Glimmix macro in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with a logistic link function and employing backward elimination. The final model for each dependent variable included all significant independent variables and interactions. Simplified models omitted SCS 2 and all interactions with SCS. Interactions of SCS with days in milk, use of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> vaccine, participant type, season, and year were not significant in any of the models. Interaction of SCS with production system was significant for the all IMI model, whereas interaction of SCS with lactation number was significant for the environmental and all IMI models. Each 1 point increase in SCS (or doubling of somatic cell count) was associated with a 2. 3, 5. 5 %, and 9. 1 % increase in prevalence of contagious, environmental, and all IMI, respectively. Empirical receiver operator characteristic curves and areas under the curve were derived for final and simplified models. The areas under the curve for simplified and final models within each type of IMI differed by 0. 009 or less. We concluded that the relationship of IMI with SCS was generally stable over time and consistent across seasons, production systems, and cow factors. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTwelve healthy {{primiparous}} sows received intramammary inoculation with Escherichia coli (serotype O 127) {{during the}} 24 -h period preceding parturition. Mammary gland biopsy samples were taken immediately before inoculation (0  h) {{and from the}} inoculated and the contralateral non-inoculated glands 24  h after inoculation. The analyses of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), IL- 6, IL- 8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) by immunohistochemistry revealed that the production of these proinflammatory cytokines significantly increased in the inoculated mammary glands of sows that developed clinical signs of mastitis (affected group, n= 4) 24  h after inoculation. This was also true for IL- 8 in the inoculated mammary glands of sows that did not develop clinical signs of mastitis (nonaffected group, n= 8). Sows that developed clinical signs of mastitis displayed significantly lower constitutive production of IL- 1 β than did sows that remained clinically healthy. The data indicate {{that the development of}} clinical symptoms of <b>coliform</b> <b>mastitis</b> in the sow is associated with a locally increased proinflammatory cytokine production in response to intramammary E. coli infection...|$|E
