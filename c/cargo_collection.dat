Adaptor proteins {{play a central}} role in <b>cargo</b> <b>collection</b> by linking targeting signals to the endocytic machinery. We have characterized NPFX(1, 2) (NPFX[1, 2]D) targeting signals and identified the actin-associated protein Sla 1 p as the adaptor for NPFX(1, 2) D-mediated endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 11 amino acids encompassing an NPFX(1, 2) D sequence were sufficient to direct uptake of a truncated form of the pheromone receptor Ste 2 p. In this context, endocytic targeting activity was not sustained by conservative substitutions of the phenylalanine or aspartate. An NPFX 1, 2 D-related sequence was identified in native Ste 2 p that functions redundantly with ubiquitin-based endocytic signals. A two-hybrid interaction screen for NPFX(1, 2) D-interacting proteins yielded SLA 1, but no genes encoding Eps 15 homology (EH) domains, protein modules known to recognize NPF peptides. Furthermore, EH domains did not recognize an NPFX(1, 2) D signal when directly tested by two-hybrid analysis. SLA 1 disruption severely inhibited NPFX(1, 2) D-mediated endocytosis, but only marginally affected ubiquitin-directed uptake. NPFX(1, 2) D-dependent internalization required a conserved domain of Sla 1 p, SLA 1 homology domain, which selectively bound an NPFX(1, 2) D-containing fusion protein in vitro. Thus, through a novel NPF-binding domain, Sla 1 p serves as an endocytic targeting signal adaptor, providing a means to couple cargo with clathrin- and actin-based endocytic machineries...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{growth of}} freight transportation has placed significant stress on U. S. and European transportation networks. The dominance of trucking {{as the main}} mode of domestic general cargo transportation has caused environmental and societal problems, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, highway accidents, noise, and increased energy consumption. Using inland and coastal waterways, short sea shipping (SSS) can alleviate these problems. SSS can provide efficient door-to-door transportation {{as part of an}} intermodal system, where ships perform the long-haul and trucks the short haul <b>cargo</b> <b>collection</b> and distribution. This dissertation examines the economic feasibility of SSS. The environmental and societal advantages of SSS over competing modes are translated into lower external costs. External costs or externalities are the hidden costs not reflected in transportation prices. This non-inclusion is considered a market failure by economists. Estimating their monetary value is a challenging task. There is an inherent subjectivity, imprecision, and vagueness in current external cost valuation methods. This dissertation addresses this vagueness and imprecision of externalities using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic treats subjectivity with mathematical rigor. Several factors that determine the impact level of transportation externalities are modeled as fuzzy input variables. The outputs are the damage costs of major air pollutants and the external costs of traffic congestion. A fuzzy inference system can provide site-specific monetary estimation for these externalities under defined conditions, instead of average values. The results show that SSS has great potential for further improving its environmental performance by lowering ship emissions at ports, where most of its external costs occur, by implementing procedures, such as “cold ironing. ” The dissertation assesses the feasibility and competitiveness of SSS, in comparison to the all-truck mode, in two realistic cases of prospective short sea operations along the U. S. East Coast. SSS is highly competitive, due to its significant energy efficiencies. Furthermore, its environmental performance, in terms of monetary impact of emissions is superior, due to location. Combining the internal costs with the external cost estimates, the two case studies demonstrate the fair pricing principle in freight transportation, where prices are based on the full social cost of a transportation mode...|$|E

Este conglomerado de lojas de diversos setores proporciona comodidade ao p?blico que o frequenta, no sentido de encontrar no mesmo ambiente uma gama de ofertas. A fim de entender o funcionamento do trabalho dos vendedores desse ambiente, esta disserta??o procura compreender a racionalidade do trabalho dos vendedores de Shopping Centers na cidade de Manaus. Para tanto, busca contextualizar esse ramo econ?mico que ainda ? objeto de indecis?o conceitual dado a gama de servi?os que oferecem. Apresentaremos o desenvolvimento dos Shopping Centers no mundo, no Brasil e em Manaus, para assim demonstrar como o trabalho dos vendedores ? influenciado por mecanismos de gest?o taylorista e toyotista respons?veis pela precariza??o de sua atividade. Avaliaremos tamb?m o ambiente da loja que, determina o decoro profissional e a maneira de agir do vendedor, que, amparado por uma fachada, trabalha como um ator na tentativa de seduzir seu cliente para a compra. Conclu?mos que essa forma de trabalho assume um car?ter tempor?rio dado o alto n?vel de desgaste f?sico e mental, oriundo da exaustiva carga de cobran?a, usurpadora do tempo de lazer desses vendedores. O presente trabalho acad?mico est? estruturado em tr?s cap?tulos e tem como base te?rica para o estudo da racionalidade do trabalho em Shopping Center, autores cl?ssicos da Sociologia do Trabalho, da Geografia, da Administra??o, da Economia e outras ?reas pertinentes, como; Bourdieu (1977), Durkheim (1995), Marx (2011, 2008, 2002, 1996, 1948), Engels (2002, 1996), Weber (2004, 2001), Goffman (2009) e Friedmann e Naville (1973), bem como outros autores, a saber: Kon (1999), Giddens (2000), Harvey (1992), Ohno (1997), Pochmann (2004), Sorj (2000) e Santos (2000, 2006). One of {{the places}} {{commonly}} used for leisure and shopping is the Shopping Mall. This store conglomerate of various sectors provides convenience {{to the public that}} attends, to find in the same environment a range of offers. In order to better understand the operation of a Shopping Mall this dissertation seeks to understand the rationality of the work of Shopping Malls vendors in the city of Manaus. Therefore, it seeks to contextualize the economic branch that work which is still conceptual indecision fruit given the range of services they offer. Describing the development of Shopping Malls in the world, in Brazil and in Manaus, so as to demonstrate how the work of is influenced by Taylorist management mechanisms and Toyotist responsible for the precariousness of their activity, as well as the store environment that determine the propriety, the way of the seller all the time working as an actor in an attempt to entice your customer to purchase supported by a facade. We conclude that this type of work takes on a temporary basis given the high level of physical and mental strain, derived from the comprehensive <b>cargo</b> <b>collection,</b> leisure time usurping these sellers. This academic study is divided into three chapters and as a theoretical basis for the study of rationality and work, classical authors of sociology of work, geography, administration, economy and other relevant areas, as Bourdieu (1977), Durkeheim (1995), Marx (2011, 2008 2002 1996 1948), Engels (2002, 1996), Weber (2004, 2001), Goffman (2009) and Friedmann and Naville (1973) are studied as well as other authors, namely: Kon (1999), Giddens (2000), Harvey (1992), Ohno (1997) Pochmann (2004), Sorj (2000) and Santos (2000, 2006...|$|E

British ships are thought to have transported more individuals into bondage during this century than in any other period in the history of human existence. Arguably the wealthiest city in the British colonies of the New World, Port Royal, Jamaica, was an important center of the maritime slave trade. This thesis concerns the role of the slave trade in the maritime community of Port Royal during the later half of the seventeenth century and the early eighteenth century, a time when Port Royal was at its commercial peak and the British slave trade was undergoing its greatest development. Primary and secondary sources provide a basis for understanding the conduct of the slave trade in Port Royal. Primary documents, which include official records, personal accounts, correspondence, probate inventories, wills and records of deeds and grants, reveal information beyond census and volume of the trade. These documents afford the opportunity to study Port Royal's slave trade on an individual level. The documents record the various participants in the trade, such as slaves, traders and purchasers, agencies and agents, and investors, so that relationships and roles can be assessed and the nature and conduct of the trade can be interpreted. Underwater excavation of the ship Henrietta Marie has yielded a significant representative collection of the slave trade's material culture. Wrecked {{at the turn of the}} eighteenth century in the Florida Keys, Henrietta Marie had just quit Port Royal after off-loading her human <b>cargo.</b> The artifact <b>collection</b> of shackles, ship's equipment and trade goods represents the trappings of the maritime slave trade. Particularly, the shackles are a grim reminder of the trade's more brutal aspects. Comparative analysis of this collection with shackles recovered from other sites reveals the role of these devices in the slave trade...|$|R
