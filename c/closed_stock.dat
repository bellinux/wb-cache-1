40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new mutual {{independence}} test {{for a large}} number of high dimensional random vectors. The test statistic is based on the characteristic function of the empirical spectral distribution of the sample covariance matrix. The asymptotic distributions of the test statistic under the null and local alternative hypotheses are established as dimensionality and the sample size of the data are comparable. We apply this test to examine multiple MA(1) and AR(1) models, panel data models with some spatial cross-sectional structures. In addition, in a flexible applied fashion, the proposed test can capture some dependent but uncorrelated structures, for example, nonlinear MA(1) models, multiple ARCH(1) models and vandermonde matrices. Simulation results are provided for detecting these dependent structures. An empirical study of dependence between <b>closed</b> <b>stock</b> prices of several companies from New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) demonstrates that the feature of cross [...] sectional dependence is popular in stock markets.

40|$|The current {{practice}} of stocks network analysis {{is based on}} the assumption that the time series of <b>closed</b> <b>stock</b> price could represent the behaviour of the each stock. This assumption leads to consider minimal spanning tree (MST) and sub-dominant ultrametric (SDU) as an indispensible tool to filter the economic information contained in the network. Recently, there is an attempt where researchers represent stock not only as a univariate time series of closed price but as a bivariate time series of closed price and volume. In this case, they developed the so-called multidimensional MST to filter the important economic information. However, in this paper, we show that their approach is only applicable for that bivariate time series only. This leads us to introduce a new methodology to construct MST where each stock is represented by a multivariate time series.

40|$|During 2002 / 2003 {{units in}} the South African Police Service, such as the Stock Theft Unit in Kimberley were closed which was {{followed}} with {{the closure of the}} Stock Theft Unit in Postmasburg the next year. Both these units are situated within the Diamondfield police area in the Northern Cape Province. At the time the closure of these units elicited varied reactions from the farmers' community, the general public and members of the SAPS. This lead to the question what the effect of the closure had on the trust in the police by the farmers' community and whether it had an effect on the fear of crime which lead, in turn to the non-reporting of crime and even vigilantism. In this study the principles of community policing are studied to determine whether they can be used to address the problem caused by the closure of the units. The current application of community policing in the South African Police Service is discussed as it is implemented through sector policing and Community Police Forums (CPF) and through other applications thereof. In addition, specialization as manifested in the investigation and detection of crime and especially stock theft by the Stock Theft Units (STU), are discussed. In the study stock theft statistics from neighbouring states in Africa, {{as well as those of}} Australia and Scotland are compared with those of South Africa. The South African situation is further divided into national, provincial and area levels. In the contexts of the Diamondfield Area it was broken down to jurisdictions areas of the Stock Theft Units in order to draw conclusions and comparisons. In the Diamondfield Area the area previously serviced by the Stock Theft Unit Kimberley are compared with that of the Stock Theft Unit Postmasburg. Questionnaires were distributed among the farmers' community, using a proportional stratified random sampling method; subsequently focus group interviews were held with members of the <b>closed</b> <b>Stock</b> Theft Unit Kimberley. This was triangulated by a focus group interview with members of the Stock Theft Unit Postmasburg, as well as with individual interviews with an influential representative of the farmers' community at both area and provincial level, and the National Head of the Stock Theft Unit of the South African Police Service. The SARA model (Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment), was used to evaluate the results of the questionnaires and to interpret the research in order to make recommendations how to address the identified problems. Lastly, an implementation plan was drawn up to facilitate the process of addressing the identified problems. CRIMINOLOGYMTECH: POLICIN...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} study {{the day of the}} week effect seasonalties on the emerging stock market and the efficient market hypothesis. This research attempted to examine the day of the week effect on stock returns in the selected stock market in Colombo Slock Exchange (CSE). To achieve the objectives four hypotheses were developed for testing. The sample included emerging stock market from CSE. The sample period covers from 1985 to 2007. Adjusted <b>closed</b> <b>stock</b> market indices are collected through online data stream. Analysis was done for the entire sample period and for the four sub samples of equal length for the test of day of the week effect. Parametric and non parametric statistics are used for testing the hypotheses. The one way ANOVA procedure was used and Kruskal Wallis test was employed to substantiate the results of the existence of the day of the week effect. The results of the analysis revealed that the null hypothesis of equality in mean return is rejected and shows there is a day of the week effect in stock market in CSE in Sri Lanka. The reasons for volatility in mean returns is felt that the impact of different settlement procedures. In summary, the results of the analysis for the entire sample period reveals thai a negative mean return on Monday and Tuesday. But a positive significant effect is observed on Thursday and Friday for the entire sample period on the other hand a positive significant mean return is observed on Monday for the first sub sample period whereas a position significant effect is reported on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for the fourth sub sample period. The reason for the irregidarities with stock may be due to Asian crisis and the global stock market crash, and collapse of the blue ships stocks in US recently. It has important implementations for the investors, management of companies and the stock market regulating agencies. The investors could make use of these findings to make decisions with regard to changes buy or sell, they have to make their portfolio to make profits or avoid losses. Hence the day of the week ejfect is anomalies in that they represent opportunities for investors to maximize their returns by choosing to trade on certain days. Further findings facilitate the investors with awareness oj the advantages of investment and interest in the day of the week effect. This will provides the investors with necessary information about the certainty of the return for their investment. This kind of research can motivate the development of share market activities through an effect of findings way and means to earn better return to the investors of the world stock markets and the development of stock exchange and {{to the development of the}} national economy...|$|E
