Main Topics : This study surveyed members of Parliament and candidates for office in British consituencies in the 1966 general election. The questionnaire elicited information about the candidates' ties with their constituencies, their sources of information about their <b>constituencies,</b> their campaign <b>strategies,</b> {{the operation of the}} campaigns, and perceived effects. The organization of the local party operation and the candidates' own attitudes and feelings towards election campaigning were also investigated...|$|R
500|$|Within the Liberal Party, Thorpe {{helped to}} found an {{informal}} organisation known as [...] "Winnable Seats", which directed energy and funding to selected target <b>constituencies.</b> This <b>strategy</b> {{led to some}} notable by-election performances during 1961–62, culminating in March 1962 with victory in Orpington, where a 14,760 Conservative majority {{was turned into a}} Liberal majority of 7,855. These results were accompanied by substantial Liberal gains in municipal elections; national opinion polls briefly showed the party on equal terms with the Labour and Conservative parties. This advance was barely reflected in the results of the October 1964 general election; the party nearly doubled its share of the national vote, to 11.2%, but secured a net gain of only two seats. One of the new Liberals was Peter Bessell, who won the Cornish seat of Bodmin. In North Devon, Thorpe increased his personal majority to over 5,000.|$|R
40|$|Foreign firms {{operating}} in emerging economies are increasingly exploiting and becoming dependent on locally existing intangible {{resources such as}} intellectual skills, technological know-how and reputation. Political strategies are used to absorb the external constraints associated with this external dependence. Little {{is known about the}} different types of political strategies used by foreign firms in emerging economies and the factors that determine this choice. We draw on Resource Dependence theory to argue that this choice will be influenced by the degree to which foreign firms depend on tangible vs. intangible resources. Using a sample of 105 foreign subsidiaries in India, we find that foreign firms that depend on local intangible resources are more likely to use information-based political strategies, but less likely to provide direct financial incentives to policymakers; whereas firms that depend on local tangibles are less likely to use information-based strategies. Foreign firms that depend on both tangible and intangible resources are more likely to use the <b>constituency</b> building <b>strategy.</b> Our findings enhance our understanding of the factors affecting foreign firms’ political strategy in emerging economies...|$|R
40|$|A World Neighbors Programme in Kenya {{suggests}} {{more general}} conclusions about how NGOs {{can help to}} promote strong, inclusive membership organisations. A capacity to recognise the potential and limitations of existing institutions {{is found to be}} critical. It is important to address perceived needs, start with something simple to build confidence, and diversify {{in order to meet the}} requirements of different <b>constituencies.</b> A clear <b>strategy</b> is necessary to reconcile these sometimes conflicting demands. Success demands a heavy initial geographical concentration of resources, a substantial training input to provide staff with specialist facilitation skills, and an NGO structure which can access a wide range of external resources. ...|$|R
40|$|What are {{the electoral}} {{consequences}} of <b>constituency</b> candidates' campaign <b>strategies?</b> This paper {{focuses on the}} German case to theoretically and empirically explore this question. Theoretically, it perceives personalization at the voter level {{as the result of}} an interactive process involving both candidates and voters. It argues that voters need to be asked and mobilized to personalize their votes in order of doing so. Empirically it draws from a novel set of data for the 2009 German Federal Elections including voters and candidate data. On the basis of this data set we are able to show that the campaign behavior of constituency candidates matters for the perceptions and behaviors of voters...|$|R
40|$|To preemptively {{respond to}} the ever {{changing}} battlefield and in light of growing threats to national security, the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) and by extension the U. S. military, have developed human performance optimization (HPO) initiatives to improve warfighter performance for increasing mission readiness. African American officers, {{by way of the}} Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), have long been and continue to be an important <b>constituency</b> for this <b>strategy.</b> Using the results of an online search via the Internet of HPO-like academic offerings at HBCUs, this paper proposes that the U. S. military could enhance its war fighting capability, and specifically that of its African American officers, for increased preparedness, increased performance and sustained and increased readiness by modeling HPO like programs at HBCUs. The authors examine similar efforts around the world, offer the potential benefits to be derived from expanded collaborations between the U. S. military and HBCUs and discuss the implications for the U. S. military and militaries within international communities, HBCUs and future research. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore some {{theoretical}} and practical possibilities for building new transnational and transcultural solidarities in postcolonial curriculum inquiry. I argue that building such solidarities requires a rethinking {{of the ways in}} which we perform and represent curriculum inquiry, so that curriculum work within a global knowledge economy does not merely assimilate national (local) curriculum discourses-practices into an imperial (global) archive. I draw on the initial stages of research on internationalisation, inclusivity, and innovative knowledge work conducted with colleagues at Deakin University, and elsewhere, which focuses on the possibilities of producing knowledge in transnational virtual spaces. This includes studies of the formation of new (and we hope more inclusive) transnational scholarly communities and <b>constituencies,</b> and of <b>strategies</b> to improve modes of intercultural communication that facilitate transnational knowledge work. I situate part of my discussion of these arguments and issues in the practicalities of establishing Transnational Curriculum Inquiry (TCI), an electronic open-access journal that is both a site for transnational scholarly conversations and a site for inquiry into the ways that electronic publishing procedures facilitate and/or constrain inclusive knowledge work and postcolonialist curriculum inquiry. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} {{political}} representation for historically disadvantaged groups {{can serve as}} an effective means to redress historical inequities. The Indian Constitution mandates reservations for two such groups, Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), in federal and state legislatures. While this policy {{has been successful in}} ensuring the political presence of minority legislators, evidence on their performance in serving the interests of their electorate is limited to the analysis of aggregate expenditure patterns. This paper is the first to establish a causal link between the reservation of seats in state legislatures and rural public good provision, and to explore its implications for the inter- and within-district pattern of provision. The sample is drawn from 9 Indian states, and uses village census data aggregated to 64 districts and 610 electoral <b>constituencies.</b> The empirical <b>strategy</b> exploits features of the process of reservation to identify an exogenous source of variation that affects reservation discontinuously. With a few exceptions, I find no evidence that ST legislators perform any differently than legislators elected from unreserved constituencies. However, SC legislators perform better, providing greater access to educational facilities, in particular, primary schools, within their districts and constituencies. In addition, these schools are located within constituencies so as to favor of their own community, as well as ST voters. Overall, these findings do not support the prediction that political reservation adversely affects the responsiveness to minority interests or politician quality, at least insofar as these affect the provision of public goods. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} related surveys of 366 union organisers and 31 state union {{secretaries}} in 13 unions and of 2400 union delegates in 8 unions to examine three issues regarding {{the relationship between}} unions and community. How do delegates who are community activists differ from other delegates? How do union organisers {{who have come to}} the union movement from backgrounds in community or student activism differ from other organisers? How do unions that work in coalition with community groups differ from unions that do not? We find that amongst delegates, community activists are more confident, better networked and have broader orientations than other members, despite their having no higher levels of training and similar levels of functional activism. Community-union delegates are more active and their presence is associated with greater workplace power for the members with whom they are associated. However these characteristics are not something that can be simply transferred from an external context and expected to automatically apply in the workplace. Training is essential to ensure that unions are {{able to take advantage of}} the potential offered by community activists. Indeed, without training just about all the potential they have is lost, as without training community-union activists are not able to effectively apply to the workplace the skills and knowledge they bring from outside. Amongst organisers, those with activist backgrounds have fewer difficulties than their peers in several areas (such as identifying activists and image problems), and appear slightly more oriented to organising issues. Organisers who report that their union branch frequently works in coalition with community or social groups consistently report more positive perceptions on a range of issues concerning organising, democracy, impediments to their work and their own satisfaction and expected tenure. Union secretaries who reported that they had worked a number of times with community or women's groups in campaigning appeared more likely to report increases in membership and in their financial position. Overall, the data suggest that there are gains for unions both from actively engaging with community groups and from recruiting delegates and probably organisers with broader activist experience. However, neither approach alone is the answer to union decline. Each must be part of a broader strategy based around organising, training and democratisation to have any beneficial effect. Community unionism is not a stand-alone tactic that can be isolated from the democratisation and opening of unions to new ideas, new <b>constituencies</b> and new <b>strategies.</b> Instead it is part of a wide-ranging package of union renewal.
