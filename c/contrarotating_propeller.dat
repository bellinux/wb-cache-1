40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{approach}} for the <b>contrarotating</b> <b>propeller</b> parametrization modelling is provided {{based on the}} APDL language. Contrarotating propeller's parametrization modelling have several advantageous for the designers. The designers only need input some parameters, then the contrarotating propellers model could be produced automatically. Finally, this models are input into ANSYS to carry on automatically the strength analysis, and input into FLUENT {{to carry on the}} fluid analysis. It has saved the analysis efficience and has the very useful values...|$|E
5000|$|The {{recommended}} {{engine is}} the [...] Lycoming O-360, but {{a variety of}} powerplants from [...] have been used. One installation uses two Suzuki 1600 automobile engines driving two concentric <b>contrarotating</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
40|$|A compact turbo {{power pack}} was {{designed}} for application i n underwater propulsion. The turbo power pack designed consists of a high pressure ratio supersonic partial admission impulse turbine coupled to a reduction gear box to reduce the turbine shaft speed {{to the level of}} the shaft speeds of the <b>contrarotating</b> <b>propellers.</b> The possible configurations of the turbine and gear box were studied to optimise the system and the design parameters. The report presents the details of the final configuration of the system...|$|R
40|$|Compared to {{conventional}} turbofan engines, advanced high speed coaxial/contra-rotating ("CR") propellers promise significant fuel savings. Their noise characteristics, however, {{differ from those}} of singe-rotating ("SR") propellers {{as a consequence of the}} unavoidable acoustic interaction effects; additional noise is generated by aerodynamic interactions. In the context of an acoustic research program to support the development of future CR-propfans, pilot-type aerodynamic wind tunnel tests on <b>contrarotating</b> model-scale <b>propellers</b> (diameter 0, 27 m) were conducted. It was found that, compared to SR-propellers, the noise radiated from CR-propellers exhibits the following specific characteristics: o increased sound pressure levels at higher frequencies, o pronounced azimuthal sound pressure level directivity, o two maxima in the polar directivities of both the high-frequency ha rmonic and the A-weighted levels, o a lower gradient of A-weighted sound pressure levels versus Mach number...|$|R
