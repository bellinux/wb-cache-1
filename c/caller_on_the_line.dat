50|$|That evening, a candle-light vigil {{was held}} at St. Rose Church, at which various {{religious}} leaders {{of the town and}} the Governor of Connecticut, Dan Malloy, addressed the assembled crowd. The parish offered a special Mass that same evening and the church remained open throughout the night, in order to provide a place of comfort {{for the people of the}} town. On Sunday, December 16, around noon, someone called the parish office and said, “I’m going to kill everyone there. My friend didn’t finish the job”. Parish officials tried to keep the <b>caller</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> asking him to repeat himself. He did so, making the same threat in the same words. Churchgoers quickly evacuated church. Police in SWAT gear arrived at the church to check out the area.|$|E
5000|$|Chris Core (born 1949) [...] is an American {{radio and}} {{television}} personality formerly on Washington, D.C.'s 630 WMAL and host of The Chris Core Show from 9 a.m. to 11:45 a.m. EST. Marc Fisher of The Washington Post calls Core [...] "a rare talker who gets the complexities of this region." [...] The program {{was one of the}} highest rated shows in the competitive drive time slot prior to being moved, mostly unchanged, to its morning slot. The show covered a wide variety of topics ranging from politics, the Global War on Terrorism, local and current affairs, show business, and others, until its cancellation on February 29, 2008. It was a [...] "call in" [...] type show where listeners were encouraged to call the show with their opinions. Core has maintained that he is neither a Democrat nor a Republican. The show often featured prominent local and national politicians who frequently called the show unsolicited. Core treated callers with respect regardless of their political stance. His show allowed {{people on both sides of}} an issue to express their opinions, and allowed listeners to form their own opinions. Core also from time to time kept a <b>caller</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to discuss the topic at hand with other callers.|$|E
50|$|Originally phone sex {{services}} {{consisted of}} a managed network of dispatchers (live or automated) and erotic performers. Performers would come to a studio where they received a cubicle, coaching, and cash incentives to keep <b>callers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> longer. This is the world portrayed in Spike Lee's movie about phone sex, Girl 6. At that time independent phone sex was more dangerous, as Lee's movie portrays.|$|R

5000|$|Name game, [...] "as in...": Listeners {{are invited}} to call in {{if they have a}} name that if they say it people always say the same thing back to them, for example [...] "Hello my name is Chris Martin" [...] and the {{response}} would be [...] "as in Coldplay?". A <b>caller</b> will come <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and say there full name and then Richie and Christian will buzz in and guess what people normally say to them when they say their name.|$|R
50|$|The {{operator}} {{will then}} transfer {{the call to}} the appropriate service's own call-taker.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} mental strain in dispatchers of medical emergency services. I focused on covering these questions, the follow-up analysis and description, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of research. The first {{objective was to}} survey opinions of operations centre dispatchers of the mental strain in their work. The next objective was their opinion of the question {{whether the number of}} dispatchers on duty in one shift influences their mental strain. My research is based on questionnaire surveying, and the research object covered 40 employees in operational centres all over the Region of South Bohemia. (Note: a nationwide research would be technically hardly realisable, as it is improbable that the questionnaires sent in would be returned). The introductory chapters contain {{a brief description of the}} operations centre and activities that the dispatchers perform every day, and I try to formulate the principles of the correct communication that should be led in the conversation with <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> distress <b>line.</b> I also describe general features of stress, the factors that lead to it, and the states breaking out as a result of its long-term effect on people. Specifically in this thesis, I describe post-traumatic stress disorder and the burn-out syndrome, and I also mention prevention to defend oneself against these risk factors. The second part of <b>the</b> thesis focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> results of the research conducted by quantitative technique, by handing out 45 questionnaires, 40 of which were processed after they were sent back. The research and results make up an essential part of the thesis and bring proofs of the fact that employees of operations centres undergo mental strain influenced by a number of factors. Some of these factors can be influenced, and becoming aware of these factors, this strain may be at least partially reduced. The thesis also uses the comparative method with the possibility of comparison of the mental strain between individual dispatchers. Last but not least, it contains inspiration for considering these questions, and personal proposals for a positive contribution to lowering this strain and a further development of this problem in general...|$|R
