40|$|Nutritional {{evaluation}} of some agro-industrial byproducts available in Samoa [dry brewers' grains (DBG), cocoa shell (CS), <b>cocoa</b> <b>dust</b> (CD) and desiccated coconut waste meal (DCWM) ] available in Samoa {{was carried out}} usingboth the in viva and in vitro techniques. In the in vivo study 24 Anglo-nubian goats were offered by-products with other feed ingredients to compound four different diets. The goats were randomly allocated to 4 diets {{on the basis of}} liveweight (18. 7 - 0. 3 kg). The ADF content of the byproducts followed a similar trend to NDF. The byproducts have a high content of organic matter (91. 0 - 95. 4 %). Gross energy (GE) content was higher in DCWM (25. 1 MJ/kg DM), closely followed by CD (23. 2 MJ/kg DM). Concentrate intake was significantly different (p 0. 05). CP digestibility followed a similar pattern to DM digestibility. The digestibility of NDF and ADF was influenced {{by the nature of the}} diets. The digestibility of OM and GE were best (p DBG>CD>CS. In conclusion, the results obtained suggest that all the byproducts can contribute to ruminant livestock diets without adverse effects on feed intake, growth rate and apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients...|$|E
40|$|Forty-five Girl Scouts in Rochester, Minn., spent last Thursday evening {{solving a}} crime. Although their three-hour foray into {{forensics}} {{was a bit}} sugar-coated [...] the girls, ages 9 to 15, were given <b>cocoa</b> powder to <b>dust</b> for fingerprints and chocolate bars to study teeth imprints [...] {{there was also a}} heavy dose of science and math. The troops measured the 2 ̆ 2 culprit 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 footprints to extrapolate how tall he or she might be and used deductive reasoning to eliminate suspects from further investigation. The workshop, organized by IBM for the fifth annual Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day, emphasized another skill crucial to the girls 2 ̆ 7 future success in science and engineering: the troops were advised to spend their 15 -minute snack break networking...|$|R
50|$|In confectionery, {{it reduces}} viscosity, replaces more {{expensive}} ingredients, controls sugar crystallization {{and the flow}} properties of chocolate, helps in the homogeneous mixing of ingredients, improves shelf life for some products, {{and can be used}} as a coating. In emulsions and fat spreads, it stabilizes emulsions, reduces spattering during frying, improves texture of spreads and flavour release. In doughs and bakery, it reduces fat and egg requirements, helps even distribution of ingredients in dough, stabilizes fermentation, increases volume, protects yeast cells in dough when frozen, and acts as a releasing agent to prevent sticking and simplify cleaning. It improves wetting properties of hydrophilic powders (e.g., low-fat proteins) and lipophilic powders (e.g., <b>cocoa</b> powder), controls <b>dust,</b> and helps complete dispersion in water. Lecithin keeps cocoa and cocoa butter in a candy bar from separating. It {{can be used as a}} component of cooking sprays to prevent sticking and as a releasing agent. In margarines, especially those containing high levels of fat (>75%), lecithin is added as an 'antispattering' agent for shallow frying.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} study of ignition risk due to hot points in the storage of bulk materials is required to ensure fire safety. Many parameters {{are involved in this}} phenomenon: nature of the material, storage volume and temperature, type and size of hot point, etc. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine critical ignition temperatures of hot spots embedded in powder materials for different conditions and with several types of hot points. Materials selected for this study are pulverized coal, wood <b>dust,</b> <b>cocoa</b> powder, alfalfa, rice husks and coffee husks. Ignition tests were carried out in 1, 000 and 2, 700 cm 3 cubic baskets containing the combustible sample and using an inert sphere at a given initial temperature as well as a glowing cigarette butt and charcoal as ignition sources. The critical ignition temperature is defined in terms of the hot point temperature that is able to ignite the sample. Differences between the results obtained under these test conditions have been explained by the oxy-reactivity of materials tested, different basket sizes and specific heat or heat production of hot points. Data obtained need now to be compared to available theoretical modeling. These results will then allow the prediction of material behavior under other storage conditions...|$|R
