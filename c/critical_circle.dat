Key words and phrases. <b>Critical</b> <b>circle</b> mapping, rigidity, renormalization. From the second author. It saddens me tremendously that Dima Khmelev will not see this paper published. Dima died suddenly, at age 28, on October 24, 2004. He was a wonderful friend and colleague, a talented and enthusiastic young mathematician. His death is a tragic loss. M. Y. Foreword. In the last several decades, since the works of Mostow, Margulis, Sullivan, and others, rigidity problems occupy a central place {{in the theory of}} holomorphic dynamical systems. This type of problems is classical in dynamics: a rigidity theorem postulates that in a certain class of dynamical systems equivalence (combinatorial, continuous, smooth, etc.) automatically has a higher regularity. The dynamical systems considered in this paper are <b>critical</b> <b>circle</b> maps, that is smooth homeomorphisms of the circle with a single critical point having a cubic type. These maps have been a subject of intensive study since the early 1980 ’s as one of the two main examples of universality in transition to chaos. In 1984 Yoccoz [Yoc] showed that any two such maps with the same irrational rotation number are conjugate by a continuous change of coordinates (this is a generalization of the classical result of Denjoy for C 2 diffeomorphisms). The central result of this paper is the following rigidity theorem: Main Theorem. For any two analytic <b>critical</b> <b>circle</b> maps with the same irrational rotation number, the conjugacy, which maps the critical point of one to the critical point of the other is C 1 +α-smooth at the critical point. Here α> 0 is a universal constant...|$|E

A <b>critical</b> <b>circle</b> exists in the photoelastic experiment of latitude strain distribution, wall thickness distribution and displacement change, thus making the wall thickness of hemispherical part become gradually thick from <b>critical</b> <b>circle</b> part to pressure-pad-circle part.
