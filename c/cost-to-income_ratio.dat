40|$|MBA thesis - WBSMobile banking {{offers the}} banking {{industry}} an opportunity to reduce their <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratios</b> and to improve their service by reducing their focus on daily, lower-value banking functions to higher-value financial services. The high cellphone ownership among the economically active population makes mobile banking an obvious banking channel for banks to focus on. In the light of this opportunity, {{the purpose of this}} research was to identify factors that facilitate and inhibit the adoption and use of mobile banking services in South Africa. Data was collected using a structured survey questionnaire with closed-response questions. The questionnaire used in the study was a 7 -point Likert scale questionnaire, which required respondents to indicate their degree of agreement or disagreement with a variety of statements related to hypotheses drawn from technology adoption literature. For the analysis of the impact of customer demographics on the likelihood of the adoption of mobile banking, a database of banked customers with selected demographic variables was used. A binary logistic regression model was used to analyse the data. This study confirmed what international studies identified as the main factors that drive adoption of technology in general, and banking technology in particular. The study confirmed that usefulness and ease-of-use of mobile banking are central in the adoption of mobile banking services in South Africa. The ability to try mobile banking and experience with mobile technology were found to be significant in explaining the adoption and usage of mobile banking. The study also found that customer demographics {{have an impact on the}} adoption of mobile banking services. The challenge for banks is to ensure that customers see mobile banking as relevant in their day-to-day banking and financial lives. Without creating this relevance, very useful services will remain unused and their importance will go unnoticed. It is also important to make sure that mobile banking is as easy to use as possible while also ensuring that making the service secure does not compromise the service’s ease of use...|$|R
50|$|The {{consolidated}} profit {{attributable to}} shareholders, in 2009, was HK$1,336 million, representing {{a gain of}} 12.7 percent. The increase was primarily due to the substantially lower impairment allowances, positive contributions from all the jointly controlled entities, improved fee income from securities related business and treasury operation. The return on average total assets and return on average equity stood at 1.2 percent and 8.7 percent respectively. Capital adequacy ratio remained strong at 19 percent, while the liquidity ratio was 55 percent.

5000|$|Housing {{affordability}} has {{and continues}} to be the top priority housing issue Vancouverites must resolve. In 1996, a study published by BC Housing revealed that 25% of renter households in Vancouver pay 50% or more of their incomes to rent. The core housing need model, developed by the CMHC, uses a threshold of households spending at least 30% of their income on shelter costs to illuminate households experiencing acute housing affordability needs. “Moving from the 30% shelter <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> (STIR) used in the core housing need model, to a 50% threshold, typically reduces the number of households identified by more than half." [...] In 2001, Statistics Canada published a study using both the 30% and 50% thresholds to identify renters and homeowners facing unaffordable housing costs in Metro Vancouver. This study revealed that 8.1% of homeowners and 27.8% of renters exceeded the 30% threshold, while 4.0% of homeowners and 10.8% of renters exceeded the 50% threshold. More in depth still, this study also found that 18.5% of immigrants living in Vancouver exceeded the 30% threshold and 8.0% exceed the 50% threshold. Only 11.3% and 4.8% of Canadian born households exceeded the 30% and 50% thresholds, respectively.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} factors affecting online conversion success {{of financial institutions}} in Australia. Twenty financial institutions (nine banks and 11 credit unions) were divided into four clusters based {{on the size of}} their client base. A cross-case comparison of the financial institutions in each group was then qualitatively analysed with respect to the joint effects of six variables on online conversion rate: banking practice, cost-efficiency, online banking experience, online product and service portfolio, response time to online queries, and branch network. Results of the comparative analysis show that the recipe for online success lies in getting the right combination of variables. To achieve an online conversion rate of no less than 25 per cent, financial institutions with a client base exceeding 100, 000 need to have attained a <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> of no greater than 0. 55, have three or more years of online banking experience coupled with a branch-to-client ratio between 1 and 2 per 10, 000 customers. For credit unions with a client base of less than 100, 000, the corresponding criteria are having a <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> of no more than 0. 67, a response time to online queries of 3 h or less, and no less than four years of online banking experience...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} the relationship between market structure and bank performance in general, together with the lack of empirical research on this relationship in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) banking markets, provide the main motivation for this study. Many researchers have sought to estimate the relationship between aspects of market structure such as concentration and market share, and indicators of bank performance such as profitability and prices. However, there is still no consensus with regard to the most appropriate theory {{in the light of the}} empirical data. In this study, the possible relationships between market structure and bank performance suggested by prior research are examined for the five main banking markets in ASEAN, i. e. Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia, for the period 1991 to 1995. This relationship is tested using pooled and cross sectional estimate, as well as on a country by country and year by year basis. This is the first study in which data for all five ASEAN countries has been analysed. The database which has been constructed for the present study has been obtained from a variety of primary sources, supplemented by commercial data services, thus providing the cross-national set of comparable data needed for the modelling of bank efficiency that is reported in this thesis. The study uses two measures of efficiency; (i) the standard accounting approach, i. e., the cost-toincome ratio, and (ii) the stochastic X-efficiency measure. Using the <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> as a proxy for efficiency, generally the pooled results suggest that both the Relative Market Power and the Relative Efficiency hypotheses may explain the profit-structure relationship in ASEAN banking markets. That is, firstly, market share appears to reflect market power, the larger firms in the market gaining higher profits; secondly, banks operating at higher levels of efficiency are also able to gain higher profits. Using the stochastic X-efficiency measure, the pooled results also provide support for both the Relative Market Power and Relative Efficiency hypotheses. In addition, we find that, overall, government ownership and market demand conditions are negatively related to bank profitability, whilst the level of risk capital is positively related. The individual country estimates suggest that Relative Market Power is supported only in the Philippines using the <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> and in the Philippines and Indonesia using the stochastic X-efficiency measure. Moreover, Relative Efficiency is also supported only in the Philippines and Indonesia using stochastic X-efficiency. In contrast, using the <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> the Relative Efficiency hypothesis is supported in all five ASEAN countries which would imply that, in the region as a whole, bank efficiency is the primary driver of higher profits...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{motivation}} {{is to show}} how the efficient frontier methods data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) can be used synergistically. As part of the illustration, we directly compare locally incorporated foreign banks with Chinese domestic banks. Both DEA and SFA reveal that foreign banks are less efficient. DEA shows the main source of inefficiency for foreign banks as managing interest income, whereas domestic banks are inefficient in managing non-interest income and interest expense. SFA reveals contextual variables such as interbank ratio, loan-to-deposit ratio and <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> are significant in explaining inefficiency. The correspondence of rankings based on DEA vs. SFA is positive and moderate in strength but efficiency estimates do not belong to the same distribution. Using DEA and SFA side-by-side can encourage more rigorous and in-depth bank efficiency studies where each method’s limitation can be overcome by the other...|$|E

30|$|Vogel (2005) {{notes that}} {{the new world of}} CSR {{emphasizes}} the link between CSR and corporate financial success. Confirmation for such emphasis, Vogel (2005) states, are the many works (e.g. Dickson 2004; Laszlo 2003; Scott and Rothman 1992; Waddock et al. 2002) that promote the ‘responsibility–profitability connection ‘and assert that CSR leads to long-term shareholder value. He also reports that ‘according to a 2002 survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, “ 70 percent of global chief executives believe that CSR is vital to their companies’ profitability”’. This evidence suggests that CSR is evolving into a core business function which is central to the firm’s overall strategy and vital to its success. Profitability in this conceptualisation refers to an improvement in a number of performance variables relative to competitors. These include total assets, deposits, advances, return-on-equity, net interest margins, <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> and asset quality (Jaworski and Kohli 1993; Orlitzky et al. 2003; Smith 2007). Profitability in a firm’s assets base is a positive indication relative to the competitor.|$|E

The tested sample includes 10 investment banks, 10 trust companies and 8 securities companies.

The results, obtained by applying the system-GMM estimator to the panel of 28 shadow banks, indicate that bank-specific factors and external factors have significant relations to shadow banks profitability: company with higher capital adequacy, which is measure as equity-to-asset ratio, tends to have higher profitability; <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> that measures management efficiency has positive relationship with profitability; liquidity and size of shadow bank perform a negative relation to profitability, which is opposite to the expected direction. In terms of external factor, GDP growth rate, inflation and interest rate are all presenting a positive relationship with profitability.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} between key regulatory and supervisory policies and {{various aspects of}} commercial bank efficiency and performance for a sample of 22 EU countries over 2000 – 2008. In {{the first stage of}} the analysis we measure efficiency by employing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique. In addition, we employ two distinct accounting ratios to capture the costs of intermediation (net interest margin) and cost effectiveness (<b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio).</b> Our regression framework includes truncated regressions and generalized linear models. Moreover, we carry out a sensitivity analysis for robustness using a fractional logit estimator. Our results show that strengthening capital restrictions and official supervisory powers can improve the efficient operations of banks. Evidence also indicates that interventionist supervisory and regulatory policies such as private sector monitoring and restricting bank activities can result in higher bank inefficiency levels. Finally, the evidence produced suggests that the beneficial effects of capital restrictions and official supervisory powers (interventionist supervisory and regulatory policies) on bank efficiency are more pronounced in countries with higher quality institution...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{conducted}} {{to compare the}} determinants of profitability of the domestic and foreign banks operating in Indonesia. The Random Effect Model is employed with balanced panel data on 27 commercial banks, using quarterly data {{for the period of}} 2010 to 2010. In order to find out the differences in the profitability determinants, the sample of banks is divided into two sub-samples based on share ownership (domestic and foreign). The bank-specific determinants such as Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR), Non Performing Loan (NPL), Cost to Income Ratio (CIR), Loss Provision (LP) and also from macroeconomic determinants (NIM sensitivity to GDP, and NIM sensitivity to Inflation) employed simultaneous and individually toward Profitability which is proxied by Return on Asset (ROA). The results reveal that the profitability determinants of domestic banks are not much different from the determinant factors of foreign banks, namely <b>Cost-to-Income</b> <b>Ratio</b> and Loss Provision, meanwhile the other variables are not able to explain the variability of domestic and foreign banks’ profitability. However, the Loss Provision variable indicates the different sign of significance, which means that there are differences in the behavior of banks in obtaining their income and managing their credit risk. In other side, the average intercept and explanatory power of the model of domestic banks is higher for than foreign bank, which shows that the profitability of domestic banks are better than foreign bank...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} relationship between organisational culture and financial performance in a selected financial services institution in South Africa. The banking sector {{as part of the}} financial services industry contributes to economic growth in the economy. The banking sector in South Africa is highly concentrated, but also highly competitive. It is important for banks to retain their competitiveness and increased global competition places further pressure on banks to perform financially in order to satisfy the demands of shareholders. The literature reviewed and previous studies both suggest that organisational culture is an important variable that influences organisational performance. For purposes of this research, organisational performance will be measured in terms of financial performance. The concepts of organisational culture and financial performance are discussed and a questionnaire based on Hall’s (1988) theory of organisational competence is used to determine the strength of the levels of the dimensions of competence as indicators of organisational culture within the selected financial institution. The financial performance of the branches within the organisation is determined by calculating certain selected financial performance ratios, namely <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> cumulative leverage and contribution per employee. A correlation analysis is conducted in order to establish whether there is a statistically significant relationship between organisational culture and financial performance. A conclusion is drawn that there is a statistically significant relationship between the organisational culture and the financial performance of the branches of the selected institution and recommendations are made as to how financial performance can be improved by strengthening the dimensions of competence as indicators of organisational culture. These recommendations include specific actions that can be taken by leaders to improve commitment, collaboration and creativity. ...|$|E

Measuring affordability involves comparing housing costs to a household’s ability to meet them. One com-mon measure is the shelter <b>cost-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> (STIR). The 30 % level is commonly accepted as the upper limit for affordable housing. Those who spend 30 % or more have been, and continue to be, the sub-ject of intense study—do they do so out of choice, having the means and preference to spend more than the norm; or out of necessity, having low income and possibly being in housing need. Housing affordability is also a critical input to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s (CMHC) core housing need indicator. 1 The core housing need indi-cator “identifies those households unable to obtain market housing that is in adequate condition, of suit-able size and, at the same time, affordable ” (CMHC 1991). The information is used by governments to help design, deliver, fund and evaluate social housing programs. Up to now, STIRs have described affordability at a particular point in time. No source followed house-holds over time, collecting both incomes and shelter costs. While Statistics Canada’s Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) provides household income over a six-year period, it does not normally collect data on shelter costs. So, for the last five years, CMHC has sponsored a module of housing questions and now this information enables a first-ever longitudinal review of housing affordability (see Data sources and definitions) ...|$|E
