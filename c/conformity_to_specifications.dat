The underlying principle of the proposed approach is illustrated with a case study in the context of e-commerce. Specifically, we show the combined use of a digital signature, which provides data integrity and non-repudiation, a digital certificate, which guaranties authentification of participants, and a symmetric cryptographic algorithm, which ensures confidentiality...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} process {{is one of}} the several main activities in industries. The process followed by quality control to achieve expected final products. Products' <b>conformities</b> <b>to</b> design <b>specification</b> can be achieved through direct measurement. However, not all measurements can be done directly while the process is running. Inconformities <b>to</b> product's design <b>specification</b> could result in unfunctional or rejected products. This will render producers into losing their profits.

Advancement in technology made it possible to automate measurement processes and will also make it possible to do during the {{production process}} in achieving expected quality control as early as possible. The quality control yield measurements in products'lengths, widths and depths/ heights which will control products' dimension and generate quality control chart.

40|$|This {{research}} was designed <b>to</b> examine whether <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms and <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> feminine norms predict minority stress, anti-effeminacy attitudes, and internalized homophobia among gay men. The participants (N= 239) completed the <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> Masculine Norms Inventory- 46, <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> Feminine Norms Inventory- 45, Negative Attitudes Toward Effeminacy Scale, Daily Heterosexist Experiences Questionnaire, and Revised Internalized Homophobia Scale. Analyses indicated that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> feminine norms predicts minority stress, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms does not predict minority stress, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms predicts anti-effeminacy, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> feminine norms does not predict anti-effeminacy, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms predicts internalized homophobia, that <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> feminine norms does not predict internalized homophobia, that anti-effeminacy does not predict minority stress, and that internalized homophobia does not predict minority stress. Components of <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> {{masculine and feminine}} norms that predict minority stress are explored. The results suggest that gay men who conform to feminine norms may face increased minority stress and that gay men who conform to masculine norms may face increased internalized homophobia and anti-effeminacy. These results can inform efforts to reduce minority stress among gay men. Further investigation with a more racially and ethnically diverse sample is suggested...|$|R

Under PAM 2006 Form,the “Architect” is the contract administrator and “Engineer” in IEM form whilst CA is also known as “Superintending Officer” in PWD and CIDB forms. CA in this study is focused to the professional CA, the Architect and Engineer. As a contract administrator and agent of the Employer, CA provides information to the contractor to enable him to carry out his contractual works,issue variations which may alter the extent,nature and quantity of the works, nominates sub-contractors and suppliers on the Employer’s behalf,supervises and approves the works. In his capacity as contract administrator and independent certifier, it is the Architect’s duty to issue certifications on all payments due under the contract and certify acceptance of completed works in <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> contract <b>specifications</b> and accepted standards. The contract administrator must act with independence, impartial and fairness. The professional obligation to act fairly extends to such of his duties to use his professional skill and judgment in forming an opinion or making a decision where he is holding the balance between the Client and the Contractor. The CA is duty bound to serve the Employer faithfully as his agent. The Employer would reasonably expect that the Architect possesses the requisite ability and skill and be liable to the Employer if he had been professional negligent. The finding of this research is based on the judgment of 11 cases where the CA has wrongful in certifying the certificates. They are categorised as error in certificate, signing by non authorised person and due to fraud and dishonest.

40|$|In a {{knitting}} factory, {{any activity}} oriented toward evaluation, maintenance or improvement of products quality level {{is based on}} measuring and examining the product quality characteristics, in order <b>to</b> establish <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> the quality <b>specifications</b> and/or naming the non-quality characteristics, thus noticing defects or fabrication deficiencies. The quality of the stitching operation has a particular influence on the finite product quality and is determined on side {{by the quality of}} knitted pieces, and on the other by insuring the correlation between the technological parameters of the stitching operation and the physico-mechanical characteristics of the knittings that are to be assembled through stitching. Although the product execution processes comprise of manufacturing the elements and distinct subassemblies and their ulterior assembly, they present various difference dictated by the constructive particularities of the machine, as well as fabric characteristics. Because of the multiple interactions between the material, yarn and working parts of the sawing machine, inadequacies in the technological discipline can result in negative effects on both the knitted and stitching thread as well as the machine. A part of these can be fixed by extra time consuming tasks (yarn breaks, stitching ruffling etc.), while other defects appear during the usage of the product cheapening it (stitch tearing by perforating the knitted on the stitching line, pilling effect, dimensional instability etc.). This paper systematically presents, the main defects that may occur during the stitching operation of the products made out of circular knitted, as well as the causes that generate them along with preventive or corrective actions. ...|$|R

40|$|Access to thesis {{permanently}} {{restricted to}} Ball State community only. <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms {{is defined as}} meeting societal expectations for what constitutes masculinity in one’s public or private life (Mahalik et al., 2003). Research shows that conforming to masculine norms can produce negative outcomes in men’s behavior, such as greater depression and anxiety (Cournoyer & Mahalik, 1995). <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms also {{has been shown to}} be affected by athletic identity specifically in college football players (Steinfeldt & Steinfeldt, 2012). However, <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms has been studied minimally in relation to positive factors such as life satisfaction or psychological well-being (Rochlen, McKelley, Suizzo, & Scaringi, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to study the relationship among <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms, athletic identity, life satisfaction, and psychological well-being in college football players across different divisions. Total years in football, year in school, and position were measured in relation <b>to</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms to extend previous findings (Steinfeldt & Steinfeldt, 2012). Participants were 110 male athletes participating on intercollegiate football teams at the Division I, II, III, and NAIA levels who completed a demographic questionnaire, the <b>Conformity</b> <b>to</b> Masculine Norms Inventory- 46 (CMNI- 46), Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS) online.

However, the role of <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> masculine norms on help-seeking attitudes for noncollege-age men or for men from diverse backgrounds is not well understood. To fill this gap in the literature, the present study examined the cross-cultural relevance of a mediational model {{of the relationships between}} <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> dominant U.

However, some important differences in the presence and strengths of the relation-ships between <b>conformity</b> <b>to</b> dominant masculine norms and the other variables in the model were present across different racial/ethnic groups and sexual orientations.
