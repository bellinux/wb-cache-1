5|$|In 1965, Braathens SAFE {{placed an}} order for three Boeing 737-200s, costing a total ofNOK100 million. They were {{intended}} to do the main haul of the <b>charter</b> <b>market.</b> There had been an internal struggle {{as to whether the}} company should purchase the Fokker F-28 Fellowship or the Boeing 737-100, a shorter version of the 737-200. Having a single plane type would give a single pool of pilot and mechanic certifications, and would have saved the company NOK millions in costs. Following the decision to purchase the F-28, Bjørn G. Braathen, son of Ludvig G. and later CEO, left the company.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Norsk Flytjeneste {{purchased}} two 50-passenger Douglas DC-6Bs from Braathens SAFE and leased {{one from}} Sterling Airways. They {{were used for}} domestic and international charter. The largest contract was from the Norwegian Church Aid, who contracted Norsk Flytjeneste to fly aid to Bangladesh. However, the airline failed to make money on the DC-6s, mostly {{because of the high}} operating costs, and sold them after a year. The company followed up with purchasing a ten-seat Cessna Citation business jet that they offered in the <b>charter</b> <b>market.</b> However, the market was not large enough, and the jet was sold.|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{established}} by Trøndelag-based investors on 2 April 1987, having been originally intended to operate charter flights to the Mediterranean area. Ansett Australia was an early investor, but soon sold out. The company suffered with its main contractor, Sun Tours, going bankrupt in 1988, after which the airline moved to the British <b>charter</b> <b>market.</b> Air Europe's holding company bought a third of Norway Airlines in October 1989; this allowed the Norwegian company to start flying Air Europe's route between Oslo and Gatwick as a wet lease operation, in addition to several international destinations from London. Air Europe went bankrupt in March 1991, causing Norway Airlines to temporarily halt operations.|$|E

5|$|Braathens SAFE {{was also}} {{given the right}} to fly its first {{international}} scheduled flights {{for the first time}} in several decades. On 19 August 1988, the airline was granted concession to fly to Billund in Denmark. At the same time, Air-X was granted concession to fly the route via Sandefjord and Skien. The route started on 2 May 1989. Previously the rules stated that if SAS flew to a non-Scandinavian destination from any capital, no other Scandinavian airlines could fly to that city. Braathens SAFE lost many contracts in the <b>charter</b> <b>market</b> in 1990, following Scanair's purchase of larger Douglas DC-10 aircraft. On 18 May 1990, Braathens SAFE was awarded the concession a route from Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger to Newcastle, which opened on 3 April 1991. The airline was also awarded the route from Tromsø to Murmansk, Russia, once per week from 28 January 1993.|$|E
5|$|By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable {{market had}} {{developed}} {{on the south}} side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century it had become a well-known red-light district. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler's neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, <b>Charter</b> <b>Market,</b> and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the New Covent Garden Market about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Braathens SAFE started {{flying to}} Ålesund {{and at the}} same time started flights along the West Coast. In 1959, Fokker F-27s were taken into use, and with the Herons taken out of service, Hamar, Farsund and Tønsberg were terminated. During 1960, the airline flew a single season to Sandefjord and Aalborg. The company also entered the {{domestic}} and international <b>charter</b> <b>market</b> during the 1960s, an industry where the airline would eventually grow to become a large Norwegian and Swedish contestant. Services to Bodø and Tromsø started in 1967, although only from Western Norway. Braathens' main domestic competitor was Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), which operated all the primary domestic routes Braathens SAFE did not, in addition to the international routes. Braathens took Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s into use in 1969; Kristiansund was first served in 1970 and Molde in 1972. From 1984, the airline also operated two Boeing 767s, although they were retired along with the F-28s were in 1986. Services to Longyearbyen started in 1987. From 1987, Braathens SAFE was allowed to make international scheduled flights on certain routes. In 1989, it opened a route to Billund, in 1991 to Malmö, Newcastle and London, and in 1993 to Murmansk. From 1989 to 1994, the airline replaced its fleet with Boeing 737-400 and -500s. From 1989 to 1994, Braathens Helikopter operated services on contract with oil companies to their oil platforms in the North Sea.|$|E

25|$|Saga Tours {{started selling}} Mediterranean charter trips in 1959 and Braathens SAFE was {{signed on to}} operate the charter flights. At first the DC-4 was used, but from 1961 the airline started using the 96-seat Douglas DC-6, {{reaching}} seven aircraft in 1967. Braathens bought strategic ownerships in both Saga Tours and Sweden's Atlas Resor to secure their part of the <b>charter</b> <b>market.</b> Multilateral agreements allowed any Scandinavian airline to fly charter services {{from any of the}} three Scandinavian countries to Spain; while this allowed Braathens SAFE to enter the Swedish and Danish <b>charter</b> <b>market,</b> it increased competition on their home turf.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to remain {{competitive}} in the <b>charter</b> <b>market</b> from Oslo, Gothenburg and Stockholm, the airline ordered two Boeing 767-200 in 1980.

25|$|Mey-Air Transport A/S, trading as Mey-Air, was a Norwegian {{charter airline}} which {{operated}} from 1970 to 1974. Owned by shipping owner Hans Otto Meyer, the company flew both smaller ad hoc charter {{as well as}} inclusive tour (IT). Initially operating a varied fleet of ten Cessna, Beechcraft, Convair CV-240 and NAMC YS-11, these were largely sold in 1972 {{to make way for}} two Boeing 737-200. The company filed for bankruptcy following the demise of the <b>charter</b> <b>market</b> after the 1973 oil crisis.|$|E
25|$|Paralift {{operated}} out of Oslo Airport, Fornebu. It subcontracted maintenance to Fred. Olsen Airtransport and {{catering to}} Scandinavian Airlines System. For the business <b>charter</b> <b>market</b> the airline bought a Cessna 310 in 1970, a Cessna 320 and Cessna 401 in 1972. The Cessna 310 {{was replaced with}} a Cessna 402 in 1975. The Cessna 320 was sold in 1976 and replaced with the airline's first Piper PA-31 Navajo.

40|$|The tanker {{industry}} {{covers all}} business related with trading tankers {{in which there}} are many participants: vessel owners, charterers, shipbuilders, scrappers, consultants, capitalists, brokers, insurers, surveyors, agents, repairing shops, manning companies, and vendors etc. The industry exhibits the characteristics of commoditization driven by price. As the industry is significantly affected by the <b>chartering</b> <b>market,</b> I will herein focus on the <b>chartering</b> <b>market</b> and its movements, in order to better understand the industry. The structure of the market creates recurring cycles and instability. Also, the key elements affecting this market are highly interrelated. Characteristically, long delays of these key elements make the market more uncertain and more volatile. The purpose of this thesis is to study the dynamic of the oil tanker industry, in particular <b>chartering</b> <b>market,</b> using system dynamics methodology.

25|$|While {{the airline}} succeeded at a near break-even on {{scheduled}} services, it saw huge {{losses in the}} <b>charter</b> <b>market,</b> largely driven by overcapacity in the market. For instance, Transwede lost 100 million kronor {{in the first five}} months of 1995. This followed a fleet downsizing that year reducing the airline's charter division to five MD-83s and two MD-87s. Jan Carlzon was hired as chairman in early 1995, and immediately set about to reorganize the airline. It was divided into three business units, which became separate companies. Ownership of the charter division passed to Nordpool, a grouping of inclusive tour operators. The remainder of Transwede was partially bought by Nordic Capital.|$|E
25|$|Mey-Air was {{established}} as a charter airline in 1970, by shipping owner Hans Otto Meyer. Based at the then secondary Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, it intended both to target the ad hoc {{as well as the}} inclusive tour <b>charter</b> <b>market.</b> It initially took over two Convair CV-240 from Meyer, although these were sold in 1970 and 1971. The airline followed up by buying eight aircraft of six different types, consisting of a Cessna 401, a Cessna 402B, a Cessna 421, two NAMC YS-11, two Beechcraft Queen Air, and a Beechcraft King Air 100. These aircraft were quickly sold, {{and by the end of}} 1972 only the Cessna 401 was still in service.|$|E
25|$|BEA Airtours {{was formed}} on 24 April 1969 as a {{division}} of BEA to provide it with a low cost platform {{to participate in the}} then rapidly growing inclusive tour (IT) holiday flights market, which until then had been the exclusive domain of wholly privately owned airlines independent from the government-owned corporation BEA and BOAC. BEA saw this as a necessary counterweight to the independents' rapidly growing scheduled activities that began encroaching on what BEA and BOAC had traditionally regarded as their sole preserve. BEA Airtours' formation was in line with one of the recommendations of the Edwards Report on the future of British air industry - that the corporations should enter the inclusive tour and <b>charter</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
50|$|From the 11th century, the English monarchs {{awarded a}} charter to local lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. A charter granted the lords {{the right to}} take tolls from vendors and also afforded some {{protection}} to a town from rival <b>markets.</b> Once a <b>chartered</b> <b>market</b> was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days. Across the boroughs of England, a network of <b>chartered</b> <b>markets</b> sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise. Gradually these market towns developed a reputation for quality or for trade in specific types of goods. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard these historic charters.|$|R

2500|$|English market towns were {{regulated}} from {{a relatively}} early period. The English monarchs awarded a charter to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village.

25|$|Fred. Olsen {{entered the}} jet age with the {{delivery}} of its first Dassault Falcon 20 in 1967 {{and the establishment of}} the brand Fred. Olsen Executive Service. The ten-seat corporate jet was mostly used for corporate executive charters and as an air ambulance service from Southern Europe to Scandinavia. FOF operated a peak four Falcons. The first two Lockheed L-188 Electras were produced in 1973, when Fred. Olsen bought Nordic Air. One more was bought the following year. These took over all regular cargo services, and the DC-6 aircraft were degraded to the spot <b>charter</b> <b>market.</b> The last DC-6 was sold in 1977, leaving Fred.

25|$|Fred. Olsen leased their Viscounts to Austrian Airlines {{when it was}} {{established}} in 1958. The wet leases ended in April 1960, when Austrian received its own Viscounts. The <b>charter</b> <b>market</b> for the size of aircraft was limited and they were sold to Indian Airlines in January 1962. This was a significant downsizing in the airline, resulting {{in a series of}} lay-offs. FOAM was liquidated in 1962, with some employees being transferred to FOF and a large number going to Kenya, where {{there was a lot of}} need for aviation personnel because of the Shifta War.
