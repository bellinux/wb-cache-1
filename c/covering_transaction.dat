Yet, empirical evidence regarding the impact of privatization remains scarce. Since the seminal work of CAMPBELL-WHITE & BHATIA [1998], <b>covering</b> <b>transactions</b> on the African continent until 1996, no comprehensive assessment has been conducted. At a time when public opposition to further privatization is growing, this paper aims at giving a broad overview {{of the impact of}} privatization in Sub-Saharan Africa from 1991 to 2002 in the light of recent developments, and to derive some general trends and conclusions from the body of empirical evidence available to date. During this period, about 2300 privatization transactions have taken place, generating a total sales value estimated at US$ 9 billion. The main findings on the impact of privatization are as follows: first, privatization has had a minimal one-off impact on the budget; second, firm turnover and profitability have generally increased immediately following privatization but the evidence is mixed regarding the sustainability of the initial post-privatization upswing; third, employment has been adversely affected by privatization, although the latter has not resulted in massive layoffs in absolute terms; fourth, FDI and stock markets have played a limited role in privatization transactions despite some showcase transactions; fifth, regulation and competition have often been overlooked in the privatization process, and even where they have been dealt with, enforcement problems have greatly limited their effectiveness; sixth, privatization has created new political patronage opportunities, leading to numerous corruption scandals which have damaged the credibility of the privatization process; finally, social aspects of privatizations have generally been overlooked, reflecting the tendency to focus on privatization transactions, rather than on sector reorganization at large including wider social objectives.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: In Autumn 2007 a new auction based pricing {{methodology}} (tarjouskauppa) {{was introduced}} to the Finnish residential real estate market. Ever since, the auction pricing has gained popularity. However, auction transactions have not yet been studied in Finnish academia {{from the point of view}} of price formation and time on market. This study fills this gap by examining whether the auction transactions over or underperform traditional transactions in terms of a debt free transaction price and time on market. DATA: The data is combined from two different sources <b>covering</b> <b>transactions</b> from August 2011 to January 2014. The transaction data is hand collected from an online transaction database while the dwelling advertisement data is obtained from "Oikotie. fi" the leading online advertisement platform in Finland. The study is limited on transactions conducted in Helsinki and focuses on condominiums leaving detached houses outside the scope. In total 7, 172 transactions are analyzed of which 1, 354 are traded via auction. The data analysis is done using regression analysis and its applications. RESULTS: The results suggest that on average auction transactions trade at 1. 5 percentage point discount in contrast with negotiated treaties. Assuming an average 200, 000 euro transaction value the economic benefit for the buyer is around 3, 000 euro per transaction. However, steep differences exist between the subareas of the city as transactions in "Southern Helsinki" generate above 4 % discounts whereas transactions in Northern Helsinki receive corresponding premiums implying the economic magnitude of more than 8, 000 euro per transaction for either the seller or buyer depending on the subarea. In contrast with common view, auctions also on average underperform negotiated sales in terms of time on market ("TOM"). The average difference in TOM is 3 - 5 days. Overall, the thesis finds evidence on price and TOM discrepancy between the two alternative transaction methods. On average, the results indicate a little support for the usage of auction pricing from the sellers' perspective...|$|R

I show that the existence of an inverted U-shape relationship between technological distance and the likelihood of being chosen as a target is not very robust. The higher the product market (technological) distance between the acquirer and the target, the more do acquirers prefer firms which are close in technological (product market) space. Regarding the role of acquirer characteristics, I find that the lower the acquirer’s patenting growth and return on assets, the more technologically distant firms are chosen. The relationship between technological distance and the transaction price is also investigated parametrically and semi-parametrically, but no statistically robust inverted U-shape relationship is found.

Few departments of the law exhibit more clearly the flexibility of the constitution, its adaptability to changing economic conditions and the resulting difficulty of forecasting constitutional decisions, than that of foreign corporations. But the greatest factor contributing to uncertainty and anomaly in this branch of the law has been the unfortunate confusion in the theory of the corporation. Curiously enough, by piling fiction upon fiction, some measure of justice has now been worked out by treating the corporation as a 2 ̆ 2 person 2 ̆ 2 or a 2 ̆ 2 person within the jurisdiction 2 ̆ 2 under the Fourteenth Amendment. Not even yet have the Supreme Court and the legal world generally accepted the view that incorporation is merely a device, a form or method adopted by real human beings for doing business and enjoying their property, just as a partnership is.

Unfortunately, the ECMA-PCTE standard does not contain a protocol of this kind. The common protocol for distributed transactions is the two-phase commit.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The project aimed to make widely accessible the data gathered on the alien commodity trade {{as a result of}} an act of parliament in 1439, which required the formal pairing of alien merchants with English hosts who kept registers of alien business activities. Copies of these registers (or views) were ordered to be returned to the exchequer. The original documents, in Anglo-Norman French and Latin written up in 15 th century hands, are available to the public at The National Archives, but the linguistic and palaeographical skills necessary to read them have proven a considerable obstacle to their use, except by a handful of professional scholars who have used the source to provide occasional illustrations of particular points. The project was designed to make the source readily and easily available to a broader readership in the form of a full transcript, as well as an English translation, and a database. The project further examined the antecedents and context of the 1439 legislation, and sought to identify the social, political and economic forces driving this early effort to isolate and control alien communities. It explored the data in terms of the contemporary good and bad alien stereotypes. It also assessed the mechanics of the administrative system employed for data collection, its adequacy to the task, and the methods used by aliens to evade it. Main Topics : The database contains 6 related tables which record the names and commodity descriptions from some 2, 300 individual business transactions which took place between alien and English merchants during the early 1440 s. It includes exact dates of the transaction, where given in the original; the forename and surname of the alien in a standardised spelling, together with his role as supplier or client, and the description of his status as given in the preamble to the original document. The forename and surname of the merchant with whom he dealt is also entered in a standardised spelling, together with his or her role as supplier or client, and a note of his or her trade affiliation or social status where it is known. A description of the commodity is entered, including any specification as to its colour or quality, the commodity then being assigned to an appropriate category of goods (spice, fabric, food, drink household, manufacture, personal, military, construction, fur). The weight, measurement or number of the commodity as given in the original is entered, with the price paid in sterling (sd) and an automatically generated equivalent price in pence (d) to facilitate calculation. Additionally, an indication is given as to whether the price applies only to one particular commodity, or represents an overall price for a <b>transaction</b> <b>covering</b> several listed commodities...|$|R
