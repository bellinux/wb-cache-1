40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} commodity-production and financial network structures in the regional economy as dual conjugate systems. Material flows (raw materials, goods and so on) circulate in the commodity network as shown by Leontiev’s input-output balance model. Nonmaterial flows of property rights, money, and so on circulate in the financial network and reflect the movement of material objects in commodity networks. A network structure comprises <b>closed</b> and open <b>circuits,</b> which have fundamentally different characteristics: locally <b>closed</b> <b>circuits</b> meet local demand by supplying locally produced goods, thus ensuring self-reproduction of the local economy; open (or transit) circuits provide export-import flows. The article describes the mechanism of ‘internal’ money generation in <b>closed</b> <b>circuits</b> of commodity-production networks. The results of the theoretical study are illustrated by the calculations of <b>closed</b> and open <b>circuit</b> flows in the municipal economy model. Mutual settlements between the population and manufacturing enterprises are given in matrix form. It {{was found that the}} volume of the turnover in <b>closed</b> <b>circuits</b> of the municipal economic network model is about 28. 5 % of the total turnover and can be provided by ‘internal’ non-inflationary money. The remaining 71. 5 % of the total turnover correspond to the flows in the network’s open circuits providing export and import. The conclusion is made that in the innovation-driven economy, main attention should be given to the projects oriented towards domestic consumption rather than export supplies. The economy is based on internal production cycles in <b>closed</b> <b>circuits.</b> Thus, it is necessary to find the chains in the inter-industrial and inter-production relations which could become the basis of the production cycle. Money investments will complete such commodity chains and ‘launch’ the production cycle.

30|$|Two {{types of}} {{circuits}} {{are commonly used}} to control hydraulic actuators: open and <b>closed.</b> In open <b>circuits,</b> power generated by a motor is reduced and regulated by a valve and is transmitted to a hydraulic actuator. Much of the power is dissipated in the valve, resulting in lower efficiency and larger system designs. Figure  1 shows a schematic of an open hydraulic <b>circuit.</b> In <b>closed</b> <b>circuits</b> (known as electro-hydrostatic actuators or EHAs) a servomotor generates and directly controls the power. Figure  2 shows a schematic of a <b>closed</b> hydraulic <b>circuit</b> (EHA). <b>Closed</b> hydraulic <b>circuits</b> offer three advantages: (1) the systems are simple and small; (2) the efficiency is high; (3) valve-related nonlinearities are omitted. However, there is a drawback in EHAs; the control performance of EHAs is worse than that of open hydraulic circuits. Therefore, control performance of EHAs is improved in this study.|$|R
