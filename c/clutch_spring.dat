40|$|The rubber v-belt {{continuously}} variable transmission (RVB-CVT) in motorcycle is very important because it affects good drive ability in terms of response and smoothness for the rider or passenger. RVB-CVT mechanically consists of primary clutch, secondary clutch and V-belt. The new mechanism of mechanical RVB-CVT components with electric motor is introduced. The objectives of this thesis are to design and to simulate a new actuate the electro-mechanical single acting pulley rubber V-belt {{continuously variable}} transmission. The electro-mechanical single acting pulley rubber V-belt {{continuously variable transmission}} (EMSAP RVB-CVT) system consists of two sets of pulleys, primary pulley and cam mechanism placed on input fixed shaft and secondary pulley placed on the secondary fixed shaft. The primary pulley design changes to reduce the centrifugal force generated by {{the mass of the}} weights and <b>clutch</b> <b>spring,</b> replaced the cam mechanism which is controlled by a DC motor through a gear's mechanism.

50|$|Wrap-spring clutches: These have a helical spring, {{typically}} wound with square-cross-section wire. These {{were developed}} in the late 19th and early 20th century. In simple form the spring is fastened at {{one end to the}} driven member; its other end is unattached. The spring fits closely around a cylindrical driving member. If the driving member rotates in the direction that would unwind the spring the spring expands minutely and slips although with some drag. Because of this, <b>spring</b> <b>clutches</b> must typically be lubricated with light oil. Rotating the driving member the other way makes the spring wrap itself tightly around the driving surface and the clutch locks up very quickly. The torque required to make a <b>spring</b> <b>clutch</b> slip grows exponentially with the number of turns in the spring, obeying the capstan equation.|$|R

The lack of biarticular actuation is one prominent example {{of the differences between}} commercially available prosthetic feet and the intact human lower limb. A novel biarticular prosthesis (BP) with a quasi-passive <b>clutched</b> <b>spring</b> mechanism to improve transtibial amputee gait was designed and evaluated. An open-sourced amputee musculoskeletal model was developed, validated, and utilized to evaluate how the BP affected gait. Seven transtibial amputee subjects walked on a treadmill using their prescribed prosthesis and then wearing the BP under different spring configurations and with biofeedback. Motion capture and ground reaction force data were collected, processed, and then OpenSim was used to perform inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and static muscle force optimization. Mechanically the BP performed as expected with the biarticular spring replicating the function of the gastrocnemius, albeit at torque levels much lower than biological. The BP had no significant effect on gait symmetry nor total muscle force. The developed open sourced musculoskeletal model is a valuable community resource that will aid future studies of amputee gait...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the I. C. engine torque, {{the impacts}} between the tooth of the unloaded gear pairs of {{a gear box}} produce vibrations originating an acoustic phenomenon, known as “gear rattle noise”. The paper presents a theoretical study on the dynamic behaviour of automotive transmissions focusing {{on the presence of}} oil between the impacting tooth of the meshing gears. This rattle phenomenon is particularly audible at low regimes and regards all the gear pairs different from the gear inserted to transmit the power. Another operating condition that manifests the gear rattle phenomenon is typically the “idle condition”, when all the gear pairs are meshing but without loading. The presence of oil between the impacting tooth of the gear pairs can play a positive role to decrease the vibrations and than the rattle noise level. In the paper some driveline complete models comprising many components as flywheel, clutch, primary and secondary shafts, are described accounting for the presence of oil lubricant between the teeth of the unloaded gear pairs. The described models consider an oil film lubrication between the tooth of the gear pairs, starting from the Reynolds equation and adopting some hypotheses regarding in particular the oil squeeze effect and also hypotheses about the teeth shape. Moreover some dissipative terms as friction and hysteresis in the <b>clutch</b> <b>springs</b> together with the oil drag torque in the gear box elements have been considered and modelled in the article...|$|R
