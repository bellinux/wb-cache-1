25|$|Expenses {{incurred}} in a trading, business, rental, {{or other}} income producing activity are generally deductible, though {{there may be}} limitations on some types of expenses or activities. Business expenses include all manner of costs {{for the benefit of}} the activity. An allowance (as a <b>capital</b> <b>allowance</b> or depreciation deduction) is nearly always allowed for recovery of costs of assets used in the activity. Rules on capital allowances vary widely, and often permit recovery of costs more quickly than ratably over the life of the asset.|$|E
2500|$|Logistics of the airport's {{construction}} were critical, {{because of}} the island's isolated location {{and the lack of}} construction equipment, which would require everything such as extremely heavy duty equipment and materials to be shipped in, thus resulting in a huge and unique logistics operation. Due to the limited landing infrastructure, with no breakwater or mooring facilities at the sea front, new harbour facilities capable of handling construction equipment and fuel supplies were constructed at Rupert's Bay. Fuel transfers between Rupert's Bay and the aerodrome, connected by a [...] haul road, were assumed to be by road tanker for 20 years, after which a <b>capital</b> <b>allowance</b> was made for enlargement of the bulk fuel storage and the installation of a fuel transfer pipeline.|$|E

5000|$|Since no capital {{deductions}} are allowed, depreciation {{on capital}} assets is not tax-deductible, although tax depreciation, known as [...] "capital allowances" [...] is available instead for expenditure on some <b>capital</b> assets. <b>Capital</b> <b>allowances</b> are {{given by the}} <b>Capital</b> <b>Allowances</b> Act 2001 (CAA 2001). Note that expenditure on finance leases (as opposed to, say, lease or hire purchase agreements) {{is considered to be}} revenue.

50|$|A {{common system}} is to allow a fixed {{percentage}} {{of the cost of}} depreciable assets to be deducted each year. This {{is often referred to as}} a <b>capital</b> <b>allowance,</b> as it is called in the United Kingdom. Deductions are permitted to individuals and businesses based on assets placed in service during or before the assessment year. Canada's Capital Cost Allowance are fixed percentages of assets within a class or type of asset. Fixed percentage rates are specified by type of asset. The fixed percentage is multiplied by the tax basis of assets in service to determine the <b>capital</b> <b>allowance</b> deduction. The tax law or regulations of the country specifies these percentages. <b>Capital</b> <b>allowance</b> calculations may be based on the total set of assets, on sets or pools by year (vintage pools) or pools by classes of assets...Depreciation has got three methods only.|$|E

50|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>allowance</b> reliefs can be {{set against}} the client’s taxable profits {{reducing}} the amount payable. Companies pay Corporation Tax at 20% or 26% (2011-12 figure), whilst individuals pay tax at 20%, 40% or 45%. Please note as it is an allowance against taxable profit, {{you have to be}} a tax payer to benefit, therefore this does not normally apply to property owned in SIPPS or by charities and trusts. Allowances are generated when a business client builds or acquires commercial property. The amount of plant contained within the building or acquired property is the key to maximising the relief.|$|E

50|$|The {{project began}} its {{work with the}} {{legislation}} covering <b>capital</b> <b>allowances</b> and the first legislation passed thanks to the project was the <b>Capital</b> <b>Allowances</b> Act 2001.

Three pieces of primary legislation relating to income tax—the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 and the Income Tax Act 2007—have been passed by Parliament. Their main change is to remove the concept of schedules from British income tax law. Previously income was assessed in one of six schedules (labelled from A through to F) depending on its source. The schedules have been replaced with everyday terminology. For example Schedule A income is now referred to as property income and Schedule E income is now referred to as employment income.|$|R
