Three Supremes albums - Let the Sunshine In, <b>Cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crop,</b> and Touch - were reworked into Deena Jones & The Dreams album designs, with the only differences in the designs being the substitution of the names and images of the Supremes with those of Deena Jones & the Dreams. Another Dreams LP seen in the film, Meet the Dreams, is represented by an album cover derived from the designs for the Supremes LPs Meet The Supremes More Hits by The Supremes and The Supremes A' Go-Go. There is also a solo album, Just In Time, recorded by Deena Jones shown in the film, the album cover for {{which is based on}} Dionne Warwick's 1970 album Very Dionne.|$|E

Neil Gaiman's work on the series is {{considered}} legendary for a reason. This story, in its entirety, is every bit as good as Watchmen and of equal (if not greater) literary merit. Were I to list the 100 best single comic-book issues I have ever read, three would come from this collection. Whether you have read The Sandman before or are a first timer, this is the one book you need to buy this fall. The stories within are magnificent and the care taken in reproducing Gaiman's work is the same you'd expect for any great work of literature." ...|$|E

40|$|With {{attention}} to <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> money {{and other resources}} that company invests in training and developing its people, only minimal attention is, however, given to ensure that learned skills, knowledge and attitudes are transferred properly into actual workplace. In Thailand, a leading international hotel chain offers a management trainee program to develop local young talents and provide accelerating career path. This program, therefore, attracts <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crops</b> from top universities in Thailand and Thai graduates abroad to join an 18 -month program. Although <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> management trainees hired are increasing, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> trainees graduated from this program is decreasing. Many quitted the program during or after the training. In fact, the program is well-structured so why did management trainees give up their commitments? In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internationalization and modernization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, work environment still features unique local culture. In this case, seniority and hierarchy are highly valued and practiced in professional setting. Junior leaders can hardly lead or drive change over senior colleagues. This research consequently explores how seniority and hierarchy in Thai work environment affect transfer <b>of</b> training <b>of</b> <b>the</b> management trainee program by employing generic qualitative analysis as the research method to collect and analyze data from twenty-two individual interviews. Of which number, fourteen are management trainees, four are human resources directors and four are general managers or coaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> management trainees. Researcher investigates four main factors affecting work environment which are opportunity to perform, transfer climate, social support and follow-up. The results ratify that seniority and hierarchy are strongly present in Thai work environment. Transfer of training of management trainee program and three additional work-environment factors namely opportunity to perform, social support and transfer climate are relatedly influenced. Whereupon, the consequences are job dissatisfaction and eventually, resignation from the program. On the bright side, job satisfaction and loyalty are enjoyed by those management trainees who successfully adapt to this work culture. With all findings considered, researcher constructively presents a discussion and suggestions {{for the company to}} improve the program and its effectiveness...|$|R

Arbuckle, accompanied by text headlining his achievement and {{entry into the}} Rice Athletic Hall of Fame. Caption reads: PHILIP H. ARBUCKLE not only was Rice’s first coach and athletic director, in his 10 years, he also was Rice’s winningest coach. Arbuckle’s teams won 48, lost 26 and tied eight for a winning percentage of 58. 5 per cent. He had only one losing season... his last in 1923. This tops even Jess Neely’s great record over 27 years (51. 4 per cent). A former University of Illinois football, baseball and basketball player from the Illinois farm country, Coach Arbuckle took his Ph. D (Bachelor of Philosophy) from Chicago U. in 1906, studying coaching under the late Alonzo A. Staff. By 1908 he {{had been brought to}} Southwestern in Georgetown where he turned that pioneer Texas institution’s athletic program completely around in four years. Going with Rice before the Institute opened in 1912, Arbuckle proved to be not only capable as a coach but a smart salesman. He needed top boys. He recruited them by driving home two points... Rice offered a superior education and Houston offered a wonderful after-life opportunity. In those days when many good athletes were solid students, this pitch won. In his fifth year (1916) Rice got <b>the</b> <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high school <b>crop.</b> By then he had beaten A&M and Baylor, and was ready to win over Texas in 1917. Coach Arbuckle was not year 50 years old in 1932 when he died of a heart condition. He was married to Georgia Ruth Curtin. They had three children – Phil H., Jr. of Houston, H. M. Arbuckle of Clear Lake and Mrs. Joe Russell, Jr., Richmond. Phil and Mrs. Russell attended Rice. Rice Athletic Hall of Fam...|$|R
