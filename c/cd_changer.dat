500|$|Pop {{music critic}} Robert Hilburn {{described}} [...] "Speechless", and another song from Invincible ("Butterflies"), as being [...] "as woefully generic as their titles". Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star contested that the acappellas in [...] "Speechless" [...] {{were enough to}} make a person wish that Jackson actually was unable to make a sound. Michigan Daily writer Dustin J. Seibert wrote that the song was a [...] "shining [...] of what happens when The Gloved One gets beside himself and writes smarmy crap that should be reserved for a <b>CD</b> <b>changer</b> somewhere in a preschool". The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was one of the weaker tracks from Invincible. Elliot Sylvester of The Independent felt that the song was [...] "pure Jackson– almost to a formulaic fault". The Dallas Morning News Thor Christensen said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was [...] "produced by Mr. Jackson in bombastic style à la Celine Dion". He added that as the track ended with an emotional Jackson, it drew a parallel with the singer's 1972 ode to a rat, [...] "Ben".|$|E
