At this time, the U.S. government, citing the Feres precedent, did not offer <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> the families of the U.S. victims. This {{was the first time that}} the U.S. had offered <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> the victims of a friendly fire incident.|$|E

5|$|In 1998 Congressman Lamar S. Smith, {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, held hearings on the compensation issue. He questioned the DoD representatives as to why compensation had not also been offered to the U.S. family members.

5|$|The airline offered <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> the locals, {{but this}} was {{rejected}} in a letter date 27 June, in which the locals collectively stated {{that they were just}} happy to help. In a Council of State on 21 August, Schlytter, Tønsberg, Robert Porten and Heggenes were awarded the Medal for Heroic Deeds.

5|$|A row {{broke out}} on 1 March 2007 when it emerged that the Government were paying <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> {{the company for}} the 159,000 culled turkeys while laid-off workers were {{receiving}} nothing. At £3.75 each for hens and £3.53 for toms, the payout was then estimated at between £537,000 and £570,000. In the event, though, the actual compensation bill came out at £589,356.89. The crisis cost Bernard Matthews at least £20m in lost sales and costs.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, {{considering}} {{that in the}} shared international production, multinational companies participate, especially in economies like the Mexican one, breaking down the value added in <b>compensations</b> <b>to</b> capital and labor allows to further advance in defining the type of prerequisites that must be fulfilled in order for exports growth to translate into economic growth. That is, {{considering that}} the multiplier effect of exports assumes that the income generated by these exports equals an increase of the domestic demand of consumption and/or capital, once the intermediate inputs content of imported origin plus the marginal propensity to import consumption goods and capital is discounted; it must be considered that the <b>compensations</b> <b>to</b> capital to which multinational companies are entitled to, could be {{brought back to the}} country, spent or saved in different economies to the one directly exporting; such that it is the <b>compensations</b> <b>to</b> labor the ones that come back to the system in the form of consumption goods and savings.|$|R

5|$|After an {{incident}} involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began {{between the two}} countries. Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to make only token resistance, and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region, trusting the League to settle the dispute. The League condemned the Greek invasion, and called for both Greek withdrawal and <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|After {{debating whether}} {{abolition}} of slavery would best proceed gradually or at once, with <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> loyal Union men or without, the Convention resolved to abolish slavery immediately without compensation on April 10, 1864. It abolished the viva voce voting {{and called for}} secret balloting for electing state officials. Immediately on its proclamation, the Constitution of 1864 was enforceable only in areas under Union control, but it would serve as Virginia's fundamental law until the Constitution of 1870 went into force.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{interest}} in the battlecruiser project, the two sides could not agree on terms. The German delegation insisted that orders placed in their country be guaranteed, with financial <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> be paid to German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships. They also refused to release {{a complete set of}} plans for the Scharnhorsts. Further complicating negotiations, the Dutch Cabinet, which would have to approve any deal, did not convene during the summer of 1939.|$|E

5|$|During {{this entire}} period, BE1 was insolvent. The bank {{therefore}} {{required that the}} entire sales price of Hamar stadion be transferred to BG, even though NOK50 million {{was to go to}} the construction of Børstad Idrettspark (BIP). Therefore, Hamar Municipality decided to finance BIP to secure sufficient funding for Briskeby, essentially subsidizing Briskeby with a further NOK50 million. In 2007, BG paid NOK3.4 million in <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> Ham-Kam for lost ticket sales during the construction time and for the club house, which would be demolished.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} the company confirmed, on 19 February 2007, that 130 workers would {{be laid off}} {{for a period of}} twenty days due to a drop in product sales. The Transport and General Workers' Union then called for the government to provide <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> the workers affected. The Transport and General Workers' Union paid out hardship monies from union funds to union members, on top of any state benefits to which the laid-off workers were entitled and a one-off £100 payment from Bernard Matthews.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{three issues}} of the Chilean {{electricity}} regulation and their incidence in the energy crisis of 1998 - 99. Could the price mechanism manage the supply shortage without blackouts? Did the regulation provide incentives to invest in reserve capacity?, and what were the effects of limiting <b>compensations</b> <b>to</b> consumers for blackouts? The model developed shows that the price mechanism is excessively rigid when facing shocks, mostly because outage costs are not contingent prices. In addition, the authorities dismantled the incentives to ameliorate {{the effects of the}} crisis when they limited the <b>compensations</b> <b>to</b> consumers, without efficiency gains or higher financial security to generators. Finally, errors in setting nodal prices affect all producers, independently of their thermo-hydroelectric mix. Consequently, even if the probabilities of droughts are biased downwards, firms will adjust optimally investment without hampering security levels.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} share-based <b>compensations</b> <b>to</b> shareholders in the Nigerian banking sector. The major consolidation reform took effect in 2005. The pre-consolidation period covered the period before 2004 while the post-consolidation era covered the period after 2005. The sample comprised bank officers of four banks in Nigeria. The audited financial {{statements of the}} four selected banks covering the periods of 2002 to 2008 were analyzed. A questionnaire was also designed to elicit information from 33 bank staff randomly selected from the four selected quoted Banks in Nigeria and 60 stakeholders. Participants were required to provide their views on share-based using the questionnaire. A research hypothesis was formulated and tested using the t-test statistics tool at 0. 05 alpha level of significance. The findings of the study revealed some differences in the share-based <b>compensations</b> <b>to</b> the shareholders {{before and after the}} 2005 bank consolidation exercise in Nigeria. However, no significant difference was found in the observations of respondents as regards share-based <b>compensations</b> <b>to</b> shareholders at pre and post consolidation era. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that the banking sector should ensure that its operations are carried out in a more transparent manner in order to encourage better investment and promote accountability...|$|R

5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for compensation. While waiting for a response, {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the <b>compensation</b> <b>to</b> redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E
