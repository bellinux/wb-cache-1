5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Anita Shapira, {{there is}} a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' {{and the image of}} the battle as retained in collective memory. This is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the battle of Latrun, which has become, in Israel, a founding myth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E
25|$|Religious scriptures {{suggest that}} the Llü-bu were female shamans who practised divination, exorcism, and other rites in a trance. By the early nineteenth century, the Dongba priests had created a huge {{religious}} vocabulary accompanied {{by a variety of}} rituals, and had largely displaced the Llü-bu. This is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Yi shamans, but the connection to dongba practices remains unclear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Below"? Here is, at all events, a word added (instead of {{anything}} being taken away); invariable, <b>certainly</b> in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of lakes, but not absolutely necessary.|$|R
5000|$|So while <b>the</b> CAG <b>certainly</b> makes <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that <b>the</b> Government had {{legal grounds}} {{on which to}} {{introduce}} competitive bidding into the coal allocation process, saying that there was [...] "no legal impediment" [...] to doing so perhaps overstates their case.|$|R
60|$|It {{has been}} proved that at {{considerable}} elevations in Europe, the hours of periodic ebb and flow differ materially from those which prevail {{at the level of}} the sea; but this is <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in <b>the</b> Sikkim Himalaya.|$|R
25|$|Infertility {{is often}} {{described}} as a characteristic of A-T. Whereas this is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the mouse model of A-T, in humans it may be more accurate to characterize the reproductive abnormality as gonadal atrophy or dysgenesis characterized by delayed pubertal development. Because programmed DSBs are generated to initiate genetic recombinations involved in the production of sperm and eggs in reproductive organs (a process known as meiosis), meiotic defects and arrest can occur when ATM is not present.|$|E
25|$|From {{its early}} years, {{when it was}} contending that the Nairs needed to join {{together}} {{if they were to}} become a political force, it argued that the caste members should cease referring to their traditional subdivisions and instead see themselves as a whole. Census information thereafter appears to have become unreliable on the matter of the subdivisions, in part at least because of the NSS campaign to ensure that respondents did not provide the information requested of them. The NSS also promoted marriage across the various divisions in a further attempt to promote caste cohesion, although in this instance it met with only limited success. Indeed, even in the 1970s it was likely that cross-subdivision marriage was rare generally, and this was <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the Central Travancore area.|$|E
25|$|As {{land prices}} and incomes {{continued}} to fall, the great London palaces {{were the first}} casualties; the peer no longer needed to use his London house to maintain a high prestige presence in the capital. Its site was often more valuable empty than with the anachronistic palace in situ; selling them for redevelopment was the obvious first choice to raise some fast cash. The second choice was to sell part of the landed estate, especially if had been purchased in order to expand political territory. In fact, the buying of land in earlier times, before the reforms of 1885, to expand political territory had had a detrimental effect on country houses too. Often when a second estate was purchased to expand another, the purchased estate also had a country house. If the land (and its subsequent local influence) was the only requirement, its house would then be let or neglected, often both. This was <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> at Tong Castle (see below) and many other houses. A large unwanted country house unsupported by land quickly became a liability.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} subject to {{significant}} agricultural run off and flows from wastewater treatment works. Hence despite recent improvements, still suffers water quality problems. At one time (around 70 years ago) the water was apparently crystal clear. This is <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> today.|$|R
40|$|Miniaturization {{is one of}} {{the prime}} motives in modern {{communication}} systems and can be achieved through size reduction of both components and their packages. Whereas passive components are fairly insensitive to packaging, this is <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for antennas as the package is located in the nearfield...|$|R
5000|$|It {{has long}} been mooted that Pacificus' poetic {{abilities}} were put to use turning Saint Francis' songs into verse, however {{there is no evidence}} to support this. <b>Certainly,</b> in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of <b>the</b> [...] "Canticle of the Sun" [...] its simple construction would suggest that the saint needed no help.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} music S Club 7 {{normally}} falls under is pop, or more specifically bubblegum pop, {{as well as}} manufactured pop. This is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for their first album, S Club where simple lyrics, three-chord structures and danceable beats define it so. Their first two singles saw vocals shared equally amongst the seven members of the group, {{and it was not}} until their third single, [...] "Two in a Million" [...] that O'Meara became known as their lead vocalist. Although the band were to progressively change their style over the four years they were together, even their first album had many tracks atypical of the pop genre: [...] "You're My Number One" [...] ,"Love Train" [...] and [...] "Everybody Wants Ya" [...] were motown driven whereas [...] "Viva La Fiesta" [...] and [...] "It's A Feel Good Thing", were both [...] "bouncy, salsa-driven Latino songs".|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{traffic on}} the branch was {{reported}} to be [...] "very satisfactory"; while <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for goods traffic, it is doubtful that this applied to passenger traffic with an average of four passengers per train.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "that is <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Still, {{they put}} me into the little boat out of friendliness--and I'm not quite sure anybody else could do as much for them, or, at least, would make an equal effort in the {{somewhat}} curious circumstances. Of course, that sounds a trifle egotistical; but still----" ...|$|R
3000|$|Up to {{the late}} 1990 s, the {{perception}} was that both type of discrete basic Hermite polynomials have only discrete orthogonality measures. This is <b>certainly</b> true in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, old friend, that <b>certainly</b> alters <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> However, as you see, {{there is}} no {{probability}} whatever {{of the young people}} taking that view of <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Ned Hampton has always been like an elder brother or, if you like, a favourite cousin of Dorothy's, and since he came home I have never seen the slightest change in his manner towards her. As to her, you have just heard what she has said.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Croke argued [...] like Barry basing his {{argument}} on Vattel's The Law of Nations [...] that international law validated such acquisition of sovereignty over [...] "uncivilised" [...] peoples, providing that adequate territory {{were left to}} them for their sustenance, and said that that was <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the Australian colonies.|$|E
2500|$|... 1878 was a [...] "chilly and wet summer" [...] {{in which}} the bad wickets reduced [...] "all (batsmen) to {{comparative}} impotence" [...] but enabled bowlers to dominate and cause [...] "havoc" [...] and that was <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> at Lord's on 27 May. CricketArchive states without elaboration that: [...] "the match was scheduled for three days but completed in one".|$|E
2500|$|Another of the French traditions, as {{developed}} from the dominant force in French dramatic literature and personified by Eugene Scribe's concept of the [...] "well-made play" [...] (which {{may be seen in}} many of the opera libretti he wrote), concerns the notion of a [...] "coup de theatre" [...] whereby some extraordinary action occurs to turn the evolution of the story totally on its head. [...] This is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with L'assedio.|$|E
50|$|Wittmann (1991) {{proposed}} that RSL was a language isolate (a 'prototype' sign language), though one developed through stimulus diffusion from an existing sign language. However, his classification presupposes {{that it was}} a full language, which is almost <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> and Kuschel (<b>the</b> only source of information about this communication system) cites no evidence to suggest that there was any contact with any sign language.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} actual author of all or parts of the Tractatus. The legal {{opinions}} of Glanvill's nephew, Hubert Walter are <b>certainly</b> cited. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> Glanvill perhaps supervised and <b>certainly</b> approved <b>the</b> work, and the issue is sidestepped in the literature by using terminology such as [...] "commonly attributed to Glanvill".|$|R
40|$|Psychiatric/Mental Health nursing {{contains}} many challenges and rewards. While {{some of the}} challenges are obvious and well documented, the rewards are more often implicit and occasionally invisible (Michael, 1994) Indeed, no doubt many of you will have been asked, as I have, “Why do you do it?” For {{members of the public}} the emotional recompense for general nurses is understandable and apparent; this is <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with P/MH nursing...|$|R
2500|$|On 31 July, {{a member}} of the Bulgarian {{security}} establishment told The New York Times that there was a [...] "clear direction that points to Hezbollah," [...] in the pattern as well as evidence of the attack. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated, [...] "It is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that Hezbollah and Iran have been bad actors, as a general matter, but we're not, at this point, {{in a position to make}} a statement about responsibility." [...] The Pentagon has said that there were [...] "distinctive Hezbollah markings" [...] linked to the attack in Burgas, although at the time they could not [...] "decisively state" [...] who was responsible for the attack.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is known}} that `Abdu'l-Bahá also sat for portraits {{at the request of}} Gibran. [...] From the above it may be {{concluded}} that `Abdu'l-Bahá and Gibran knew each other more than in passing, but that `Abdu'l-Bahá made no formal or informal claims or suggestions about Gibran's writing but cooperated whenever asked (as for sitting for the drawings.) So the influence is really at the choice of Gibran - he could as well have chosen and mention any other source of inspiration for his book. It seems he chose `Abdu'l-Bahá. As `Abdu'l-Bahá is one of the [...] of the Bahá'í Faith and these are works of fiction, it is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that at least two of Gibran's, and his most famous, are properly mentioned here.|$|E
2500|$|Carroll wrote many poem parodies such as [...] "Twinkle, twinkle little bat", [...] "You Are Old, Father William" [...] and [...] "How Doth the Little Crocodile?" [...] Some {{have become}} {{generally}} better known than the originals {{on which they}} are based, and this is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with [...] "Jabberwocky". The poems' successes do not rely on any recognition or association of the poems that they parody. Lucas suggests that the original poems provide a strong container but Carroll's works are famous precisely because of their random, surreal quality. Carroll's grave playfulness has been {{compared with that of}} the poet Edward Lear; there are also parallels with the work of Gerard Manley Hopkins in the frequent use of soundplay, alliteration, created-language and portmanteau. Both writers were Carroll's contemporaries.|$|E
5000|$|Among the islets are Houmet Benest/Houmet Benêt, Houmet Paradis and Houmet Hommetol (Omptolle). Although Victor Hugo {{suggests}} that they were heavily eroded by quarrying (which was <b>certainly</b> true in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Crevichon off Herm), Victor Coysh disagrees saying: ...|$|R
3000|$|... {{corresponds}} to the discrete basic Hermite polynomials of type I. Up to the late 1990 years, the perception was that both type of discrete basic Hermite polynomials have only discrete orthogonality measures. This is <b>certainly</b> true in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of [...]...|$|R
50|$|Although {{images of}} autarkic farmers {{who had no}} {{connection}} {{to the rest of}} China may have some merit for the earlier Han and T'ang dynasties, this was <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for <b>the</b> Ming dynasty. During the Ming dynasty, the increase in population and the decrease in quality land made it necessary that farmers make a living off cash crops. Many of these markets appeared in the rural countryside, where goods were exchanged and bartered.|$|R
2500|$|The manuscripts {{give the}} title of the work as Vita Cypriani ("The Life of Cyprian"), while Jerome (see above) {{referred}} to it as Vita et passio Cypriani ("Life and martyrdom of Cyprian"). Jerome's reference may not be intended as a title; but it is <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that the book is clearly divided into two parts, one concerned with Cyprian's life, one with the events leading up to his martyrdom. [...] In the preface to the work, Pontius expresses regret there were detailed accounts of the martyrdoms of lay Christians, but none of a bishop like Cyprian who had so much worth narrating even without the martyrdom (1, 2). Chapters 3 to 10 relate Cyprian's activities from the time of his conversion, while chapters 11-19 describe proceedings before two different proconsuls, their judgements and Cyprian's final martyrdom.|$|E
2500|$|... {{from page}} 222 of her book, Esoteric Healing and it {{provides}} context for the criticisms that follow. [...] "...Inter-marriage between nations and races, the fusion of bloods for hundreds of years—due to migration, travel, education and mental unity—has led to there being no really pure racial types today. [...] This is far more <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> than the most enlightened think, if the long, long history of mankind is considered. [...] Sexual intercourse knows no impenetrable barriers, and people today have in them all the strains and the blood of all the races, and this (as {{a result of the}} world war, 1914-1945) will be increasingly the case. [...] This development is definitely a part of the divine plan, no matter how undesirable it may appear to those who idealize purity of relationship ... Something intended is being brought about and it cannot be avoided." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another event, within freemasonry itself, {{accelerated}} {{the demand for}} patents from the non-French masonic authorities. [...] Internal disputes within the Grand Lodge of France led to its suspension in 1767, {{a result of the}} Convent's secession from this Grand Lodge in Paris, having been excluded in previous years. [...] From then on lodges in the Austrian Netherlands came to feel isolated. [...] This was <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the [...] "Vraie et Parfaite Harmonie" [...] ("True and Perfect Harmony") lodge in Mons (English patent, received January 1770), probably also for the [...] "Discrète Impériale" [...] in Aalst (English patent, received June 1765) and perhaps for the [...] "Parfaite Union/Bonne Amitié" [...] in Namur (Scottish patent, received February 1770). [...] In 1770, the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Austrian Netherlands formed, dependent on the Grand Lodge of London (the [...] "Moderns"), made up of 26 lodges and with the Marquis de Gage as its Grand Master. [...] It was centred on de Gage's own lodge [...] "la Vraie et Parfaite Harmonie" [...] in Mons, the most brilliant of the 18th century Austrian Netherlands.|$|E
40|$|Sulfur {{is often}} {{classified}} as a “secondary” essential element, mainly due to a smaller plant requirement, {{but also because it}} is less frequently applied as a fertilizer compared to N, P, and K. This has <b>certainly</b> been <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Iowa, where research had not documented S deficiency or fertilization need for optimal crop production. However, if deficient, S can have a dramatic effect on plant growth and crop productivity – more than the classification “secondary” would imply...|$|R
50|$|The fifth criterion, residents, {{would appear}} to imply that {{universities}} must be residential. This was <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in <b>the</b> early 19th century as the Scottish universities were non-residential. The London colleges followed this pattern (as did the redbrick university colleges later on the century), although Durham followed Oxford and Cambridge in being residential. It also {{does not apply to}} the modern era, with both the Open University and the University of Arden being distance-learning institutes.|$|R
60|$|Such <b>certainly</b> was <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{of these}} men, of whom I could {{not so much}} as see room to suppose any of them were saved; nothing could make it rational, so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, except the {{possibility}} only of their being taken up by another ship in company: and this was but mere possibility indeed; for I saw not the least signal or appearance of any such thing.|$|R
