40|$|Figure 11 {{shows the}} {{locations}} of various types of corridors within the Leoland landscape. This corridor analysis departed somewhat from convention in that it included as corridors two landscape elements {{that do not have}} high contrast with the surrounding matrix: hiking trails and riparian forest corridors. This approach seemed justified by the functional importance of these relatively linear phenomena within the landscape, that of fostering transport of organisms (including humans) from one part of the landscape to another. Roads- The major road corridors in Leoland are gravel-surfaced one-lane routes (with the exception of paved sections on the lower portions of Rds. 4630 - 200 and 4631) initially developed to provide logging access and (in the case of the 4630 / 4630 - 200 system) construction and maintenance for the pipeline between Harriet Lake and Three Lynx. These road corridors are relatively narrow, consisting of the roadbed itself and a narrow (generally less than 20 ’ wide on either side) verge. The vegetation of the verge usually consists of a mixture of grasses, forbs and shrubs, some non-native. The most common species are: <b>common</b> <b>brome,</b> orchardgrass, bracken fern, Queen Anne’s lace, swordfern, white hawkweed, fireweed, vine maple, willow, Scotch broom, trailing blackberry, bigleaf maple and red alder (scientific and common names of all specie...|$|E

50|$|From {{the village}} of Kloster over the Hucke to the tourist cafe of Zum Klausner in the Tannengrund valley is a mixed wood of Scots pine, beech, English oak, hornbeam, wild cherry, Swedish whitebeam, {{sycamore}} maple and Norway maple. In the west - on the former clifftop dunes - field maple, hawthorn, silver birch, hazel, willows, roses, fly honeysuckle, buckthorn, blackthorn (sloe), spindle and alpine currant are mainly found. North of Kloster, {{in the area of}} the old bird ornithological station, there are a few large- and small-leaved limes as well as hybrids of both species. Old man's beard, common hop, <b>common</b> polypody, false <b>brome,</b> <b>common</b> twayblade, which has become extremely rare on Hiddensee, and common moonwort, as well as the still common broad-leaved helleborine form an undergrowth. Early bloomers are e. g. wood violet, lesser celandine und ivy-leaved speedwell. The rich orchid communities, for which Hiddensee was formerly well-known have, however, disappeared.|$|R
40|$|These studies {{indicate}} that smooth bromegrass, Bromus inermis Leyss, is the only host of the bromegrass seed midge, Stenodiplosis bromicola Marikovskiy and Agafonova, in Nebraska. The midge did not infest two <b>common</b> annual <b>brome</b> species under field conditions. The midge has been collected from all counties surveyed in Nebraska {{and seems to be}} widely distributed throughout the midwestern states. An apparently undescribed species of Tetrastichus (Hymenoptera: Eulophiclae) was observed to parasitize all stages of the bromegrass seed midge. Parasitism rates greater than 90 % were observed. The parasite larvae do not kill the midge until damage to the bromegrass floret has occurred. However, a high parasite population may help to reduce the population of the bromegrass seed midge in succeeding generations...|$|R
5000|$|Leaving Ireland for Canada {{along with}} his father in 1844, the latter having {{suffered}} financial misfortunes, Devlin settled initially at Quebec City. Devlin's brother Charles, the future pioneer Mayor of Aylmer, Quebec, had arrived two years earlier, {{and his younger brother}} by 12 years, Owen Joseph Devlin, a notary, arrived some years afterwards. [...] At Quebec, unable to practice medicine because he was less than 21 years of age, Devlin established a weekly newspaper with a liberal bias called the Freeman's Journal and Commercial Advertiser. He directed this newspaper from 1844 to 1847, after which he left for Montreal, where he continued his activity as a journalist and began the study of law under Edward Carter, QC, Member of Parliament in the House of <b>Commons</b> for <b>Brome,</b> Quebec.|$|R
5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, <b>common</b> bent, drooping <b>brome,</b> and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris.

40|$|The Early Iron Age granaries of Tell Gradina upon Bosut {{exploded}} {{in a fire}} inferno in the 8 th century B. C. The result of this catastrophe is 2 - 5 cm thick layer with mixed carbonized seeds and fruits. Recently, eight samples were taken from Gradina's profile for archaeobotanical analysis. The goal was to obtain basic information on land use and on major crops and weeds of that period. The most abundant were cereals, followed by millets, pulses and oil/fibre plants. The dominant cereals were einkorn (Triticum monococcum) and hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare vulgare). Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) was also very important. Pulses were represented with six and oil/fibre plants with three species. Among weeds and ruderals, most <b>common</b> are rye <b>brome</b> (Bromus secalinus), fat hen (Chenopodium album), darnel ryegrass (Lolium temulentum), hairy crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis) and corncockle (Agrostemma githago) ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the diets of cattle at risk to DABPE on stress and inciting pastures and to determine if segregated feeding groups of cattle displayed differential susceptibility to DABPE. Stress pastures were classified and mapped by plant communities and segregated feeding group areas. Cattle diets were determined for each segregated feeding group area. Cattle were marked to identify each individual {{as a member of a}} particular group. Major dietary species on the stress pastures were Kentucky bluegrass, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, elk sedge, yellow sweetclover, and American vetch. Major dietary species on the inciting pastures were alfalfa, <b>common</b> timothy, smooth <b>brome,</b> Kentucky bluegrass, and reed canarygrass. Twenty cows whose activities could be traced back to a specific area on the stress pasture contracted DABPE during the study. Two similarities were common to 19 of the 20 cows stricken with the disease. Nineteen of these cows had grazed on areas of the stress pasture where the diet was lower in percent dry matter than the diets on the driest areas of the same stress pasture. The same cows all had grazed areas on the stress pasture where Kentucky bluegrass was the dominant dietary species. However, there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that Kentucky bluegrass was a causative agent of DABPE. Forty-three cows between the age of five and twelve years showed signs of DABPE during the two year study. Thirty-two cows were stricken on the Izee inciting pasture in 1974 (20 percent overall morbidity) and seven died (22 percent mortality of those animals stricken). Only nine of the 32 stricken cows could be traced back to specific areas on the stress pasture. Thirty-three cows had grazed on the two stress pasture areas that appeared to be associated with DABPE. The nine stricken cows accounted for a morbidity of 27 percent and a mortality of 33 percent. Nine cows showed signs of DABPEon the Rockpile inciting pasture in 1974 (17 percent overall morbidity) and none died. All nine were from two specific stress pasture areas. Twenty-five cows had grazed on the two stress pasture areas that appeared to be associated with DABPE. The nine stricken cows accounted for a morbidity of 36 percent. Cattle were drylotted and introduced over a period of six days to the Izee inciting pasture in 1975. No cases of DABPE were noted. Two cows showed signs of DABPE on the Rockpile inciting pasture in 1975 (2. 8 percent overall morbidity) and one died. Both cows had grazed the same area on the stress pasture in a group of 20 cows. When cattle were drylotted for three to six days while being gradually introduced to the inciting pastures no mortality from DABPE was noted. Prior to drylotting neither ranch had experienced zero mortality from DABPE for at least ten years...|$|R
