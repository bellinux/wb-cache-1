5|$|Sellers's {{introduction}} to film work came in 1950, where he dubbed {{the voice of}} Alfonso Bedoya in The Black Rose. He continued to work with Bentine, Milligan, and Secombe. On 3 February 1951, he made a trial tape entitled The Goons, {{and sent it to}} the BBC producer Pat Dixon, who eventually accepted it. The first Goon Show was broadcast on 28 May 1951. Against their wishes, they appeared under the name <b>Crazy</b> <b>People.</b> Sellers appeared in The Goons until the last programme of the ten-series run, broadcast on 28 January 1960. Sellers played four main characters—Major Bloodnok, Hercules Grytpype-Thynne, Bluebottle and Henry Crun—and seventeen minor ones.|$|E
25|$|Milligan {{returned}} to jazz {{in the late}} 1940s and made a precarious living with the Hall trio and other musical comedy acts. He was also trying {{to break into the}} world of radio, as a performer or script writer. His first success in radio was as writer for comedian Derek Roy's show. After a delayed start, Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine joined forces in a relatively radical comedy project, The Goon Show. During its first season the BBC titled the show as <b>Crazy</b> <b>People,</b> or in full, The Junior Crazy Gang featuring those <b>Crazy</b> <b>People,</b> the Goons!, an attempt to make the programme palatable to BBC officials, by connecting it with the popular group of theatre comedians known as The Crazy Gang.|$|E
25|$|Susini, {{along with}} his nephew Miguel Mugica and his friends Cesar Guerrico and Luis Romero Carranza formed part of this {{community}} and took part in these first tentative steps. Soon they acquired the nickname Locos de la Azotea ("the <b>crazy</b> <b>people</b> from the roof"), because their hobby involved activities - sometimes bordering on the acrobatic - on top of tall buildings, where they mounted the long wire antennas required by early-type radios. During this time, the group first played with the idea to use radio {{as a means for}} cultural dissemination, a fact that Susini himself later ascribed to their shared passion for theater and music.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crazy</b> <b>Peoples</b> Right to Speak is {{the third}} album by the British new wave/pop rock band Kajagoogoo, {{released}} in 1985. For this release, the band had shortened its name to Kaja, a name the band used earlier for the U.S. release of their second album, Islands. By this time, the band was a three-piece as drummer Jez Strode had quit in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Strode {{then left}} the band and, {{in an attempt to}} gain some {{credibility}} and to lose their bubblegum image, the remaining three members relaunched as Kaja in the UK in 1985. Following the name change, the band released the single [...] "Shouldn't Do That" [...] (UK No. 63) in August 1985. The song was featured on their third album, <b>Crazy</b> <b>People's</b> Right to Speak, but this too was unsuccessful. In December 1985, the band split up.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the failure}} of the album, the band split up in late 1985. However, after the band was {{featured}} on the VH1 programme Bands Reunited in 2004, renewed interest in Kajagoogoo prompted EMI to re-issue the band's three studio albums including <b>Crazy</b> <b>Peoples</b> Right to Speak. The album was remastered and four bonus tracks were added to the original ten tracks: two remixes of [...] "Shouldn't Do That", and two tracks that were previously only available in the single's limited edition gatefold double pack release in 1985.|$|R
500|$|Drummer Tommy, who {{had also}} worked to co-produce the album, was troubled {{by the lack of}} sales and began debating on {{continuing}} with the Ramones. He also considered touring to be [...] "depressing", and that the audience at unfamiliar gigs were [...] "a bunch of very eccentric, high-strung, <b>crazy</b> <b>people,</b> from one shit-hole club to another." [...] The drummer left the band to continue on the album's writing and mixing. He said: ...|$|E
500|$|Settling in London, Geldray took up British citizenship, {{and worked}} {{on a number of}} BBC radio programmes, such as Workers' Playtime, Melody Magazine and Forces' All-Star Bill. In 1951 he {{provided}} the musical interludes for a new BBC series <b>Crazy</b> <b>People,</b> a comedy show that starred Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Michael Bentine. <b>Crazy</b> <b>People</b> changed its name for subsequent series to The Goon Show and Geldray was a regular performer in the remaining nine series. The show followed a successful format of a vague plot interspersed by two musical performances; the BBC were using the same structure for a number of radio series, including It's That Man Again (ITMA). In The Goon Show, the musical segments were taken up by Geldray and The Ray Ellington Quartet, with Geldray also playing [...] "Crazy Rhythm" [...] for the play-out music. On occasions Geldray was given lines to perform, although he felt uncomfortable doing so, and his lack of acting ability became a long-running joke within the programme. Geldray was also the butt of some of the Goons jokes and humour: he was referred to throughout the programmes as [...] "Conk", on account of his nose, and his performances were often humorously dismissed by the announcer Wallace Greenslade, with such comments as: [...] "That was Mr Max Geldray playing a harmonica. We thought you ought to know what it was, anyhow." ...|$|E
500|$|According to author Andy Gill, by {{starting}} {{his new album}} with what sounded like [...] "a demented marching-band... staffed by <b>crazy</b> <b>people</b> out of their mind on loco-weed", Dylan delivered his biggest shock yet for his former folkie fans. The elaborate puns on getting stoned combine a sense of paranoiac persecution with [...] "nudge-nudge wink-wink bohemian hedonism". Heylin {{points out that the}} Old Testament connotations of getting stoned made the Salvation Army-style musical backing seem like a good joke. The enigmatic title came about, Heylin suggests, because Dylan knew a song entitled [...] "everybody must get stoned" [...] would be kept off the airwaves. Heylin links the title to the Book of Proverbs, chapter 27, verse 15: [...] "A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike." [...] Released as a single on March 22, 1966, [...] "Rainy Day Women" [...] reached number two on the Billboard singles chart, and number seven in the UK.|$|E

5000|$|Very few {{rules were}} ever {{adopted by the}} {{community}} as Malcolm Terence notes: [...] "Anarchists are good at lots of things but making rules isn’t one of them." [...] After a hepatitis epidemic, they banned sitting on the kitchen counter, and they also banned turning the handle on the cream separator [...] "because it used to drive <b>people</b> <b>crazy</b> when <b>people</b> {{would sit in the}} kitchen and play with the handle on the cream separator".|$|R
5000|$|In {{the same}} year Stephen Prothero, author and {{chairman}} of Boston University's Department of Religion, wrote in the Harvard Divinity Bulletin: [...] "I am <b>crazy</b> for <b>people</b> who are <b>crazy</b> for God: <b>people</b> nearly as inscrutable to me as divinity, who leave wives and children to become forest-dwelling monks in Thailand, who wander naked across the belly of India in search of self-realization, who speak in tongues and take up serpents in Appalachia because the Bible says they can." ...|$|R
2500|$|After hospitalisation, Milligan drifted {{through a}} number of rear-echelon {{military}} jobs in Italy, eventually becoming a full-time entertainer. He played the guitar with a jazz and comedy group called The Bill Hall Trio, in concert parties for the troops. After being demobilised, Milligan remained in Italy playing with the trio but returned to Britain soon after. While he was with the Central Pool of Artists (a group he described as composed [...] "of bomb-happy squaddies") he began to write parodies of their mainstream plays, which displayed many of the key elements of what would later become The Goon Show (originally called <b>Crazy</b> <b>People)</b> with Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine.|$|E
2500|$|When south-central Los Angeles {{erupted in}} riots—in which 58 were killed—after the Rodney King verdict in 1992, Waters gained {{national}} attention [...] "when she helped deliver relief supplies in Watts and demanded {{the resumption of}} vital services". Waters described the riots as a rebellion, saying [...] "If you call it a riot {{it sounds like it}} was just a bunch of <b>crazy</b> <b>people</b> who went out and did bad things for no reason. I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable." [...] In her view, the violence was “a spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice.” [...] In regards to the looting of Korean-owned stores by local black residents, she said: “There were mothers who took {{this as an opportunity to}} take some milk, to take some bread, to take some shoes... They are not crooks.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its {{introduction}} in the Indiana House of Representatives, the bill's language and topic occasioned confusion among the membership; a member from Bloomington proposed {{that it be}} referred to the Finance Committee, but the Speaker accepted another member's recommendation to refer the bill to the Committee on Swamplands, where the bill could [...] "find a deserved grave". [...] It {{was transferred to the}} Committee on Education, which reported favorably; following a motion to suspend the rules, the bill passed on February 6, without a dissenting vote. [...] The news of the bill occasioned an alarmed response from Der Tägliche Telegraph, a German-language newspaper in Indianapolis, which viewed the event with significantly less favor than its English-speaking competitors. [...] As this debate concluded, Purdue University Professor C. A. Waldo arrived in Indianapolis to secure the annual appropriation for the Indiana Academy of Science. An assemblyman handed him the bill, offering to introduce him to the genius who wrote it. He declined, saying that he already met as many <b>crazy</b> <b>people</b> as he cared to.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, {{a second}} {{delegation}} departed the Red Cloud Agency, {{led by the}} noted Oglala leader Red Cloud, with nearly 70 other members of various bands.

5000|$|Continuing, he {{also stated}} this about his motives for [...] "Lifeline":"We {{know right now}} America is <b>crazy</b> times. <b>People</b> are hurting.

2500|$|With Kasdan's {{advice to}} cast good actors and write for them instead of shoehorning {{them into the}} other roles, Meriwether was {{prepared}} to deviate from her pitched characters during casting. Basing Nick Miller on a friend also surnamed Miller, she originally imagined Nick as the smartest {{one of the group}} who doesn't need to say that and thought of him as [...] "the everyman one, who's stepping away and commenting on what all the <b>crazy</b> <b>people</b> are doing around him." [...] She sent the New Girl pilot script to movie actor Jake Johnson, with whom she had enjoyed working on No Strings Attached. As he had never auditioned for a TV pilot, she guided him through the audition process. Casting was done mainly through chemistry tests, and Johnson auditioned with Max Greenfield, who impressed the producers in his first audition as Schmidt. The actors auditioning for Schmidt were more varied in appearance than those auditioning for Nick, and Johnson and Greenfield were initially worried that they looked too much alike. Johnson got the role of Nick after he agreed to lose 15 pounds at the network's request; Greenfield learned the same day that he was cast.|$|E
2500|$|Foley and McDonald {{played two}} clearly insane people (although they always {{introduced}} themselves as [...] "not two clearly insane people"), who wore large wigs and {{identified themselves as}} Jerry Sizzler and Jerry Sizzler, the Sizzler Sisters. They were usually seen doing insane things, such as posing as a capella lounge singers, robbing a bank {{in order to make}} a deposit and then forcing people to mix up their shoes. In one sketch, Foley's character (whose real name is revealed to be Lister) has become sane through medication and is happily married. McDonald's character (whose real name is revealed to be Jean-Pierre) comes to Lister's apartment and urges him into become insane again, causing him stress and then withholding his medication. McDonald mentioned in an interview that he and Foley thought up the characters while running through the Kathie and Cathy beauty pageant sketch ("T.G.I.N.P.!"). Because they were bored, they started improvising that they were <b>crazy</b> <b>people</b> who escaped from an asylum; using the wigs (that they were wearing as background pageant contestants in the sketch) as their [...] "disguises". They wrote the Sizzler & Sizzler sketch shortly thereafter.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} days of the transcontinental railroad, Cochiti artists caricatured the travelers—circus performers, salesmen, and adventurers— who {{suddenly}} appeared in their world. “The figurative style was a form of social commentary,” Ortiz said. “They captured in clay the images of all the <b>crazy,</b> nonnative <b>people</b> who were passing through the area at that time. Those crazier pieces and the tradition of pottery as social commentary really leave the board wide open for me as an artist.” Ortiz and other Cochiti potters have revived this tradition for the 21st century.|$|R

He held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a muggy atmosphere; and stuck in the branches of trees like a wool-flake.

60|$|The woods {{were pretty}} {{full of the}} kind of hickory-trees called pignuts, and the boys {{gathered}} the nuts, and even ate their small, bitter kernels; and around the Poor-House woods there were some shag-barks, but the boys did not go for them because of the bull and the <b>crazy</b> <b>people.</b> Their great and constant reliance in foraging was the abundance of black walnuts which grew everywhere, along the roads and on the river-banks, {{as well as in the}} woods and the pastures. Long before it was time to go walnutting, the boys began knocking off the nuts and trying whether they were ripe enough; and just as soon as the kernels began to fill out, the fellows began making walnut wagons. I do not know why it was thought necessary to have a wagon to gather walnuts, but I know that it was, and that a boy had to make a new wagon every year.|$|E
