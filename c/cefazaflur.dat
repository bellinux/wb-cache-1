50|$|<b>Cefazaflur</b> (INN) is a first-generation {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefazaflur</b> {{stands out}} among {{this group of}} analogues because it lacks an arylamide C-7 side chain (see cephacetrile for another example).Cefazaflur is {{synthesized}} by reaction of 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-ylthiomethylene)-7-amino-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (1) with trifluoromethylthioacetyl chloride (2).|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefazaflur</b> {{was tested}} in vitro against 262 strains of bacteria. Inhibitory and {{bactericidal}} concentrations were determined with two inoculum sizes of bacterial cells in Mueller-Hinton broth and nutrient broth. Agar dilution studies also were performed. When tested in agar, 5. 0 μg {{or less of}} <b>cefazaflur</b> per ml inhibited almost all strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis. The drug was less active against Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, and 7. 5 μg of antibiotic per ml inhibited approximately two-thirds to one-fourth of the strains. A concentration of 50 μg of <b>cefazaflur</b> per ml was required for inhibition of the enterococci. There was negligible activity against Pseudomonas. The drug demonstrated less activity in broth than in agar, and a major inoculum effect was seen with some strains. For example, with a lower inoculum, 2. 5 μg of <b>cefazaflur</b> per ml killed all strains of E. coli, whereas with the higher inoculum, 7. 5 μg of <b>cefazaflur</b> per ml, inhibited 64 % and killed only 8 % of strains. The activity of the drug for some strains was greater in Mueller-Hinton broth; for others, it was greater in nutrient broth. There were considerable differences in {{the results of the}} broth and agar studies for some species when the same medium was employed. Because of differences in activity found with different media, inocula, and method of testing, an evaluation of the eventual usefulness of <b>cefazaflur</b> must await the results of in vivo studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>cefazaflur,</b> a parenteral cephalosporin, was determined against 590 clinical isolates. <b>Cefazaflur</b> inhibited {{the majority of}} gram-positive cocci at concentrations below 1 μg/ml except for enterococci. The agent was as active as cefamandole or cefoxitin against most Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Although it inhibited a number of strains of Enterobacter, indole-positive Proteus, and Serratia resistant to cephalothin, it was much less active against these organisms than were cefamandole or cefoxitin...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activity of nine cephalosporins (cephalothin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefatrizine, cefoxitin, and <b>cefazaflur)</b> was determined against 344 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 99 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. Cefamandole, <b>cefazaflur,</b> and cefuroxime {{were the most}} active cephalosporins against the Enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of Serratia marcescens). However, cefoxitin was the only cephalosporin that inhibited all 30 S. marcescens strains in a concentration of 16 μg/ml and {{was by far the}} most active compound against selected cephalothin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis. Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited best by cefuroxime, but none of the cephalosporins had appreciable activity against the Pseudomonas spp...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of 19 cephalosporins against 105 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis {{was determined by}} using a heavy inoculum, i. e., 108 to 109 organisms per ml, to maximally challenge the antibiotics. The anti-staphylococcal activities of cephaloridine and 87 / 312 were consistently decreased {{by the use of}} a heavy inoculum when compared with the activity obtained with two less-concentrated inocula. The activity of most of the other compounds was also decreased {{with the use of a}} heavy inoculum, but this was observed only with selected isolates. Cephapirin, cephalothin, and <b>cefazaflur</b> were the most active drugs against the methicillin-susceptible isolates. Cephaloridine, cefamandole, <b>cefazaflur,</b> and 87 / 312 had substantial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci even with heavy inocula. With the exception of cefaclor against S. aureus, the orally absorbed cephalosporins were generally one-half to one-sixteenth as active as the parenterally administered cephalosporins. The median minimal inhibitory concentrations of five of the 12 parenteral cephalosporins were lower with the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus than with the methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} susceptibility of 492 anaerobic bacteria, {{the majority}} of which were recent clinical isolates, {{was determined by the}} agar dilution technique. Penicillin G was active against most of the strains tested at 32 U or less/ml, but only 72 % of Bacteroides fragilis strains were susceptible at this level and 9 % required 256 U or more/ml. Ampicillin was effective against most of the strains except B. fragilis at 16 μg or less/ml. Amoxicillin was active against only 31 % of B. fragilis, 76 % of other Bacteroides species, and 67 % of Fusobacterium species at 8 μg/ml. Two new penicillins, mezlocillin and azlocillin, were similar to ampicillin in their activity. Carbenicillin and ticarcillin inhibited all but a few strains at 128 μg or less/ml. BLP 1654 was somewhat more active than penicillin G against B. fragilis but had similar activity against other anaerobes. Cephalothin was inactive against B. fragilis, and only 65 % of other Bacteroides species were inhibited by 32 μg or less/ml. It was effective against all other anaerobes at that level. Cefamandole showed somewhat greater activity than cephalothin against B. fragilis but generally less activity against gram-positive organisms. <b>Cefazaflur</b> (SKF 59962) was comparable to cephalothin against B. fragilis. Cefoxitin was distinctly more active than cephalothin against B. fragilis. These latter two agents were less active than cephalothin against the gram-positive anaerobes. Chloramphenicol remains active against anaerobic bacteria at 16 μg or less/ml, with rare exceptions. Thiamphenicol was similar to chloramphenicol in its activity. Clindamycin was very active against most of the anaerobes at 8 μg or less/ml. Erythromycin and josamycin were also tested, with josamycin showing greater activity against B. fragilis than either erythromycin or clindamycin. A new oligosaccharide, everninomicin B, was less active than clindamycin against B. fragilis but more active against clostridia {{and some of the other}} strains tested. Most of the groups of bacteria tested demonstrated a trend toward resistance to tetracycline. Doxycycline and minocycline were somewhat more active than was tetracycline. Metronidazole was active against {{the majority of}} the anaerobes tested; resistance ws demonstrated by some of the gram-positive cocci and gram-positive, non-sporeforming bacilli...|$|E
