40|$|International audienceThe {{simulation}} of cardiac blood flow using patient-specific geometries can {{help for the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} cardiac diseases. Current patient-specific cardiac flow simulations requires a significant amount of human expertise and time to pre-process image data and obtain a <b>case</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> simulations. A new procedure is proposed to alleviate this pre-processing by registering a unique generic mesh on patient-specific cardiac segmentations and transferring appropriately the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ventricle. The method is applied on real patient data acquired from 3 D ultrasound imaging. Both a healthy and a pathological conditions are simulated. The resulting simulations exhibited physiological flow behavior in cardiac cavities. The experiments confirm a significant reduction in pre-processing work...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The {{key to the}} {{contemporary}} revival of the American labor movement is precisely a renewed mobilization of the rank and file. Based on our combined research and work in labor education and representation, we believe {{that large numbers of}} American workers, blue and white-collar, skilled and unskilled, professional, service and manufacturing, union members and non-members, are open and in many <b>cases</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> expanded workplace and union participation. To be sure, mobilization by itself is not enough: also necessary are national union support, innovative and flexible strategies, and coalition building, and we highlight these as well. But expanded rank-and-file participation draws on the central union comparative asset - the membership - and is essential to the success of most other strategies as well. In this article, we present an overview of union revitalization strategies and three case studies of successful rank-and-file mobilization. Although not typical, these cases illustrate a variety of advanced union strategies in today 2 ̆ 7 s context, along with some of the barriers and resistance to be overcome...|$|R
50|$|In 1847, Dred Scott {{made his}} first legal contest for freedom in St. Louis, Missouri. Judge Alexander Hamilton presided over the case and Samuel M. Bay acted as Scott's attorney. Francis B.

The Russians in this area were well aware of German intentions due to von François's attack, and had spent the time preparing for the assault by moving up their heavy artillery. At first the German advance went well, but faltered once they came under Russian artillery fire, and the Russians were able to turn their flanks and force them to retreat in disorder to the Insterburg-Angerburg lines, leaving 6,000 prisoners in Russian hands.|$|R

50|$|Like {{nearly all}} French courts, the Council's court system is inquisitorial, and {{proceedings}} are initiated by {{a statement of}} claim detailing the factual background {{of the case and}} why the appellent should be granted relief. The Council then begins a formal investigation, asking the appellee, i.e., the government or a government agency or office, to satisfy the Council with a detailed statement of defense. Burden of proof does not lie with the plaintiff; instead, the Council decides whether or not the appellent has cause to bring suit and whether the government was in error if information provided by the appellent is sufficient to locate previously undisclosed evidence. Of course, both parties may submit additional pleadings and information until the <b>case</b> is <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> final judgment.|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} is inquisitorial: the litigant writes {{a letter to}} the Council, stating precisely what happened and why he feels that the defendant acted illegally; the Council then starts an inquiry, asking the other party (generally, a government or government agency) for precisions, and so on until the Council has a clear picture of the case. The litigant does not have the burden of proof: the Council may well decide that the litigant was right and the government was wrong if the information supplied by the litigant was sufficient to enable it to find the missing proofs. Of course, both parties may supply supplemental information until the <b>case</b> is <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> final judgment. A litigant has to make his claim within 60 days after the publication of the regulation in the Belgisch Staatsblad/Moniteur Belge, or if it is a decision which affects {{only a limited number of}} people, within 60 days after he gets notified of it.|$|R

Trial Parts also conduct pre-trial motion hearings, including Sandoval (witness impeachment) and Molineux (admissibility of prior uncharged crimes) hearings.

40|$|ACUTE limb {{ischemia}} is any sudden decrease or worsening in limb perfu-sion {{that causes}} {{a potential threat}} to limb viability (1). Acute peripheral ar-terial occlusion {{may be caused by}} in situ thrombosis or embolus. In this ar-ticle, the term “thrombus ” will be used to describe arterial occlusion caused by in situ thrombosis or embolus. Per-cutaneous or “open ” surgical tech-niques can be used to remove the thrombus. Current percutaneous methods for transluminal removal of thrombus (TRT) include thrombolytic therapy (ie, catheter-directed, pharma-comechanic), percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy (PAT), and percutane-ous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT). These methods may be used in combi-nation. Surgical techniques entail an “open ” procedure that necessitates an arteriotomy for the removal of throm-bus. Of the various TRT methods used to treat acute limb ischemia, catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy with urokinase has been the most widely studied. Catheter-directed thrombo-lytic therapy has at least three theoret-ical and practical advantages over sur-gical thromboembolectomy: less endothelial trauma, angiographic vi-sualization of the underlying lesion(s) and runoff vessels, and, in many <b>cases,</b> <b>ready</b> access <b>for</b> definitive translumi-nal therapies that address the under-lying lesion (1, 2).

25|$|An {{emphasis}} on oral transmission {{as more important}} than the printed word derives from the earliest period of Indian Buddhism, when it allowed teachings to be kept from those who should not hear them. Hearing a teaching (transmission) <b>readies</b> the <b>hearer</b> <b>for</b> realization based on it. The person from whom one hears the teaching should have heard it as one link in a succession of listeners going back to the original speaker: the Buddha {{in the case of a}} sutra or the author in the case of a book. Then the hearing constitutes an authentic lineage of transmission. Authenticity of the oral lineage is a prerequisite for realization, hence the importance of lineages.|$|R
