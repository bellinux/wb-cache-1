In this connection, I request that the name 'Russian Federation' should be used in the United Nations in place of the name 'the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'. The Russian Federation maintains full responsibility for all the rights and obligations of the USSR under the Charter of the United Nations, including the financial obligations. I request that you consider this letter as confirmation of the credentials to represent the Russian Federation in United Nations organs for all the persons currently holding the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> <b>representatives</b> of the USSR to the United Nations.|$|E

5000|$|The UN {{expelled}} from the conference three activist groups for [...] "unacceptable disruptive behavior." [...] The Iranian Neda Institute for Political and Scientific Research was kicked out for distributing inflammatory material to meeting participants, while the Union of Jewish Students of France and the London-based group The Coexist Foundation were removed for disrupting Ahmadinejad's speech. In all, the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> 64 <b>representatives</b> from the three groups were revoked. Two journalists representing the conservative magazine and website Townhall were also expelled for disrupting the proceedings after one tried {{to take over the}} podium while the other filmed the scene.|$|R
50|$|On 24 December 1991, the Soviet Permanent Representative to the UN Yuli Vorontsov {{delivered}} to the Secretary-General of the UN {{a letter from the}} Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The letter stated that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist, and that Russia would continue the Soviet Union's membership in the UN and maintain the full responsibility for all the rights and obligations of the Soviet Union under the UN Charter. The letter was circulated among the UN membership without any objection, and Russia formally took over the Soviet Union's seat in the UN General Assembly, in the Security Council and in other organs of the United Nations. The letter also confirmed the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> Soviet <b>representatives</b> to represent Russia, and Soviet representatives to the various UN agencies continued serving as Russian representatives without presenting new credentials. Ambassador Vorontsov continued serving as the first Permanent <b>Representative</b> <b>of</b> the Russian Federation to the UN.|$|R

5000|$|The Summit of Alma-Ata also {{issued a}} {{statement}} on December 21, 1991 supporting Russia's claim {{to be recognized as}} the successor state of the Soviet Union for the purposes of membership of the United Nations. On December 25, 1991, Russian President Yeltsin informed UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar that the Soviet Union had been dissolved and that Russia would, as its successor state, continue the Soviet Union's membership in the United Nations. The document confirmed the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> the <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet Union as <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> Russia, and requested that the name [...] "Soviet Union" [...] be changed to [...] "Russian Federation" [...] in all records and entries. This was a move designed to allow Russia to retain the Soviet Union's permanent Security Council seat, which wouldn't have been possible if the former republics were all reckoned as equal successors of the Soviet Union, or if the Soviet Union was regarded as having no successor state for the purpose of continuing the same UN membership. (see Russia and the United Nations). The Secretary General circulated the request, and there being no objection from any Member State, the Russian Federation took the Soviet Union's UN seat. On January 31, 1992, Russian Federation President Yeltsin personally took part in a Security Council meeting as <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> Russia, the first Security Council meeting in which Russia occupied the permanent Security Council seat originally granted to the Soviet Union by the UN Charter.|$|R
50|$|Frankfurt {{regularly}} {{served as}} the site of the election from the fifteenth century on, but elections were also held at Cologne (1531), Regensburg (1575 and 1636), and Augsburg (1653 and 1690). An elector could appear in person or could appoint another elector as his proxy. More often, an electoral suite or embassy was sent to cast the vote; the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> such <b>representatives</b> were verified by the Archbishop of Mainz, who presided over the ceremony. The deliberations were held at the city hall, but voting occurred in the cathedral. In Frankfurt, a special electoral chapel, or Wahlkapelle, was used for elections. Under the Golden Bull, a majority of electors sufficed to elect a king, and each elector could cast only one vote. Electors were free to vote for whomsoever they pleased (including themselves), but dynastic considerations played a great part in the choice. Electors drafted a Wahlkapitulation, or electoral capitulation, which was presented to the king-elect. The capitulation may be described as a contract between the princes and the king, the latter conceding rights and powers to the electors and other princes. Once an individual swore to abide by the electoral capitulation, he assumed the office of King of the Romans.|$|R
40|$|Canada's post-Confederation {{economy was}} marked by a search for capital {{that was used to}} {{complete}} large infrastructure projects such as the Canadian Pacific Railway. Since Canada's small tax base could not pay for the transcontinental railway, financiers in the City of London were the first choice as a source for this capital by the Canadian government. As P. J. Cain and A. G. Hopkins explained in British Imperialism: Innovation and Expansion, however, the ability to tap this resource was dependent on the gentlemanly <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> the government's <b>representative</b> because the City's social culture was dominated by ideals of "propertied wealth", family connections and social activity. Sir John A. Macdonald's Conservatives, therefore, installed a representative in London that possessed these gentlemanly qualities in the hopes of securing capital for the completion of the CPR and promoting Canada's interests in the London business community. Three men between 1869 and 1885 served as Canada's High Commissioner. Sir John Rose, Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt and Sir Charles Tupper were all chosen for their apparent gentlemanly qualities. The men used these qualities with varying success to promote and eventually secure the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway...|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of this Congressional {{schedule}} Bradley and Robinson had not been seated when the Vermont House <b>of</b> <b>Representatives</b> convened in early October, 1791. At this legislative session, some members suggested that the January election of Bradley and Robinson had been premature, since Vermont had not yet been admitted to the union. Bradley and Robinson volunteered to resign the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> their January elections; on October 17, the Governor and Council voted again, and selected Bradley and Robinson. The House <b>of</b> <b>Representatives</b> then voted a second time, and also selected Bradley and Robinson. No vote totals were recorded.|$|R

50|$|In October 2007, Bruce {{announced}} {{his plans to}} seek {{a seat in the}} Colorado House <b>of</b> <b>Representatives.</b> After Rep. Bill Cadman was appointed to fill a Senate seat vacated by Ron May, Bruce sought to be appointed to Cadman's seat representing House District 15. Bruce faced two other Republican challengers for the appointment during a short but contentious battle for the vacancy committee nomination, during which he questioned the professional <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> one of his opponents, and opponents charged that he was too divisive a figure to successfully represent the district. Ultimately, Bruce received two-thirds of the votes from the 66 members of the vacancy committee, beating out former school board candidate and engineer Reginald Perry and businessman Steve Hasbrouck.|$|R

5000|$|By the 1970s, a shift had {{occurred}} in international diplomatic circles and the PRC had gained {{the upper hand in}} international diplomatic relations and recognition count. On 25 October 1971, the 21st time the United Nations General Assembly debated on the PRC's admission into the UN, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 was adopted, by which it recognized that [...] "the <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> China to the United Nations and that the People's Republic of China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council," [...] and decided [...] "to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> its Government as the only legitimate <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it." [...] This effectively transferred the seat of China in the UN, including its permanent seat on the Security Council, from the ROC to the PRC, and expelled the ROC from the UN. From the United Nations' perspective the [...] "Republic of China" [...] is not a former member. No UN member was expelled in 1971. Rather, the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> one Chinese delegation (from Taipei) were rejected and the <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> another Chinese delegation (from Beijing) were accepted.|$|R
