40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the effect of using <b>co-axial</b> <b>cables</b> in ultra-wideband off-body radio channel characterisation and performance evaluation for wearable antennas. Experiments were carefully designed to faithfully compare the use of a <b>co-axial</b> feed <b>cable</b> for a wearable antenna versus an optic fibre feed, and thus report on any errors introduced into the measurements due to the use of such reflective cabling. Detailed results are presented for a range of body-centric antenna positions for stationary measurements and general observations for mobile tests are also introduced and discussed. Presented results show that the use of <b>co-axial</b> <b>cables</b> has a marked effect on the radio channel characterisation, affecting received power, mean delay and delay spread results, seen to greater extent in low reflection environments and for non line of sight and highly shadowed configurations. Co-axial cable-fed antenna tests yielded greater received power than with an optic-fibre feed for a user-stationary scenario in low reflection environments. As either the line of sight component or the measurement environment's reflectivity was increased, {{the difference between the two}} systems diminished. It was also found that the use of a <b>co-axial</b> <b>cable</b> altered the statistical fading channel model for mobile tests...|$|R
25|$|On 7 July 1965 Kennedy {{appeared}} on a then-innovative live split-screen link with Don Lane, the host of Sydney Tonight, via the recently completed <b>co-axial</b> <b>cable</b> linking Melbourne and Sydney. Starting late September 1966, IMT itself would be transmitted in Sydney via the <b>co-axial</b> <b>cable.</b> This coincided with a cameo in the film They're a Weird Mob in which Kennedy plays himself. Like the film's protagonist, Kennedy in the film finds Sydney to be a city somewhat unwelcoming towards migrants from anywhere. By early December 1966 ratings for Kennedy's show were strong in Sydney. There was an increase from one IMT episode a week in Sydney, to two, with a Monday night broadcast added that month.|$|R
50|$|Another {{explanation}} for the Eastern European adoption of SECAM, led by the Soviet Union, is that the Russians had extremely long distribution lines between broadcasting stations and transmitters. Long <b>co-axial</b> <b>cables</b> or microwave links can cause amplitude and phase variations, which do not affect SECAM signals.|$|R

40|$|The most {{frequent}} use of <b>co-axial</b> <b>cable</b> is to prevent electrical noise entering signals being passed between equipment. Ground voltage di#erences are common and add in series with the signal voltage. The screen of <b>co-axial</b> <b>cable</b> grounded at both ends induces avoltage in the inner conductor which cancels higher frequency ground voltage di#erences, starting from a break pointoftypically 2 kHz. The signal current also produces a #ux external to the screen, which induces a loop current through the screen and earth path which opposes the earth current. Signal currents above 2 kHz thus increasingly return through the screen, in spite of alower impedance ground path. An equivalent circuit explains the phenomena and the extreme sensitivityof co-ax and oscilloscope probes to short pigtail leads. Experiments are described and data presented which justify the theory. Remarks are made on end connections, cable trays, and feeding power lines via co-ax...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} address the {{detection}} and localization of partial discharge (PD) in cross-bonded (CB) high voltage (HV) cables, this paper investigates the characteristics of PD propagation in CB HV cables. On-line PD detection and location in power cables has been a research topic for many years. The issue has not been solved due to surrounding interference and complicated propagation modes in cable joints. It becomes even more complex with CB cables. The main challenge to PD monitoring of CB cables is {{as a result of}} the interconnectedness of the sheaths of the three single phase cables. The cross-bonding of the sheaths makes it difficult to localize which of the three phases a PD signal has emanated from. <b>Co-axial</b> <b>cables</b> are used to connect cable sheaths to cable link boxes, for ease of installation and protection against moisture. A second challenge is, therefore, the coupling characteristic when a PD pulse propagates in HV cable joints and the <b>co-axial</b> <b>cables,</b> making PD detection and localization more complex. The paper presents experimental investigations into PD pulse coupling characteristic between the cable center conductor and the sheath and the behavior of PD pulse propagation in CB HV cables, which can be used for PD localization in CB HV cable system...|$|R

A great deal {{has been published}} in recent years on PD based cable insulation condition monitoring, diagnostics and localization in medium voltage (MV) and high voltage (HV) cables. The topic of pulse propagation and PD source localization in CB HV cable systems {{has yet to be}} significantly investigated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} both stationary {{and mobile}} signal strength measurements for a wearable UWB radio channel {{in a hospital}} environment. The measurements were made using RF-over-fibre technology to eliminate unwanted electromagnetic effects {{associated with the use}} of <b>co-axial</b> <b>cables.</b> The results show that received signal strength values depended on whether transmit and receive antennas are in relative line of sight or non line of sight conditions. For mobile tests, both line of sight and non line of sight conditions tended to have lognormally distributed fading with the latter having significantly lower mean signal strength. For stationary conditions, signal strength was also dependant on user mode, with the difference between standing and sitting in the same location being up to 5. 3 dB. ...|$|R

50|$|Based on the {{operation}} of Panorama, Siemens & Halske improved this system, and renamed it Jagdschloss (hunting lodge). They added a second switchable operation to 150 kW at 1.2 m (250 MHz), increasing the range to near 200 km. The information from the receivers was sent via <b>co-axial</b> <b>cable</b> or a 50-cm link from the tower to a central command center, where {{it was used to}} direct fighter aircraft. Hollmann's polar-coordinate (PPI) CRT was used in the display, the first German system with this device; it was also added to the Panorama. The Jagdschloss entered service in late 1943, and about 80 systems were eventually built. The Jagdwagen (hunting car) was a mobile, single-frequency version; operating at 54 cm (560 MHz), it had a correspondingly smaller antenna system.|$|R

In particular we present the first application of a transfer matrix based calculation to this challenging problem by using an adaptive co-ordinate transformation to accurately model the shape of the SNOM tip. We also investigate the possibility of increasing the transmitted light through the SNOM tip by introducing a metal wire into the centre of the tip. This converts the tip into a <b>co-axial</b> <b>cable.</b> We show that, in principle, this can dramatically improve the transmission characteristics without having a detrimental effect on the resolution.

50|$|The Sydney-Melbourne <b>co-axial</b> <b>cable</b> {{was a major}} {{telecommunications}} {{engineering and}} construction project in south-eastern Australia in the early 1960s, designed to significantly increase telecommunications transmission capacity between Sydney and Melbourne and other centres, along its route including Canberra. The cable's route was approximately 960 kilometres and roughly followed the Hume Highway as it existed at that time. Key points along the route were Sydney-Liverpool-Campbelltown-Bowral-Goulburn-Canberra-Yass-Gundagai-Wagga Wagga-Culcairn-Albury-Wangaratta-Benalla-Euroa-Seymour-Melbourne.It was {{five years in the}} making and cost £6.89 million to complete. Its prime purpose was to boost the capacity for telecommunications between the two major cities. The cable was made up of three pairs of tubes, each pair capable of carrying 1,260 simultaneous telephone connections.There was a marker stone commemorating the official opening of the cable at 532 Hume Highway, Casula but it has since been removed. There is a corresponding marker stone in Gordon Reserve near the Parliament of Victoria in Melbourne.|$|R

40|$|When glass fibres {{were first}} {{proposed}} for optical communications {{in the late}} 1960 's, one attractive selling point was their extreme insensitivity (if not complete immunity) to electromagnetic interference, which - {{in addition to a}} much larger bandwidth - gave them considerable advantages over <b>co-axial</b> <b>cable.</b> Early research concentrated on reducing the optical absorption to the lowest possible levels, eventually achieving values < 0. 1 dB/km in the main communications windows at 1. 3 and 1. 5 µm. At this point there seemed no reason to suppose that germanium doped silica glass of extremely high purity should be anything other than an almost perfect optical transmission medium. Ambitious, however, to extend the capabilities of optical fibres, researchers went on to study whether more complex functions such as amplification, modulation, wavelength conversion and lasing could be incorporated, the idea being to avoid the need for optical-electronic-optical repeaters and modulators. This effort has resulted in the successful demonstration of all-optical diode-laser-pumped in-fibre lasing and amplification by incorporation of rare-earth dopants in the core glass. These developments are already revolutionising communications system design...|$|R
