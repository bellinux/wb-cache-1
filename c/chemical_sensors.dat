50|$|A <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> is a {{self-contained}} analytical device {{that can provide}} information about the chemical composition of its environment, that is, a liquid or a gas phase. The information is provided {{in the form of}} a measurable physical signal that is correlated with the concentration of a certain chemical species (termed as analyte).
