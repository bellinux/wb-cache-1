5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, <b>carbon</b> <b>paper,</b> automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E

40|$|Water {{transport}} {{through the}} cathode and oxygen presence/absence in the anodic solution, {{are important for}} operation and performance of single chamber microbial fuel cells (SCMFCs). This study focused on water transport and biofilm formation on <b>carbon</b> <b>papers</b> with different characteristics: hydrophobicity, thickness, and presence of a micro porous layer (MPL). The results showed that higher hydrophobicity, thicker structures {{and the presence of}} the MPL decreased the water transport over time. The <b>carbon</b> <b>papers</b> with low hydrophobicity had complete penetration of biofilms and higher water transport, while those with high hydrophobicity and MPL had no biofilm penetration and lower water transport, indicating a clear correlation of biofilm penetration and water transport across <b>carbon</b> <b>papers.</b> Salt precipitation on <b>carbon</b> <b>papers</b> clogged the pores and resulted in lower water transport. Cyclic voltammograms using Au/Hg microelectrode inserted near the cathode indicated the absence of oxygen in the anodic solution due to the oxygen consumption by aerobic/anaerobic biofilms on cathodes. The results of water transport and oxygen presence illustrated that the biofilms {{can be used as a}} cost-effective membrane/separator for SCMFCs...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum-assisted resin {{transfer}} molding (VARTM) process {{was used to}} fabricate the nanocomposites through integrating <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>paper</b> into traditional glass fiber reinforced composites. The <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>paper</b> had a porous structure with highly entangled carbon nanofibers and short glass fibers. In this study, the <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>paper</b> was employed as an interlayer and surface layer of composite laminates to enhance the damping properties. Experiments conducted using the nanocomposite beam indicated up to 200 – 700 % increase of the damping ratios at higher frequencies. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization of the <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>paper</b> and the nanocomposites was also conducted to investigate the impregnation of <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>paper</b> by the resin during the VARTM process and the mechanics of damping augmentation. The study showed a complete penetration of the resin through the <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>paper.</b> The connectivities between carbon nanofibers and short glass fibers within the <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>paper</b> {{were responsible for the}} significant energy dissipation in the nanocomposites during the damping tests...|$|R

Adhesion and proliferation of L 929 mouse fibroblasts and plateletson MWCNTs and <b>carbon</b> <b>papers</b> were investigated. The influence of different bloodprotein adsorption on the human skin fibroblasts growth was also studied. The resultsshowed that mouse fibroblasts implanted on MWCNTs tended to grow more prolificallythan those on <b>carbon</b> <b>papers.</b> The cell concentration observed on MWCNTsincreased from 1. 25 &acute; 10 5 /mL (cultured for 1 d) to 4. 1 &acute; 10 5 /mL (culture for 7 d). No toxicity reaction was observed during the culturingperiod. By employing the adsorptionassay, it was found albumin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulinG adhered on materials could promotethe adhesion and growth of the human skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, plateletadhesion rate on MWCNTs is lower than that on the <b>carbon</b> <b>papers.</b> These resultsindicate that MWCNTs have better tissue compatibility and blood compatibility...|$|R

40|$|A unique {{concept of}} making nanocomposites from <b>carbon</b> {{nanofiber}} <b>paper</b> was explored in this study. The {{essential element of}} this method was to design and manufacture <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>paper</b> with well-controlled and optimized network structure of carbon nanofibers. In this study, <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>paper</b> was prepared under various processing conditions, including different types of carbon nanofibers, solvents, dispersants, and acid treatment. The morphologies of carbon nanofibers within the nanofiber paper were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the bulk densities of <b>carbon</b> nanofiber <b>papers</b> were measured.

40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} flexible <b>carbon</b> <b>papers</b> were prepared, {{based on}} hydroxyl functionalized few layer graphene (G-OH). G-OH {{was obtained from}} the reaction of KOH with nanosized graphite with a very high surface area (HSAG), greater than 300 m 2 g- 1, and with high shape anisotropy, with the help of mechanical and thermal energy. Wide angle X-ray and Raman analyses showed that the core of G-OH had the structure of infinite and ideal graphene layers and that the interlayer distance between the few stacked graphene layers was the same as in pristine HSAG. Hydroxyl groups were thus essentially located in peripheral positions. High resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of graphene aggregates made by a number of layers as low as 6. Stable water suspensions were obtained, with concentrations up to 4 mg mL- 1. Mild centrifugation of such suspensions had interesting efficiency as a method for producing few layer graphene: about 35 % by mass of pristine HSAG was isolated as few layer graphene from supernatant suspensions. Flexible and electrically conductive <b>carbon</b> <b>papers</b> were prepared by coating a paper support with a G-OH water suspension. This work demonstrates that <b>carbon</b> <b>papers</b> can be prepared without adopting the traditional oxidation-reduction procedure, avoiding harsh reaction conditions, dangerous and toxic reagents, solvents and catalysts...|$|R

25|$|Instead, Cherryh wrote {{novels in}} her spare {{time away from}} {{teaching}} and submitted these manuscripts directly for publication. Initially, she met with little success. In fact, {{she was forced to}} re-write some of her early works when various publishers lost the manuscripts she submitted. Retyping from carbon copies of her manuscripts was cheaper than paying for photocopying, and, in effect, forced her to rewrite those lost manuscripts (using <b>carbon</b> <b>paper</b> to make at least one copy of a manuscript was standard practice until the advent of the personal computer).|$|E
25|$|Catalyst: A {{chemical}} substance {{that increases the}} rate of a reaction without being consumed; after the reaction, it can potentially be recovered from the reaction mixture and is chemically unchanged. The catalyst lowers the activation energy required, allowing the reaction to proceed more quickly or at a lower temperature. In a fuel cell, the catalyst facilitates the reaction of oxygen and hydrogen. It is usually made of platinum powder very thinly coated onto <b>carbon</b> <b>paper</b> or cloth. The catalyst is rough and porous so the maximum surface area of the platinum can {{be exposed to the}} hydrogen or oxygen. The platinum-coated side of the catalyst faces the membrane in the fuel cell.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} ways of achieving the nanoscale Pt on carbon powder, {{which is currently}} the best option, are through vacuum deposition, sputtering, and electrodeposition. The platinum particles are deposited onto <b>carbon</b> <b>paper</b> that is permeated with PTFE. However, there is an optimal thinness to this catalyst layer, which limits the lower cost limit. Below 4nm, Pt will form islands on the paper, limiting its activity. Above this thickness, the Pt will coat the carbon and be an effective catalyst. To further complicate things, Nafion cannot be infiltrated beyond 10um, so using more Pt than this is an unnecessary expense. Thus the amount {{and shape of the}} catalyst is limited by the constraints of other materials.|$|E

The bipolar plates may be made of different types of materials, such as, metal, coated metal, graphite, flexible graphite, C–C composite, carbon–polymer composites etc. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is referred as the heart of the PEMFC and is usually made of a proton exchange membrane sandwiched between two catalyst-coated <b>carbon</b> <b>papers.</b> Platinum and/or similar type of noble metals are usually used as the catalyst for PEMFC. The electrolyte could be a polymer membrane.|$|R

25|$|Further {{efficiencies}} can {{be realized}} using an Ultrasonic nozzle to apply the platinum catalyst to the electrolyte layer or to <b>carbon</b> <b>paper</b> under atmospheric conditions resulting in high efficiency spray. Studies have shown that due to the uniform size of the droplets created by this type of spray, due to the high transfer efficiency of the technology, due to the non-clogging nature of the nozzle and finally {{due to the fact}} that the ultrasonic energy de-agglomerates the suspension just before atomization, fuel cells MEA's manufactured this way have a greater homogeneity in the final MEA, and the gas flow through the cell is more uniform, maximizing the efficiency of the platinum in the MEA.|$|E
25|$|Samizdat {{copies of}} texts, such as Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita or Václav Havel's essay The Power of the Powerless were passed around among trusted friends. The {{techniques}} used to reproduce these forbidden texts varied. Several copies {{might be made}} using <b>carbon</b> <b>paper,</b> either by hand or on a typewriter; {{at the other end}} of the scale mainframe printers were used during night shifts to make multiple copies, and books were at times printed on semiprofessional printing presses in much larger quantities. Before glasnost, the practice was dangerous, because copy machines, printing presses, and even typewriters in offices were under control of the organisation's First Department, i.e. the KGB: reference printouts for all of these machines were stored for subsequent identification purposes, if samizdat output was found.|$|E
500|$|The {{general design}} of Oliver {{typewriters}} remained mostly unchanged throughout the company's history. The Olivers are [...] "down strike" [...] typewriters, meaning the typebars strike the platen (also {{known as the}} roller) from above, rather than from below ("up strike") or from the front ("front strike"). Unlike the [...] "up strike" [...] method, which prints text out of sight {{on the underside of}} the platen, the [...] "down strike" [...] is a [...] "visible print" [...] design, meaning the full page is visible to the typist as the text is being entered. The relatively greater striking power of the [...] "down strike" [...] design led Olivers to be preferred for specialty uses such as stencil cutting or [...] "manifolding" [...] (copying using <b>carbon</b> <b>paper).</b> The [...] "front strike" [...] method, a competing [...] "visible print" [...] design, was patented around the same time (1889–91), but an effective machine that did not interfere with the typist’s line of sight was not available until 1897 when, roughly three years after the introduction of the Oliver No. 1, the Underwood No. 1 appeared on the market.|$|E

This arrangement was introduced to protect thin <b>carbon</b> copy <b>paper</b> from direct hit by nail.Also internal electronics was simple. Printer head was single nail with electromagnet driven by software on home computer. One direction motor for paper movement and two directions motor to move printer head were also controlled directly from computer. To give necessary feedback, motor axes were connected to plastic disc with cutouts on perimeter. LED and photoresistor were placed against disc cutouts and as the disc rotated light beam would reach photoresitor only when facing a cutout. This way distance travelled by motors could be measured, again directly from software.With provided drivers the printer would print 480 points across A4 (58 DPI) with 560 lines on page (48 DPI). That is 70 lines with 60 to 80 characters on line. Printer could print one A4 page in 10 minutes in low quality. Higher quality was available at cost of doubling the time.
