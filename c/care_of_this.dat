5|$|Diệm's trip {{came after}} two years of American {{attempts}} to schedule a state visit. In 1955, Washington made two attempts to organise a trip while Diệm was still prime minister, but he was too busy quelling opposition groups and his grip on power was tenuous. Diệm took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> by crushing the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate in the Battle for Saigon in May 1955, and then deposed Bảo Đại and proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam after his brother Ngô Đình Nhu rigged a referendum that made him head of state. Diệm was credited with 98.2% of the votes and 133% in the capital Saigon. The South Vietnamese leader's visit was organized after he indicated interest in February 1957 to US Ambassador to South Vietnam Frederick Reinhardt.|$|E

Michael suggests that she donate the money to an organization that combats adult illiteracy, preferably a Jewish one. She wants him to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> instead. Ilana keeps the tea tin since it is similar to one stolen from her in Auschwitz.|$|E

Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) is a mandatory Medicaid program for children {{that aims to}} focus on prevention, early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} medical conditions. Oral screenings are not required for EPSDT recipients, and they do not suffice as a direct dental referral. If a condition requiring treatment is discovered during an oral screening, the state is responsible for taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> service, {{regardless of whether or not}} it is covered on that particular Medicaid plan.|$|E
25|$|While repressive {{measures}} were relaxed {{starting in the}} mid-1970s, gaining new converts proved difficult. One method involved members traveling in pairs by train, starting a conversation on religious topics and beginning to proselytize after gaining the interest of others in their compartment. Another strategy was to start religious discussions in cemeteries or in crowded areas like rail and bus stations. The Watchtower was sent into Romania in English, translated by Witnesses into Romanian, the manuscript sent into Austria and copies then brought back into Romania, distributed to members and used in conversion efforts. According to British political scientist Tom Gallagher, by the 1980s, one source of converts to the Witnesses, {{as well as to}} Protestant denominations, was the new working class housed in urban high-rise settlements, as the Orthodox hierarchy was reluctant to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group's religious needs. In an interview with the World Council of Churches' official magazine, Metropolitan Antonie Plămădeală of the dominant Romanian Orthodox Church said that gaining official recognition would have been very difficult for Jehovah's Witnesses in Romania because of their attitude toward the Communist state and to military service, but {{it would not have been}} impossible if the state had better understood their views and been less paranoid. He claimed that if they kept a low profile and were not active against the state, the authorities would be unconcerned about them.|$|E

She moved in with her father in Oklahoma City, where he was living with his second wife and her child. Manning got a job as a developer with a software company, Zoto, and was apparently happy for a time, but was let go after four months. Her boss told The Washington Post that on a few occasions Manning had [...] "just locked up" [...] and would simply sit and stare, and in the end communication became too difficult. The boss told the newspaper that [...] "nobody's been taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kid for a really long time." ...|$|E

500|$|Some bowlers had {{experimented with}} Bodyline in the season, and the West Indian team, 1–0 {{down in the}} series and {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} pace in the pitches, decided to experiment with the tactic. Facing a good West Indies total, England suffered a batting collapse, at one point falling to 134 for four. With Les Ames in difficulty against the short-pitched bowling, Jardine said, [...] "You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bloody nonsense." [...] He went right back to the bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and stopped them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. Wisden described how he never flinched despite facing the greatest amount of Bodyline. It also believed that he played it [...] "probably better than any other man in the world was capable of doing." [...] He batted for nearly five hours, scoring 127, his only Test century. England then retaliated by bowling Bodyline in the West Indies' second innings, but the slow pitch meant that the match was drawn. However, this performance played a large part in turning English opinion against Bodyline. The Times used the word [...] "Bodyline", without using inverted commas or using the qualification [...] "so-called", for the first time. Wisden said that [...] "most of those watching {{it for the first time}} must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice." ...|$|E
500|$|Jardine {{himself had}} to face bodyline bowling in a Test match. The West Indian cricket team toured England in 1933, and, in the second Test at Old Trafford, Jackie Grant, their captain, decided to try bodyline. He {{had a couple of}} fast bowlers, Manny Martindale and Learie Constantine. Facing bodyline tactics for the first time, England first suffered, falling to 134 for 4, with Wally Hammond being hit on the chin, though he {{recovered}} to continue his innings. Then Jardine himself faced Martindale and Constantine. Jardine never flinched. With Les Ames finding himself in difficulties, Jardine said, [...] "You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bloody nonsense." [...] He played right back to the bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and played them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. While the Old Trafford pitch was not as suited to bodyline as the hard Australian wickets, Martindale did take 5 for 73, but Constantine only took 1 for 55. Jardine himself made 127, his only Test century. In the West Indian second innings, Clark bowled bodyline back to the West Indians, taking 2 for 64. The match in the end was drawn but played a large part in turning English opinion against bodyline. The Times used the word bodyline, without using inverted commas or using the qualification so-called, for the first time. Wisden also said that [...] "most of those watching {{it for the first time}} must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice." ...|$|E

[...] "We were to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> guy Freiberg," [...] Cipollina recalled, and though they had never met before, Freiberg was integrated into the group. The band also added Skip Spence on guitar and began to rehearse at Marty Balin's club, the Matrix.

2500|$|A city-level {{official}} in Liaoning province {{was asked by}} investigators what direction Bo Xilai may have given regarding removing organs from Falun Gong prisoners. The official replied “I was asked to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> task. Party central is actually taking care of this...He [...] was involved quite positively, yeah it seemed quite positive. At that time we mainly talked about it during the meetings within the Standing Committee.” The official hung up after realizing {{that he had not}} confirmed the identity of the caller. Another phone call recipient was a medical doctor at a military hospital in Liaoning. When asked about whether Falun Gong practitioners’ organs were ever used in transplant operations at a nearby hospital, the official answered in the affirmative: “All that was processed through the court.” The doctor soon grew uncomfortable with the line of questioning and refused to discuss the issue further without clearance from the hospital’s political division.|$|E
2500|$|Problems with {{dentures}} {{may arise}} because patients {{are not used}} to having something in their mouth that is not food. The brain senses the appliance and interprets it as 'food', sending messages to the salivary glands to produce more saliva and to secrete it at a higher rate. This usually only happens in the first 12 to 24 hours, after which the salivary glands return to their normal output. [...] New dentures can also be the cause of sore spots as they compress the denture-bearing soft tissues (mucosa). [...] A few denture adjustments in the days following insertion of the dentures can take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> problem. [...] is another problem encountered by a minority of patients. [...] At times, {{this may be due to}} a denture that is too loose, too thick or extended too far posteriorly onto the soft palate. [...] At times, gagging may also be attributed to psychological denial of the denture. Psychological gagging is the most difficult to treat since it is out of the dentist's control. [...] In such cases, an implant-supported palateless denture may have to be constructed. Sometimes there could be a gingivitis infection under the completed dentures, caused by the accumulation of dental plaque. One of the most common problems for wearers of new upper complete denture is a loss of taste sensations.|$|E
