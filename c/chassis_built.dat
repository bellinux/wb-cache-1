5|$|M14 Half-track – This variant had {{the same}} {{armament}} as the M13 but used the slightly different M5 Half-track <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by International Harvester for the Lend-Lease Program. The M14 was mostly supplied to Britain, where they were converted back to regular half-tracks. A total of 1602 were produced by International Harvester.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{factories}} {{assembled the}} various {{models of the}} Sd.Kfz. 10. Demag built approximately 1,075 from 1938 to November 1942. Adler-Werke completed 3,414 between 1938 and December 1943. Büssing-NAG built 750 between 1938 and December 1942. MWC assembled 4750 between 1939 and November 1944. Mühlenbau und Industrie A.G. (MIAG) completed 324 between 1939 and 1941. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen Hannover (MNH) built about 600 between 1939 and November 1942. Österreichische Saurerwerke completed about 3,075 from 1940 to December 1943. Both Demag and MWC were producing the D 7p chassis for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light APC in 1945 when a shortage of armored bodies meant that 276 had to be completed with wooden upper bodies. Eighty of these {{are known to have}} been delivered by 1 March 1945. These numbers may include 310 <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> for Sd.Kfz. 252 armored ammunition carriers and Sd.Kfz. 253 oberservation vehicles.|$|E

25|$|The Leyland Tiger was {{a heavyweight}} half-cab single-decker bus and coach <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by Leyland Motors between 1927 and 1968, except {{the period of}} World War II.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} six BRM P261 cars were constructed, with both {{the first and last}} <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> being written off during their careers and rebuilt by the factory. All six survive.|$|E
25|$|The Bristol LH was a single-decker bus <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by Bristol Commercial Vehicles (BCV) in Bristol, England. Nearly 2,000 {{were built}} between 1967 and 1982 {{in a variety}} of sizes and body types, {{including}} some as goods vehicles.|$|E
50|$|In total five Nimrod <b>chassis</b> were <b>built</b> between 1981-84.|$|R

25|$|The Bristol SU was a single-decker bus and single-decker coach <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by Bristol Commercial Vehicles between 1960 and 1966. The {{bodies for}} these {{vehicles}} were built by Eastern Coach Works (ECW). Some {{of them were}} built as medium length chassis whereas {{most of them were}} built as full length chassis.|$|E
25|$|TA2 {{class rules}} specify a tubular <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by Howe Racing Enterprises, M-1 Motorsports, Mike Cope Racing, or Meissen Enterprises, and a Chevrolet Camaro, Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger body (full-scale replica) built by either Five Star Racing Race Car Bodies (Gen 6 Camaros and Mustangs), or Howe Racing Enterprises (all other {{eligible}} cars), with the Camaro body {{being the most}} popular by far. A minimum of two functional brake lights in their approximate stock location are required on all cars competing in the Trans Am Series.|$|E
25|$|The <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by TVR {{were all}} {{provided}} to customer specification, and therefore no {{two of them}} left the factory {{in exactly the same}} configuration. The extra exposure created by using the Sports Saloon in competition led to potential customers inquiring about the availability of other body styles. TVR sold kits with Microplas Mistal bodies, and at least two different styles from Rochdale Motor Panels & Engineering Ltd. The engines fitted were typically the Ford 1172cc sidevalve or Austin A40 1200cc OHV. There was at least one instance of a car being fitted with the 1489cc BMC B-Series engine (as fitted to the MGA), and one chassis was built to accommodate a customer's 2½-litre Lea-Francis engine.|$|E
50|$|Two more ND283F test <b>chassis</b> were <b>built,</b> but no ND243F.|$|R
50|$|Six prototypical Dennis Trident 3 <b>chassis</b> were <b>built</b> in 1996.|$|R

25|$|In the 2007 season, for {{the first}} time since the 1981 rule, two teams used <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by other teams. Super Aguri started the season using a {{modified}} Honda Racing RA106 chassis (used by Honda the previous year), while Scuderia Toro Rosso used the same chassis used by the parent Red Bull Racing team, which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary. The usage of these loopholes was ended for 2010 with the publication of new technical regulations, which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis, which prevents a team using a chassis owned by another Formula One constructor. The regulations continue to allow a team to subcontract the design and construction of the chassis to a third-party, an option used by the HRT team in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{became a}} major issue in Formula One and the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa did not take place as the drivers boycotted the circuit after safety {{upgrades}} were not installed as demanded. Stewart won the 1969 title easily with the new Matra MS80, a spectacular achievement from a constructor and a team that had only entered Formula One the previous year. It remains the only title won by a <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> in France. 1969 also saw a brief resurgence of interest in four wheel drive with a record of four such cars on field at the British Grand Prix. Johnny Servoz-Gavin became the one and only driver to score a point with a 4WD, finishing sixth with the Matra MS84 at the Canadian Grand Prix, although the front wheel transmission was actually disconnected. Wide tyres and downforce had proved to be better means of increasing grip, and the technology was largely abandoned. Jacky Ickx finished second in the championship for Brabham, competitive again after dropping its Repco engines in favour of the DFV.|$|E
500|$|The Howmet TX (Turbine eXperimental) was an American sports {{prototype}} {{racing car}} designed in 1968 {{to test the}} competitive use of a gas turbine engine in sports car racing. [...] Planned by racing driver Ray Heppenstall, the TX combined a <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by McKee Engineering, turbine engines leased from Continental Aviation & Engineering, and financial backing and materials from the Howmet Corporation.|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with the}} 200Tdi engine, the 127's name {{was changed to}} the [...] "Land Rover Defender 130". The {{wheelbase}} remained the same; the new figure was simply a tidying up exercise. More importantly, 130s were no longer built from [...] "cut-and-shut" [...] 110s, but had dedicated <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> from scratch. The chassis retained the same basic structure as the 90 and 110 models, but with a longer wheelbase.|$|E
2500|$|The initial CSX4000 series {{cars were}} {{completed}} from the <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by McCluskey Ltd {{as well as}} other new parts and reconditioned Ford engines. Given the value of the vehicle many [...] "extra" [...] cars have appeared over the years, even some sharing the same chassis number. Gradually as the vintage parts supply ran low, newly constructed frames and body panels were obtained from a variety of suppliers. The production of chassis numbers CSX4001 to CSX4999 took roughly 20 years and many different business relationships to complete.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is known}} for working on his own racecars as the chief chassis builder. He used to race in <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> by major chassis manufacturers. He would then modify the chassis with tricks that he learned during his decades of racing. He {{decided it would be}} easier to build his own chassis than to modify someone else's design. He sold [...] "Bloomquist Chassis" [...] (aka TEAM ZERO) to select racers. Bloomquist Chassis helped in their entire program. [...] These racers {{included}} Jared Landers, Dale McDowell, Trevor Landrum, Steve landrum, and Eric Wells. In 2014, Bloomquist went into business with Michigan racer and businessman Randy Sweet and elected to halt chassis production for outside buyers and focus on building cars only for Scott Bloomquist Racing.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{initially}} {{put to work}} on the Templeton route, running a shuttle {{from the end of the}} Riccarton tramline to the terminus via Hornby and Islington, until being taken out of service in June 1920. Its next assignment was to run an afternoon shuttle service, starting on 2 October 1920, between the Brighton tramline at Linwood Avenue and the Bromley Cemetery during weekends. This proved to be its last public service, ending on 1 January 1922, after which it was dismantled. The body was later lengthened and mounted on another chassis while the Walker chassis was cut up for parts. The Tramway Historical Society have two similar Walker <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> in 1918 as part of their collection, and intend to restore one of these with a replica [...] "Beetle" [...] body.|$|E
2500|$|The Model J {{quickly became}} one of the most popular luxury cars, as well as a status symbol in the United States and Europe, driven by the rich and famous, {{including}} Al Capone, Evalyn Walsh McLean, Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, Mae West, Marion Davies, Tyrone Power, Clark Gable, Bill [...] "Bojangles" [...] Robinson, William Randolph Hearst, Powel Crosley, Jr., the families Mars, Whitney, and Wrigley; members of European royalty such as the Duke of Windsor, Prince Nicholas of Romania, Queen Maria of Yugoslavia, and the Kings Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Alfonso XIII of Spain. The latter was very keen on motoring and chose his now-missing Duesenberg J, among his cars, to go to exile after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. Father Divine had the last Duesenberg <b>chassis</b> <b>built</b> with an extra-long 178-inch wheelbase. It weighed [...] and accommodated ten passengers. J. Herbert Newport was the designer. Built by Bohman & Schwartz and delivered in October 1937, it was [...] long and [...] wide. It was known as Father Divine's Throne Car, because it had a removable rear top section that exposed two raised rear seats.|$|E
60|$|A {{thousand}} sarcastic refusals did not {{check his}} teasing {{for a car}} of his own. However lax he might be about early rising and the prosody of Vergil, he was tireless in tinkering. With three other boys he bought a rheumatic Ford <b>chassis,</b> <b>built</b> an amazing racer-body out of tin and pine, went skidding round corners in the perilous craft, and sold it at a profit. Babbitt gave him a motor-cycle, and every Saturday afternoon, with seven sandwiches {{and a bottle of}} Coca-Cola in his pockets, and Eunice perched eerily on the rumble seat, he went roaring off to distant towns.|$|E
