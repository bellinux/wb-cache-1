5|$|Lombardy {{noted the}} shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky {{remained}} glued to his seat. A sympathetic Lothar Schmid <b>came</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> the two shifted the pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win {{from a position}} which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft {{came over the}} area to make an airdrop. The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in the attic, where he had several Studer tape recorders. Little was done with them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more avant garde sound {{recordings}} also made in the attic, have appeared on various bootlegs). The attic also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an upright piano in the sunroom.|$|E

5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> found that the new team had gone off the rails, scrapping the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the Core team were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E

25|$|Roald Dahl {{was born}} in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegian parents, Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (née Hesselberg). Dahl's father had emigrated to the UK from Sarpsborg in Norway, and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s. His mother <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after the Norwegian polar {{explorer}} Roald Amundsen. His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke {{at home with his}} parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild and Else. Dahl and his sisters were raised in the Lutheran faith, and were baptised at the Norwegian Church, Cardiff, where their parents worshipped.|$|E

500|$|Hill {{repeatedly}} tells a {{story from}} when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. [...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> said 'You all seem to be having a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He felt as if he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
500|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. North Korean fire destroyed Vandygriff's radio, {{forcing him to}} use runners to communicate with Kennedy's command post. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft came over the area to make an airdrop. Kennedy put out orange identification panels, but the North Koreans put out similar panels. The planes circled, and finally dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> attacked D Company. The North Korean panels had misled both the cargo and fighter planes. The fighters dropped two napalm tanks within D Company's perimeter, but none there were injured. The planes then strafed right through the 2nd Platoon position, but again caused no casualties. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions, and PPSh-41 [...] "burp gun" [...] fire wounded Kennedy in the leg and ankle.|$|E

2500|$|Maurice Ravel [...] did {{not have}} {{confidence}} in me for the Boléro. He was afraid that my Mediterranean temperament would overtake me, and that I would rush the tempo. I assembled the orchestra at the Salle Pleyel, and Ravel took a seat beside me. Everything went well until the final part, where, in spite of myself, I increased the tempo by a fraction. Ravel jumped up, <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> pulled at my jacket: [...] "not so fast", he exclaimed, {{and we had to}} begin again.|$|E
2500|$|The crowd {{stood and}} applauded {{for almost two}} minutes.

2500|$|A second {{air raid}} at 22:00 the next night, again in {{brilliant}} moonlight, flew low to drop bombs and machine-gun the casualty clearing stations at Deir el Belah, which were caring for about 100 casualties, and were clearly marked with Red Cross ground sheets. The attack killed six and wounded {{nine in the}} 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance, while one patient was killed and four orderlies wounded in the 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance. The next night another air raid caused 13 casualties. [...] "The Turks are out bombing every night, while this bright moonlight lasts ...

Eventually, they moved to Van Nostrand Avenue between Ocean Avenue and Rutgers Avenue. His mother worked for Western Electric in Kearny, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|The rearguard of Hodgson's {{column was}} closely {{followed}} by German and Ottoman units firing {{on the rear}} of the retreating column. When they reached the Jordan Valley, the right rear of Chaytor's force was threatened by enemy units which pressed in strongly on the piquets in the hills which were soon driven in, while German aircraft continued to machine gun the column. Five Taubes <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> for half an hour bombed the large formations and about midday German and Ottoman forces closed in on the right as our troops withdrew under heavy fire. The 4th Light Horse Brigade was being strongly pushed as it fell back following orders to retire. During this crucial part of the retirement, the 4th Light Horse Brigade's right had become uncovered but when the formations got to the lower slopes of the hills the dismounted Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment reinforced the 4th Light Horse Brigade's right. A squadron of Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) with the Berkshire, Leicester Batteries and the remaining three guns of [...] "B" [...] Battery H. A. C. came into action against this German and Ottoman force advancing down the Umm esh Shert track. These squadrons and artillery came into action and checked the strong enemy attack {{with the support of the}} 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) which had also been sent back to support the rearguard. The 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades and the 10th Mountain Battery formed a reserve while the 2nd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades proceeded straight on through to the bridgehead.|$|E
