25|$|Orangutans (genus Pongo) {{were first}} {{observed}} using {{tools in the}} wild in 1994 in {{the northwest corner of}} Sumatra. As with the chimpanzees, orangutans use tools made from branches and leaves to scratch, scrape, wipe, sponge, swat, fan, hook, probe, scoop, pry, <b>chisel,</b> <b>hammer,</b> cover, cushion and amplify. They will break off a tree branch that is about 30cm long, snap off the twigs, fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites. Sumatran orangutans use a variety of tools—up to 54 types for extracting insects or honey, and as many as 20 types for opening or preparing fruits such as the hard to access Neesia Malayana. They also use an 'autoerotic tool'—a stick which they use to stimulate the genitals and masturbate (both male and female). In parts of Borneo, orangutans use handfuls of leaves as napkins to wipe their chins while orangutans in parts of Sumatra use leaves as gloves, helping them handle spiny fruits and branches, or as seat cushions in spiny trees. There have been reports that individuals in both captivity and in the wild use tools held between the lips or teeth, rather than in the hands. In captivity, orangutans have been taught to chip stone handaxes.|$|E

25|$|Polishing {{operations}} for {{items such as}} <b>chisels,</b> <b>hammers,</b> screwdrivers, wrenches, etc., are given a fine finish but not plated. In order to achieve this finish four operations are required: roughing, dry fining, greasing, and coloring. Note that roughing is usually done on a solid grinding wheel and for an extra fine polish the greasing operation may be broken up into two operations: rough greasing and fine greasing. However, for inexpensive items money is saved by only performing the first two operations.|$|R

The {{intended}} victims (who are much larger men than Pinky and Baravelli) manage to kidnap the pair instead, removing their outer clothing and locking them in a room. Pinky and Baravelli make their escape by sawing their way out through the floor. The saws came from a tool bag Pinky carried with them that held their kidnappers' tools, which included, among other things, rope, <b>chisels,</b> <b>hammers</b> and at one point, a small pig.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Pierre Sabatier {{began his career}} with {{large-scale}} murals in mosaic and ceramics. At {{the end of the}} 1960s he turned to metal, which was to become his preferred, signature material. Working with large surfaces and volumes, often using adapted tools of his own design, Pierre Sabatier worked with steel, pewter, brass, aluminium or copper. Stamped, <b>chiseled,</b> <b>hammered,</b> cut out, burnt, soldered, corroded, polished... Sabatier used all possible techniques to achieve the desired effect. The oxidation process of transforming metal through acid treatment, and for which he developed a unique know-how, is essential to the aesthetic of Sabatier’s work and the key to its originality. In the 1980s Pierre Sabatier discovered new techniques with cement, that he used in creations for amusement parks and playgrounds.|$|R

50|$|The {{footpaths}} link {{many of the}} fortifications of Gibraltar. They {{were constructed}} from the 18th century onwards using <b>chisels,</b> <b>hammers</b> and rods to dig through the solid rock, in order to permit cannon, soldiers and supplies to be moved from ground level to gun positions and observation points established in numerous places on the Upper Rock. Most of these supply routes were later widened to permit vehicular traffic. Many of the roads on the Upper Rock have steel rings embedded in the rock alongside the carriageway, which were used as safety brakes for heavy loads such as cannon being pulled up the slope. Some routes were retained as footpaths to enable troop movements to be concealed behind the surrounding shrubbery, and to provide alternative routes to key points if a road was congested with a heavy load. Several of the paths can be combined into a strenuous circuit of around 10 km that takes about four hours to complete, providing broad views of the Gibraltar peninsula, the Strait of Gibraltar, Spain and the coast of Morocco.|$|R

50|$|India: In India, over {{1 million}} urban poor workers, often with low {{literacy}} skills {{and awareness of}} the potential hazards of e-waste exposure, manually dismantle e-waste. A great portion of Indian e-waste workers are children and women. High levels of dioxin compounds, which are linked to cancer and developmental defects, have been commonly found in the breast milk and placentas of women exposed to e-waste, which can reveal improper disposal and handling of electronic products. Specifically, there are various reports that the city of Delhi contains several e-waste management sites that use concentrated hydrochloric and nitric acids to extract gold and copper. Recycling of e-waste is a very lucrative business in India and dominated by informal actors. E-waste in India is often processed to recover valuable materials in small workshops using rudimentary recycling methods. For instance, during the manual dismantling process in informal dismantling and recycling sites, e-waste recyclers use <b>chisels,</b> <b>hammers,</b> and cutting torches to open solder connections and separate various types of metals and components. Researchers have collected ashes from two waste burning operations in New Delhi, India, at Ibrahimpur and Shashtri Park which contained high levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc.|$|R
