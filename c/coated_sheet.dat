50|$|The tower's namesake was the priest, mountaineer and patriot Jakob Aljaž. In early 1895, he drew up, with a {{piece of}} chalk on the floor of his room in the parish of Dovje, plans for a {{cylindrical}} tower with a flag on its top. In April that year he purchased the summit of Triglav for the sum of one Austro-Hungarian gulden. Having done so, he secured himself the right to erect a building on the mountain top. The tower was constructed from iron and zinc <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> steel by Anton Belec from Šentvid near Ljubljana. He and four workers brought the parts of the tower to the summit of Triglav and put the tower together in only five hours on 7 August 1895. The opening took place that same day.

40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are being increasingly incorporated into automotive body structure to reduce vehicular weight without adversely affecting crashworthiness. Ultra-{{high strength}} steel (UHSS), a sub-set of AHSS, possess excellent anti-intrusion properties which make them very suitable for fabricating crash relevant automotive structures. The steel is usually coated {{as a necessary}} preparation for further processing. During resistance spot welding, the principal joining method for body-in-white automotive structures, the contact resistance, which is principally determined by {{the properties of the}} coating, play key role in defining welding parameters, thermal profiles, microstructure and eventually, sometimes, mechanical properties of the joint. 	In this work, the contact resistance associated with AlSi and galvannealed coatings on Usibor 1500 hot stamping steel were determined using their dynamic resistance profiles. The results showed significant differences in the contact resistance values associated with the different coatings, and the trend in these values represented trends in current requirements for attaining acceptable nuggets sizes during resistance spot welding. Although peak load for tensile shear loading in static mode was similar for the AlSi and galvannealed <b>coated</b> <b>sheets,</b> there were significant differences in failure mode transition characteristics and energy absorption capabilities associated with the different coatings. Moreover, it was found that joints formed from dissimilar combinations of AlSi and galvannealed <b>coated</b> <b>sheets</b> exhibited poorer mechanical properties than either of AlSi or galvannealed <b>coated</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

Metal flashing {{should be provided}} with expansion joints on long runs to prevent deformation of the metal sheets due to expansion and contraction, and should not stain or be stained by adjacent materials or react chemically with them. An important type of potential chemical reaction between metal flashing materials is galvanic corrosion. Copper and lead cannot be used in contact with or even above aluminum, zinc, or coated steel without {{an increased risk of}} premature corrosion. Also, Aluminum and zinc flashing cannot be used in contact with pressure treated wood due to rapid corrosion. Aluminum is also damaged by wet mortar and wet plaster. Salt spray in coastal areas may accelerate corrosion. so stainless steel, copper, or coated aluminum are recommended flashing materials near salt water.|$|E

A scanning electron microscopy analysis indicates that micromachining and plastic deformation are the dominant cutting phenomena in sheet steel processing. Plausible trends and relationships between kerf characteristics and process parameters are discussed. It is found that an optimum water pressure together with small standoff distance between the nozzle and workpiece may be used, while the traverse speed should be selected as high as possible for through cuts {{in order to increase}} the cutting rate.

40|$|AbstractBlends of {{thermoplastic}} starch (TPS) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) (70 / 30 TPS/PLA wt/wt) were thermopressed {{to produce}} biodegradable sheets. These <b>sheets</b> were <b>coated</b> with cross-linked chitosan by two different methods: spraying and immersion. The <b>coated</b> <b>sheets</b> presented a more irregular surface than uncoated samples, which {{was associated with}} the chitosan reticulation. The chitosan coating reduced the water solubility and the water vapor permeability of the sheets due to being less hygroscopic. <b>Coated</b> <b>sheets</b> were more rigid and had higher tensile strength than uncoated sheets, because the cross-linking joins the macromolecules covalently, reducing the mobility of the chains. Higher glycerol concentration in the TPS increased the elongation at break due to the glycerol plasticizing effect. Coating by spraying was more effective at changing the <b>sheet</b> properties than <b>coating</b> by immersion, and this technique can be used to reduce the hydrophilic character of biodegradable films, allowing their use as packaging materials...|$|R
40|$|Resistance {{spot welding}} is a {{fabrication}} process highly {{used in the}} structures assembly. This fact evidences {{the importance of this}} welding process control, due to its efficiency, productivity speediness and straightforward simple automation. This work aimed to study the weldability of zinc coated and uncoated steel sheets for automotive industry, comparing the performance of two welding equipments with two current outputkinds: alternating current (AC) and medium frequency direct current (DC). The welding parameters were kept constant: 260 kgf (force), 150 ms (time) and 7. 0 kA (welding current), based upon an optimization parameters methodology. The joints were characterized using optical metallography (spot diameter, indentation depth and weld penetration depth), mechanical tensile-shear tests and electrical measurements: contact electrical resistance, dynamic resistance and dynamic energy. The results showed that welding in medium frequency direct current was more efficient in generating heat in zinc <b>coated</b> <b>sheets</b> and uncoated sheets than alternating current equipment. In welding using AC and DC equipments in zinc <b>coated</b> <b>sheets,</b> the spot weld time formation was 25 ms longer than uncoated steel sheets spot weld time. The burn of zinc during welding did not damage the spot weld formation with AC or DC equipments. The electrical contact resistance increased with the roughnessand also presented 52 % higher in uncoated sheets than in zinc <b>coated</b> <b>sheets.</b> Finally, the increase in dynamicresistance and dynamic energy augmented the spot weld diameter for both welding equipments.

40|$|Polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{components}} find diverse applications in many industries. The manufacturing {{of the components}} generally involves forming of sheet metal into the desired shape and coating of the formed part with organic coating. An alternative manufacturing route is to coat the sheet metal first before forming. The change in the manufacturing sequence can potentially improve cost and reduce environmental impact. This approach, however, requires the coating to survive the deformation process. Thus, the effect of plastic deformation on coating adhesion is of primary interest to many engineers and researchers. This research aims at developing a methodology to predict the adhesion of coating after metal forming processes. A pull-off apparatus that measures the coating pull-off stress was used to indicate the coating adhesion strength. Several types of specimen were designed to obtain uniaxial tension, biaxial tension, and tension-compression deformation modes on pre-coated sheet by using a uniaxial tensile tester. Experimental results from two selected polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metals show that coating adhesion was affected by plastic deformation. An analytical model based on a virtual interface crack concept was developed to indicate the adhesion potential of the coating-substrate interface. From interfacial fracture mechanics, the initial adhesion potential {{is defined as the}} energy release rate characterized by the virtual interface crack and the initial pull-off stress. The analytical model was used to predict coating adhesion loss after deformation in uniaxial tension mode. The analytical model predictions agreed well with experimental results. Finite element analysis tool was applied to simulate more complex deformation modes in stamping of <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> meals. The stress field near the interface crack tip was used to calculate the energy release rate and predict the adhesion loss under different deformation modes. The predictions obtained from numerical method are also in good agreements with the experimental results in biaxial tension and tension-compression modes. The research has led {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of plastic deformation on coating adhesion. The developed adhesion test methods can be used to generate useful information on coating durability for diverse practical use. It is also expected that the results of the research will facilitate the development of better polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal to be used in sheet metal forming processes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractApplication of {{the coating}} to {{material}} {{in a flat}} condition has economical, technological and ecological advantages. As the material is subsequently formed into shape not only the base material needs to withstand this process but the coating as well. Development of forming tools for coated metals is mainly concerned with the prediction of performance of the base material and does not analyse {{the condition of the}} coating. However, during the forming process, major surface damage can occur when the <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> is bent and unbent around the die geometry. To reduce surface damage of coatings, proper control of the parameters during forming and a detail study of the surface conditions is required. This research is conducted on metallically and organically <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> material which is commonly used for structural applications. The crack density of the coating is analysed during a deep drawing process and a forming limit diagram is obtained from the biaxial straining of the prepainted steel samples.

40|$|Drying occurs {{twice during}} coated paper production: first, when drying the base paper, then when drying the sheet freshly coated with an aqueous {{suspension}} of pigment particles. The effects on coated paper quality from the impingement drying conditions used at both base paper and coated paper drying stages were studied {{for the light}} weight coated (LWC) paper. A central feature {{of the study was}} the development of the capability to dry coated paper by impingement in superheated steam. The variables investigated were the drying fluid, air or superheated steam, drying fluid temperature, drying time and temperature, and coating-to-drying delay time. The effects of drying on the uncoated paper physical properties and the coated paper physical and printing properties were determined. The drying of the base paper with superheated steam gave higher strength and hydrophobicity but lower optical properties and smoothness than drying in air. When steam-dried base paper was coated and dried in air or steam it gave a rougher, less glossy, less bright coated paper than air-dried base paper. Print mottle remained high when air drying was used subsequently for the <b>coated</b> <b>sheet.</b> The biggest effect on LWC coated paper quality derived from the choice of drying medium, air or superheated steam. Coating-to-drying delay time had no effect. Most of the properties of steam-dried coated paper were fixed by 0. 6 s drying time. Properties the most affected were surface properties: print quality, gloss and roughness, while bulk properties were less sensitive. Drying with superheated steam gave lower gloss and smoothness than drying in air. Print mottle was significantly improved with steam drying of the <b>coated</b> <b>sheet.</b> Superheated steam drying of coated paper has advantages only if used for the <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> not the base sheet...|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} core loss of {{electrical}} steel the vacuum arc ion plating technique {{has been used}} to deposit titanium nitride (TiN) layers on highly grain oriented electrical steel sheets. The layer thickness, the stresses of layers and <b>coated</b> <b>sheets</b> and the achieved reduction in core losses have been measured as functions of coating duration and applied bias voltage. Well adhered layers with high compressive stress up to 6. 8 GPa have been produced. With increasing bias voltage the layer thickness decreases and the intrinsic stress of the layers increase. A further increase of bias voltage leads to a drop in stress due to thermal relaxation. In general, the tensile stress of the <b>coated</b> <b>sheets</b> rises with increasing layer thickness while the core loss of the coated material decreases with increasing tensile stress of the steel sheet and increasing bias voltage.

40|$|The {{major problem}} during laser welding of zinc <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> steel in an overlap {{configuration}} is the zinc vapour produced at {{the interface between}} two sheets. The vapour tends to evacuate through the keyhole and melt pool, particularly when no gap is present between the overlapped sheets.

The aim of this work is to build an understanding of the material behaviour, particularly the zinc behaviour when welding zinc coated steels in overlap configuration without a pre-set gap. The interaction between zinc vapour and welded materials was investigated mainly by experimental approaches. Questions concerning when and how stable welds can be obtained are answered by introducing a mechanism describing the dynamic balance between the zinc vapour, the keyhole and the weld pool.

40|$|Abstract. Functional TiB 2 coating was {{prepared}} {{onto the surface}} of Cr-Zr-Cu electrodes by vibrating electrospark deposition in order to extend their service life during resistance spot welding of Zinc <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> steels. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the coatings have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive analysis, X-ray diffraction and micro-hardness tests respectively. The results indicate that cracks appear in the coating due to the tensile stress accumulation and delamination of the coating is related to mismatch in the equivalent valence electron. Cu diffuses obviously from the substrate {{to the surface of the}} coating, forming a gradient distribution and making the bonding of the interface between the coating and the substrate an atomic one. TiB 2 coating is oxidized during deposition under high temperature of electrosparking.
