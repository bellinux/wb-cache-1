40|$|The particle-in-cell <b>code</b> ORB <b>5</b> is {{a global}} gyrokinetic {{turbulence}} simulation code in tokamak geometry. It has been developed at CRPP, Lausanne, Switzerland, with major contributions from IPP, Garching, Germany, and IPP, Greifswald, Germany, under a long-standing collaboration. The <b>code</b> ORB <b>5</b> solves the gyrokinetic equations in the whole plasma core, including the magnetic axis. A field-aligned filtering procedure and sophisticated noise-control and heating operators allow for accurate simulations. Recently, the <b>code</b> ORB <b>5</b> has been extended to include self-consistent perpendicular magnetic field perturbations. The inclusion of magnetic perturbations allows for a comprehensive study of finite beta effects on microinstability. In this paper, we present the first linear and nonlinear code results concerning electromagnetic effects on tokamak microinstabilities. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to improve the upper bounds of the minimum {{distances}} of self-dual <b>codes</b> over F <b>5</b> for lengths 22, 26, 28, 32 − 40. In particular, we prove that there is no [22, 11, 9] self-dual <b>code</b> over F <b>5,</b> whose existence was left open in 1982. We also show that both the Hamming weight enumerator and the Lee weight enumerator of a putative [24, 12, 10] self-dual <b>code</b> over F <b>5</b> are unique. Using the building-up construction, we show that there are exactly nine inequivalent optimal self-dual [18, 9, 7] <b>codes</b> over F <b>5</b> up to the monomial equivalence, and construct one new optimal selfdual [20, 10, 8] <b>code</b> over F <b>5</b> and at least 40 new inequivalent optimal self-dual [22, 11, 8] codes...|$|R

5000|$|In the erasure channel model {{a symbol}} gets either {{transmitted}} correctly with probability [...] or is erased with probability [...] (see Figure \ref{fig:Sudoku3x3channel}). The channel introduces no errors, i.e. no channel input is changed to another symbol. The example in Figure \ref{fig:Sudoku3x3BSC} shows {{the transmission of}} a [...] Sudoku <b>code.</b> <b>5</b> of the 9 symbols got erased by the channel. The decoder is still able to reconstruct the message, i.e. the whole puzzle.Note that the symbols sent over the channel are not binary. For a binary channel the symbols (e.g. integers [...] ) have to be mapped onto base 2. The binary erasure channel model however is not applicable because it erases only individual bits with some probability and not Sudoku symbols. If the symbols of the Sudoku are sent in packets the channel {{can be described as}} a packet erasure channel model.|$|E
