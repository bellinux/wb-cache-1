40|$|The {{strength}} and fracture behavior of dowel-type connections with stiff dowels loaded perpendicular to grain was studied by nonlinear 3 D finite element (FE) -analysis. A cohesive zone model {{was used to}} model the perpendicular to grain fracture of the wood, i. e., failure by wood splitting along the grain. The influence of load eccentricity and dowel-to-loaded-edge distance was studied for a plate type of geometry loaded in tension and for a simply supported beam loaded in bending. The strength found from the FE-analysis is compared to strength from experimental tests with <b>centric</b> <b>loading,</b> showing overall good agreement. Numerical results for <b>centric</b> <b>loading</b> are further compared to strength predictions according to the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) -based design criterion present in Eurocode 5 (EN 1995 - 1 - 1 : 2004). The comparison showed good agreement regarding the relative influence of connection geometry, but the design criterion appears, however, to yield unconservative strength predictions. The results of the FE-analyses regarding dowel load eccentricity showed that such loading conditions may yield significantly lower strengths compared to <b>centric</b> <b>loading.</b> An approximate engineering method {{to account for the}} strength reduction due to load eccentricity is, furthermore, presented...|$|E
40|$|The lateral {{torsional}} buckling behaviour of hot rolled channel sections subjected to bending is studied in an overall project. The final {{objective of this}} project {{is to develop a}} design method. This paper concentrates on the validation of the FEM model against the experiments. For channel sections loaded through the shear centre (<b>centric</b> <b>loading)</b> sudden collapse was observed while channel sections loaded in the plane of the web (eccentric loading) fail gradually in bending and torsion. The objective of the numerical research was to simulate this experimental behaviour and to predict the failure load correctly. Therefore, a FEM model was made consisting of shell elements and beam elements to compensate for the root radius of the channels, including plastic material behaviour, geometric non-linearity and measured imperfections. The simulations gave agreeable failure loads. For eccentric loading, the FEM simulations showed load-displacement curves, which compare well with experimental results. For <b>centric</b> <b>loading</b> however, the results appeared to be largely sensitive to imperfections with respect to member straightness. Finally, it is concluded that the FEM model is successfully validated against the available test results. ...|$|E

For this purpose a rail ofNP 46 standard section was subjected to experimental research {{with the aid of}} electrical resistance strain gauges in the Laboratory for Highway and Railway Engineering (Stevin IV), Delft University of Technology. After some initial problems in maintaining the constancy of the conditions under which the measurements were performed, good results were obtained by this method. Furthermore, the flexural stresses in the rail due to the above-mentioned load were analysed with the ICES/STRUDL application package, version 2, available at the University, by means of the IBM 360 computer of the University's Computer Centre. The two methods of determining the flexural stresses were found to be satisfactorily serviceable for the purpose and to yield comparable results. It also emerged that the existing theories for calculating more particularly the maximum stresses occurring in the rail do not always yield satisfactory results.

One suggested explanation is that ETT exhibit a lower threshold level for tactile sensitivity than vital teeth. Therefore, this study compared the threshold for tactile sensitivity of vital teeth and ETT in the same individuals. MethodsForty participants with double crown-retained RPDPs fixed to vital teeth and ETT {{were included in the}} study. Each subject had at least one vital and one corresponding contralateral endodontically treated abutment tooth in the same jaw. After removal of the RPDP, an increasing centric force (0 cN to max. 2000 cN) was separately applied axially to both free-standing abutment teeth using a force gauge while the patient was asked to give three acoustic signals: (1) when noticing the first contact, (2) when noticing pressure and (3) when the pressure became displeasing. Afterwards, the same trial was performed with an eccentric force applied parallel to the tooth axis. ResultsStatistical analysis revealed no significant differences in the threshold of tactile sensitivity of vital teeth and ETT to either centric or eccentric loading (p> 0. 05). Eccentric loading showed lower mean threshold values compared to <b>centric</b> <b>loading.</b> A large variability of tactile sensitivity between individuals was noted. However, there were no gender-related significant differences in tactile sensitivity (p> 0. 05). ConclusionsThe tactile sensitivity of vital and non-vital teeth seems comparable. Clinical significanceThe assumption that a lower threshold level for tactile sensitivity in ETT than in vital teeth is responsible for their increased fracture risk could not be confirmed. Therefore, other reasons, e. g. loss of hard tissue due to root canal treatment, have to be considered responsible for the increased fracture risk of ETT...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} several works {{have been carried out}} for {{eccentric}} loaded condition over sand for finding the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundation. These investigations are limited to strip, square and rectangular footings, it has been found out that less attention is paid to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of eccentrically loaded circular foundation with different depth of embedment Df. Hence the present investigations are based on the load settlement behaviour of eccentrically loaded circular footing. Bearing capacity is different for centric and eccentric vertical loaded condition which is subjected to the foundation, the case of vertical load applied centrally to the foundation studied in most of the cases. Settlement and bearing capacity study of shallow footings is needed for design of a foundation. The investigation is undertaken to study the behaviour of bearing capacity and settlement of circular footing over sand bed. The test have been conducted for both surface and embedded foundations under eccentric and <b>centric</b> <b>loads</b> resting over sand bed. The investigation shows that ultimate bearing capacity of foundation depends on the different type of <b>loading</b> (<b>Centric,</b> eccentric) and the depth of embedment (Df/B).

At 01 / 12 / 2016, a new Chinese Code {{for the design of}} composite structures JGJ 138 - 2016 was put in practice to replace the old JGJ 138 - 2001. Benefit from the vast experience of composite structure applications blooming recently in Chinese, the new code covers much wider topics and is more comparable to Eurocodes 4. Generally, both codes cover topics of composite beams and columns, composite slabs and composite connections. However, JGJ 138 - 2016 covers also the design of composite shear walls, while Eurocode 4 considers more about durability and time effects. It is necessary to compare the materials used for both of codes. In this article, it covers comparison of the mechanic properties such as elastic modulus, characteristic strength and design strength. The analysis includes concrete, reinforcement, and structural steel. The main comparison is the design procedure of composite columns. The application range of the codes will be pointed out first. Both codes allow the design of concrete encased sections and concrete filled rectangular and circular tubes. However different limitations on cross-section sizes and materials can be found. Eurocode 4 represents three different design methods: the simplified method for <b>centric</b> <b>loading,</b> based on the buckling curves; the general method based on 2 nd order calculation for action effects and N-M interaction for the determination of resistances; as well as the non-linear method based on stress-strain limitation of material and FE-Analysis. Chinese code gives a simplified method of the calculation of column resistance for centric and eccentric loading. Also the impact of second-order effect are to proof if needed. According to the EN 1994 - 1 - 1 the impact of creep is to consider for the denervation of the bending stiffness and for ideal buckling resistance and non-dimensional slenderness. JGJ 138 - 2016 do not consider impact of creep for the design. Besides, JGJ 138 - 2016 includes also design for seismic situation.

40|$|The {{local and}} distortional {{buckling}} behaviour of flange and web-stiffened compression members was investigated. In particular, the behaviour of web-perforated sections was investigated both numerically and experimentally. Perforation reduces the perpendicular flexural stiffness {{of the web}} and thus particularly reduces the distortional buckling strength of the section. The main task of the research {{was to develop a}} design method for estimating the compression capacity of a perforated steel wall-stud under <b>centric</b> <b>loading.</b> The influence of the gypsum sheathing on the distortional buckling strength is also taken into account. It was shown that the method given in Eurocode 3 is quite rough and sometimes gives inaccurate results for estimating the elastic distortional buckling stress of both C-sections and intermediate stiffened plates. In the case of C-sections, the method developed by Lau and Hancock and the method developed by Schafer and Peköz correlate better with the results defined numerically. The Finite Strip Method (FSM) and Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) provided particularly good tools with which to analyze local and distortional buckling modes. It was also shown that interaction between different distortional buckling modes should be taken into account when analysing sections having both web and flange stiffeners. Distortional buckling stress of the web-perforated C-section with or without web stiffeners can be determined by replacing the perforated web part with an equivalent plain plate corresponding to the same perpendicular bending stiffness. Distortional buckling stress may be determined by some numerical method such as FSM or GBT. For the web-perforated C-section, an analytical method for the distortional buckling is also presented. Gypsum sheathing connections give rotational restraint to the wall–stud, thus improving distortional buckling strength. Some practical guidelines are given for calculating the rotational restraint. Buckling analysis showed that relatively small restraint may double the distortional buckling stress of the web-perforated section. Buckling analysis and experimental research showed that screw pitch also has a considerable effect on the distortional buckling stress. Using restraint values given by the connection tests, the predicted values for the gypsum board braced columns are in good accordance with the test results. In practical design, utilizing the gypsum board in the determination of the distortional buckling stress requires that the sheathing retains its capacity and stiffness for the expected service life of the structure. Furthermore, the connection characteristics should be carefully examined. Based on the results of the experimental and theoretical studies, design proposals were made for the design of compressed web-perforated steel wall studs. Some practical guidelines were also given for taking into account the gypsum sheathing. These design proposals are also valid for solid steel wall studs, especially for slender sections, which are sensitive to distortional buckling. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Examining {{existing}} {{experimental results}} for shallow rigid foundations subjected to vertical <b>centric</b> <b>load</b> (N), accompanied or {{not with a}} bending moment (M), two main non-linear mechanisms governing the cyclic response of the soil-foundation system can be distinguished: foundation uplift and soil yielding. A soil-foundation failure limit, {{is defined as a}} domain of resistance in the two dimensional (2 D) load space (N, M) inside of which lie all the admissible combinations of loads; these latter correspond to a pure elastic, non-linear elastic or plastic behavior of the soil-foundation system, while the points lying on the failure limit correspond to a combination of loads leading to a failure of the soil-foundation system. In this study, the proposed resistance domain is constructed analytically based on mechanics. Original elastic limit, uplift initiation limit and iso-uplift limits are constructed inside this domain. These limits give a prediction of the mechanisms activated for each combination of loads applied to the foundation. A comparison of the proposed failure limit with experimental tests existing in the literature shows interesting results. Also, the developed uplift initiation limit and iso-uplift curves are confronted with others already proposed in the literature and widely used due to the absence of other alternatives, and remarkable differences are noted, showing evident errors in the past proposals and relevant accuracy for those given in the present work...|$|R

Terzaghi (1943) wrote this as a superposition of three separate bearing capacity components for the cohesion, surcharge and soil-weight. The first question is to what ex-tent the currently used components are correct. The second question is {{to what extent the}} superposition is correct, because the failure mechanisms for these three components are not the same.

Meyerhof (1953) extended the equation of Terzaghi with correction factors for the shape of the footing and the inclination of the load. For eccentric loading however, there are no correction factors. The common practice is to reduce the contact area of the foundation such that its centroid coincides with that of the load, which means that, the area of the foundation outside the effective area, is completely neglected. Therefore the third question is, if this reduction of the foundation area is an accurate method to describe the reduction of the bearing capacity due to eccentric loading.

40|$|Since the {{development}} of Terzaghi's theory on the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations in 1943, outcomes of various studies either theoretical, experimental and numerical, done by various investigators has been brought into light. Apart from <b>centric</b> vertical <b>load,</b> various researchers have also studied the effect of eccentric vertical <b>load,</b> <b>centric</b> inclined <b>load</b> and eccentrically inclined load on foundation system. Due to chemical flow, underground pipe lines, mining, blasting and other underground activities, which have dynamic impact on the soil creates flexible voids below the foundation. Nearness of void underneath the footing influences the stability itself and causes serious harm to the structure. Based on the literature review, it appears that limited research {{has been carried out}} in the field of ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundation, when the foundation is subjected to eccentric vertical load having a void beneath the foundation. The origin of present study targets that scarcity in research. In order to achieve the objective, one hundred and fifty-six numbers of numerical models have been made using PLAXIS to study the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow strip foundation resting over dry sand bed with the flexible void underneath the footing. The embedment ratio (Df /B) was varied from zero to one. The eccentricity was varied from 0 to 0. 15 B (where, B = width of footing) with an increment of 0. 05 B. The effect of flexible void on the ultimate bearing capacity of the footing has been analyzed by varying the size (D = Diameter of void), location (L = Location of void below foundation base) and horizontal distance (H) of the voids from center line of the footing. Based on the numerical results, three numbers of reduction factors are developed to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow strip footing lying over a void on dry sand bed by knowing the ultimate bearing capacity of footing in the absence of flexible void. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1920 Prandtl {{published}} an analytical {{solution for the}} bearing capacity of a <b>centric</b> <b>loaded</b> strip footing on a weightless in-finite half-space, based on a so-called Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. Reissner extended this solution for a surrounding surcharge and Keverling Buisman and Terzaghi for the soil weight. Meyerhof and other researchers presented correction factors for {{the shape of the}} shallow foundation, which would suggest that, the failure mechanism of circular shallow foundations, is related to the Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. Meyerhof and Koppejan adapted this Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism also for pile foundations. The numerical calculations made in this article show that the Prandtl-wedge cannot be applied to circular shallow foundations and pile foundations in non-cohesive soils. The failure zone (plastic zone) below a loaded circular plate or pile tip, is far wider and deeper than the Prandtl-wedge. The calculations also show that there is, for these axisymmetric cases, failure {{both in and out of}} the standard x-y plane, but most of the failure is due to out-of-plane (tangential) failure. Therefore, this failure mechanism is different from the Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. Also interesting are the circular and diagonal thin zones below the plate and around the pile tip, where there is no out-of-plane failure, although there is still in-plane failure. In these thin zones without out-of-plane failure, the tangential (out-of-plane) stresses are relatively high due to large shear strains, formed during previous shearing or sliding of the soil...|$|R

Emphasis is given on the construction of neural interpretation diagram, based on the weights of the developed neural network model, to find out direct or inverse effect of input parameters on the output. A prediction model equation is established using the trained weights of the neural network model. The predictions from artificial neural network (ANN), and those from two other approaches, were compared with the laboratory model test results.

40|$|Eccentrically {{inclined}} load on {{a shallow}} strip foundation can {{be referred to}} as partially compensated when the line of load application on the foundation is inclined toward the center line of the foundation or reinforced when the line of load application on the foundation is inclined away from the center line. In a companion paper, Patra et al. (2012) provide model test results for a strip foundation on sand subjected to partially compensated type of loading. Laboratory model tests results for a strip foundation supported by sand and subjected to eccentrically inclined load in the reinforced mode are presented in this paper. The depth of the foundation was varied from zero to B (width of foundation) for these tests. The load eccentricity varied from 0. 05 B to 0. 15 B with load inclined from 0 ° to 20 ° with respect to the vertical. Based on the present model test results, an empirical reduction factor has been proposed to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity from the bearing capacity with <b>centric</b> vertical <b>loading...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cold formed {{sections}} can be {{optimized for}} different purposes {{and they are}} fairly inexpensive to produce in small series. They have an inherent weakness in their small torsional stiffness, which is unfavourable for columns. The solution presented here is to make closed section by adding a thin cover plate connected with self-tapping screws. It is here called a partially closed cross-section {{because it is not}} continuously and rigidly connected. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the efficiency of this solution by comparing the behaviour of partially closed and open cross-section. Four columns were tested within the project, two of them with <b>centric</b> axial <b>load</b> and two with eccentricities. Numerical analysis was performed using ABAQUS for establishing the influence of the cover plate on the critical load and the resistance. A good agreement between non-linear FEM and experiments were found. After this verification of the FE model a parametric study was carried out. Results of experiments and numerical analysis were compared with the predicted resistance by Eurocode 3, Part 1 - 3, and the Direct Strength Method.

40|$|Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) {{is one of}} the non-intrusive {{techniques}} recently being {{utilized for}} measuring soil displacement in geotechnical engineering. The work discussed in this paper focuses on the application of an image processing tool known as MatPIV, a freeware readily available to the general users. The test programmes involved measurement and visualization of the behavior of displaced soil under various type of loadings and sizes of the foundation plate. Prior to testing, validation test was performed to study on the validity of measurements produced by MatPIV by comparing its measurements with the actual. Boundary analysis was also performed to justify on the configuration chosen for the model box used in both validation and experimental set-ups. In addition, a set of 70 displacement data was also studied in the validation test and a further statistical analysis on the data showed an acceptable accuracy of 98. 8 % for the MatPIV analysis when compared to the actual measured displacement. Hence, further test programmes which consisted of various soil-structure interaction conditions were performed. This comprehensive analysis showed that the diameter of loading rods and the sizes of foundation plate do affect the behavior of soil displacement under <b>centric</b> structural <b>loading</b> and was shown successfully vi...|$|R
40|$|It is {{observed}} that Indian Railway network has several hundreds of bridges {{which are more}} than 100 years old {{and needs to be}} repaired or rehabilitated for normal services of Rails. The Railways bridges have been subjected to higher loads and speed which is concerning factors to the Designers of Railway Bridges. Hence, an attempt has been made through this study to assess the health of a bridge under normal and defect condition of bridge member. Through successful health monitoring, the performance of bridge can be monitored and catastrophic failure events can be prevented. This paper presents the damage assessment through Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of an under-slung railway bridge model, fabricated using aluminum material. The performance of bridge model has beenevaluated under <b>centric</b> and eccentric <b>loading</b> experimentally under normal and defective members and compared with theoretical performance of bridge model under same loadingcondition. Experimental and analytical results have been compared to evaluate the damage assessment which helps in understanding the performance of bridge structure...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory model {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on a strip footing resting over dry sand bed subjected to eccentrically inclined load in reinforced condition to determine the ultimate bearing capacity. Eccentrically inclined load on a strip footing {{can be referred to}} as partially compensated when the line of load application {{at the base of the}} footing is inclined toward the centerline of the foundation or reinforced when the line of load application is inclined away from the centerline. Based on the model load test results, a neural network model was developed to predict the reduction factor that will be used in computing the ultimate bearing capacity of an eccentrically inclined loaded strip footing. This reduction factor (RF) is the ratio of the ultimate bearing capacity of the footing subjected to an eccentrically inclined load to the ultimate bearing capacity of the footing subjected to a <b>centric</b> vertical <b>load.</b> A thorough sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the parameters affecting the reduction factor. Based on the weights of the developed neural network model, a neural interpretation diagram is developed to find out whether the input parameters have direct or inverse effect on the output. A prediction model equation is established using the trained weights of the neural network model. The results were compared with the developed empirical equation for the reduction factor (Patra et al., 2012 b). The ANN model results were found to be more accurate than the regression equation proposed by Patra et al. (2012 b) based on the laboratory model test data and the predictability was reasonably good...|$|R
40|$|Plastic anchors {{consist of}} a {{spreading}} sleeve made of plastic and a spreading element, which is usually made of steel. During installation the spreading element is driven into the plastic sleeve so that the plastic is pressed {{against the wall of}} the drilled hole. The installation of the spreading element can be realised by turning (screw-in anchor) or striking (nail-in anchor) motion. Plastic anchors usually fail in concrete by pulling the sleeve out of the drill hole. Therefore the frictional force between anchor sleeve and concrete considerably affects the anchor behavior. The frictional force of a plastic anchor results from the spreading force and the coefficient of friction between plastic sleeve and concrete. After an overview of the relevant properties of plastic (section 2) and the state-of-the- art of research in this field (section 3), the behavior of plastic anchors in uncracked and cracked concrete under various influence parameters is examined. Emphasis is placed on the interaction between the time-dependent spreading force and the coefficient of friction. In the investigation finite element studies, as well as experimental splitting force measurements and pullout tests were conducted. Additionally creep tests were performed to derive a criteria for failure of plastic anchors. The results of this work are valid for plastic sleeves of polyamide PA 6 or PA 66. Evaluation of the pullout tests according to ETAG (2000 / 1) clarify the safety level of plastic anchors. A design model is deduced from tests with groups of anchors under <b>centric</b> tensile <b>load</b> and from tests with plastic anchors at the edge of concrete specimens under transverse loading.

40|$|Columns have a {{supporting}} function. If there are additional requirements such as transparency of building materials, components of glass are used. In load-bearing members mainly glasses with laminated cross sections and viscoelastic interlayer (especially PVB) are used. These glass columns under axial compressive loads and possible horizontal shear loads are dimensioned against stability failure {{taking into account}} material specific properties of the glass and the interlayer. Normative rules for this are still lacking. This work is devoted developing of an appropriate analytical design method for the stability case buckling of monolithic and laminated glass columns. The basis of the design concept has already been established in the structural steel design calculation using European buckling curves {{as a function of}} non-dimensional slenderness. Considering the special features of glass (elastic structural behavior, high ratio of characteristic compressive strength to characteristic flexural strength) for thermally tempered monolithic glass columns structural design calculation are developed for concentric and eccentric compression loads and verified by experimental and numerical investigations. In addition, stability analysis for <b>centric</b> compressive <b>loads</b> in combination with bending are presented for selected load cases. The derivation of partial safety factors completes the design methods. Moreover the design method is extended to glass columns with laminated cross sections. For this purpose the temperature- and time-dependent composite action is considered by use of any shear modulus of the interlayer in the second-order stress equation and the analytically derived buckling curves. For combined loads of different duration, design equations are available taking into account both the combination of axial long-term and axial short-term pressure loads as well as the combination of axial long-term compressive and short-term vertical shear loads by using different shear moduli...|$|R
