50|$|Stewart {{represented}} domestic steel {{producers in}} a series of trade remedy cases that redefined U.S. <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> law practice and that resulted in voluntary export restraint agreements. In 1982, Stewart filed anti-dumping and <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> petitions for a major U.S. producer. These petitions were part {{of a large number of}} trade remedy cases brought by three groups of domestic steel producers at the same time. The petitions resulted in 93 preliminary <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> and antidumping investigations involving 9 steel product lines from 9 countries. The petitions were delivered in 494 boxes, contained an estimated 3 million pages and concerned imported carbon steel products with an estimated value of more than $1 billion. The petitions were later withdrawn in 1982 after the United States and the European Community reached an agreement limiting steel imports for three years. The agreement was later expanded in product coverage and extended through September 1989, and subsequently extended through March 1992.|$|E

During the 1970s, Stewart was involved in <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> cases on flat glass which affected the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 and the availability of judicial review for cases brought under the Act. Stewart was involved in numerous cases involving domestic steel producers in both the 1970s and 1980s. The result of these cases led to changes in U.S. <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> law practices. Throughout his career, he was quoted in numerous books and also gave government testimony on international trade matters.|$|E

While the DoC made this claim, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) believed that these Canadian imports did in fact hinder U.S. producers.

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the dispute is {{the claim that the}} Canadian lumber {{industry}} is unfairly subsidized by the federal and provincial governments. Specifically, most timber in Canada is owned by provincial governments. The price charged to harvest the timber (the [...] "stumpage fee") is set administratively rather than through a competitive auction, as is often the practice in the United States. The United States claims that the provision of government timber at below market prices constitutes an unfair subsidy.
