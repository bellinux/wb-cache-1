5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} he had {{achieved}} in Romania in 1940 {{with the help of}} his son-in-law, Berger had proposed to Himmler that the next recruiting sphere be the Volksdeutsche communities of Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia, which together contained about 1.5 million ethnic Germans. Little <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> further this proposal until mid-1941, by which time Yugoslavia had been overrun by the Axis, and Romania and Hungary had joined the pact. Immediately after the lightning-quick defeat of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Hausser was being pressed to accept Yugoslav Volksdeutsche into his renamed SS-Division-Reich, even before it was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Barbarossa. On his way back to Germany from Yugoslavia, Hausser had transited through Romania and gathered another 600 ethnic German volunteers who he smuggled out of the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} report, an outraged Hermann Göring demanded 'at the highest level' the {{transfer}} of the airmen to Luftwaffe control. Unknown to all airmen except Lamason, their execution had been scheduled for 26 October, if they remained at Buchenwald. News of the airmen's scheduled execution had been conveyed to Lamason by a German political prisoner, Eugen Kogon, who had a reliable contact within the camp administrative area. Lamason discussed the information at length with Yeo-Thomas, Burney and Robert and they concluded there was little that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> avert the mass execution. Lamason decided not to inform the airmen, but to keep this information to himself to keep morale high and in the slight hope the Luftwaffe would intervene in time. On the night of 19 October, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 airmen, including Lamason, were transferred from Buchenwald to Stalag Luft III by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} {{to assist in}} the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the initial entry into the Dardanelles, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. Gaulois was hit twice during this bombardment, but only one shell did any significant damage. It hit just above the waterline on the starboard bow and pushed in the armour plates below the waterline and opened up a hole through which water flooded in. Little <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> staunch the inflow and the ship's captain decided to head for the Rabbit Islands, north of Tenedos, where he could beach his ship for temporary repairs. Escorted by Charlemagne in case she foundered en route, Gaulois managed to reach the islands. After temporary repairs, the ship was refloated and sailed for Toulon, escorted by Suffren. They encountered heavy weather en route and emergency repairs had {{to be made in the}} Bay of Navarin. She made Toulon without further incident where the ship was refitted and extensively modified to improve her stability, returning to the Dardanelles in July.|$|E

50|$|Although {{plenty of}} water was at hand, the fire had too strong a hold and all that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> douse the {{buildings}} nearby to prevent a spread. Apart from a pig and a few fowls, there were no casualties, but damage amounted to £1,327.|$|R
25|$|Several other expeditions {{visited the}} ruins before Frans Blom of Tulane University in 1923, who made {{superior}} maps {{of both the}} main site and various previously neglected outlying ruins and filed a report for the Mexican government on recommendations on work that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> preserve the ruins.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 9 June 1979, a fire broke out inside the ride at {{approximately}} 10:15 pm. Due {{to a combination of}} low water pressure, under-staffing within the park, and inadequate coverage of the Ghost Train by the park's fire hose system, the fire was able to completely consume the ride. It took an hour to bring the fire under control, but it was extinguished before any significant damage <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> the adjacent River Caves and Big Dipper.|$|E

25|$|The former type {{of study}} is purely {{descriptive}} and {{cannot be used}} to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> investigate possible causal factors. These can include case control studies or prospective studies.

25|$|On 7 June 2013, British lawmakers {{concluded}} that BT {{should never have}} allowed the Chinese company access to the UK's critical communications network without ministerial oversight, saying they were 'deeply shocked' that BT did not inform government that they were allowing Huawei and ZTE, both foreign entities with ties to the Chinese military, unfettered access to critical national systems. Furthermore, ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure Chinese equipment and code was threat-free was entirely staffed by Huawei employees. Subsequently, parliamentarians confirmed that {{in case of an}} attack on the UK there was nothing at this point that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> stop Chinese infiltration attacking critical national infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|As the {{violence}} escalated, the Mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Peñaloza, sought {{to stop the}} shooting. The 53-year-old presidente municipal took a white handkerchief, tied it to his cane {{and ran into the}} streets of his city hoping to quell {{the violence}}. As US troops advanced into the streets of Nogales, Sonora, from their positions across the line, Presidente Peñaloza pleaded with the angry nogalenses to put down their weapons. Despite later accounts to the contrary by US military personnel (including Lt. Col. Herman), an official note from the US Consulate in Nogales, Sonora, confirmed that a shot “from the Arizona side” felled the Mexican mayor. The mortally wounded Peñaloza was dragged into a nearby pharmacy, “where nothing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> save him.” He died a half-hour later.|$|E
25|$|On 29 November 1952, U.S. President-elect Dwight D.

With the UN's acceptance of India's proposal for a Korean armistice, a cease-fire was established on 27 July 1953, by which time the front line was back around the 38th parallel, and so a demilitarised zone (DMZ) was established around it, defended by North Korean troops on one side and by South Korean, American and UN troops on the other. The DMZ runs north of the parallel towards the east, and to the south as it travels west. The site of the peace talks, Kaesong, the old capital of Korea, was part of the South before hostilities broke out but is currently a special city of the North. North Korea and the United States signed the , which Syngman Rhee refused to sign.|$|E
25|$|Future of the Vilnius Region caused {{frictions}} {{between political}} and military leaders in Lithuania. As first Soviet troops moved into Lithuania on November 14, the government, which included four generals, resigned. A new civilian cabinet, led by controversial Prime Minister Antanas Merkys, was formed on November 21. Lithuanians were careful to follow the treaty to a letter and not to give any excuses for Moscow to accuse them of treaty violations. At first, delayed by the Winter War, the Soviets did not interfere with Lithuania's domestic affairs and Soviet soldiers were well-behaved in their bases. The Lithuanian government started debating its options and what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prepare for the future occupation. Despite various resolutions, nothing material was accomplished. Lithuania had no counterweight to Soviet influence: its own forces were small, Germany was in effect Russia's ally, Poland was conquered, France and Great Britain had bigger issues in western Europe. After the Winter War was over, Soviet Union turned its attention to the Baltic States.|$|E

25|$|Jerry and Charlie O'Connell {{left the}} series to pursue film careers, and because Jerry was denied an {{executive}} producer credit on the series. When he left, they informed Charlie {{that they would}} no longer require him either. The brothers leaving the show upset many fans and Tracy Tormé was asked what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> win them back. This resulted in an unsuccessful effort to bring back some popular previously recurring characters. The producers negotiated with John Novak (Ross J. Kelly, the ambulance-chasing lawyer), Alex Bruhanski (Pavel Kurlienko, the taxi driver) and Lester Barrie (Elston Diggs the waiter at the Chandler Hotel) for their return in season five. Zoe McLellan (Logan St. Clair) was scheduled to appear again and Jason Gaffney (Conrad Bennish, Jr) from season one was confirmed for four episodes including the season finale. However, none of these guest stars appeared. Why Bennish didn't appear in the fifth season {{is one of the}} biggest behind-the-scenes mysteries of the show.|$|E
25|$|In July 1975, Fernandes {{arrived in}} Baroda. There, he met Kirit Bhatt, who was {{president}} of Baroda Union of Journalists, and Vikram Rao, a staff correspondent of The Times of India at Baroda, both who opposed the Emergency. They used to meet and discuss on what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> topple the autocratic Indira Gandhi Government. An industrialist friend, Viren J. Shah, managing director of Mukand Ltd., helped them find contacts for procuring dynamite, used extensively in quarries around Halol (near Baroda). They aimed at blowing up toilets in government offices and cause explosions near the venue of public meetings {{to be addressed by}} Indira Gandhi. The idea was not to injure anybody, but only create a scare. The explosions were to be carried out either late in the night or hours before the public meeting was to begin to avoid injury. A plan was hatched to blow up a dais four hours before Indira Gandhi was to address a meeting in Varanasi. The conspiracy later {{came to be known as}} the infamous Baroda dynamite case.|$|E
25|$|As {{everything}} {{had been done to}} help the passengers, and when nothing else <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> save them, Mr Russell and people from all over Kilkee took in survivors from the disaster for the night. The next morning the extent of the disaster became apparent with bodies and wreckage strewn across the whole beach. As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed up on the beach and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it. In the end over £300 was raised, all going to the survivors and to the next of kin of the dead. As Ireland {{was in the middle of}} a famine, many poor people looted the ship, with some going as far as stripping the clothes from the dead.|$|E

A number of examples of flexible working are examined and the implications of each for union membership and influence are outlined.

25|$|Jellicoe {{continued}} {{to take a}} pessimistic view, advising the War Policy Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1917) during planning meetings for the Third Ypres Offensive in June and July that nothing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> defeat the U-boats. However, removing Jellicoe in July, as Lloyd George wanted, would have been politically impossible given Conservative anger at the return of Churchill (still blamed for the Dardanelles) to office as Minister of Munitions. In August and September Lloyd George was preoccupied with Third Ypres and the possible transfer of resources to Italy, whilst the new First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Eric Campbell Geddes, was reforming the Naval Staff (including creating a post for Wemyss as Deputy First Sea Lord). Geddes and Lloyd George met with Balfour and Carson (both former First Lords of the Admiralty) on 26 October to discuss sacking Jellicoe after {{he had failed to}} act on “secret, but absolutely reliable” information about a German attack on a Norwegian convoy, but again nothing came of this as Lloyd George was soon preoccupied by the Battle of Caporetto and the setting up of the Supreme War Council. Geddes wanted to return to his previous job in charge of military transportation in France, and by December it was clear that Lloyd George would have to sack Jellicoe or lose Geddes.|$|E
