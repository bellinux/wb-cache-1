5000|$|Scott in 1903 used a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> <b>drive</b> {{to connect}} a tractor to other devices, an early example of {{versatility}} in this area. In 1904 at Perth a demonstration was held of three practical farming tasks, with a Scott motor and an Ivel motor designed by Dan Albone. In 1905 the Scientific American Supplement carried an article [...] "The Scott Gasoline-Motor-Propelled Agricultural Tractor". Photographs showed a rotary cultivator with a seed drill attached, and the [...] "motor tractor and plowing engine". Power {{was provided by}} a 24 hp four-cylinder Aster engine.|$|E
40|$|In the {{investigation}} of this problem the {{major part of the}} time was spent in the construction, erection and adaptation of the required equipment to incineration of waste liquor. A great deal of space could be filled describing the various mechanical difficulties encountered; for example, considerable time was spent in attempting to adapt a belt and pulley auxiliary drive mechanism to rotate the furnace. This was eventually scrapped and a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> <b>drive</b> used. It is deemed advisable, however, to omit such descriptive details from this treatise, as they would be uninteresting and of minor value to future readers. [ [...] . ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>drive</b> uses <b>sprockets</b> <b>and</b> {{a roller}} <b>chain,</b> which {{requires}} both lubrication and adjustment for elongation (stretch) that occurs through wear. The lubricant {{is subject to}} being thrown off the fast-moving <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> results in grime and dirt build up. <b>Chains</b> do deteriorate, <b>and</b> excessive wear on the front <b>and</b> rear <b>sprockets</b> can be dangerous. In a chain drive the power is transmitted into the real wheel via a cush drive. Conventional roller chain drives suffer the potential for vibration, as the effective radius of action in a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> combination constantly changes during revolution ("chordal action"). If a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> rotates at constant RPM, then the <b>chain</b> (<b>and</b> the <b>driven</b> <b>sprocket)</b> must accelerate <b>and</b> decelerate constantly. Most chain-driven motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to eliminate this vibration issue.|$|R

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{integrated approach}} to the testing and comparison of motorcycle drive chain lubricants is presented. This is a novel way of testing the lubrication by using loaded operating <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets.</b> A test rig {{has been designed to}} operate <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> in a clean environment and allow direct comparison between different lubricants. The advantage of this method over previous techniques is that it allows the differentiation of lubricants in a more controlled operating environment and evaluates the overall lubricant performance as opposed to individual properties. The lubricants tested were a wax spray, PTFE spray and drip fed light oil. The test rig allowed measurement of the power saved by the lubricant in running the <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets.</b> <b>Chain</b> length <b>and</b> component masses were also taken before and after running the <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> under load on the test rig. The results clearly show that any lubricant is preferable to none. The drip fed oil provided the greatest power saving and wear protection between the <b>chain</b> rollers <b>and</b> pins and the spray lubricants provided the highest level of protection between rollers <b>and</b> <b>sprockets...</b>|$|R

50|$|Eventually, Red Star {{was put on}} the run between Sicamous, British Columbia and Enderby, British Columbia. However, {{she drew}} too much water, so R. P. Rithet had a flat-bottomed, scow-shaped {{stern-wheeler}} of light draft built, where he placed Red Star's machinery. The machinery was not suitable for a stern-wheeler, so the paddle wheel had to be <b>driven</b> with a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> wheel. <b>and</b> to overcome the difficulty the paddle wheel was <b>driven</b> with a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> wheel. This vessel became known as Red Star No. 2 and thus, the original Red Star's long and varied career ended.|$|R

50|$|Motorcycle {{chains are}} part of the drive train to {{transmit}} the motor power to the back wheel. Properly lubricated chains can reach an efficiency of 98% or greater in the transmission.

5000|$|This {{progression}} {{has provided}} more fine adjustment of gear ratio, however {{the use of}} thinner metal parts has {{had the effect of}} shortening the life-span of the <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> due to so called [...] "stretching" [...] of the chain. This is caused by frictional abrasion of the load-bearing surfaces of the chain causing elongation. As such, the <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> of a nine-speed system require more frequent replacement than an eight. The narrowing of the hub flanges has created more dish in the wheel, which weakens the wheel if all other factors are the same, but improvements in the strength and reliability of spokes and rims has more than balanced this out, and wheel strength is generally higher despite the increased dish.|$|R

50|$|In November 2007, the G450X sport enduro {{motorcycle}} {{was launched}} using a 450 cc single-cylinder engine. The G450X contained several technological improvements over the Japanese off-road racing motorcycles {{but the most}} unusual and significant {{was the use of}} a single pivot point for the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> <b>and</b> the swing arm. This unusual configuration allowed for a very tense drive chain with no slop and eliminated acceleration squat. The former benefit saves on <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> wear <b>and</b> the latter allows for a more consistent drive geometry and fully available rear suspension travel during heavy acceleration.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} unique nature, beach races {{tend to be}} very popular with riders and spectators, with some of the larger races {{attracting}} several hundred riders. However beach racing is known to be very tough on motorcycles, small sand particles can damage wheel bearings, <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets,</b> <b>and</b> the soft, sandy surface increases the demand on engines and clutches. Experienced beach racers typically follow meticulous bike maintenance prior to the event in order to ensure their bike will not fail.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the realm}} of 16 mm cameras, Michel Coutant at Éclair was working with Brault and Rouch's input to create prototypes that {{eventually}} led to the self-blimped Eclair 16 (also known as the Eclair NPR or Eclair Coutant [...] ), the first successful lightweight sync-sound movie camera. History of the collaboration of Brault with Éclair is told here (in French) http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/article.php3?id_article=162#nh15. The design included a camera magazine which not only was back-mounted specifically to distribute a more balanced camera weight across the shoulder for hand-holding, but also included a built-in pressure plate <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> <b>drive,</b> which allowed cameras to be reloaded in seconds — a crucial feature for vérité documentaries.|$|R

50|$|The {{first version}} of the {{mechanism}} has a chain around two sprockets on which are mounted bending rollers. Each bending roller {{is attached to a}} cam which rides along another inclined face to move the roller along the protruding surface of the cane to complete bending it around the die. In the second version, the <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> are replaced by a wheel on which the bending rollers are mounted.|$|R
50|$|In other words, {{conventional}} {{roller chain}} drives suffer {{the potential for}} vibration, as the effective radius of action in a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> combination constantly changes during revolution ("Chordal action"). If the chain moves at constant speed, then the shafts must accelerate and decelerate constantly. If one sprocket rotates at a constant speed, then the <b>chain</b> (<b>and</b> probably all other <b>sprockets</b> that it <b>drives)</b> must accelerate and decelerate constantly. This is usually not an issue with many drive systems; however, most motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to virtually eliminate this vibration issue. Toothed belt drives are designed to avoid this issue by operating at a constant pitch radius.|$|R

50|$|A gear case, {{also known}} as a chain case or chainguard, is an {{enclosure}} for the bicycle <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> assemblages commonly employed by utility bicycles.

It may also contain an oil bath to keep the chain lubricated. Modern examples are usually moulded in plastic. Similar devices may be found in connection with chains used on larger vehicles and machinery.|$|R
