50|$|Based on {{a survey}} of >800, {{surgical}} removal of the entire involved kidney plus the peri-renal fat appeared curative {{for the majority of}} all types of mesoblastic nephroma; the patient overall survival rate was 94%. Of the 4% of non-survivors, half were due to surgical or chemotherapeutic treatments. Another 4% of these patients suffered relapses, primarily in the local area of surgery rare <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>relapse</b> due to lung or bone metastasis.. About 60% of these recurrent cases had a complete remission following further treatment. Recurrent disease was treated with a second surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy that often vincristine and actinomycin treatment. Removal of the entire afflicted kidney plus the peri-renal fat appears critical to avoiding local recurrences. In general, patients who were older than 3 months of age at diagnosis or had the cellular form of the disease, stage III disease, or involvement of renal lymph nodes had a higher recurrence rate. Among patients with these risk factors, only those with lymph node involvement are recommended for further therapy.|$|E

50|$|There are no {{well known}} and settled {{treatments}} for O. gallopava infection yet. So far, the most effective treatment is early diagnosis of the infection. Also, antifungal drug therapy and surgical excision {{can be used to}} treat the infection separately or together. O. gallopava infection treatment widely use antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B, itraconazole, triazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, and many others. Also, surgical excision can play a role in treatment of O. gallopava infection. This method is useful to remove lesions formed in the affected organ due to phaeohyphomycosis. Surgical resection is especially recommended for removal of CNS lesions. However, both antifungal drugs and surgical excision do not guarantee the perfect cure; there are some reported <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>relapse</b> of the disease. These drugs and surgical methods are the most effective when the fungus is yet disseminated into the brain. Survival rate of the infection varies among individuals depending on the locations of fungus dissemination.

However, if the infection is spread throughout the body including the brain, the mortality is 66%.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{randomised}} trials {{demonstrated that}} adjuvant radiation therapy (aRT) improves cancer control {{in patients with}} pT 3 prostate cancer (PCa). However, there is currently no evidence supporting early salvage radiation therapy (eSRT) as equivalent to aRT in improving freedom from biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate BCR-free survival for aRT versus observation followed by eSRT in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>relapse</b> in patients undergoing RP for pT 3 pN 0, R 0 -R 1 PCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a European multi-institutional cohort, 890 men with pT 3 pN 0, R 0 -R 1 PCa were identified. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent RP. Subsequently, patients were stratified into two groups: aRT versus initial observation followed by eSRT in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>relapse.</b> OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Propensity-matched analysis was employed, and patients were stratified into two groups: aRT versus observation and eventual eSRT, defined as RT given at a postoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 0. 5 ng/ml at least 6 mo after RP. BCR, defined as PSA > 0. 20 ng/ml and rising after administration of RT, was compared between aRT and initial observation followed by eSRT in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>relapse</b> using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 390 (43. 8 %) and 500 (56. 2 %) patients were treated with aRT and initial observation, respectively. Within the latter group, 225 (45. 0 %) patients experienced BCR and underwent eSRT. In the postpropensity-matched cohort, the 2 - and 5 -yr BCR-free survival rates were 91. 4 % and 78. 4 % in aRT versus 92. 8 % and 81. 8 % in patients who underwent initial observation and eSRT in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>relapse,</b> respectively (p= 0. 9). No differences in the 2 - and 5 -yr BCR-free survival rates were found, even when patients were stratified according to pT 3 substage and surgical margin status (all p ≥ 0. 4). These findings were also confirmed in multivariable analyses (p= 0. 6). Similar results were achieved when the cut-off to define eSRT was set at 0. 3 ng/ml (all p ≥ 0. 5). CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that timely administration of eSRT is comparable to aRT in improving BCR-free survival {{in the majority of}} pT 3 pN 0 PCa patients. Therefore, eSRT may not compromise cancer control but significantly reduces overtreatment associated with aRT. Copyright © 2012 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B. V.

30|$|Currently, most authors suggest {{conservative}} {{treatment for}} clubfoot, restricting the indication for surgery {{in cases of}} recurrent or resistant deformity [23 – 28]. In newborns, conservative treatment with the Ponseti method is effective in most cases with {{a high rate of}} good results [29]. Besides manipulation and casting, minimally invasive surgery consisting of percutaneous Achilles tenotomy, as reported in the literature, very often completes the Ponseti method; in our series all cases but one were treated with this technique. In cases of severe or recurrent equinus, as well as in older children, a greater Achilles retraction could be suspected together with ankle and subtalar joint stiffness. In these cases we assumed that percutaneous Achilles tenotomy alone could not obtain satisfactory correction; hence, a little more extensive surgery was performed in some cases. Some authors also suggest performing percutaneous Achilles tendon section in ambulating children and in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>relapse</b> of equinus while others advise open lengthening or use of percutaneous incisions as described by Hoke [30 – 32]. We preferred to perform open Achilles tendon lengthening in older children or in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>relapse</b> of the equinus in order to also appreciate the possible tightness of the ankle and subtalar joints and then perform a posterior release of these joints along with tendon lengthening.|$|E
