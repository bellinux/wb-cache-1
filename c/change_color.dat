5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes <b>change</b> <b>color</b> every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick. The player {{controls}} Q*bert, who starts each game {{at the top of}} a pyramid made of 28 cubes, and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to <b>change</b> <b>color,</b> and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} coating able to <b>change</b> <b>color</b> {{was tested}} on Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide {{was applied to}} the hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E
50|$|Indicator: A {{substance}} that <b>changes</b> <b>color</b> {{in response to}} a chemical change. An acid-base indicator (e.g., phenolphthalein) <b>changes</b> <b>color</b> depending on the pH. Redox indicators are also used. A drop of indicator solution is added to the titration at the beginning; the endpoint has been reached when the <b>color</b> <b>changes.</b>|$|R

A drop of indicator solution is added to the titration at the start; when the <b>color</b> <b>changes</b> the endpoint has been reached, this is an approximation of the equivalence point.|$|R
5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not <b>change</b> <b>color</b> when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and <b>change</b> <b>color</b> as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore <b>change</b> <b>color</b> in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not <b>change</b> <b>color.</b> Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction {{but it has a}} different color and is not hairy at the margin of the cap. L.flavidus has a yellowish cap but does not have a hairy margin.|$|E
5|$|The {{orange and}} brown {{coloration}} {{in the clouds}} of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that <b>change</b> <b>color</b> when {{they are exposed to}} ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons. These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.|$|E
5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks that line the wall. One all of the bricks <b>change</b> <b>color,</b> the player moves to the next level. Some bricks are power-ups that change the larger ball's size or add extra small balls into play. Players who hit flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball {{through a hole in}} the wall ends the game.|$|E

5|$|Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies {{strongly}} with temperature {{can be used}} as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials <b>change</b> <b>color</b> when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy, which {{involves the use of}} coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the leaf beetles (family Chrysomelidae) or weevils. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the ability to <b>change</b> <b>color</b> as their surroundings shift (B. scabrinota, T. californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (catalepsy), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators.|$|E
25|$|A rash may be {{localized}} in {{one part}} of the body, or affect all the skin. Rashes may cause the skin to <b>change</b> <b>color,</b> itch, become warm, bumpy, chapped, dry, cracked or blistered, swell, and may be painful.|$|E

25|$|Following the harvest, {{the vines}} {{continues}} {{the process of}} photosynthesis, creating carbohydrate reserves to store in the vine's roots and trunks. It will continue doing this until an appropriate level of reserves have been stored. At that point the chlorophyll in the leaves begin to break down and the leaves <b>change</b> <b>color</b> from green to yellow. Following the first frost the leaves begin to fall as the vine starts to enter its winter dormancy period. The following spring, the cycle begins again.|$|E
25|$|Same Language Subtitling (SLS) {{is the use}} of Synchronized Captioning of Musical Lyrics (or any {{text with}} an Audio/Video/ source) as a Repeated Reading {{activity}}. The basic reading activity involves students viewing a short subtitled presentation projected onscreen, while completing a response worksheet. To be really effective, the subtitling should have high quality synchronization of audio and text, and better yet, subtitling should <b>change</b> <b>color</b> in syllabic synchronization to audio model, and the text should be at a level to challenge students' language abilities.|$|E
