50|$|In {{the sport}} {{not only is}} skill {{required}} but {{you also need to}} use the right equipment. When competing you will need a few basic items: <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saws,</b> bow saws, axes, peaveies, foot and leg protection, and climbing gear for the pole climb.|$|R
60|$|The noise {{at night}} {{would have been}} {{annoying}} to me ordinarily, but I didn't mind it in the present circumstances, because it kept me from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day's cripples. They ruined an uncommon good old <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw</b> for me, and broke the saw-buck, too, but I let it pass.

60|$|From {{time to time}} as {{the weather}} permitted, father had been cutting and hauling maple and hickory logs from the forests of the Cedar River, and these logs must now be made into stove-wood and piled for summer use. Even before the school term ended we began to take a hand at this work, after four o'clock and on Saturdays. While the hired man and father ran the <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw,</b> whose {{pleasant}} song had much of the seed-time suggestion which vibrated in the caw-caw of the hens as they burrowed in the dust of the chip-yard, I split the easy blocks and my brother helped to pile the finished product.|$|E

60|$|Brooke {{smiled a}} little, {{for he had}} of late been almost {{astonished}} at his growing interest in his work. Of scientific engineering he knew nothing, though he remembered that several relatives of his had made their mark at it, but every man who lives {{any time in the}} bush of the Pacific slope of necessity acquires some skill with axe and <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw,</b> besides a working acquaintance with the principles of construction. Wooden houses, bridges, dams, must be built, and now and then a wagon road underpinned with redwood logs along the side of a precipice. He had done his share of such work, but he had, it seemed, of late become endued with a boldness of conception and clearness of insight into the best means of overcoming the difficulties to be faced, which had now and then astonished those who assisted him.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} they had reached the {{platform}} of the damaged saw-mill, and Bob pointed out, with elaborate care, {{the details of the}} mill in all its minute particulars, commenting specially on {{the fact that most of}} the telling improvements on it were due to the fertile brain and inventive genius of Tim Lumpy. He also explained the different kinds of saws--the ripping saw, and the <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw,</b> and the circular saw, and the eccentric saw--just as if his mother were an embryo mill-wright, for he felt that she took a deep interest in it all, and Mrs Frog listened with the profound attention of a civil engineer, and remarked on everything with such comments as--oh! indeed! ah! well now! ain't it wonderful? amazin'! an' you made it all too! Oh! Bobby!--and other more or less appropriate phrases.|$|E
25|$|There {{was only}} one place, about {{one-half}} mile upstream {{from the mouth of}} the river, where Winema might be turned, and in the process, Winema became wedged sideways between the river banks. It became necessary to excavate a bay in the bank of the river, using hay knives and <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saws</b> to cut the sod, before Winema could be turned. This took almost 3 full days.|$|R

50|$|Land for {{the lakes}} was {{acquired}} in 1934 and 1935 through the Great Depression-era Resettlement Administration. The {{site for the}} lakes was chosen in a low area that contained the three tributaries: Caney Creek (which crosses the Lewisville Road), Cow Creek, and Butler Creek. The dredging of the lakes was undertaken by primitive methods, with trees leveled by <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saws.</b> Plow mules were used to remove the dirt. The soil was placed on dirt sleds as the mules slowly pulled away the debris.|$|R
60|$|He treated his negroes with kindness; {{attended}} to their comforts; was particularly careful {{of them in}} sickness; but never tolerated idleness, and exacted a faithful performance of all their allotted tasks. He had a quick eye at calculating each man's capabilities. An entry in his diary gives a curious instance of this. Four of his negroes, employed as carpenters, were hewing and shaping timber. It appeared to him, in noticing {{the amount of work}} accomplished between two succeeding mornings, that they loitered at their labor. Sitting down quietly he timed their operations; how long it took them to get their <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw</b> and other implements ready; how long to clear away the branches from the trunk of a fallen tree; how long to hew and saw it; what time was expended in considering and consulting, and after all, how much work was effected during the time he looked on. From this he made his computation how much they could execute {{in the course of a}} day, working entirely at their ease.|$|E
60|$|We {{shook off}} our wrappings {{and entered the}} long lamp-lit hall, partly dazed by the sudden glare and warmth after the intense cold. It {{certainly}} was different from anything I had seen at home, for here in place of paint and gilding the decoration was {{in harmony with the}} country, bizarre and bountiful, with a beauty that was distinctly its own. Few oat-heads grown from English furrows might compare with the pale golden tassels that drooped in graceful festoons from the wall, while among the ruddier wheat-ears and bearded barley, antelope heads peeped out beside the great horns of caribou which the owner of Lone Hollow had shot in the muskegs of the north. Rifles and bright double-bitted axes of much the same pattern as those with which our forbears hewed through Norman mail caught the light of the polished brass lamps and flashed upon the wainscot, while even an odd <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw</b> had been skillfully impressed into the scheme of ornamentation. But there was nothing pinchbeck or tawdry about them. Whirled high by sinewy hands, or clenched in hard brown fingers while a steady eye stared down the barrel, that a bridge might span a ravine where no bridge had been, or venison help to cut down the grocery bill and leave the more for the breaking of virgin soil, that steel had played its part in the opening up of a wide country. Yet, the suggestion of strict utility even enhanced its effectiveness, and I remembered with a smile the trophies of weapons stamped out by the gross in Birmingham which I had seen adorning our suburban villas at home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right, Mr Charles," [...] said Jacques, in an {{approving}} tone, [...] "quite right. I {{holds that}} a man should always attend to what he's at, an' to nothin' else. I've lived long in the woods now, and that fact {{becomes more and more}} sartin every day. I've know'd chaps, now, as timersome as settlement girls, that were always in such a mortal funk about what was to happen, or might happen, that they were never fit for anything that did happen; always lookin' ahead, and never around them. Of coorse, I don't mean {{that a man}} shouldn't look ahead at all, but their great mistake was that they looked out too far ahead, and always kep' their eyes nailed there, just as if they had the fixin' o' everything, an' Providence had nothin' to do with it at all. I mind a Canadian o' that sort that travelled in company with me once. We were goin' just as we are now, Mr Charles, two canoes of us--him and a comrade in one, and me and a comrade in t'other. One night we got to a lot o' rapids that came one after another for the matter o' three miles or thereabouts. They were all easy ones, however, except the last; but it was a tickler, with a sharp turn o' the land that hid it from sight till ye were right into it, with a foamin' current, and a range o' ragged rocks that stood straight in front o' ye, like the teeth of a <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw.</b> It was easy enough, however, if a man knew it, and was a cool hand. Well, the pauvre Canadian was in a terrible takin' about this shoot long afore he came to it. He had run it often enough in boats where he was one of a half-dozen men, and had nothin' to do but look on; but he had never steered down it before. When he came to the top o' the rapids, his mind was so filled with this shoot that he couldn't attend to nothin', and scraped agin' a dozen rocks in almost smooth water, so that when he got little more than half-way down, the canoe was as rickety as if it had just come off a six months' cruise. At last we came to the big rapid, and after we'd run down our canoe I climbed the bank to see them do it. Down they came, the poor Canadian white as a sheet, and his comrade, who was brave enough, but knew nothin' about light craft, not very comfortable. At first he could see nothin' for the point, but in another moment round they went, end on, for the big rocks. The Canadian gave a great yell when he saw them, and plunged at the paddle till I thought he'd have capsized altogether. They ran it well enough, straight between the rocks (more by good luck than good guidance), and sloped down to the smooth water below; but the canoe had got such a battering in the rapids above, where an Injin baby could have steered it in safety, that the last plunge shook it all to pieces. It opened up, and lay down flat on the water; while the two men fell right through the bottom, screechin' like mad, and rolling about among shreds o' birch-bark!" ...|$|E

50|$|When Charles E. Lewis {{decided he}} needed a large barn for his large herd of cattle and hogs, he thought outside the box, so to speak. Having heard about three round barns built around 1900 for the College of Agriculture at the University of Illinois, he was intrigued. The {{efficiency}} of the round barn's structure is what impressed Lewis, but he didn't need the university's barns - {{he needed a}} much larger barn. His mind began to build {{a vision of a}} barn that was much larger than any round barn built in the Midwest, at the time. He selected 40 acre of timbered land from the 160 acre Grove Place, a recent acquisition of his father's estate. The land was thick with large elm and oak trees, as well as other native Illinois tree species. Lewis built a portable sawmill at the site and hired several men to log the land with <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saws</b> and axes, while also working the logs into lumber and piling them to air dry. This occurred during the fall and continued well into the winter of 1911.|$|R
5000|$|Johnston {{was still}} {{the owner of the}} Mount Molloy sawmill when it burnt down on 31 January 1934, William J Santowski being the manager at the time. It was {{reported}} that [...] "One 350 h.p. boiler was in the destroyed building, also one Sandycroft steam engine; one twin circular log breaking down plant, four saw benches, one planing machine, saw-dust carriers, belting, shafting and pulleys and other tools of various descriptions, 29 circular saws, one log rolling winch, two saw sharpening machines, three <b>cross-cut</b> <b>sawing</b> machines". However, the employees were able to protect the boiler, main engines and pumping plant from serious damage. There were also two other planing machines in a separate building that was not destroyed. Prior to the fire Johnston had purchased machinery for a new sawmill at Shipton's Flat near Cooktown, and after the fire he placed some of the machinery at Mount Molloy. He claimed that the latter was a paying proposition and a very essential part of his organisation. It was also essential to have the mill at Mount Molloy, as most hardwood supplies came from there.|$|R
60|$|The {{reason for}} its {{peculiar}} appearance above the roof touches upon rather delicate ground. How shall I reveal that, forasmuch {{as many years}} ago the original gable roof of the old house had become very leaky, a temporary proprietor hired a band of woodmen, with their huge, <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saws,</b> and went to sawing the old gable roof clean off. Off it went, with all its birds' nests, and dormer windows. It was replaced with a modern roof, more fit for a railway wood-house than an old country gentleman's abode. This operation--razeeing the structure some fifteen feet--was, in effect upon the chimney, something like the falling of the great spring tides. It left uncommon low water all about the chimney--to abate which appearance, the same person now proceeds to slice fifteen feet off the chimney itself, actually beheading my royal old chimney--a regicidal act, which, {{were it not for}} the palliating fact that he was a poulterer by trade, and, therefore, hardened to such neck-wringings, should send that former proprietor down to posterity in the same cart with Cromwell.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{cultures}} developed {{two main}} types of saw teeth: the 'cross cut' saw teeth and the 'rip' saw teeth. These {{cut into the}} wood using different mechanisms. Wood is composed of many long cells running length-ways. Thus, crosscut saws have sawteeth that are usually shaped, often with a metal file, {{in such a way}} that they form a series of tiny knifelike edges.The wood cells are contacted by the knife-edge of the tooth and cut. Rip saws, on the other hand, are usually shaped so that they form a series of tiny chisel-like edges. The wood cells are contacted by the chisel and 'ripped' apart from the bundle of other cells. It is common that people do not recognize the difference and use saws both ways. However, a rip saw is much faster than a <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw</b> when cutting with the grain but leaves a very rough cut, often with splinters on the surface, and has more difficulty maintaining a straight cut when cutting across the grain. The <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw</b> can cut in any direction but is much slower than needs be when cutting with the grain.|$|E
50|$|In 1757, a French {{officer was}} {{executed}} by his {{men in a}} mutiny on Cat Island in current-day Mississippi. Three of the mutineers were eventually captured and brought to New Orleans for trial. After conviction, two of the mutineers died on the French wheel. The last mutineer, a Swiss from the Karrer regiment, was allegedly, nailed into a coffin-shaped wooden box, and it was sawed into with a <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saw.</b> This claim of a Swiss being sawed in two was first made by the French captain and traveller Jean Bernard Bossu in his 1768 Nouveaux Voyages aux Indes Occidentales, translated into English by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1771.|$|E

5000|$|The brothers’ {{partnership}} did {{not survive}} and in 1834 William sold out to Harvey, who carried on as the Harvey Mann Axe Co. Another brother, Stephen, would join Harvey, but illness limited his involvement. Upon Harvey’s death in 1870, he was succeeded by a son, Harvey Jr., but a railroad accident in 1875 resulted in the son’s early death at age 37. Factory supervision was transferred to J. Fearon Mann, a nephew and a son of William Jr., through a lease with Jane Burnside Mann, the widow of Harvey Sr. [...] Business slowed in the 1880s as use of <b>cross-cut</b> <b>saws</b> expanded. Around this time, steampower was added, [...] and J. Fearon patented (no. D-2961) the “Red Mann” axe brand. [...] However, in 1890 a “monopoly-trust” movement swept the country and - as described below - consolidation included the axe industry. American Axe and Tool Co. purchased the factory and in Oct 1892 after 64 years of operation, it was closed. [...] Today, a few structures remain as reminders of past activities. Axemann Spring still flows and Mann Road crosses the creek opposite the spring. A shed at the crossing {{was part of the}} factory. A large stone house, Mann’s Edgefonte, sits near the spring house. Nearby stands the United Methodist Church, built in 1882 and paid for by Mrs. Mann as tribute to her late husband.|$|R

Large {{rough-hewn}} blocks were transported on horse-drawn drays to the River Nore a short distance away, then onto small river floats or barges and brought about 3 kilometers down-river to Milmount where it was worked. A weir on the river provided water to drive reciprocating, <b>cross-cut</b> type, <b>saws</b> to cut the larger blocks into the finished shapes required for the market. The saws were actually steel bands, about four meters long. Sand {{was used as an}} abrasive cutting agent.|$|R
