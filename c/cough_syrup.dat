40|$|The {{treatment}} {{and management of}} acute cough due to common cold costs {{billions of dollars of}} healthcare expenditure and there is a growing opinion that a simple linctus containing glycerol with flavourings such as honey and lemon is a safe and effective treatment for acute cough in children and adults. Glycerol is a component of most <b>cough</b> <b>syrups,</b> and although it is often thought of only as a solvent or thickening agent in <b>cough</b> <b>syrups,</b> it may be a major component for the efficacy of <b>cough</b> <b>syrups</b> due to its special properties of lubrication, demulcency, sweetness, and acting as a humectant. The major benefit of <b>cough</b> <b>syrups</b> in soothing <b>cough</b> is likely due to the properties of the syrup rather than the active ingredients and this review discusses the special properties of glycerol in relation to the treatment of acute cough...|$|R

25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{dextromethorphan}} {{became available}} in an over-the-counter tablet form by {{the brand name}} Romilar. In 1973, Romilar {{was taken off the}} shelves after a burst in sales because of frequent misuse, and was replaced by <b>cough</b> <b>syrup</b> in an attempt to cut down on abuse. The advent of widespread internet access in the 1990s allowed users to rapidly disseminate information about DXM, and online discussion groups formed around use and acquisition of the drug. As early as 1996, DXM HBr powder could be purchased in bulk from online retailers, allowing users to avoid consuming DXM in syrup preparations. As of January 1, 2012, dextromethorphan is prohibited for sale to minors in the state of California, except with a doctor's prescription.|$|E
25|$|In April 2003, British Army Major Charles Ingram, {{his wife}} Diana, and college {{lecturer}} Tecwen Whittock {{were convicted of}} using fraudulent means to win £1 million on the UK version of the show when Ingram was a contestant on the show in September 2001. The allegation was that when Tarrant asked a question, Whittock, one of that episode's nine other Fastest Finger First contestants, would cough to guide Ingram to the correct answer. Ingram won the £1 million top prize, but members of the production staff raised suspicions over Whittock's coughing along with the Ingrams' behaviour after the recording, and the police were called in to investigate. The defence claimed that Whittock simply suffered from allergies; however, all three were found guilty and given suspended sentences. After the trial, ITV aired a documentary about the scandal, along with Ingram's entire game, complete with Whittock's coughing sounds. As a joke, Benylin <b>cough</b> <b>syrup</b> paid to have the first commercial shown during the programme's commercial break.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cough</b> <b>syrups</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{developing}} world, but safety of their use in infants and children {{less than two years}} has not been well documented. Some syrups contain multiple combinations of such drugs as promethazine, diphenhydramine and ephedrine; which are individually now contraindicated in children less than two years. Despite this, the syrups are available as over the counter drugs and may be dispensed to mothers who are unaware of the potentially hazardous effects to their infants. A descriptive cross-sectional study was used to investigate suitability of <b>cough</b> <b>syrups</b> sold within Eldoret municipality for use in children less than two years of age based on their formulations and available literature. Two semi-structured questionnaires were administered to pharmacy attendants and mothers attending sick child clinic at a referral hospital to establish whether <b>cough</b> <b>syrups</b> containing more than one active ingredient of compounds, now contraindicated in children are administered to infants, and awareness of potential serious adverse effects. Data from labeled contents of <b>cough</b> <b>syrups</b> from retail pharmacies was recorded and corroborated with information from literature to determine those deemed to contain the ingredients. The second questionnaire was administered to mothers with children less than two years to ascertain whether they had used the identified syrups. A total of 260 mothers and 55 pharmacy attendants were interviewed. There was widespread use of the syrups in children, including infants, with 192 (74 %) of the respondents having used identified syrups and over 90 % of these on children less than 2 years including those less than three months. 146 (76 %) mothers had administered the syrup at double the recommended dose. The regulatory authorities should make concerted efforts to discourage use of <b>cough</b> <b>syrups</b> containing ingredients that pose adverse events to infants, including campaigns to educate pharmacy workers and mothers...|$|R

Later, as Moe is about to accept the deal— and share half of the money with Homer— Homer, unhinged by resentment, arrives at the tavern.
