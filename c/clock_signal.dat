The data lanes runs in inverted clock mode and embeds the <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> in itself. This allows the clock lane to be used for data (in addition to the existing three data lanes). The lane data structure has been changed to a packet-based format. The lane encoding is changed from 8b/10b to 16b/18b (reducing the overhead from 20% to 11%).|$|E

The second stage is reached when the tunneling barriers are high enough to prevent electrons from tunneling. The third stage occurs when the high barrier starts to lower. And finally, in the fourth stage, the tunneling barriers allow electrons to freely tunnel again. In simple words, when the <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> is high, electrons are free to tunnel. When the <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> is low, the cell becomes latched.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clock</b> <b>signals</b> are {{typically}} loaded {{with the greatest}} fanout and operate at the highest speeds of any signal within the synchronous system. Since the data signals are provided with a temporal reference by the <b>clock</b> <b>signals,</b> the <b>clock</b> waveforms must be particularly clean and sharp. Furthermore, these <b>clock</b> <b>signals</b> are particularly affected by technology scaling (see Moore's law), in that long global interconnect lines become significantly more resistive as line dimensions are decreased. This increased line resistance {{is one of the}} primary reasons for the increasing significance of clock distribution on synchronous performance. Finally, the control of any differences and uncertainty in the arrival times ofthe <b>clock</b> <b>signals</b> can severely limit the maximum performance of the entire system and create catastrophic race conditions in which an incorrect data signal may latch within a register.|$|R
25|$|The key to {{the ability}} of a {{frequency}} synthesizer to generate multiple frequencies is the divider placed between the output and the feedback input. This is usually {{in the form of a}} digital counter, with the output signal acting as a <b>clock</b> <b>signal.</b> The counter is preset to some initial count value, and counts down at each cycle of the <b>clock</b> <b>signal.</b> When it reaches zero, the counter output changes state and the count value is reloaded. This circuit is straightforward to implement using flip-flops, and because it is digital in nature, is very easy to interface to other digital components or a microprocessor. This allows the frequency output by the synthesizer to be easily controlled by a digital system.|$|E

25|$|In clock tree {{optimization}} (CTO) clock can be shielded so {{that noise}} is not coupled to other signals. But shielding increases area by 12 to 15%.

CTO is achieved by buffer sizing, gate sizing, buffer relocation, level adjustment and HFN synthesis. We try to improve setup slack in pre-placement, in placement and post placement optimization before CTS stages while neglecting hold slack. In post placement optimization after CTS hold slack is improved. As a result of CTS lot of buffers are added. Generally for 100k gates around 650 buffers are added.|$|E

25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the <b>clock</b> <b>signal,</b> and typically deselects the slave.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{benefit of}} DDR3 SDRAM over its {{immediate}} predecessor, DDR2 SDRAM, {{is its ability}} to transfer data at twice the rate (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled <b>clock</b> <b>signal,</b> a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may achieve a transfer rate (in megabytes per second, MB/s) of up to 64 times the memory clock speed (in MHz). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per memory module, DDR3 SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (memory clock rate) × 4 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a memory clock frequency of 100MHz, DDR3 SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 6400 MB/s.|$|E

Following the electromagnetic interference (EMI) test guidelines, this paper investigates {{for the first time}} the peak-level reduction of the spectrum (modulation gain) achievable by using frequency-discontinuous modulated <b>signals</b> in spread-spectrum <b>clocking</b> applications. In the paper, the spectrum of frequency-discontinuous <b>clock</b> <b>signals,</b> measured by a spectrum analyzer in peak-hold mode, is computed analytically in closed-form. This expression is used to formulate the problem of finding the optimal frequency-discontinuous modulated waveform as the solution of a non-linear differential equation. A suboptimal modulation waveform, that can be computed in closed-form, is also derived in this paper. To verify the effectiveness of developed approach, the spectrum of frequency modulated <b>clock</b> <b>signals</b> with different modulation waveforms and different modulation parameters (frequency deviation, modulation frequency) has been calculated for two different spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidths (100 kHz, 1 MHz).

2500|$|Synchronous {{dynamic random-access memory}} (SDRAM) is any dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) {{where the}} {{operation}} of its external pin interface is coordinated by an externally supplied <b>clock</b> <b>signal.</b> DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to mid-1990s used an asynchronous interface, in which input control signals have a direct effect on internal functions only delayed by the trip across its semiconductor pathways.

[...] In SDRAM families standardized by JEDEC, the <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> controls the stepping of an internal finite state machine that responds to incoming commands.

40|$|The present article {{presents}} a system {{making it possible}} to produce time information at spatially separate points with picosecond range precision. By using this time information, the accelerator and storage rings of the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) are to be synchronized. To do this, the rf cavities of these ring accelerators have to be controlled by signals having different phases and frequencies (0. 4 to 5. 4  MHz). Some frequencies of the signals are variable during acceleration due to what is referred to as ramp control. To enable synchronization of all these different signals, also during acceleration, the signals for controlling the cavities are not sent directly by the timing system, but instead two <b>clock</b> <b>signals</b> of constant frequency are sent. These <b>clock</b> <b>signals</b> are produced phase synchronously at different points up to 1  km apart and represent the time information. With the help of these <b>clock</b> <b>signals,</b> it is then possible to synchronize frequency generators that produce the signals actually needed for the cavities. Because of the universal character of the time information produced, it can be used not only to control the cavities but also to synchronize other processes. To transmit the <b>clock</b> <b>signals,</b> an optical network with dense wavelength division multiplex methods is used.
