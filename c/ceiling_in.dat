5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare <b>ceiling</b> (<b>in</b> {{imitation}} of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the <b>ceiling.</b> <b>In</b> this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is exclusively residential, with fourteen apartments spread over ten stories. Amenities will include wine cellars, extra storage, a children’s playroom, and a fitness center. The building will also feature eleven-foot <b>ceilings,</b> <b>in</b> {{response to the}} inclusion of tall <b>ceilings</b> <b>in</b> other luxury developments.|$|R

50|$|The {{reason that}} {{relatively}} small 110 ton vessels were used, {{was due to}} the low <b>ceilings</b> <b>in</b> the existing building.|$|R
5|$|The statehouse {{was built}} of blue limestone, two stories high. The {{governor}} and the Supreme Court occupied the lower floor, and the legislature occupied the upper floor, with each house in its own wing. The building {{was the site of}} many great events in its history, including a bier for Abraham Lincoln. The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen out of style, and the building was beginning to become decrepit. The building's limestone foundation began to fail, and many feared a general structural collapse of the building. In 1867 the <b>ceiling</b> <b>in</b> the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed. A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found. By the time that Governor James Williams was elected to office, the building was about to be condemned. It was finally demolished in 1877.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>in</b> wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} in the {{decoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was the painting of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>in</b> blue, studded with gilt stars, and with decorative borders around the architectural details of the pendentives. This was entirely replaced when Michelangelo came {{to work on the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>in</b> 1508.|$|E

50|$|The {{front door}} opens onto a hall with an {{approximately}} 3.5m high <b>ceiling.</b> The <b>ceilings</b> <b>in</b> all rooms, except the kitchen, laundry and sleep-out (enclosed verandah), are this height. The hall is divided in two by an arched doorway, {{on either side}} of which are fixed glass panels. The walls are lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding, as are all other walls in the house. In the hall are located the only skirting boards {{to be found in the}} house. The floor is polished timber boarding, as are all others excluding those in the bathroom, ensuite, kitchen and laundry. The <b>ceilings</b> <b>in</b> both segments of the hallway are pressed metal, as are the cornices. There are further pressed metal <b>ceilings</b> <b>in</b> the living room, kitchen and main bedroom. All other <b>ceilings,</b> excluding those <b>in</b> the sleep-out and verandah, which are sheeted, are lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding.|$|R
50|$|A {{few years}} later, a kitchen lean-to {{and a new}} north kitchen ell {{to the rear of}} the house were added. By 1676, Turner had added a spacious south (front) {{extension}} with its own chimney, containing a parlor on the ground floor, with a large bed chamber above it. <b>Ceilings</b> <b>in</b> this new wing are higher than the very low <b>ceilings</b> <b>in</b> older parts of the house. The new wing featured double casement windows and an overhang with carved pendants; it was capped with a three-gabled garret.|$|R

25|$|The older SAT (before 1995) had a {{very high}} <b>ceiling.</b> <b>In</b> any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was {{equivalent}} to the 99.9995 percentile.|$|E

50|$|In the board's {{assembly}} room, {{centred on}} a six metres long desk, was a <b>ceiling</b> painted <b>in</b> grisaille stucco-imitations, walls covered with woven fabrics displaying a forest landscape, and {{doors and windows}} furnished with green broadcloths and curtains. The remaining spaces were left quite more modest, with white-washed walls and board floors and <b>ceilings</b> <b>in</b> the rooms, and limestone floors in the corridors and stairwell.|$|R
25|$|After the leaking roof {{caused the}} partial {{collapse}} of plaster from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>in</b> the eastern {{wing of the}} building, the National Park Service declared the entire structure unsafe on February 23, 1981, and sealed the structure to the public.|$|E

25|$|Cotter and {{his colleagues}} found that glass {{ceilings}} are correlated strongly with gender.
