50|$|According to the FAO, {{the fish}} have been overexploited, but {{are in a}} {{recovering}} state. The commercial capture of <b>crimson</b> <b>jobfish</b> sharply dropped to 4,400 tonnes in 2009 from 25,300 tonnes the previous year.|$|E
50|$|Pristipomoides filamentosus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>crimson</b> <b>jobfish,</b> crimson snapper, opakapaka, or Hawaiian pink snapper, is a species of snapper native to the Indian Ocean and into the Pacific Ocean as far east as Hawaii and Tahiti. They inhabit waters over rocky substrates at depths from 40 to 400 m seemingly preferring to remain between 180 and 270 m. This species can reach a length of 100 cm, though most are around 50 cm. The greatest known weight for this species is 8.2 kg. This species is very important to local commercial fisheries and is sought out as a game fish.|$|E
40|$|An {{intensive}} commercial hook-and-line {{fishing operation}} targeted the demersal fisheries resources at Saya de Malha Bank in the Southwest Indian Ocean. Fishing {{was conducted with}} 12 dories that were equipped with echo sounders and electric fishing reels and supported by a refrigerated mothership. Over a 13 -day period in the 55 â€“ 130 m depth range, a total of 74. 3 metric tons (t) of fish were caught, of which the <b>crimson</b> <b>jobfish</b> (Pristipomoides filamentosus) represented 80 %. Catch rates decreased with time {{and could not be}} attributed to changes in location, climatic conditions, fishing depth, fishing method, or bait type. The initial virgin biomass of P. filamentosus available to a line fishery at the North Western promontory of Saya de Malha Bank was estimated at 72. 6 t through application of the Leslie model to daily catch and effort data. Biomass densities of 2364 kg/km 2 and 1206 kg/km were obtained by applying the initial biomass estimates to the surface area and to the length of the dropoff that was fished. The potential sustainable yield prior to exploitation was estimated at 567 kg/km 2 per year. The quantity of P. filamentosus caught by the mother-ship-dory fishing operation represented 82 % of the initial biomass available to a hook-and-line fishery, equivalent to more that three times the estimated maximum sustainable yield. The results of the study are important to fisheries managers because they demonstrate that intensive line fishing operations have the potential to rapidly deplete demersal fisheries resources...|$|E
