He noticed these cultures produced substances that were effective against Salmonella typhi, {{the cause of}} typhoid fever, which had β-lactamase. Guy Newton and Edward Abraham at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at the University of Oxford isolated cephalosporin C. The cephalosporin nucleus, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA), was derived from cephalosporin C and proved to be analogous to the penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), {{but it was not}} sufficiently potent for clinical use.

2500|$|OXA beta-lactamases {{were long}} {{recognized}} as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze oxacillin and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d [...] The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and <b>cephalothin</b> and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin {{and the fact that}} they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae, the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in P. aeruginosa. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.|$|E
50|$|Cephaloridine was {{temporarily}} popular {{because it was}} better tolerated intramuscularly and attained in higher and more sustained levels in blood than <b>cephalothin.</b> However, it binds to proteins to a much lesser extent than <b>cephalothin.</b> Because it is also poorly absorbed after oral administration {{the use of this}} drug for humans declined rapidly, especially since the second generation of cephalosporins was introduced in the 1970s. Today it is more commonly used in veterinary practice to treat mild to severe bacterial infections caused by penicillin resistant and penicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus sutbtilis, Klebsiella, Clostridium diptheriae, Salmonella and Shigella. Interest in studying cephalosporins was brought about by some unusual properties of cephaloridine. This antibiotic stands in sharp contrast to various other cephalosporins and to the structurally related penicillins in undergoing little or no net secretion by the mammalian kidney. Cephaloridine is, however, highly cytotoxic to the proximal renal tubule, the segment of the nephron responsible for the secretion of organic anions, including para-am-minohippurate (PAH), as well as the various penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The cytotoxicity of cephaloridine is completely prevented by probenecid and several other inhibitors of organic anion transport, including the nearly nontoxic <b>cephalothin.</b>|$|E

In pigs, it is usually associated with proliferative ileitis, and found in conjunction with other species of that genus; however, it has also been isolated from hamster and cattle feces. It is catalase-positive, hydrogen sulfide-positive in the TSI slant, glycine-tolerant, and intolerant to 3.0% sodium chloride. It is able to grow at 25 °C, is sensitive to <b>cephalothin,</b> and resistant to nalidixic acid.|$|E
50|$|Campylobacter mucosalis strains can be {{distinguished}} from all other catalase-negative Campylobacter strains except C. concisus by their requirement for H2 or formate for microaerophilic growth and H2 fumarate or formate and fumarate for anaerobic growth.

50|$|<b>Cephalothin,</b> a first {{generation}} cephalosporin for parenteral use {{was the first}} cephalosporin to become available for patients in the US in 1964. It was chosen for clinical trials from series of 7-ACA derivatives prepared at Eli Lilly.

50|$|SmithKline Corp. (SKC) and Eli Lilly and Co. (Lilly) were {{manufacturers}} of prescription drugs, including antibiotics. In 1964 Lilly Lilly introduced the first cephalosporin antibiotic, Keflin (<b>cephalothin),</b> into the United States market. It subsequently introduced four additional cephalosporin drugs: in 1972 Keflex (cephalexin), in 1967 Loridine (cephaloridine), in 1971 Kafocin (cephaloglycin), and in 1973 Kefzol (cefazolin). Lilly had patents on all its cephalosporin antibiotics except Kefzol (cefazolin), which this case concerns. From 1964 to 1972, Lilly's patents {{gave it a}} monopoly over all the cephalosporin drugs then in use. In 1973, competitors began to introduce new cephalosporins.

5000|$|Occurrences {{of group}} G Streptococcus in animals are mostly {{associated}} with S. canis, which normally infects domesticated dogs and cats. However, the pathogen can be horizontally transferred to other domesticated animals from {{either of these}} two animals. A documented instance of this transfer occurred on a central New York farm between a cat which was exhibiting chronic sinusitis and a dairy cow. This transfer resulted in S. canis mastitis on the udder of the cow, which appeared to be normal, leading to a prolonged diagnosis. Additional horizontal disease transfer to other cows in the herd was facilitated due to poor udder health management procedures, which included {{the use of a}} common cloth to wipe the udders of the cows following milking and the failure to use disinfection techniques. An outbreak of S. canis mastitis occurred from these transfers, but was controlled using antibiotic treatments and prevention techniques.Not limited to strains within the United States, instances of bovine mastitis due to S. canis have been reported in other areas. In both Germany [...] and Israel, similar outbreaks occurred due to horizontal disease transfer from either a domesticated cat or dog, but during the Israel outbreak, the cows were clinically examined to determine the susceptibility of the pathogen to various antibiotics. From this study, the bacteria were found to be sensitive to <b>cephalothin</b> and partially resistant to penicillin.|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of 4, 929 unselected clinical isolates {{of bacteria}} to cefoxitin and <b>cephalothin</b> {{was determined by}} the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and <b>cephalothin</b> were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to <b>cephalothin</b> but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and <b>cephalothin</b> susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then <b>cephalothin</b> against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with <b>cephalothin,</b> against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of <b>cephalothin,</b> especially against gram-negative strains...|$|E
40|$|Sensitivity to {{ampicillin}} and <b>cephalothin,</b> {{the formation}} and induction of penicillinase and cephalosporinase, {{and the role of}} cephalosporinase in resistance to <b>cephalothin</b> were investigated in nine strains of Gram-negative bacteria. Naturally occurring strains resistant to <b>cephalothin</b> formed cephalosporinase, and ampicillin-resistant strains formed penicillin-ase. Cephalothin-resistant strains were all resistant to ampicillin, but the ampicillin-resistant strain of Proteus mirabiEis was sensitive to <b>cephalothin</b> and did not form cephalosporinase. Penicillinase and cephalosporinase activity were induced by benzylpenicillin in five strains of Gram-negative bacteria and cephalosporinase was also induced by <b>cephalothin</b> and 6 -amino-penicillanic acid in four of the inducible strains examined. Methicillin and quinacillin were variable in effect as inducers and cloxacillin partially inhibited cephalosporinase activity of two strains.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of <b>cephalothin</b> into a less active metabolite (desacetylcephalothin) might influence its distribution in tissues. An experimental rabbit model devised to determine concentrations of antibiotics in subcutaneous fibrin clots {{was used in}} this study. Groups of five to six animals received 100 -mg/kg intravenous injections of either cefamandole or <b>cephalothin.</b> One hour after the injection, the concentration of cefamandole in serum was 20 times higher than that of <b>cephalothin.</b> Whereas <b>cephalothin</b> was undetectable at 4 h, cefamandole was still detectable {{at the end of the}} experiment. The half-lives of <b>cephalothin</b> and cefamandole in serum were 16 and 27 min, respectively. The concentration of cefamandole found in fibrin clots was severalfold higher than that of <b>cephalothin.</b> The half-life of cefamandole in clots (81 min) was superior to that of <b>cephalothin</b> (38 min). Although concentrations of both antibiotics were higher in serum than in clots at 1 h, the concentrations of these drugs in the clots persisted at higher levels throughout the next 5 h of the experiment. The extent of binding of cefamandole (87 %) to rabbit serum was greater than that of <b>cephalothin</b> (50 %). At least 55 % of <b>cephalothin</b> was metabolized in vivo into its less active metabolite desacetylcephalothin. This metabolite was found in higher proportion in the serum (75 %) than in the clots (55 %). Whereas only 12 % of the free (unbound) <b>cephalothin</b> reached the clots, 78 % of the free cefamandole was found in the clots. This lower level of penetration of unbound <b>cephalothin</b> might be explained by the short half-life of this antibiotic, not permitting equilibrium to occur...|$|E

40|$|Cefuroxime, a new {{parenteral}} cephalosporin {{was compared}} with <b>cephalothin</b> by broth microdilution susceptibility testing against 5, 887 routine clinical bacterial isolates in four large clinical laboratories. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefuroxime against the Enterobacteriaceae were consistently {{lower than those}} of <b>cephalothin.</b> This was most striking among the Enterobacter species, which were generally susceptible to cefuroxime (MIC ≤ 8 μg/ml), but resistant to <b>cephalothin.</b> Similar results occurred with Haemophilus species, Acinetobacter anitratus, meningococci, and Aeromonas hydrophilia, but Pseudomonas species and enterococci were resistant to high concentrations of both drugs. Streptococci showed slightly greater susceptibility to cefuroxime than to <b>cephalothin.</b> By contrast, staphylococci were more susceptible to <b>cephalothin.</b> Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to cefuroxime, but other anaerobes were generally susceptible...|$|E
40|$|Burn tissue {{sites are}} a {{potential}} source of bacteremia during debridement surgery. Burn injury is likely to affect the distribution of antibiotics to tissues, but direct evidence of this is lacking. The {{aim of this study}} was to directly evaluate the influence of burn trauma on the distribution of <b>cephalothin</b> to peripheral tissues. We used subcutaneous microdialysis techniques to monitor interstitial fluid concentrations of <b>cephalothin</b> in the burnt and nonburnt tissues of adult patients with severe burns following parenteral administration of 1 g <b>cephalothin</b> for surgical prophylaxis. Analogous simultaneous studies conducted with healthy adult volunteers provided reference tissue concentration data. Equivalent tissue exposures were seen for burn and nonburn sites, giving overall median interstitial <b>cephalothin</b> concentrations (from 0 to 240 min) of 2. 84 mg/liter and 3. 06 mg/liter, respectively. A lower overall median interstitial <b>cephalothin</b> concentration of 0. 54 mg/liter was observed for healthy individuals, and the patient nonburnt tissue and volunteer control tissue <b>cephalothin</b> concentrations exhibited significantly different data distributions (P < 0. 001; Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonpara-metric test).

40|$|The {{in vitro}} susceptibilities of 408 recent {{clinical}} isolates of anaerobic bacteria against cefaclor, cephalexin, <b>cephalothin,</b> cefazolin, cefamandole, and cefoxitin were compared by an agar dilution technique. Against gram-positive bacteria, especially peptococci, peptostreptococci, and propionibacteria, cephalexin and cefaclor {{were significantly less}} active than <b>cephalothin</b> (P < 0. 05). Cephalexin was also less active than <b>cephalothin</b> against clostridia and lactobacillus (P < 0. 05). Against gram-negative bacteria, major differences were observed primarily with Bacteroides fragilis, against which cephalexin, cefazolin and cefoxitin were all significantly more active than <b>cephalothin</b> (P < 0. 001). At concentrations of 16 μg per ml, however, all cephalosporins showed high in vitro activity, except against Lactobacillus species and B. fragilis. <b>Cephalothin,</b> cefazolin and cefamandole were considerably more active against the former, whereas cefoxitin was distinctly more active against the latter...|$|E

40|$|BL-S 339 {{is a new}} broad-spectrum, parenterally {{effective}} cephalosporin whose {{expression of}} antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected {{by the nature of}} the assay medium. When assayed in nutrient agar, BL-S 339 was more active than <b>cephalothin</b> against strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and indole-positive Proteus sp. However, when assayed in Mueller-Hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of <b>cephalothin</b> was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. The in vivo activity of BL-S 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than <b>cephalothin</b> in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. When BL-S 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with <b>cephalothin.</b> BL-S 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as <b>cephalothin.</b> Recovery of BL-S 339 in the urine within the 24 -hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of <b>cephalothin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between cephalosporin β-lactamase activity {{and resistance to}} <b>cephalothin</b> was investigated in strains of Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes. β-Lactamase activity was detected in all strains, but a quantitative correlation between amount of β-lactamase activity and level of resistance to <b>cephalothin</b> was not observed. Permeability barriers to <b>cephalothin</b> were observed and varied from strain to strain. β-Lactamase activity was increased by growing organisms {{in the presence of}} penicillin G. These enzymes hydrolyzed cephalosporins more rapidly than penicillins. Penicillinase-resistant penicillins, especially those of the isoxazolyl series, effectively inhibited Enterobacter β-lactamase. A synergistic antibacterial effect was observed when organisms were exposed to <b>cephalothin</b> and oxacillin in combination, and the resistance of even very small inocula to <b>cephalothin</b> was reduced by addition of oxacillin. Oxacillin probably exerts its effect by inhibiting β-lactamase at an intracellular site. Intracellular β-lactamase may make an important contribution to the resistance of even small inocula of gram-negative bacilli to cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of cefazolin in Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis {{has been questioned}} because of in vitro inactivation by staphylococcal beta-lactamase. Cefazolin, although inactivated in vitro by S. aureus beta-lactamase, was as effective as <b>cephalothin</b> {{in the treatment of}} left-sided S. aureus endocarditis in rabbits. Cefazolin (20 mg/kg every 6 or 8 h), <b>cephalothin</b> (40 mg/kg every 6 h), and methicillin (40 mg/kg every 6 h), administered intramuscularly, were compared in the treatment of left-sided endocarditis caused in rabbits by a highly penicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus. The three antibiotics were all effective in reducing titers in vegetations. However, at the dose used, methicillin reduced the titers more rapidly than <b>cephalothin</b> or cefazolin. Cefazolin concentrations in serum were about double those achieved with <b>cephalothin</b> or methicillin. However, cefazolin was only half as active as methicillin and one-eighth as active as <b>cephalothin</b> in vitro in a serum assay.
