40|$|This chapter explores whether current {{accounting}} technology fulfils the stewardship {{and accountability}} information needs of family business owners. As the influences on contemporary accounting are both conceptual and contextual we frame {{our discussion in}} terms <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> knowledge foundations <b>of</b> accounting, as informed by various <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm, and stakeholder theory. We posit that if prevailing <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm impact <b>the</b> knowledge foundations <b>of</b> accounting, and subsequently the nature and form of accounting practice, then it is <b>the</b> <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> influential stakeholders that can define the accounting change agenda and affect contemporary accounting practice. We use extant research and practice to identify what <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm prevail and whether these are consistent with <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> family firms. We identify two streams of literature relevant to our review. The conceptual stream focuses on <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm {{and the extent to}} which particular conceptions are encapsulated within accounting regulation and practice. We find that recent international accounting regulation evidences a shift in <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm that aligns better with <b>the</b> stewardship orientation <b>of</b> family business owners. The empirical stream largely focuses on financial reporting quality and performance differences between publicly listed family and non-family firms. As <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> family firms are private, this literature sheds limited light on accountability issues pertinent to family firms. Accordingly we identify opportunities for further empirical research connecting financial reporting quality and performance issues with alternative <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm...|$|R

5|$|House (also called House, M.D.) is an American {{television}} medical {{drama that}} originally {{ran on the}} Fox network for eight seasons, from November 16, 2004 to May 21, 2012.

The series' premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for the <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title character. The series' executive producers included Shore, Attanasio, Attanasio's business partner Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It was filmed largely in Century City.|$|E

This dance is performed in Paro as the Tsche festival.

5|$|It was Newton's <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{universe}} {{based upon}} natural and rationally understandable laws that {{became one of}} the seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.|$|E

In the midst of worsening civil unrest throughout India, it was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the Indian militant movement, especially in Punjab and Bengal. On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act (1919), an extension of the Defence of India act of 1915, was enforced in India.|$|E

40|$|This paper explicates {{competing}} <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WTO {{by examining}} {{the relationship between the}} perceived legitimacy crisis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WTO and <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> development onto <b>the</b> global trade agenda. The general argument is that the WTO legitimacy debate in trade law literature can be understood as a proxy for a development debate. By reconstruing the legitimacy debate as a development debate, this paper shows how implicit within legitimacy arguments are competing <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WTO 2 ̆ 7 s function and purpose and that these conceptions are embedded within a broader development framework. <b>The</b> unfortunate effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contestations and justifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WTO 2 ̆ 7 s legitimacy has been <b>the</b> obscuring <b>of</b> normative assumptions underpinning <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WTO. One suspects that the more the discourse continues in this tug-of-war <b>of</b> legitimacy, <b>the</b> more entangled our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WTO will be.

Sider conceived of Goofus and Gallant as near-equals, with Gallant only marginally better than Goofus, in arguing that sending the former to Heaven and the latter to Hell is antithetical to God's justice. Other philosophers such as Matthew Konieczka and Casey Swank have also called upon Goofus and Gallant as archetypes of bad and good when formulating arguments.|$|E
5|$|During the Anarchy, Scotland invaded Northern England {{and took}} {{much of the}} land north of Durham. In the 1139 peace treaty that followed, Prince Henry of Scotland was made Earl of Northumberland and kept the {{counties}} of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumbria. These reverted to English control in 1157, establishing {{for the most part}} the modern England–Scotland border. The region also saw violence during the Wars of the Roses, including the decisive Battle of Wakefield, although the modern-day <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war as a conflict between Lancashire and Yorkshire is anachronistic – Lancastrians recruited from across Northern England, including Yorkshire, while the Yorkists drew most of their power from Southern England, Wales and Ireland. The Anglo-Scottish Wars also touched the region, and in just 400 years, Berwick-upon-Tweed – now the northernmost town in England – changed hands more than a dozen times. The wars also saw thousands of Scots settle south of the border, chiefly in the border counties and Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the last}} century {{military}} service {{has been one of the}} single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian experience of war and of soldiering, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, larrikinism, egalitarianism and mateship; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity.|$|E

40|$|Some sociologists {{and higher}} {{education}} scholars view theory and empiricism as separate worlds, arguing that one has nothing to offer the other. This work proposes that the boundaries between theoretical conceptions and empirical realities have a transilient fluidity, that one domain informs the other. Hence this study explores connections between three theoretical <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university, Weber's bureaucracy, Ritzer's McUniversity and Clark's Entrepreneurial University and <b>the</b> leadership style <b>of</b> executives in Australian public universities. Information about executives' leadership style was gathered from case study interviews with seventeen executives from four Australian public universities. This work found that at each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case study universities leaders' views of their university comprised elements <b>of</b> these three <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university were actualized in a 'pure' form. This work also identifies four different leadership styles used by these executives: entrepreneurial transformers, facilitators, bureaucrats and collegial leaders. It finds some connections between leaders' theoretical <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university and how they led their universities. However, the connections between theory and empiricism were complex, reflexive ones rather than unidirectional causes and effects...|$|R
