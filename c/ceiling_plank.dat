50|$|Apart {{from several}} {{small changes in}} the {{position}} of hands and faces, the under-drawing shows that the small pilasters on the left wall were originally planned to be repeated on the rear wall, and to be much taller, reaching nearly to the roof, on both. The paint on the rear wall is thicker than on the left wall, so he may have painted the pilasters before changing his mind. In the underdrawing the <b>ceiling</b> <b>planks</b> are all in place, and there was also a light source to the right, for which the shadows are drawn.|$|R
60|$|Daniel Davidson {{was engaged}} in a very {{important}} conversation with old Duncan McKay {{at the time the}} formidable troop of North-Westers swept through the settlements. The old man was seated in the hall, parlour, drawing-room--or whatever you choose to call it--of Ben Nevis House. It was an uncarpeted, unpainted, unadorned room with pine plank flooring, plank walls, a <b>plank</b> <b>ceiling,</b> a <b>plank</b> table, and a set of plank chairs. Ornament was dispensed with in the hall of Ben Nevis House; for although Elspie would fain have clothed it with a little feminine grace, its proprietor would not hear of such proposals.|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built by Judge Thomas W. Scott in 1827. It has a wide front gallery, and the {{entrance}} is highlighted by two large double doors. Inside there are <b>plank</b> <b>ceilings,</b> Federal period woodwork, beaded board walls, and molded Adam style mantels.|$|R
50|$|The crowded {{mezzanine}} excuses its tight spaces with a cozy nautical flavor: This is from {{a combination}} of the galley kitchen, exposed, finished joinery, overhead clerestory, <b>planked</b> <b>ceiling,</b> wood paneling, and built-in dining table. Some owners noticed this and emphasized it with their decor.|$|R
5000|$|Ship builder Donald McKay laid all {{his skills}} and {{professional}} {{experience in the}} construction of this passenger carrying clipper ship, small faults that had been detected by him before in the sister ships were fixed during the building of James Baines. Regarding her lines, stem, and bow, she was not as sharp and hollow-lined as her sister ship Lightning or as [...] "full" [...] as her other sister ship Champion of the Seas. The ship's main frame was of white oak, the <b>ceiling,</b> <b>planking,</b> deck-frames and keelsons, of hard pine. The ship's hull was diagonally braced with iron, and square-fastened, and all the keelsons and waterways are scarphed and keyed. It was said in her time the style in which James Baines's hull was designed and built, both inside and outside, has not been surpassed or equalled, by any other ship Donald McKay has ever constructed. The stern and the bow including the cutwater were beautifully adorned with gilded carvings, the ship's hull was painted black with blue waterways and a blue underwater ship. Her mast-heads and yards were black and equipped with iron caps, the hoops on her masts were held in white as well as the deck houses and rails. On Mr James Baines order the ship was equipped and fitted with the best and most modern ship improvements (pumps, windlasses & winches, Crane's self-acting chain-stoppers (invented in 1852)).|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has many architectural features of its period with the roof structure comprising {{a series of}} jointed crucks together with some curved wind-braces still in place. There are coffered <b>ceilings</b> and a <b>plank</b> and muntin screen with soot blackening to one side now {{in one of the}} upstairs rooms (possibly re-sited from being a screens passage {{at the entrance to the}} main hall where one would expect to see this type of structure).|$|R
60|$|The sun {{was up and}} {{the birds}} were singing long before that slumber was broken. When at last Olaf and his little charge awoke, they yawned several times and {{stretched}} themselves vigorously; opened their eyes with difficulty, and began to look round with some half-formed notions as to breakfast. Olaf was first to observe that the roof above him was a confused mass of earth and roots, instead of the customary <b>plank</b> <b>ceiling</b> and cross-beams of home.|$|R
50|$|The Town of Ramsgate {{public house}} {{is located at}} the centre of the ancient hamlet of Wapping in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It {{features}} in several books about London inns where it is rated as 'a notable specimen of a waterman's tavern.' Although the present building dates back to 1758, the National Monuments Record have stated that it was constructed on earlier foundations. Today it benefits from a listed Grade II, awarded primarily for the pub's interior; the 'beamed <b>ceilings,</b> benches, <b>plank</b> paneling and engraved glass screen' but also for its 'group value and historical associations.' Despite later changes,the pub has a distinctive atmosphere. Crammed into a small rectangular area between Wapping Old Stairs and Oliver's Wharf, its fight for space is reflected in the long narrow shapes of the pub's main bar. Walking out onto the pub's riverside terrace, the visitor is confronted by the dramatic sight of narrow steps leading up to the mock gallows that loom against the skyline.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{arriving}} at this village Burlington, {{we stopped at}} the house of one Jacob Hendrix, from Holstein, living on this side. He was an acquaintance of Ephraim who would have gone there to lodge, but he was not at home. We, therefore, rowed on to the village, in search of lodgings, for it had been dark all of an hour or more; but proceeding a little further, we met this Jacob Hendrix, in a canoe with hay. As we were now at the village, we went up to the tavern, but there were no lodgings to be obtained there, whereupon we reembarked in the boat, and rowed back to Jacob Hendrix's, who received us very kindly, and entertained us according to his ability. The house, although not much larger than where we were the last night, was somewhat better and tighter, being made according to the Swedish mode, and as they usually build their houses here, which are block-houses, being nothing else than entire trees, split through the middle, or squared out of the rough, and placed {{in the form of a}} square, upon each other, as high as they wish to have the house; the ends of these timbers are let into each other, about a foot from the ends, half of one into half of the other. The whole structure is thus made, without a nail or a spike. The ceiling and roof do not exhibit much finer work, except among the most careful people, who have the <b>ceiling</b> <b>planked</b> and a glass window. The doors are wide enough, but very low, so that you have to stoop in entering. These houses are quite tight and warm; but the chimney is placed in a corner.In his journal, Danckaerts called Hendrick Jacobs [...] "Jacob Hendrix from Holstein," [...] getting his name backwards, but providing the only reference to his place of nativity. Through YDNA evidence, which follows the male genetic line, the Falkenberg ancestry indicates roots in the Neatherlands, not the Holstein area of Germany. This evidence will be forthcoming. The journal entry also provides a detailed description of an important Swedish contribution to American culture—the log cabin.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the ground}} level has a floor of pavers, white walls, and {{a flight of}} {{concrete}} steps leading to the second level. The second through fifth levels are all largely alike, with bare concrete floors and ceilings, and exposed brick walls; they connect to each other by a central steel staircase. The sixth level is accessed from the fifth by an attic ladder; {{it has the same}} concrete floor and brick walls as the lower levels, but a wooden <b>plank</b> <b>ceiling</b> hides the rafters supporting the roof. The top level houses the loudspeakers of the electronic carillon; the system's controls are below, on the second floor.|$|R
50|$|One of the house's most {{significant}} features is a well-preserved early {{kitchen in the}} cellar below the main parlor. A simple open stair with chambered and tapered square newel and square spindles descends from the first floor to the kitchen. The room retains its original plain six-panel doors, wainscoting, beaded Federal-era casings, plaster walls and <b>ceiling</b> and fir <b>plank</b> floor. At the room's north wall is a cooking fireplace and baking oven. The fireplace retains a federal mantle, andirons and crane. The firebox opening and the heath are made of large dressed blocks of Gasport Limestone. The adjacent baking over in constructed of brick.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. William Taylor, of Mystic, a man seventy-six years old, who was [...] in the smack Evergreen, Capt. John Appleman, {{tells me}} that they [...] started from Mystic, October 3, 1832, on a fishing voyage to Key [...] West, in company with the smack Morning Star, Captain Rowland. On [...] the 12th were off Cape Hatteras, the winds blowing heavily from the [...] northeast, and the smack under double-reefed sails. At ten o'clock [...] in the evening they struck a woho, which shocked the vessel all [...] over. The smack was leaking badly, and they made {{a signal to the}} [...] Morning Star to keep close to them. The next morning they [...] found the leak, and both smacks kept off Charleston. On arrival [...] they took out the ballast, hove her out, and found that the sword [...] had gone through the <b>planking,</b> timber, and <b>ceiling.</b> The <b>plank</b> was [...] two inches thick, the timber five inches, and the ceiling [...] one-and-a-half-inch white oak. The sword {{projected}} two inches [...] through the ceiling, {{on the inside of the}} [...] "after run." [...] It struck by [...] a butt on the outside, which caused the leak. They took out and [...] replaced a piece of the plank, and proceeded on their voyage.|$|R
5000|$|The chamber {{was built}} by Henry III, {{parallel}} to St Stephen's Chapel. It is said that the site was previously occupied by a room in which Edward the Confessor had died. [...] The new chamber was intended {{for use by the}} king primarily as a private apartment, but was also used as a reception room, and it was constructed and decorated to impress visitors. The chamber was relatively long and narrow, measuring approximately 82 x 28 ft, with a state bed towards one end under a painting of Edward the Confessor. One wall included a squint providing a view of the altar in a chapel next door, so the king could view religious services from the chamber. The <b>ceiling</b> of wooden <b>planks</b> with decorative bosses survived until at least 1819, when it was replaced with plaster.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{until just}} before the {{completion}} of the railway lines, did the two railway administrations agree, on 17 May 1877, details of the very large station building and extensive track system needed for the transfer of goods and passengers. This required the local terrain to be filled with over 250,000 m³ of earth and levelled off. The station building was built with its centre section exactly on the border. On either side was an adjoining wing belonging to the respective railway company. The waiting room was designed {{in a way that was}} very representative of the style of that era. In the first class waiting room is the largest surviving <b>planked</b> <b>ceiling</b> of its type - a so-called [...] "Cologne ceiling" [...] (Kölner Decke). The station was completed in 1878. On its southern side, west of the track network, that had 9 tracks to begin with and later 11, is the roundhouse with its turntable. Today it houses the Bavarian Localbahn (=branch line) Museum in which the Bavarian Localbahn Society stables more than 20 vehicles from the Lokalbahn era.|$|R
