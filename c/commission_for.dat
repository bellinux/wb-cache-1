5|$|Cairano first {{documented}} work is from December 24, 1489 {{with his}} <b>commission</b> <b>for</b> {{the cycle of}} twelve statues of the Apostles to be installed in the first dome {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Brescia. The installation of Cairano's cycle is contemporaneous with Tamagnino's installation of the twelve angels in the lower section of the dome.|$|E
5|$|Cairano's art {{and career}} began a rapid ascent {{following}} several other commissions for {{work within the}} sanctum of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli. On November 16, 1941, he was paid for two keystones for the vault of the old Duomo which was being built {{under the aegis of}} Bernardino da Martinengo. Cairano was given the sole <b>commission</b> <b>for</b> figurative sculptures in the new building. Two years later, in 1493, Cairano began work at the courtyard of the Loggia palazzo.|$|E
5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500.

But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who {{has come a long}} way from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E
