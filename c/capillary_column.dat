25|$|Gas {{chromatography}} {{is based}} on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid or viscous liquid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter (commonly 0.53 – 0.18mm inside diameter) glass or fused-silica tube (a <b>capillary</b> <b>column)</b> or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in analytical chemistry; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in biochemistry, it is well suited for use in the petrochemical, environmental monitoring and remediation, and industrial chemical fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.|$|E
2500|$|The GC-MS is {{composed}} of two major building blocks: the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph utilizes a <b>capillary</b> <b>column</b> which depends on the column's dimensions (length, diameter, film thickness) {{as well as the}} phase properties (e.g. 5% phenyl polysiloxane). [...] The difference in the chemical properties between different molecules in a mixture and their relative affinity for the stationary phase of the column will promote separation of the molecules as the sample travels the length of the column. The molecules are retained by the column and then elute (come off) from the column at different times (called the retention time), and this allows the mass spectrometer downstream to capture, ionize, accelerate, deflect, and detect the ionized molecules separately. The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into ionized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass-to-charge ratio.|$|E
2500|$|The direct liquid {{introduction}} (DLI) interface {{was developed}} in 1980. This interface was thought {{as a solution to}} the evaporation of liquid inside the capillary inlet interface. In DLI, a nebulizer was used to disintegrate part of the effluent coming from the column. A small diaphragm was used to form a liquid jet composed of small droplets that were subsequently dried in a desolvation chamber. A microbore <b>capillary</b> <b>column</b> was used to transfer the nebulized liquid product to the MS ion source. The analytes were ionized using a solvent assisted chemical ionization source, where the LC solvents acted as reagent gases.To use this interface, it was necessary to split the flow coming out of the LC column because {{only a small portion of}} the effluent (10 to 50 μl/min out of 1 ml/min) could be [...] analyzed on-line without breaking the MS vacuum. One of the main operational problems of the DLI interface was the frequent clogging of the diaphragm orifices. The DLI interface was used between 1982 and 1985 for the analysis of pesticides, corticosteroids, metabolites in equine urine, erythromycin, and vitamin B12. However, this interface was replaced by the thermospray interface, which removed the flow rate limitations and the issues with the clogging diaphragms.|$|E

Practical applications by this technique have also been studied, especially in the period from 1996 and onwards. A recently developed technique, solvating gas chromatography (SGC), which uses CO 2 as the mobile phase combined with a high inlet pressure, has received specific focus. The use of packed <b>capillary</b> <b>columns</b> in GC has also been evaluated. The technique used to pack these columns has been developed from a similar technology, which have been used for packing of columns, achieving very good separations, for both supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

The hydrocarbons are separated using a <b>capillary</b> <b>column</b> and detected with a FID. A complication with light gas analyses that include H2 is that He, {{which is the most}} common and most sensitive inert carrier (sensitivity is proportional to molecular mass) has an almost identical thermal conductivity to hydrogen (it is the difference in thermal conductivity between two separate filaments in a Wheatstone Bridge type arrangement that shows when a component has been eluted). For this reason, dual TCD instruments used with a separate channel for hydrogen that uses nitrogen as a carrier are common. Argon is often used when analysing gas phase chemistry reactions such as F-T synthesis so that a single carrier gas can be used rather than two separate ones. The sensitivity is less, but this is a trade off for simplicity in the gas supply.|$|E
