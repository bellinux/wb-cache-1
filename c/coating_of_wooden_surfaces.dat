Present work is the study, to evaluate the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>wooden</b> block by implementing a contact type optical sensor. The traditional contact type thickness measuring sensors are inductive type, capacitive type and ultrasonic type. This measurement technique has some advantages and some drawbacks according to their measuring principles and environmental effects. In case of inductive type transducer sensitivity is truly affected by stray magnetic fields and severely dirt and other contaminants may produce difficulty for using capacitive type transducer. Beside this, ultrasonic vibration transducer avoids those physical phenomena but its dynamic reading is not suitable for moving materials. For this shortcoming, a new type of opto-imaging thickness gauge has been designed & fabricated. This proposed sensor principle is based on the effect of temporal changes of reflected light intensity due to an image. Hence, the variation <b>of</b> the <b>wooden</b> block thickness with respect to the reference plane is directly proportional to this light intensity information, due to which it has been recorded in terms of voltage utilizing signal processing circuit (SPC) for interfacing with the electronic measuring instruments.

Results: Samples were collected from different monuments and environments, and fungi growing on them were isolated and identified. The isolated Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger strains were used for the infestation of new pitch pine samples. The results revealed that the lightness of samples infected with any of the tested fungi decreased with increasing incubation times. XRD analysis showed that the crystallinity of incubated samples treated individually with the different concentrations of chitosan was lower than the crystallinity of infected samples. The crystallinity index measured by the first and the second method decreased after the first and second months but increased after the third and fourth months. This may due to the reducing of amorphous part by enzymes or acids produced by fungi in wooden samples. Conclusions: The growth of fungi on the treated wood samples decreased with increasing the concentration of chitosan.

In addition, the RH dropped below 20  % for less time as compared to the impermeable case. Furthermore, Osanyintola and Simonson [2] showed that using hygroscopic materials, such as wood, combined with a well-controlled heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, the potential for direct energy savings is relatively small for heating, i.e., 2 – 3  % of the total heating energy, but significant for cooling, i.e., 5 – 30  % of the total cooling energy. The potential indirect savings from adjusting the ventilation rate and indoor temperature, while maintaining adequate indoor air quality and comfort, are in the order of 5  % for heating while they range from 5 to 20  % for cooling. Woloszyn et al.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to develop algorithms for automatic quality control of textured surfaces by means of image processing methods. In particular we focused on <b>wooden</b> <b>surfaces</b> and non-woven fabrics. Quality control <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>surfaces</b> encompasses the detection of defects like, e. g., knotholes, classification of the color aspect and determining and evaluating the local direction of the fibers {{as well as the}} global 'esthetic' appearance of the line pattern. We developed a method which allows for a compression of the image data and which extracts a small number of features which can be used for color classification. This is of importance for sorting wood which is assembled in a piece of furniture. Defects in wood usually correspond to darker regions in the <b>wooden</b> <b>surface</b> and can be extracted by using a segmentation approach. We implemented here {{a modified version of the}} Mumford-Shah method, taking into account also the typically elliptical shape of the defects. For analyzing the local orientation of fibers we developed robust algorithms. For the detection of the global line pattern we implemented a method based on the Radon- or Hough-transform. In an additional step we use a model of a tree trunk to identify parameters from the line pattern, which can then be used for classifying the 'esthetical appearance' of the overall pattern. These parameters correspond to the degree of symmetry in the pattern, they can be used to determine if the lines are parallel, etc. Evaluating the quality of non-woven fabrics, we need to determine the homogeneity of the fabric and we have to detect 'lanes'. We implemented a multi-scale approach for analyzing the homogeneity. In order to have comparable results, the image acquisition has to be calibrated. We developed a simulation algorithm which can be used to synthesize 'artificial non-wovens' with a predetermined degree of homogeneity. The enhance 'lanes' in the non-woven we make use of an anisotropic diffusion filtering which yields images which can easily be evaluated by using additional tools. (orig.)

Protective liquid surface treatments such as paints and varnishes are often used to extend the esthetic and economic life <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> material <b>surfaces</b> [15 – 17]. The main purpose of a surface treatment is to protect the surface of wood and give it a good appearance.

40|$|This work {{focused on}} {{developing}} surface treatments for various cellulosic materials, including wood, cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), and natural textiles (cotton and linen). For this purpose, several approaches were developed, aiming at various improvements {{depending on the}} type of substrate. Some components were created specifically for this work, including amphiphilic galactoglucomannan (GGM) derivatives and an aqueous carnauba wax dispersion. On wood, non-continuous coatings were assembled, made of natural wax particles alone or combined with UV-absorbing additives. When wax particles were used alone, the performance <b>of</b> the <b>coated</b> wood was compared to a continuous wax film and commercially available coatings (lacquer, linseed oil). The treatment with particles enhanced the hydrophobicity <b>of</b> the <b>wooden</b> <b>surface</b> and its moisture buffering performance. Additionally, it is known that protection from the degrading effect of UV light is as important as protection against water. Therefore, zinc oxide nanoparticles were incorporated together with wax particles into multilayer coatings through layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition. The multilayers increased the roughness <b>of</b> the <b>wooden</b> <b>surface</b> and provided UV-absorbing properties. Moreover, the coated wood was superhydrophobic, yet the moisture buffering was preserved and even enhanced. On CNF, galactoglucomannan derivatives with different hydrophobic tails were adsorbed. The derivatives were synthesised using naturally occurring fatty acids or polydimethylsiloxane as hydrophobic blocks. The hydrophobic moieties did not hinder the adsorption on cellulose, and all GGM-derived materials were found to adsorb irreversibly. However, the use of hydrophobic blocks with high molar mass was required in order to overcome the inherent hydrophilicity of the GGM molecule, and increase the hydrophobicity of the surface. Moreover, inspired by the promising results achieved on wood, wax-containing multilayers were assembled on CNF and textiles. Here poly-L-lysine (PLL) was utilised instead of zinc oxide as the cationic counterpart. Two bilayers were sufficient to reduce the sensitivity towards water and switch surfaces from being highly hydrophilic to hydrophobic, or superhydrophobic. In addition, studying the LbL assembly with quartz crystal microbalance revealed that the adsorption of the wax particles increased with the pH of the PLL solution. Nevertheless, the oxygen permeability of the CNF films and moisture sorption of textiles were preserved in all cases. Having these properties, the enhanced cellulosic materials could be used in advanced applications, like smart packaging, passive climate control systems, and breathable superhydrophobic clothing for sports and outdoors...|$|R

The main objective of this work was to improve the legibility of very faint text that was detected {{on the surface of}} one of the three tally sticks used in this project. For imaging, an ultraviolet light source was used to achieve reasonable contrast between the text and the wood and the optimal wavelength was found to be 365 nm. Single band images at 550 nm gave the best contrast, particularly if flat fielding was used to compensate for uneven lighting <b>of</b> the <b>wooden</b> <b>surface.</b> Finally, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and SEM were used to assess the wood and possibly identify the material used to write on the tally stick. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images did not reveal the presence of any graphite particles or ink deposits, but the XRF indicated that there were higher levels of Fe where text was detected, which may indicate that an iron containing writing material was used to write on these tally sticks...|$|R
