The ability of a coating layer to retard the photo-yellowing of a hydrogen-peroxide-bleached birch <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> is exemplified using this method. It is shown that the repeatability of the model system is excellent, even for coat weights below 10 g/m 2.

Whilst some of the UV absorbers offer some protection, their effect can be enhanced by use {{in conjunction with a}} reducing agent (sodium hypophosphite) and by lowering the pH of the paper by application of potassium dihydrogen phosphate. The best effect was obtained by using Tinuvin 1130 in combination with both a reducing agent and potassium dihydrogen phosphate.

30|$|Antibodies {{recognizing}} galacturonan {{were used}} in immunoassays for industrial unbleached and hydrogen peroxide-bleached <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>CTMP).</b> The assays {{were based on a}} colorimetric method using specific monoclonal antibody recognition of acidic and methylated homogalacturonan, respectively, on the pulp fiber surfaces. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies were linked to the galacturonan specific antibodies, and an alkaline phosphatase substrate (p-nitrophenylphosphate) was used to develop a yellow reaction product that can be followed spectrophotometrically. Together the newly developed immunoassays were able to describe the deesterification, specifically, of surface-localized galacturonan on CTMP, induced by alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching. Unbleached CTMP showed relatively more labeling by methylated galacturonan recognizing antibodies, whereas bleached CTMP was relatively more labeled for acidic galacturonan. The increase in negative charge of the bleached pulp was also shown by polyelectrolyte titration; the negative surface charge was 9.3 [*]µeq[*]g− 1 in unbleached CTMP and 21.7 [*]µeq[*]g− 1 in bleached pulp.|$|E

The conditions of the chemical treatment are much less vigorous (lower temperature, shorter time, less extreme pH) than in a chemical pulping process since {{the goal is to}} make the fibres easier to refine, not to remove lignin as in a fully chemical process.

Pectin was immunolocalized using an antibody (JIM 7) specific for partly methyl-esterified polygalacturonan. A fluorescent antibody was linked to JIM 7 and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy. Pectin was found in both <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> in similar uneven patterns: Some fibers showed no labeling, whereas others showed extensive labeling in patches restricted to the fiber surfaces. Pectin labeling of bleached and unbleached kraft pulps did not show any presence of pectin. Labeling was correlated to the presence of compound middle lamella tissue left on the CTMP-treated surfaces. Pectin on pulp-fiber surfaces may affect the interfiber bonds and thereby the pulp properties.|$|R

40|$|The light-induced {{brightness}} reversion {{of different}} types of unbleached and bleached high-yield pulps was studied under both accelerated and long-term ambient light-induced ageing conditions. It was found that accelerated ageing conditions that mimic indoor daylight exposures overestimate the yellowing tendencies of hardwood high-yield pulps (especially aspen pulps) compared to long-term ambient aging with no indirect sunlight present. It was, however, possible to predict the yellowing characteristics of softwood high-yield pulps. The lignin content of the pulps was found to be strongly correlated with the degree of photo-yellowing in the case of long-term ambient light-induced ageing. The presence of small amounts of birch <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> in a fine paper furnish resulted in extensive light-induced discoloration.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} method {{making it possible}} to study the reflectance/transmittance of thin coating layers and to link this to the inhibition of the light-induced yellowing, was used to describe the photo-stabilising properties of different types of commercial kaolin and calcium carbonate pigments. A base paper produced from a hydrogen-peroxide-bleached birch <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> was used throughout the study. The transmittance of the coating layers in the UV-region (300 - 385 nm) was found to be very low (below 1. 0 % at coat weights < 5 g/m 2) for all of the tested pigments, it strongly depends on the coat weight especially for coat weights below 10 g/m 2. The kaolin pigments examined were found to be better in inhibiting the brightness reversion compared to the calcium carbonate pigments, even though the differences between the pigment types were only a few brightness units. The coating layer was, however, able to conceal some of the colour formed through the light-induce brightness reversion. For example, a coating layer consisting of kaolin pigments (coat weight of 15. 6 g/m 2) could conceal about 30 % of the discoloration of the CTMP base paper...|$|E

Pulp total weight loss, lignin loss, and cellulose loss were determined to compare the different enzymes secreted by the three fungal strains. Pulp physical strengths, optical properties, and bleachability after the {{fungal treatment}} were investigated to compare the effect of fungal treatment on the pulp quality improvement. The results show that lignin reduction by both T. h- 19 - 6 and T. h- 19 - 6 (w) was about {{twice as much as}} that by P. c- 1767. However, the selectivity of T. h- 19 - 6 (w) towards lignin over cellulose was only 0. 82, while that of T. h- 19 - 6 was as high as 4. 43.

50|$|Chemical pulping {{achieves}} this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules {{which can}} be washed away from the cellulose fibres without depolymerizing the cellulose fibres (chemically depolymerizing the cellulose weakens the fibres). The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical (RMP) pulping, physically tear the cellulose fibres one from another. Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres. Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. Related hybrid pulping methods {{use a combination of}} chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres. These hybrid methods include thermomechanical <b>pulping</b> (TMP) and <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (<b>CTMP).</b> The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.|$|R

In the case of wood–plastic composites (WPC), the produc-tion of WPC with long fibers has been neglected, because they are difficult to handle with current production equip-ment. This study provides {{a better understanding of}} the effect of fiber length on WPC processing and properties. The objectives of this study were therefore to determine the role of fiber length in the formation process and prop-erty development of WPC. Three <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> with different lengths, distributions, and length-to-diameter ratios (L/D) were obtained by mech-anical refining. Length, shape, and distribution were char-acterized using a fiber quality analyzer (FQA). The rheometer torque properties of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) filled with the pulps at different loads were stud-ied. Variations in fiber load and length distribution resulted in significant variations in melting properties and torque characteristics.

The consequence of the varied fungal pretreatment on a subsequent <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> was addressed. In all cultures, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and xylanase were the predominant extracellular enzymes. The biopulping efficiency was evaluated based {{on the amount of}} fiber bundles obtained after the first fiberizing step and the fibrillation levels of refined pulps. It was found that the MnP levels in the cultures correlated positively with the biopulping benefits. On the other hand, xylanase and total oxalate levels did not vary significantly. Accordingly, {{it was not possible to}} determine whether MnP accomplishes the effect alone or depends on synergic action of other extracellular agents. Pulp strength and fiber size distribution were also evaluated. The average fiber length of <b>CTMP</b> <b>pulps</b> prepared from untreated wood chips was 623 mu m. Analogous values were observed for most of the biopulps; however, significant amounts of shorter fibers were found in the biopulp prepared from wood chips biotreated in cultures supplemented with glucose plus corn-steep liquor.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the optical properties of <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> from Eucalyptus camaldulensis, {{one group of}} samples of CTMP was aged by heating, and another group was first subjected to bleaching with different bleaching agents, and then aging by exposure to sunlight. Chromophores were analyzed using diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra (DRUV), and the brightness and color parameters (L*, a*, b*) were analyzed using colorimetry. Results showed that the color reactions of the pulp, upon heating, were enhanced {{in the presence of}} moisture. There was a linear relationship between the pulp initial moisture content (MC) and the intensity of UV-Vis absorption. The contribution of different chromophores to pulp color was analyzed with the help of bleaching agents: hydrogen peroxide, sodium dithionite, and sodium borohydride. Sodium borohydride and hydrogen peroxide treatments resulted in a decrease in the absorption band at 280 nm along with the shoulder near 320 nm, which could be attributed to conjugated C=O and C=C systems. Similarly, sodium dithionite treatment also led to a decrease in absorption of the carbonyls and double bonds conjugated with aromatic double bonds. The chromaticity parameters of bleached pulp increased after exposure to sunlight. A correspondingly higher concentration of quinoid structures was found...|$|E

Fiber sludge, a waste stream from pulp and paper mills, was enzymatically hydrolyzed to sugar, which was used for the production of BNC by the submerged cultivation of Komagataeibacter xylinus. Compared with a synthetic glucose-based medium, the productivity of purified BNC from the fiber sludge hydrolysate using shake-flasks was enhanced from 0. 11 to 0. 17 g/(L × d), although the average viscometric degree of polymerization (DPv) decreased from 6760 to 6050. The cultivation conditions used in stirred-tank reactors (STRs), including the stirring speed, the airflow, and the pH, were also investigated. Using STRs, the BNC productivity in fiber-sludge medium was increased to 0. 32 g/(L × d) and the DPv was increased to 6650. BNC produced from the fiber sludge hydrolysate was used as an additive in papermaking based on the <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> of birch.

40|$|The modern {{concept of}} "biorefinery" is dominantly based on {{chemical}} pulp mills {{to create more}} value than cellulose pulp fibres, and energy from the dissolved lignins and hemicelluloses. This concept {{is characterized by the}} conversion of biomass into various biobased products. It includes thermochemical processes such as gasification and fast pyrolysis. In mechanical pulp mills, the feedstock available to the gasification-based biorefinery is significant, including logging residues, bark, fibre material rejects, biosludges and other available fuels such as peat, recycled wood, and paper products. This work is to study co-production of bio-automotive fuels, biopower, and steam via gasification {{in the context of the}} mechanical pulp industry.   Biomass gasification with steam in a dual-fluidized bed gasifier (DFBG) was simulated with ASPEN Plus. From the model, the yield and composition of the syngas and the contents of tar and char can be calculated. The model has been evaluated against the experimental results measured on a 150 KWth Mid Sweden University (MIUN) DFBG. The model predicts that the content of char transferred from the gasifier to the combustor decreases from 22. 5 wt. % of the dry and ash-free biomass at gasification temperature 750 ℃ to 11. 5 wt. % at 950 ℃, but is insensitive to the mass ratio of steam to biomass (S/B). The H 2 concentration is higher than that of CO under normal DFBG operating conditions, but they will change positions when the gasification temperature is too high above about 950 ℃, or the S/B ratio is too far below about 0. 15. The biomass moisture content is a key parameter for a DFBG to be operated and maintained at a high gasification temperature. The model suggests that it is difficult to keep the gasification temperature above 850 ℃ when the biomass moisture content is higher than 15. 0 wt. %. Thus, a certain amount of biomass needs to be added in the combustor to provide sufficient heat for biomass devolatilization and steam reforming. Tar content in the syngas can also be predicted from the model, which shows a decreasing trend of the tar with the gasification temperature and the S/B ratio. The tar content in the syngas decreases significantly with gasification residence time which is a key parameter.   Mechanical pulping processes, as Thermomechanical pulp (TMP), Groundwood (SGW and PGW), and <b>Chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> processes have very high wood-to-pulp yields. Producing pulp products by means of these processes is a prerequisite for the production of printing paper and paperboard products due especially to their important functional properties such as printability and stiffness. However, mechanical pulping processes consume a great amount of electricity, which may account for up to 40 % of the total pulp production cost. In mechanical pulping mills, wood (biomass) residues are commonly utilized for electricity production through an associated combined heat and power (CHP) plant. This techno-economic evaluation deals with the possibility of utilizing a biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) plant in place of the CHP plant. Integration of a BIGCC plant into a mechanical pulp production line might greatly improve the overall energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially when the flow of biomass (such as branches and tree tops) from the forest is increased. When the fibre material that negatively affects pulp properties is utilized as a bioenergy resource, the overall efficiency of the system is further improved. A TMP+BIGCC mathematic model is developed based on ASPEN Plus. By means of this model, three cases are studied:   1) adding more forest biomass logging residues in the gasifier, 2) adding a reject fraction of low quality pulp fibers to the gasifier, and 3) decreasing the TMP-specific electricity consumption (SEC) by up to 50 %.   For the TMP+BIGCC mill, the energy supply and consumption are analyzed in comparison with a TMP+CHP mill. The production profit and the internal rate of return (IRR) are calculated. The results quantify the economic benefit from the TMP+BIGCC mill.   Bio-ethanol has received considerable attention as a basic chemical and fuel additive. It is currently produced from sugar/starch materials, but can also be produced from lignocellulosic biomass via a hydrolysis [...] fermentation or thermo-chemical route. In terms of the thermo-chemical route, a few pilot plants ranging from 0. 3 to 67 MW have been built and operated for alcohols synthesis. However, commercial success has not been achieved. In order to realize cost-competitive commercial ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass through a thermo-chemical pathway, a techno-economic analysis needs to be done.   In this work, a thermo-chemical process is designed, simulated, and optimized mainly with ASPEN Plus. The techno-economic assessment is made in terms of ethanol yield, synthesis selectivity, carbon and CO conversion efficiencies, and ethanol production cost.   Calculated results show that major contributions to the production cost are from biomass feedstock and syngas cleaning.

40|$|The {{development}} of new antimicrobial active packaging systems have been gaining a raising interest due to its potential to increase product shelf-life and provide food quality and safety benefits allied to society demands on food-related health risks, multi-drug resistance and environmental problems. A great variety of organic substances such as phenolic compounds and essential oils as well as inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles such as Ag+, ZnO and TiO 2 have been intensively studied for having antimicrobial properties, although their efficiency is highly dependent on the target microorganisms, the material or media where they act {{as well as the}} surrounding environment are relevant (Burt, 2004; Suppakul et al., 2003; Visai et al., 2011). Recent research in active packaging is mostly focused on the use of natural renewable material resources including preservatives to develop biodegradable and recyclable packaging products. Accordingly, the NEWGENPAK project was funded within ITN-Marie Skłodowska-Curie EU program with the aim “to take wood cellulose based material a significant step forward by replacing petroleum-based additives used in paper and board packaging materials in order to achieve the barrier and other crucial properties needed for competitive, low carbon footprint, packaging materials”. NEWGENPAK, the acronym for New Generation of Cellulose Fibre Based Packaging Materials for Sustainability, just finished in December 2015, was an interdisciplinary research training network (ITN) constituted by 8 European universities, 3 research institutes and 6 enterprises from all over Europe, with 13 researchers working full time developing their own individual researcher projects, making collaborations and receiving training on the field. This PhD thesis was carried out within this project and developed mainly at Innovhub SSI – Paper Division, Milan, Italy. The main target of this work was to attain antibacterial cellulose-based materials for food packaging applications, following two approaches based in the incorporation of active organic components or active nanoparticles as active agents. Besides, it was studied the possibility to develop an antibacterial packaging for medical applications, in order to prevent medical cross contamination. The fate of the nanoparticles in the recycling process and their effect on the biodegradability of the packaging was initially assessed as an important part of environmental aspects related to the end of life of packaging products. The first approach, described in the chapter 2, aimed to explore the possibilities to extract polyphenols from black tea brewing residues and use them as active compounds for the {{development of}} active cellulosic-based surfaces. Therefore, the chemical characterization of black tea residues as well as the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of their extracts were addressed. The best infusion conditions, considering the yield of extraction, the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content, were found to be at 80 ºC for 7. 5 minutes for an infusion of 2. 5 g of tea residue in 100 mL of water, and just 1. 1 mg of these extract where enough to provide a bactericidal effect. The resulting paper coated with 3. 8 g/m 2 of polyphenols-based coating formulation attained a complete killing effect against S. aureus. In the second approach, several papers were functionalized with formulations based on photo-active TiO 2 NPs by dip-coating and compared regarding their antibacterial activity. The results presented in the chapter 3 have shown that both handsheets of bleached Kraft pulp (BK) and <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> displayed a bactericidal effect against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, even after three weeks of storage either in light and dark conditions, while pre-coated recycled paper (PCR) and bleached pre-coated Kraft (BPK) paper samples did not shown any antibacterial activity. The effect of TiO 2 NPs against S. aureus was inhibited in: i) PCR samples due to the presence of considerable amounts of inorganic compounds, such as calcium carbonate, that shielded the effect of active nanoparticles; and ii) BPK samples, most likely due to their high hydrophobicity that did not permit a good retention of the NPs and homogenous coating distribution. Accordingly, different preparation methods and deposition techniques were considered for hydrophobic surfaces and compared regarding the amount of TiO 2 incorporated in nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) loaded and finally retained on the BPK paper surfaces. Under the best conditions with the polyelectrolyte-assisted deposition 90 % of nanoparticles retention was attained against only 25 % for the direct-mixture formulations. The antibacterial activity of the paper samples reached approximately 2 log bacterial reduction of S. aureus showing the possibility to achieve a contact active surface based on layer-by layer assembly NFC-TiO 2 formulation. Moreover a scale-up pilot demonstration of an over-print varnish based on ZnO nanoparticles was performed to be loaded by flexographic printing at industrial scale for medical packaging applications. The SAFEBOX packaging demonstrator produced was loaded with only 5. 6 mg/m 2 of ZnO NPs based varnish, due to some technical production constraints and restrictions, therefore it presented a slightly bacteriostatic effect with less than one log reduction. However, with the possibility {{to increase the amount of}} NPs loaded on the paper surface, promising results can be achieved. Preliminary results obtained at lab scale showed a bactericidal effect, up to 4 log reduction, for papers with about 1, 5 g/m 2 of ZnO NPs on the surface. Regarding the preliminary studies on environmental impact of NPs, towards packaging end-of-life options presented also in the chapter 3, laboratory tests have shown only marginal effect of active ingredients on biodegradability performance whereas recyclability tests have shown a reasonable good retention of TiO 2 nanoparticles (approximately 90 %) in the recycled fibres after one recycling loop...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical pulps {{are used}} in paper {{products}} such as magazine or news grade printing papers or paperboard. Mechanical pulping gives a high yield; nearly everything in the tree except the bark {{is used in the}} paper. This means that mechanical pulping consumes much less wood than chemical pulping, especially to produce a unit area of printing surface. A drawback of mechanical pulp production is the high amounts of electrical energy needed to separate and refine the fibers to a given fiber quality. Mechanical pulps are often produced from slow growing spruce trees of forests in the northern hemisphere resulting in long, slender fibers that are well suited for mechanical pulp products. These fibers have large varieties in geometry, mainly wall thickness and width, depending on seasonal variations and growth conditions. Earlywood fibers typically have thin walls and latewood fibers thick. The background to this study was that a more detailed fiber characterization involving evaluations of distributions of fiber characteristics, may give improved possibilities to optimize the mechanical pulping process and thereby reduce the total electric energy needed to reach a given quality of the pulp and final product. This would result in improved competitiveness as well as less environmental impact. This study evaluated the relation between fiber characteristics in three types of mechanical pulps made from Norway spruce (Picea abies), thermomechanical pulp(TMP), stone groundwood pulp (SGW) and <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>CTMP).</b> In addition, the influence of fibers from these pulp types on sheet characteristics, mainly tensile index, was studied. A comparatively rapid method was presented on how to evaluate the propensity of each fiber to form sheets of high tensile index, by the use of raw data from a commercially available fiber analyzer (FiberLabTM). The developed method gives novel opportunities of evaluating the effect on the fibers of each stage in the mechanical pulping process and has a potential to be applied also on‐line to steer the refining and pulping process by the characteristics of the final pulp {{and the quality of the}} final paper. The long fiber fraction is important for the properties of the whole pulp. It was found that fiber wall thickness and external fibrillation were the fibercharacteristics that contributed the most to tensile index of the long fiber fractions in five mechanical pulps (three TMPs, one SGW, one CTMP). The tensile index of handsheets of the long fiber fractions could be predicted by linear regressions using a combination of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation. The predicted tensile index was denoted BIN, short for Bonding ability INfluence. This resulted in the same linear correlation between BIN and tensile index for 52 samples of the five mechanical pulps studied, each fractionated into five streams(plus feed) in full size hydrocyclones. The Bauer McNett P 16 /R 30 (passed 16 meshwire, retained on a 30 mesh wire) and P 30 /R 50 fractions of each stream were used for the evaluation. The fibers of the SGW had thicker walls and a higher degree of external fibrillation than the TMPs and CTMP, which resulted in a correlation between BIN and tensile index on a different level for the P 30 /R 50 fraction of SGW than the other pulp samples. A BIN model based on averages weighted by each fiber´s wall volume instead of arithmetic averages, took the fiber wall thickness of the SGW into account, and gave one uniform correlation between BIN and tensile index for all pulp samples (12 samples for constructing the model, 46 for validatingit). If the BIN model is used for predicting averages of the tensile index of a sheet, a model based on wall volume weighted data is recommended. To be able to produce BIN distributions where the influence of the length or wall volume of each fiber is taken into account, the BIN model is currently based on arithmetic averages of fiber wall thickness and fibrillation. Fiber width used as a single factor reduced the accuracy of the BIN model. Wall volume weighted averages of fiber width also resulted in a completely changed ranking of the five hydrocyclone streams compared to arithmetic, for two of thefive pulps. This was not seen when fiber width was combined with fiber wallthickness into the factor “collapse resistance index”. In order to avoid too high influence of fiber wall thickness and until the influence of fiber width on BIN and the measurement of fiber width is further evaluated, it is recommended to use length weighted or arithmetic distributions of BIN and other fiber characteristics. A comparably fast method to evaluate the distribution of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation with high resolution showed that the fiber wallthickness of the latewood fibers was reduced by increasing the refining energy in adouble disc refiner operated at four levels of specific energy input in a commercial TMP production line. This was expected but could not be seen by the use of average values, it was concluded that fiber characteristics in many cases should be evaluated as distributions and not only as averages. BIN distributions of various types of mechanical pulps from Norway spruce showed results that were expected based on knowledge of the particular pulps and processes. Measurements of mixtures of a news‐ and a SC (super calendered) gradeTMP, showed a gradual increase in high‐BIN fibers with higher amounts of SCgrade TMP. The BIN distributions also revealed differences between the pulps that were not seen from average fiber values, for example that the shape of the BINdistributions was similar for two pulps that originated from conical disc refiners, a news grade TMP and the board grade CTMP, although the distributions were on different BIN levels. The SC grade TMP and the SC grade SGW had similar levels of tensile index, but the SGW contained some fibers of very low BIN values which may influence the characteristics of the final paper, for example strength, surface and structure. This shows that the BIN model has the potential of being applied on either the whole or parts of a papermaking process based on mechanical or chemimechanical pulping; the evaluation of distributions of fiber characteristics can contribute to increased knowledge about the process and opportunities to optimize it...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research work was to study the wettability of thermomechanical pulps (TMP) prepared from heart- and sapwood of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris [L. ]). The TMP were prepared at different pulping temperatures (150 °C, 180 °C). Furthermore, thermomechanical (TMP) and chemo-thermomechanical <b>pulps</b> (<b>CTMP)</b> from Norway spruce (Picea abies [Karst. ]) were also investigated. In this case both TMP and CTMP were prepared at 140 °C and 180 °C. Sheets of all pulps were prepared according to a method developed by Roffael et al. (2002). Sheets of TMP pulps from pine sapwood showed much better wettability compared with their counterparts from heartwoods. Pulps from heartwood experienced a dramatic decrease in their wettability when increasing the pulping temperature from 150 °C to 180 °C. In contrast increasing the temperature from 150 ° to 180 °C {{seems to have no}} deleterious effect on the wettability of pulps prepared from sapwood. This phenomenon has been explained by the higher extractive content in pine wood. Comparing TMP and <b>CTMP</b> <b>pulps</b> from Norway spruce leads to the result that in general <b>CTMP</b> <b>pulps</b> are of higher wettability.

The results reveal that MDF made from CTMP of waste particle- and fibreboards meet the standards according to EN 622 - 5, type MDF. The bending strength and internal bond of MDF made from industrial TMP is higher compared with MDF from chemo-thermo-mechanical pulps from waste panels. However, the thickness swelling of MDF made from pulps derived from waste panels is clearly lower compared with that of MDF made from industrial TMP.

This study investigates the frictional behavior of both native and chemically treated birch under simulated chip-refining conditions (hot saturated steam, high sliding speed). Chip pretreatment, i. e. chemical impregnation and pre-heating done when birch <b>chemithermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> is produced, affects energy consumption during refining; {{the study found that}} frictional forces may be an important parameter in this respect. The coefficient of friction peaks at approximately 115 °C for both native and extracted birch. It was shown that sulfonating native birch decreased its coefficient of friction over the temperature range investigated (100 � 170 °C). The coefficient of friction had a broad and flat peak in the 130 � 150 °C temperature interval for the specimens treated with 3 % sodium sulfite at pH 13. 5. Furthermore, it was clear that pH had a profound influence on the coefficient of friction. A high pH lowered the coefficient of friction, likely due to well lubricated contacts. The friction arising between birch (Betula verrucosa) and steel was shown to be higher than that between spruce (Picea abies) and steel. The higher stiffness and density of the birch wood, together with a more porous bulk structure leading to rough test surfaces, are some factors possibly accounting for these high friction coefficients. Also, the differences in the amount and composition of the extractive substances in birch and spruce may contribute to the differing frictional behaviors of these species...|$|R

As a major component of anionic DCS, polygalacturonic acids can be effectively degraded during pectinase treatment. Therefore, the efficiency of cationic polymers improved, and subsequently they were able to fix the destabilized sticky particles on the fibers, which led to the decrease of stickies deposition. However, the pectinase treatment of DCS insignificantly affected stickies deposition in absence of cationic polymers when the stickies deposition was caused by calcium ions...|$|R
