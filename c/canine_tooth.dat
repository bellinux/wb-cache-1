5|$|Lemurs are unusual {{since they}} have great {{variability}} in their social structure, yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of true lemur (genus Eulemur), the gray-headed lemur (E. albocollaris) and the red lemur (E. rufus), exhibit size differences in canine teeth. True lemurs show sexual dichromatism (sexual differences in fur coloration), but {{the difference between the}} genders varies from strikingly obvious, as in the blue-eyed black lemur (E. macaco), to nearly imperceptible {{in the case of the}} common brown lemur (E. fulvus).|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge {{on the side of}} its front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression that becomes wider {{near the top of the}} tooth, which is probably the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Salanoia durrelli has a {{more robust}} {{dentition}} than the brown-tailed mongoose; the teeth have larger surface areas. The first and second upper incisors are smaller than the third, which is separated by a pronounced diastema (gap) from the <b>canine</b> <b>tooth.</b> The canine is more robust than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The first upper premolar is small, but {{the second and third}} are larger; these two teeth are shorter and broader than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The fourth premolar is large, as is the first molar. The second upper molar is less than one-third the size of the first, and is more highly reduced than that of the brown-tailed mongoose, which is about two-thirds the size of the first molar. The first lower incisor is smaller than the other two. The lower canine, premolars, and first molar are well-developed. The second molar is broad, but smaller than in the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
50|$|Propliopithecus {{had small}} <b>canine</b> <b>teeth,</b> lacked spaces {{to fit the}} <b>canine</b> <b>teeth</b> of the other jaw into, and had molars {{very similar to those}} of Australopithecus. These {{features}} set Propliopithecus apart from Aegyptopithecus, which had big <b>canine</b> <b>teeth</b> along with other more normal simian dental features.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the incisors, premolars and molars, some, but not all, horses may also have <b>canine</b> <b>teeth</b> and wolf teeth. A horse can have between zero and four <b>canine</b> <b>teeth,</b> also known as tusks (tushes for the deciduous precursor), with a clear prevalence towards male horses (stallions and geldings) who normally have {{a full set of}} four. Fewer than 28% of female horses (mares) have any <b>canine</b> <b>teeth.</b> Those that do normally only have one or two, and these may by only partially erupted.|$|R

5|$|The {{difference}} between {{the male and female}} of a species apart from their sex organs is called sexual dimorphism, and in this regard little variance exists among the canids. A study of dire wolf remains dated 15,360–14,310YBP and taken from one pit that focused on skull length, <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> size, and lower molar length showed little dimorphism, {{similar to that of the}} gray wolf, indicating that dire wolves lived in monogamous pairs. Their large size and highly carnivorous dentition supports the proposal that the dire wolf was a predator that fed on large prey. To kill ungulates larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey, and they work together as a pack consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. It can be assumed that dire wolves lived in packs of relatives that were led by an alpha pair. Large and social carnivores would have been successful at defending carcasses of prey trapped in the tar pits from smaller solitary predators, and thus the most likely to become trapped themselves. The many C.d.guildayi and Smilodon remains found in the tar pits suggests that both were social predators.|$|E

500|$|The French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville first {{identified}} the two lateral {{teeth of the}} lemuriform toothcomb as canines in 1840. [...] <b>Canine</b> <b>teeth</b> are normally used to pierce or grasp objects. [...] With modified lower <b>canine</b> <b>teeth,</b> the first lower premolars following the toothcomb are usually shaped like typical <b>canine</b> <b>teeth</b> (caniniform) and assume their function. These premolars are commonly confused with canines. [...] Normally the true canines in the lower jaw {{sit in front of}} the upper canines, and in toothcombed primates, the caniniform premolars rest behind it.|$|R

25|$|The Lady {{has several}} missing teeth {{due to her}} facial injury. Her left {{alveolar}} plate and part of her left jaw were fractured, explaining {{what happened to her}} teeth. One tooth is visible within her mouth. The fracture involved most of her left alveolar plate distal to the left first incisor. This incisor is among the missing teeth. The right alveolar plate is in a better condition, though the sockets of the first incisor and the right <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> are empty, with these teeth missing. The rest of the teeth are still present, including an nonerupted third molar (wisdom tooth).|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} the night in Grimshank's room and waking up as humans, Kröd and his men steal the vial of tears, throw the <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> {{out the window and}} tie up Grimshank. Kröd reveals to Aneka (India de Beaufort) and Ralph Longshaft (James Murray) that Grimshank is a traitor, but Grimshank insists he had to do it so that he could get close to Dongalor and stop him. Aneka is thrilled Kröd is still alive, but when Longshaft reveals that he and Aneka have been having sex, a disheartened Kröd gives him the Pagan tears, much to Grimshank's horror. Suddenly, Dongalor arrives with his army and Longshaft, who reveals himself to be the true traitor, gives him the tears. Kröd says the tears are fake and that he simply was trying to expose the real traitor, but Dongalor calls out his guards and takes the real tears from Kröd (Krod tries to swallow the vial, but ends up choking it up into Dongalor's hands: Aneka, Longshaft and Dongalor's advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) then make cutting remarks about what he could have done with the vial). An annoyed Grimshank explains he planned to give the tears to Dongalor then use his powers to turn the weapon against him, but that he is now powerless without his <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> and cannot help. However, Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce arrive to fend off the guards and a battle ensues.|$|E
25|$|The {{fracture}} of mandible involved the midline and the adjacent {{part of the}} left mandible. Her right and left first incisors and the left <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> were affected by this fracture. The sockets of the right second incisor, the left first molar, and the left second molar are empty, with these teeth missing. The first and second left upper molars are partially fractured. Both {{the right and the}} left upper third molars are nonerupted. Conversely, the Lady's upper right canine, premolars, first molar, and second molar are still present. This group of teeth has no visible attrition, and no occlusal irregularity of their surface.|$|E

25|$|The reduced {{degree of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} is primarily {{visible in the}} reduction of the male <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> relative to other ape species (except gibbons). Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of hidden estrus. Humans are the only ape in which the female is fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as genital swelling during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together have been interpreted {{as a result of an}} increased emphasis on pair bonding as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.|$|E
25|$|Kröd Mändoon (Sean Maguire) and {{his friends}} Loquasto (Steve Speirs), Zezelryck (Kevin Hart) and Bruce (Marques Ray), having survived an {{explosion}} during a secret mission, find a notice that Dongalor (Matt Lucas) has declared victory following Kröd's death and offered amnesty (and a free mule) to freedom fighters who surrender. Since the warlock Grimshank (John Rhys-Davies) was the only resistance fighter who knew of Kröd's mission, they realize he is a double agent. After seeking advice from his ex-wife Agnes Grimshank (Janine Duvitski), they learn Grimshank is powerless without the <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> he wears upon a waist chain. Agnes turns the foursome into dogs so they can sneak into the castle and get close to Grimshank. They arrive at his room and learn he has acquired Pagan tears, the last ingredient needed to activate Dongalor's ancient weapon, the Eye of Gulga Grymna.|$|E

As in all other crown strepsirrhines, their lower incisors and canine are procumbent (lie down and face outwards), forming a toothcomb, which is used for {{personal}} and social grooming and feeding. The toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or [...] "under-tongue", a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. [...] The sublingua extends below the tip of the tongue and is tipped with keratinized, serrated points that rake [...] between the front teeth.|$|E
500|$|The dire wolf {{was about}} {{the same size as the}} largest modern gray wolves (Canis lupus), which are the Yukon wolf and the northwestern wolf. C.d.guildayi weighed on average [...] and C.d.dirus was on average [...] Its skull and {{dentition}} matched those of C.lupus, but its teeth were larger with greater shearing ability, and its bite force at the <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> was the strongest of any known Canis species. These characteristics are thought to be adaptations for preying on Late Pleistocene megaherbivores, and in North America its prey are known to have included horses, ground sloths, mastodons, bison, and camels. As with other large Canis hypercarnivores today, the dire wolf is thought to have been a pack hunter. Its extinction occurred during the Quaternary extinction event along with most of the American megafauna of the time, including a number of other carnivores, that occurred soon after the appearance of humans in the New World. Its reliance on megaherbivores has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the cause remains controversial. Dire wolves lived as recently as 9,440 years ago, according to dated remains.|$|E

500|$|Ocepeia {{was first}} {{described}} and named in 2001 by Gheerbrandt and Dr. Jean Sudre (University of Montpellier) {{based on two}} lower jaw fragments assigned to the new species O. daouiensis: one (designated CPSGM-MA1), bearing a premolar and first molar, is the holotype for the species. Additional material assigned to O. daouiensis was described in 2010, including a near-complete left lower jaw bone and additional dental fragments. [...] In 2014, new specimens of O. daouiensis were described including a partial skull, upper jaw, and additional teeth, allowing for a complete reconstruction of what the intact skull looked like. The diversity of specimens, combined with CT scans of the partial skull, allowed for a much more detailed and comprehensive description. Additionally, new lower jaw fragments with larger teeth led to the description of O. grandis, whose holotype (designated MNHN.F PM37) bears a <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> and full set of cheek teeth. As of 2014, the skull of Ocepeia is the best-known mammal skull from the Paleocene of Africa (other species are only known from teeth or lower jaws), {{as well as the}} oldest known skull of any afrotherian.|$|E

[...] Around 400 journalists visited the Berlin Zoo on what was dubbed [...] "Knut Day" [...] to report on the cub's first public appearance to a worldwide audience. [...] Because Knut became the focus of worldwide media at a very young age, many stories and false alarms regarding the cub's health and well-being were circulated during his first year. [...] For example, on 16 April 2007, Knut was removed from display due to teething pains resulting from the growth of his right upper <b>canine</b> <b>tooth,</b> but initial reports vaguely stated that he was suffering from an unknown illness and subsequently put on antibiotics. [...] Much ado was also made about a death threat that was sent shortly before 15:00 local time on Wednesday 18 April 2007. [...] The zoo had received an anonymous letter by fax which said [...] "Knut ist tot! Donnerstag Mittag." [...] ("Knut is dead! Thursday noon.") In response, the police increased their security measures around the bear. The time frame for the threat passed without incident or harm to Knut.|$|E
500|$|All of the extinct subfossil lemurs, {{including}} the smallest species (Pachylemur, Mesopropithecus, {{and the giant}} aye-aye), were larger than the lemur species alive today. The largest species were among the largest primates ever to have evolved. Due to their larger size, the extinct subfossil lemurs have been compared to large-bodied anthropoids (monkeys and apes), yet they more closely resemble the small-bodied lemurs. [...] Like other lemurs, the subfossil lemurs did not exhibit appreciable differences in body or <b>canine</b> <b>tooth</b> size {{between males and females}} (sexual dimorphism). [...] This suggests that they, too, exhibited female social dominance, possibly exhibiting the same levels of agonism (aggressive competition) seen in extant lemurs. [...] Like other lemurs, they had smaller brains than comparably sized anthropoids. [...] Most species also had a unique strepsirrhine dental trait, called a toothcomb, which is used for grooming. Even tooth development and weaning was rapid compared to similarly sized anthropoids, suggesting faster sexual maturity of their offspring. Most subfossil lemurs also had high retinal summation (sensitivity to low light), resulting in poor day vision (low visual acuity) compared to anthropoids. This has been demonstrated by the ratio between their relatively small orbits (eye sockets) and the relative size of their optic canal, which is comparable to that of other lemurs, not diurnal anthropoids.|$|E

40|$|Background: The present {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} determine the location and severity of root resorption associated with impacted maxillary <b>canine</b> <b>teeth</b> using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). A secondary aim was to identify possible influencing factors. Methods: The radiological reports of 183 patients, radiographed with a small-volume CBCT focussed on the impacted maxillary <b>canine</b> <b>teeth,</b> were assessed. Eighty-five patients had resorption associated with the impaction. The CBCT image datasets were viewed to determine the location and severity of the lesions. Results: A total of 110 impacted maxillary <b>canine</b> <b>teeth</b> resorbed 120 adjacent teeth, including 14 premolars and one permanent molar. The apical third and palatal surface were commonly involved. Fifty per cent of the resorptive lesions were mild, 20 % moderate and 30 % severe. There was no significant relation between age or gender on the number, location or severity of resorption. There was a statistically significant correlation {{between the number of}} impacted <b>canine</b> <b>teeth</b> and the number of teeth resorbed, as well as the tooth type and the surface involved in the resorption. Conclusions: All root levels and surfaces of teeth associated with impacted maxillary <b>canine</b> <b>teeth</b> can be resorbed to different levels of severity. Neither age nor gender influences the number, location or severity of the resorption. Esma J. Doğramacı, Martyn Sherriff, Giampiero Rossi-Fedele, and Fraser McDonal...|$|R
