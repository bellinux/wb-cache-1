5|$|Egypt's {{first ever}} Olympic {{competitor}} in <b>canoe</b> <b>and</b> kayak, Mostafa Mansour, {{qualified for the}} 2012 Games. Having taken up the sport in 2007, after abandoning his initial pursuit of rowing, Mansour qualified for the K-1 200 metres by coming in third in the event at the 2011 All-Africa Games. The Olympic spots were originally meant {{to go to the}} top two finishers, Greg Louw of South Africa and Mohamed Mrabet of Tunisia, but South Africa did not select Louw for the Games. Mansour's best time in the K-1 1000 metres earned him a spot in that event as a continental wildcard. He was eliminated in the opening round of both events in London, after finishing last in his heats.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) plans a woodshop {{expansion}} {{in his home}} and seeks the approval of city planner Mark (Paul Schneider). Mark informs Ron that an inspection is needed {{to ensure that the}} facility meets all current zoning code standards, and an obviously lying Ron claims it does, clearly underscoring his vexation with governmental regulations. During the inspection, Mark finds numerous code violations, including oily rags placed above a wood-burning fireplace and a long-outdated fire extinguisher. Later, Mark takes a half-day off so that he can help his friend's woodshop meet city code. Ron thanks Mark by building a wooden <b>canoe</b> <b>and</b> leaving it in his office.|$|E

5|$|The friars {{returned}} in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ek' welcomed {{them in a}} friendly manner, {{but this time the}} Maya priesthood were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors, and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting <b>canoe</b> <b>and</b> instructed to leave and never return. Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to Mérida.|$|E

5|$|These {{crossings}} passed {{across a}} true marsh, {{either side of}} the River Lea. This wide, fast flowing river was then tidal as far as Hackney Wick, and navigable as far as Hertfordshire. Dates for the earliest use of the rivers by boats are unknown, although a late Bronze Age dugout <b>canoe</b> <b>and</b> parts of a Saxon barge have been found in the marshes at Walthamstow. The first alteration to the natural river may have been made by Alfred the Great, who cut another channel to strand a force of Danes in 896, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. This lowered the tide head to Old Ford, and prevented large boats sailing the river until the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{arrived at}} Maracaibo {{to find the}} city largely deserted, its {{residents}} having been forewarned of his approach by the fortress's troops. He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, {{and some of the}} remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden. Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by <b>canoe</b> <b>and</b> assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1502, {{during his}} fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, {{one of the}} Bay Islands {{off the coast of}} Honduras. He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island. As Bartholomew explored, a large trading canoe approached. Bartholomew Columbus boarded the <b>canoe,</b> <b>and</b> found it was a Maya trading vessel from Yucatán, {{carrying}} well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes – the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan, the northern Maya feathered serpent god, were probably recorded around this time, and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam.|$|E

5|$|The Final Fantasy {{series and}} several {{specific}} games within {{it have been}} credited for introducing and popularizing many concepts that are today widely used in console RPGs. The original title is often cited {{as one of the}} most influential early console RPGs, and played a major role in legitimizing and popularizing the genre. Many console RPGs featured one-on-one battles against monsters from a first-person perspective. Final Fantasy introduced a side view perspective with groups of monsters against a group of characters that has been frequently used. It also introduced an early evolving class change system, as well as different methods of transportation, including a ship, <b>canoe,</b> <b>and</b> flying airship. Final FantasyII was the first sequel in the industry to omit characters and locations from the previous title. It also introduced an activity-based progression system, which has been used in later RPG series such as SaGa, Grandia, and The Elder Scrolls. Final Fantasy III introduced the job system, a character progression engine allowing the player to change character classes, as well as acquire new and advanced classes and combine class abilities, at any time during the game. Final Fantasy IV is considered a milestone for the genre, introducing a dramatic storyline with a strong emphasis on character development and personal relationships. Final FantasyVII is credited as having the largest industry impact of the series, and with allowing console role-playing games to gain mass-market appeal.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting the}} near-ruined town of Melmond, the Light Warriors {{go to the}} Earth Cave to defeat a vampire and {{retrieve}} the Star Ruby, which gains passage to Sage Sadda's cave. With Sadda's Rod, the Warriors venture deeper into the Earth Cave and destroy the Earth Fiend, Lich. The Light Warriors then obtain a <b>canoe</b> <b>and</b> enter Gurgu Volcano and defeat the Fire Fiend, Kary. The Levistone from the nearby Ice Cave allows them to raise an airship to reach the northern continents. After they prove their courage by retrieving the Rat's Tail from the Castle of Ordeal, the King of the Dragons, Bahamut, promotes each Light Warrior. A kind gesture is repaid by a fairy, receiving special liquid that produces oxygen, and the Warriors use it to help defeat the Water Fiend, Kraken, in the Sunken Shrine. They also recover a Slab, which allows a linguist named Dr. Unne to teach them the Lefeinish language. The Lefeinish give the Light Warriors access to the Floating Castle that Tiamat, the Wind Fiend, has taken over. With the Four Fiends defeated and the Orbs restored, a portal opens in the Temple of Fiends which takes them 2000 years into the past. There the Warriors discover that the Four Fiends sent Garland (now the archdemon Chaos) {{back in time and}} he sent the Fiends to the future to do so, creating a time loop by which he could live forever. The Light Warriors defeat Chaos, thus ending the paradox, and return home. By ending the paradox, however, the Light Warriors have changed the future to one where their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend.|$|E
