60|$|The {{condition}} of the archives at the Department of State calls for the early action of Congress. The building now rented by that Department is a frail structure, at an inconvenient distance from the Executive Mansion and from the other Departments, is ill adapted to the purpose {{for which it is}} used, has not capacity to accommodate the archives, and is not fireproof. Its remote situation, its slender construction, and the absence of a supply of water in the neighborhood leave but little hope of safety for either the building or its contents in case of the accident of a fire. Its destruction would involve the loss of the rolls containing the original acts and resolutions of Congress, of the historic records of the Revolution and of the Confederation, of the whole series of diplomatic and <b>consular</b> <b>archives</b> since the adoption of the Constitution, and of the many other valuable records and papers left with that Department when it was the principal depository of the governmental archives. I recommend an appropriation {{for the construction of a}} building for the Department of State.|$|E

"Not at all," [...] replied Mr. Ferris, {{putting on}} his gloves; [...] "I am a painter by profession, and I amuse myself with consuling;" [...] [Footnote: Since these words of Mr. Ferris were first printed, I {{have been told that}} a more eminent painter, namely Rubens, made very much the same reply to very much the same remark, when Spanish Ambassador in England. [...] "The Ambassador of His Catholic Majesty, I see, amuses himself by {{painting}} sometimes," [...] said a visitor who found him at his easel. [...] "I amuse myself by playing the ambassador sometimes," [...] answered Rubens. In spite of the similarity of the speeches, I let that of Mr. Ferris stand, for I am satisfied {{that he did not know}} how unhandsomely Rubens had taken the words out of his mouth.] and as so open a matter needed no explanation, he said no more about it. Nor is it quite necessary to tell how, as he was one day painting in New York, it occurred to him to make use of a Congressional friend, and ask for some Italian consulate, he did not care which. That of Venice happened to be vacant: the income was a few hundred dollars; as no one else wanted it, no question was made of Mr. Ferris's fitness for the post, and he presently found himself possessed of a commission requesting the Emperor of Austria to permit him to enjoy and exercise the office of consul of the ports of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, to which the President of the United States appointed him from a special trust in his abilities and integrity. He proceeded at once to his post of duty, called upon the ship's chandler with whom they had been left, for the <b>consular</b> <b>archives,</b> and began to paint some Venetian subjects.|$|E
50|$|As {{a matter}} of U.S. policy, honorary {{consular}} officers recognized by the U.S. Government are American citizens, or permanent resident aliens who perform consular services on a part-time basis. The limited immunity afforded honorary consular officers is specified in Article 71 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR). Such individuals do not enjoy personal inviolability, and may be arrested pending trial if circumstances should otherwise warrant. However, appropriate steps are provided to accord to such officers the protection required {{by virtue of their}} official position. In addition, the <b>consular</b> <b>archives</b> and documents of a consular post headed by an honorary consular officer are inviolable at all times, and wherever they may be, provided they are kept separate from other papers and documents of a private or commercial nature relating to other activities of an honorary consular officer or persons working with that consular officer.|$|E
500|$|The {{method of}} record keeping, however, was cumbersome, having {{remained}} the same since John Quincy Adams. Rather than world regions, countries were listed in alphabetical order; the correspondence was embedded in bound diplomatic and <b>consular</b> category <b>archives,</b> rather than by subject matter. [...] Added to countries' information was a miscellaneous category filed chronologically. [...] This resulted in a tedious and time-consuming process to make briefings for Congress. [...] Diplomatic ministers, only 23 in 1877, were not kept informed of current world events {{that took place in}} other parts of the world.|$|R
60|$|In {{these days}} Ferris {{received}} a dispatch from the Department of State, informing {{him that his}} successor had been appointed, and directing him to deliver up the <b>consular</b> flags, seals, <b>archives,</b> and other property of the United States. No reason for his removal was given; but as {{there had never been}} any reason for his appointment, he had no right to complain; the balance was exactly dressed by this simple device of our civil service. He determined not to wait for the coming of his successor before giving up the consular effects, and he placed them at once in the keeping of the worthy ship-chandler who had so often transferred them from departing to arriving consuls. Then being quite ready at any moment to leave Venice, he found himself in nowise eager to go; but he began in a desultory way to pack up his sketches and studies.|$|R
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{the conclusions of}} a study on entrepreneurial activities related to the cycle of the olive-oil economy in Lesvos, {{an island in the}} North-Eastern Aegean, from the eighteenth century until the middle of the twentieth century. It is based on research and observations drawn from a multiform primary material, such as companies' records, communal and family <b>archives,</b> <b>consular</b> and administrative reports, as well as secondary sources which allow comparisons with other oleiferous regions and connect the economy of Lesvos to the broader Aegean and Mediterranean environment. It points out that the single cultivation phenomenon, though associated to the economy of risk, obeyed to the market's command and was prepared by the abolition of the governor's monopoly on the oil trading and the consequent opening of the market. This enabled the Christian ottoman subjects to develop the administration of intensive olive growing, mechanized oil extraction and trade expansion. Olive oil and soap were the two basic commodities of the island's export revenues that were commercialised, despite their low quality, into a wide range of port and island markets of the Asia Minor coast, the Aegean islands and the Black Sea. Moreover, the article explores the type of commercial and industrial enterprises and the characteristics of the olive-cycle entrepreneurs. It concludes with the commercial crisis suffered from the major political and economic changes of the twentieth century and the consequent reorientation of Lesvos' businessmen towards Crete and Piraeus, the olive manufacturing centres of the Neohellenic state...|$|R
5000|$|Three {{days after}} the incident, Don Pacifico himself wrote to Sir Edmund Lyons, Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece: It is with much grief that I feel myself obliged to {{communicate}} to your Excellency a dreadful event which has happened to me, and as an English subject to beg your protection. Last Sunday, Easter-day, at about 12 o'clock, a crowd of people, amongst whom were some soldiers of the gendarmerie, {{just come out of}} church, presented themselves at the door of my house, which they very soon battered down with large pieces of stone. These brigands, in number about 300 or 400, entered my house, and swearing dreadfully, began beating my wife, my innocent children, and my son-in-law. After having broken the windows, doors, tables, chairs, and every other article of furniture, they robbed me of my jewels, forcing open the closets in which were vases, candlesticks, gold and silver ornaments, diamonds, and lastly a box containing money to the amount of 9,800 drachmas, of which 2,300 were my own private property, and 7,500 which had been deposited with me by the Jewish community of Italy for the projected erection of a temple, and for the poor of this kingdom. These barbarians did not even leave me the <b>Consular</b> Portuguese <b>archives,</b> which were torn by them to pieces. These papers being my security from that nation for the sum of 21,295 l. 1s. 4d. sterling. It is clear that Don Pacifico was a man of many facets. He had been the Portuguese Consul-General in Athens until 1842, and had possession of the Legation's archive. He had previously been Portuguese Consul-General in Morocco. He was also a leader of the Jewish community in Athens, in possession of money earmarked to build a synagogue in Athens. His house was not, as alleged by his and Palmerston's enemies, a poor hovel, but the very house in which the head of the Regency Council of King Otho, Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg, had lived during the Regency (1832-1835) and as Arch-Secretary to the King (1835-1837). On May 20, 1847, Sir Edmund Lyons informed the Foreign Office in London [...] that he had applied to the Greek Government for compensation for Don David Pacifico, a British subject, for loss of possessions, including documents relating to a substantial claim against the Portuguese government for monies owed. Lord Palmerston advised Lyons to have Pacifico draw up an itemized valuation of his losses, and, if his statement were supported by satisfactory proof, to present a note to the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs requiring him to direct that the sum be paid to Don Pacifico. Pacifico complied on February 22, 1848, and Sir Edmund duly dispatched a demand for payment to M. Drossos Mansolas, the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs. He also wrote to M. Constantine Colocotronis, the Prime Minister. Colocotronis rejected Pacifico's claims, with the same objections used by his predecessor in office, M. Colettis. The objections of the Greek government were that the claimed damages were impossibly great, with some estimates going as far as to state that the claimed sum was larger than the value of the Greek Royal Palace, while the Greek gov't also considered this to be an affair of the Judiciary, not the Executive branch. On August 31, 1848, David Pacifico again wrote to Sir Edmund Lyons, pointing out that sixteen months had passed since the incident and no satisfaction had been forthcoming. Moreover, he had been forced to abandon his house during the Easter celebrations of 1848; and he drew to the attention of Sir Edmund that several years earlier two Jews had been massacred at Patras, and likewise the Synagogue at Negroponte had been burned down. After additional exchanges of letters among all the parties, on October 15, 1848, Don David Pacifico again appealed to the British Government to obtain justice for him and the settlement of his claims.|$|R
