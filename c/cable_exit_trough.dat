50|$|The springs {{used are}} large, stiff springs {{with a high}} modulus of elasticity, and they are highly tensioned. A {{compound}} pulley system is then used so that the large force exerted by the spring can be divided {{by a factor of}} (say) five. The <b>cable</b> <b>exiting</b> the pulley system will have a moderate tension on it, but most importantly, when the cable is drawn in or out, and the extension of the spring changes by only a fifth of that distance, so that the tension force of the spring will not change much. The result is that the spring-pulley system can produce a fairly constant tension in the cable over a large range of movement.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} Reconfigurable Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (RCDPRs). A RCDPR {{is able to}} change the {{locations}} of its <b>cable</b> <b>exit</b> points, the latter being defined as the connection points between the cables and the robot base frame. Given a RCDPR, a set of possible reconfigurations, a desired platform path and {{a description of the}} robot environment, the reconfiguration strategy proposed in this paper selects the optimal configurations to be associated to each point of the desired path. The selection of the optimal configurations can be performed with respect to several criteria such as the number of configuration changes, the number of cable reconfigurations and the robot stiffness. In this paper, the optimization is performed using a Dijkstra's based algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The MEAS KPSI ® 27 is a non-submersible {{pressure}} transducer {{specifically designed for}} demanding industrial applications where the primary criteria are reliability and economy. These units provide repeatable, precision measurements under the most hostile conditions. Capable of measuring vacuum to pressure as high as 2000 psi (13, 790 kPa), these transducers can meet most any industrial pressure measurement requirement and are optionally available with an overmolded <b>cable</b> <b>exit</b> for splash down applications (IP 68). All MEAS KPSI ® Transducers utilize a highly accurate pressure sensor assembly specifically designed for hostile fluids and gases. The assembly is integrated with supporting electronics in a durable housing constructed of 316 SS or Titanium. A wide variety of electrical and pressure connections are available to accommodate most any system interface...|$|R
50|$|Cable trays {{are used}} in {{industrial}} areas where many insulated cables are run together. Individual <b>cables</b> can <b>exit</b> the tray at any point, simplifying the wiring installation and reducing the labour cost for installing new cables. Power cables may have fittings in the tray to maintain clearance between the conductors, but small control wiring is often installed without any intentional spacing between cables.|$|R
5000|$|... Balfour Beatty, {{the civil}} {{contractors}} fitting the new electricity cables through the tunnel, {{were engaged in}} phase 2 of the project. The <b>cables</b> <b>exiting</b> the tunnel were being laid individually in concrete and sand insulated ducts at the tunnel exit, leading up to, and ready to be connected to, the first pylon. The old galvanised steelwork hanging over the River Etherow was dismantled and removed. The inside of the tunnel has a flat concrete floor and concrete-finished walls and ceiling. The cables run down {{both sides of the}} tunnel attached to metal framework {{from one end to the}} other. There are six cables running along each wall, each about 12 in in diameter with thick insulation. Other ducting and cables run along the floor. There is no evidence inside the tunnel that trains operated inside, other than the shape of the tunnel. At the western end of the tunnel the old concrete and tarmac platforms still stand.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, SBC {{announced}} it would acquire Pacific Telesis Group, a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) in California and Nevada. 1997 brought rumors of a proposed merger between AT&T Corporation (the USA's largest long distance provider) and SBC (the USA's largest local provider). The FCC disapproved of the merger, and it came to end. Later in 1997, SBC sold its last two <b>cable</b> companies, <b>exiting</b> the <b>cable</b> telecom field.|$|R
5000|$|A regular plug (pictured), {{with the}} 3 pins {{going into the}} wall and the handle part of the plug being a flat 28 mm disc {{protruding}} only about 12 mm from the socket. The telephone <b>cable</b> generally <b>exits</b> the plug at the bottom. The plug has a slightly larger diameter (33 mm) for its outermost 5 mm, thus providing an easy grip. This design supersedes an earlier model which protruded about 18 mm from the socket (pictured).|$|R
5000|$|The {{controls}} {{of a conventional}} 2-line/"U-Control" [...] system consist of lead-out cables, a bellcrank, push rods and control horns. These are connected so that differential motion of the lines rotates the bellcrank, causing a pushrod to move either forward or aft. The pushrod {{is connected to the}} control surface with a control horn that moves the elevator (and flaps, if used) up and down. The pilot holds a handle to which the lines are attached. Tilting the handle with the fingers, wrist, and/or elbow motion causes the differential movement in the lines. By convention, tilting the hand so the top is closer to the pilot than the bottom results in [...] "up" [...] elevator, much like pulling back on a full-scale airplane control stick. Also by convention, most airplanes are flown nominally counter-clockwise as viewed from above, with the leadout <b>cables</b> <b>exiting</b> the left wing. This is not universal and some pilots fly in the opposite direction. Flying clockwise has a slight advantage in some situations because most engines run so that the torque will roll the airplane away from the pilot, increasing line tension in upright level flight.|$|R
50|$|A {{ventilated}} tray has {{openings in}} the bottom of the tray, allowing some air circulation around the cables, water drainage, and allowing some dust to fall through the tray. Small <b>cables</b> may <b>exit</b> the tray through the ventilation openings, which may be either slots or holes punched in the bottom. A ladder tray has the cables supported by a traverse bar, similarly to the rungs of a ladder, at regular intervals on the order of 4 to 12 inches (100 to 300 mm).|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} tray {{are used in}} {{different}} applications. A solid-bottom tray provides the maximum protection to cables, but requires cutting the tray or using fittings to enter or <b>exit</b> <b>cables.</b> A deep, solid enclosure for cables is called a cable channel or cable trough.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Polyt V is a plywood covered box structure, {{the pilot}} sitting over the wing {{under a single}} piece, rearward-sliding canopy. An electrically driven winch at the rear retrieves the launch <b>cable,</b> which <b>exits</b> the aircraft at the narrow extreme stern of the fuselage, {{at a rate of}} about 1 m/s. The engine installation is unusual in having a 16 blade adjustable intake cooling fan in the cowling immediately behind the propeller, for low speed high power flight. This additional cooling is automatically blanked off during a dive.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pressurised}} {{cabin was}} used to counter the physiological problems encountered by pilots at high altitudes. The cabin was not like the fully pressurised cabin of a modern airliner; the pressure differential provided by the modified cockpit of the VI was only two {{pounds per square inch}} (which was double the Air Ministry requirement). To achieve this, the forward and rear cockpit bulkheads were completely enclosed, with all control and electrical <b>cables</b> <b>exiting</b> though special rubber sealing grommets. In addition, the side cockpit door was replaced with alloy skin and the canopy was no longer a sliding unit: externally there were no slide rails. Once the pilot was in, the canopy was locked in place with four toggles and sealed with an inflatable rubber tube. It could be jettisoned by the pilot in an emergency. The windscreen of production Mk VIs was the same as the type fitted to the Mark III and some Mk Vs although it was fitted with an inward opening clear-view panel on the port quarter pane. The effect was to make [...] seem like [...] to the pilot, who would still have to wear an oxygen mask. Pressurisation was achieved by a Marshall-manufactured compressor located on the starboard side of the engine, fed by a long intake below the starboard exhaust stubs. Mk VIs were built with the Coffman cartridge starter, with a small teardrop fairing just ahead of the compressor intake.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a crowd of}} N persons trying to <b>exit</b> some area <b>trough</b> a small <b>exit.</b> The probability is calculated that an individual is able {{to withdraw from the}} crowd under one’s own steam. The problem is simulated within the generalized force model (D. Helbing et al., Nature 407 (2000) 487), and all model parameters are taken from this paper. The results indicate, that in a crowd of 150 persons, this probability is not greater than ten percent. We also evaluate the number of helpers necessary to get the above probability of fifty percent...|$|R
50|$|A frontal <b>trough</b> <b>exited</b> the East Coast of the United States on October 18. The {{southern}} {{portion of}} the system became stationary near the Bahamas; simultaneously, a cut-off upper-level low formed in the same region. The disturbance produced scattered convection, until a tropical wave merged with it on October 23. The system developed into a subtropical depression by October 24, while located about 100 mi east of Florida. The depression drifted northward on October 25 and eventually acquired tropical characteristics by October 26. Due to tropical storm force winds, the system was reclassified as Tropical Storm Hallie, while situated about 100 mi east of Charleston, South Carolina. Hallie accelerated to the northeast starting on October 26. By the following day, Hallie peaked with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Later that day, Hallie merged with a frontal zone and became extratropical offshore Virginia.|$|R
5|$|On September3, another <b>trough</b> <b>exited</b> {{the coast}} of the United States, {{allowing}} the hurricane to accelerate toward the northeast through the diminished ridge. By that time, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h), although forecasters expected baroclinic instability to maintain much of the cyclone's remaining force. Instead of continued weakening, the hurricane began to significantly re-intensify. Early on September4, Ella again reached major hurricane status, and later that day it peaked with winds of 140mph (220km/h); {{at the time it was}} about 335miles (540km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and its peak winds were measured by Hurricane Hunters. This made it the strongest hurricane ever recorded in Canadian waters. Weakening began immediately after peak intensity due to cooler water temperatures. Early on September5, Ella passed very near Cape Race, although the strongest winds were south and east of the center. Associated convection became completely removed from the center, and the hurricane became extratropical as it was absorbed by a larger mid-latitude system.|$|R
50|$|On September 22-23, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave, embedded within the monsoon <b>trough,</b> <b>exited</b> {{the west coast}} of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean near Guinea Bissau. The wave coincided with an upper-level trough and an isolated plume of moisture; however, little convection was present. Located unusually close to the equator, roughly 8-10°N, the system was unable to acquire significant spin via the Coriolis force and struggled to develop as it moved rapidly west at 25 - 30 mph. Despite this, the three top forecast models for hurricanes—the GFS, ECMWF, and UKMET—indicated the system would likely become a tropical cyclone over the Caribbean Sea. Two days later, the wave passed south of Cape Verde, and was assessed as having a high probability of tropical cyclogenesis within five days by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). With environmental conditions favoring slow development, thunderstorm activity increased along the wave on September 25, which organized more during the subsequent days while approaching the Lesser Antilles.|$|R

5|$|Now a {{tropical}} depression, Gilda remained nearly stationary for another 24 hours before accelerating northeastward, {{under the influence}} of an upper-level <b>trough</b> <b>exiting</b> the east coast of the United States. Cold air from the trough interacted with Gilda, providing a baroclinic environment for intensifying, and on October 24 the storm transitioned into a subtropical storm about halfway between Hispaniola and North Carolina. This made Gilda the first tropical storm on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone. Operationally, tropical storm advisories were still issued on Gilda while it was subtropical, due to the need to maintain consistency and the possibility it could again become tropical. The circulation of the storm became very large, at one point stretching from New England to the Bahamas, and eastward beyond Bermuda, or a diameter of more than 1300 mi (2100 km). On October 25, Gilda passed about halfway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, when it reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). Subsequently it turned northeastward, and on October 27 attained a minimum pressure of 984 mbar, the lowest of its duration while tropical or subtropical. Later that day, Gilda became an extratropical cyclone southeast of the Canadian Maritimes as it moved over colder waters. After passing just southeast of Newfoundland, the storm continued northeastward, becoming nearly stationary off the coast of Greenland before dissipating on October 30.|$|R
500|$|Similar to a Subtropical Depression 13 in April 2000, {{there was}} an unusual {{subtropical}} cyclone that formed in June to end the season. A <b>trough</b> <b>exited</b> South Africa on June18 with an associated frontal wave in the southern Mozambique Channel. On the next day, the system separated from the front and became a cut-off low. It moved north-northwestward along the eastern periphery of a ridge in southern Africa, becoming a subtropical depression on June20. The associated convection initially diminished, although the thunderstorms redeveloped due to the atmospheric instability in the region. On June21, the depression passed about 100km (60mi) east of Maputo, Mozambique, while moving into an area of much warmer waters. As such, the structure became more tropical, with a small central dense overcast forming over the circulation only 75km (45mi) in diameter. The JTWC initiated advisories on June21 as Tropical Cyclone 12S. The small size of the storm merited the MFR calling it a [...] "midget cyclone", with a small eye forming late on June21. Based on the feature, the JTWC estimated peak 1winds of 120km/h (75mph); in contrast, the MFR estimated 10minute winds of 95km/h (60mph). Despite the structure, the convection was shallow, which brought uncertainty to the true intensity of the storm. Turning to the northeast and east, the subtropical storm rapidly weakened on June22 to depression status after the environment became hostile, and the convection largely dissipated. The exposed low turned northwestward on June23, dissipating the next day.|$|R

40|$|In {{epilepsy}} {{patients who}} have electrodes implanted in their brains {{as part of their}} pre-surgical assessment, simultaneous intracranial EEG and fMRI (icEEG-fMRI) may provide important localising information and improve understanding of the underlying neuropathology. However, patient safety during icEEG-fMRI has not been addressed. Here the potential health hazards associated with icEEG-fMRI were evaluated theoretically and the main risks identified as: mechanical forces on electrodes from transient magnetic effects, tissue heating due to interaction with the pulsed RF fields and tissue stimulation due to interactions with the switched magnetic gradient fields. These potential hazards were examined experimentally in vitro on a Siemens 3 T Trio, 1. 5 T Avanto and a GE 3 T Signa Excite scanner using a Brain Products MR compatible EEG system. No electrode flexion was observed. Temperature measurements demonstrated that heating well above guideline limits can occur. However heating could be kept within safe limits (< 1. 0 °C) by using a head transmit RF coil, ensuring EEG <b>cable</b> placement to <b>exit</b> the RF coil along its central z-axis, using specific EEG cable lengths and limiting MRI sequence specific absorption rates (SARs). We found that the risk of tissue damage due to RF-induced heating is low provided implant and scanner specific SAR limits are observed with a safety margin used to account for uncertainties (e. g. in scanner-reported SAR). The observed scanner gradient switching induced current (0. 08 mA) and charge density (0. 2 μC/cm 2) were well within safety limits (0. 5 mA and 30 μC/cm 2, respectively). Site-specific testing and a conservative approach to safety are required to avoid the risk of adverse events...|$|R
