50|$|All {{of these}} {{processes}} result in a product that is 70% protein, 20% carbohydrates (2.7 to 5% <b>crude</b> fiber), 6% <b>ash</b> and about 1% oil, but the solubility may differ. One tonne of defatted soybean flakes will yield about 750 kg of soybean protein concentrate.|$|R
40|$|The sawdust of {{different}} woods were investigated for {{the cultivation of}} exotic strain of Pleurotus (flabellatus) djamor (R- 22) {{to find out the}} efficiency {{of different}} nutrients including protein, fat, <b>crude</b> fiber, <b>ash,</b> dry matter and moisture. Among all type of nutrients, protein, fat, <b>crude</b> fiber, <b>ash,</b> dry matter and moisture of Pleurotus ostreatus on sawdust of different woods were observed. Protein was observed on control treatment (cotton waste, kikar, mango, mixed sawdust, simbal and kail (21. 89), (21. 64), (21. 34), (21. 16), (21. 03) and (20. 75) % respectively. Fat was observed on control treatment (cotton waste, kikar, mango, mixed sawdust, simbal and kail (0. 80), (0. 53), (0. 41), (0. 33), (0. 24) and (0. 11) % respectively. Crude fiber was observed on control treatment (cotton waste, kikar, mango, mixed sawdust, simbal and kail (8. 92), (8. 45), (8. 17), (7. 96), (7. 70) and (7. 32) % respectively. Ash was observed on control treatment (cotton waste, kikar, mango, mixed sawdust, simbal and kail (7. 65), (6. 75), (6. 47), (6. 39), (6. 33) and (6. 23 %) respectively. Dry matter was observed on control treatment (cotton waste, kikar, mango, mixed sawdust, simbal and kail (6. 47), (6. 27), (6. 13), (6. 01), (5. 87) and (5. 67) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the change in dry matter and nutritive composition of Humidicola grass (Brachiaria humidicola) grown in Ban Thon soil series (infertility soil) {{as a function of}} growth age. One rai (0. 16 ha) of two-year-old pasture of fertilised Humidicola grass was uniformly cut and the regrowth samples were collected every twenty days. The samples were subjected to analysis for dry matter content and nutritive composition, i. e. <b>crude</b> protein, <b>ash,</b> calcium, phosphorus, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, and acid detergent lignin. The results showed that while the yields of available forage and leaves increased curvilinearly (quadratic, p< 0. 05), the stem yield increased linearly (p< 0. 05) over sampling dates. The highest biomass accumulation rate was numerically observed between 40 - 60 days of regrowth. The concentrations of <b>crude</b> protein, <b>ash,</b> calcium and phosphorus decreased curvilinearly (quadratic, p< 0. 05) with advancing maturity and reached the lowest flat after 60 days of regrowth. The cell wall components, i. e. NDF, ADF and ADL, increased over the experimental period and reached the highest plateau at 40 days of regrowth. It was concluded that Humidicola grass should be grazed or preserved at the regrowth age of not over 60 days to maximise the utilisation of the grass...|$|R
