30|$|Cystatin C is a {{novel marker}} which is {{independent}} of body composition and size and believed not {{to be influenced by}} maternal renal function [46]. <b>Compensatory</b> <b>surface</b> increase and hyperfiltration of fewer glomeruli may affect serum levels of both creatinine and cystatin C [47]; assessment of GFR, however, is superior using cystatin C as a marker [48]. Conclusions about renal endowment based on these markers may be questionable, as {{it has been shown that}} effective renal plasma flow is the better marker prognosticating renal outcome [49]. More accessible in the NICU may be clearing pharmacokinetics of common neonatal medications such as aminoglycosides which also approximate effective renal plasma flow [50].|$|E
40|$|Expression of the gamma/delta T cell {{receptor}} (TCR) on CD 3 + intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) was studied by two-colour immunofluorescence in duodenal tissue sections from healthy (n = 6) or infection-prone (n = 7) subjects with selective IgA deficiency (IgAD), and subjects (n = 4) with combined IgAD and IgG subclass deficiency. TCR gamma/delta+ IEL proportions in selective IgAD subjects (median 6. 3 %, range 1. 0 - 41 %) {{and in those}} with combined deficiency (median 4. 5 %, range 1. 2 - 33 %) were well within the range (0. 3 - 38 %) for histologically normal controls (n = 11), but the healthy IgAD subgroup tended to show raised TCR gamma/delta+ IEL proportions (median 13. 6 %) compared {{with the other two}} subgroups. Also the number of TCR gamma/delta+ IELs per intestinal length unit was relatively high (median 13. 9 /mm) in the healthy IgAD subjects, and significantly raised (P < 0. 03) compared with controls (median 3. 2 /mm). Paired staining revealed that most TCR gamma/delta+ IELs in both selective IgAD (98 %) and combined deficiency (99 %) were CD 8 -, and a large fraction (median 84 % and 63 %, respectively) expressed the V delta 1 /J delta 1 -encoded epitope. The total number of CD 3 + IELs (mostly CD 8 +) was similar to controls. IgAD subjects, and especially the healthy subgroup, had significantly increased serum concentrations of soluble CD 8 (P < 0. 0002), neopterin (P < 0. 005), and beta 2 -microglobulin (P < 0. 007), which was similar to our previous observations in common variable immunodeficiency, and probably reflected stimulation of cell-mediated immunity. In addition, the increased TCR gamma/delta+ IELs might reflect a component of <b>compensatory</b> <b>surface</b> protection in the healthy IgAD subgroup...|$|E
40|$|Candida albicans is {{a common}} {{opportunistic}} pathogen that causes {{a wide variety of}} diseases in a human immunocompromised host leading to death. In a pathogen, cell wall proteins are important for stability as well as for acting as antigenic determinants and virulence factors. Pir 32 is a cell wall protein and member of the Pir protein family previously shown to be upregulated in response to macrophage contact and whose other member, Pir 1, was found to be necessary for cell wall rigidity. The {{purpose of this study is}} to characterize Pir 32 by generating a homozygous null strain and comparing the phenotype of the null with that of the wild-type parental strain as far as filamentation, virulence in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis, resistance to oxidative stress and cell wall disrupting agents, in addition to adhesion, biofilm capacities, and cell wall chitin content. Our mutant was shown to be hyperfilamentous, resistant to sodium dodecyl sulfate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium chloride, and more virulent in a mouse model when compared to the wild type. These results were unexpected, considering that most cell wall mutations weaken the wall and render it more susceptible to external stress factors and suggests the possibility of a cell <b>surface</b> <b>compensatory</b> mechanism. As such, we measured cell wall chitin deposition and found a twofold increase in the mutant, possibly explaining the above-observed phenotypes. PublishedN/...|$|R
