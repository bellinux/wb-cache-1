25|$|Biological Aerated (or Anoxic) Filter (BAF) or Biofilters combine {{filtration}} with biological <b>carbon</b> <b>reduction,</b> nitrification or denitrification. BAF usually {{includes a}} reactor {{filled with a}} filter media. The media is either in suspension or supported by a gravel layer {{at the foot of}} the filter. The dual purpose of this media is to support highly active biomass that is attached to it and to filter suspended solids. <b>Carbon</b> <b>reduction</b> and ammonia conversion occurs in aerobic mode and sometime achieved in a single reactor while nitrate conversion occurs in anoxic mode. BAF is operated either in upflow or downflow configuration depending on design specified by manufacturer.|$|E

30|$|For the {{scenario}} with reforestation and energy use, approximately 11 [=− 4 –(− 15)] t-C/dam and 28 [=– 4 –(– 32)] t-C/dam of <b>carbon</b> emission <b>reduction</b> {{effects can be}} expected for the evaluation periods of 50 and 100  years, respectively. These results demonstrated that the <b>carbon</b> emission <b>reduction</b> effects in these scenarios are greater than the <b>carbon</b> emission <b>reductions</b> of approximately 7 (= 12 – 5) t-C/dam associated with substituting the concrete dam with the timber dam, which takes only fossil fuel consumption into consideration. In other words, from mid- to long-term perspectives, <b>carbon</b> emission <b>reduction</b> effects will be greater by taking the carbon balance of the wood into consideration {{based on the premise}} that reforestation and energy use will be implemented rather than targeting only fossil fuel consumption.|$|R
25|$|Although many {{carbon offset}} {{projects}} tout their environmental co-benefits, some {{are accused of}} having negative secondary effects. Point Carbon has reported on an inconsistent approach with regard to some hydro-electric projects as carbon offsets; some countries in the EU are not allowing large projects into the EU ETS, because of their environmental impacts, {{even though they have}} been individually approved by the UNFCCC and World Commission on Dams. It is difficult to assess the exact results of carbon offsets given {{the fact that they are}} a relatively new form of <b>carbon</b> <b>reduction,</b> and it is possible that some carbon offset purchases are made in an attempt to increase positive business public relations rather than to help solve the issue of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring <b>carbon</b> <b>reduction</b> are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E

This material, an impure form of TiO2, is derived from ilmenite by removal of iron, either using <b>carbon</b> <b>reduction</b> or extraction with sulfuric acid.

40|$|The {{interface}} of {{a long-standing}} movement for sustainability at the urban {{scale and the}} imperatives of the carbon-reduction agenda are driving change in urban energy systems. This paper seeks to address {{the nature of that}} change and, in particular, to consider how different pathways of change are emerging. To do this it draws on the coevolution and pathways literatures to interrogate a database of current urban energy initiatives within the UK. This analysis reveals the multiple pathways of change though which new modes of energy production and consumption are being developed to deliver <b>carbon</b> <b>reductions</b> through the reconfiguring of urban energy systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these changes for urban governance and for <b>carbon</b> <b>reductions...</b>|$|R

30|$|Examining the {{reforestation}} scenario {{showed that}} the <b>carbon</b> emission <b>reductions</b> become greater for the scenario with reforestation as the evaluation period is extended, while no <b>carbon</b> emission <b>reductions</b> were realized for the scenario without reforestation throughout the evaluation period of 100  years, and carbon emissions occurred instead. Reforestation in the forest after harvesting is essential despite {{the differences in the}} energy use scenarios in to achieve <b>carbon</b> emission <b>reductions.</b> Reviewing the energy use scenario revealed that the starting time of <b>carbon</b> emission <b>reduction</b> effects varies depending on whether the energy use is actually implemented, even though it does not have as strong an impact on the results as the reforestation scenario. Moreover, a comparison between the scenario with or without reforestation and the scenario with or without energy use revealed the characteristic that <b>carbon</b> emission <b>reduction</b> effects become greater for the scenario with reforestation as the evaluation period is extended, while a constant level of carbon emission effects can be expected in both short-term and long-term periods for the scenario with energy use.|$|R
