The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess the similarity of demand and supply shocks in the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> NAFTA and MERCOSUR, and to compare it with the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> the Euro Area. For these aims, correlation and structural vector autoregression methods are used. Methods are based on Blanchard and Quah (1989) and Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993). We confirm the existence of core states and periphery states in the Euro Area with some exceptions. If we compare supply and demand shocks, we find more similarity in the case of supply shocks in the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> the Euro Area. According to the results, the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> NAFTA are more appropriate for the creation of monetary union than the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> MERCOSUR.

5|$|From {{the late}} 1840s into the 1870s, Texas stockmen drove their beef cattle through {{southern}} Arizona on the Texas–California trail.

The Texans contributed their proven range methods to the new grass <b>country</b> <b>of</b> Arizona, but also brought their problems as well. Texas rustlers brought lawlessness, poor management resulted in overstocking, and carelessness introduced destructive diseases. But these difficulties did force laws and associations in Arizona to curb and resolve them. The Anglo-American cattleman frontier in Arizona was an extension of the Texas experience.|$|E
