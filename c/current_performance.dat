5|$|There was one driver change {{heading into}} the race. Having been {{in one of the}} Jordan cars since the first race of the season in Australia, Heinz-Harald Frentzen was sacked by his team and was {{replaced}} by Jordan's third driver Zonta. Frentzen announced he would take legal action against Jordan and team principal Eddie Jordan said that Frentzen's management was not happy with Jordan's <b>current</b> <b>performance</b> but denied rumours that a heated row occurred. The Schumacher brothers were sympathic towards Frentzen who felt unhappy about the manner in which he was sacked. Irvine came to Jordan's defence and said that he believed the decision was influenced by problems Jordan had with 1996 World Champion Damon Hill who had similar poor performances like Frentzen. In an interview with The Sunday Independent in 2005, Jordan later claimed that Frentzen was sacked because engine supplier Honda wanted Japanese driver Takuma Sato to race for Jordan in 2002 and to retain Honda's engine supply. During the week of the race, the organisers of the German Grand Prix signed an extension to continue hosting the event at the Hockenheimring until 2008 with an option for a further five years.|$|E

25|$|Design of a {{balanced}} scorecard is about the identification of {{a small number of}} financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether <b>current</b> <b>performance</b> 'meets expectations'.

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2011, the events of 2009 were {{repeated}} with the band's <b>current</b> <b>performance</b> venue announcing its impending closure. Again a search was made to find another suitable location and once again (then) band president, musician, and veteran night club manager Bob Lasley came to the rescue. Through his efforts and musical connections Lasley arranged for the band to perform {{at one of the}} Harry's Hofbrau restaurants in San Jose. The band has since performed on Wednesday evenings from 7:00pm to roughly 8:30pm and has continued its alternate band leader second sets.|$|E
500|$|Before {{making a}} shot, the player may select a club {{and adjust the}} general {{direction}} of the swing. As with other golf games, a [...] "swing meter" [...] is used to simulate the act of swinging the club. The player clicks three times: first to initiate the backswing, which causes a timing indicator to move along the meter; second to begin the downswing; and third to [...] "snap" [...] the shot, which determines accuracy. Changes in the timing of these clicks alter the shot. A red section on the far end of the swing meter represents overswinging, which negatively affects shots. The crowd reacts to the player's shots, and Tournament mode features announcer commentary that analyzes the match overall; it can frame the player's <b>current</b> <b>performance</b> in the light of past shots.|$|E

500|$|Troy McClure is a stereotypical Hollywood has-been. He {{was a star}} in {{the early}} 1970s, but his career went {{downhill}} due to rumors of a paraphilia involving fish.

McClure introduces himself by saying, [...] "Hi, I'm Troy McClure.

2500|$|Each {{family has}} its own traditions, played out year after year, event after event. These traditions are {{frequently}} so engrained that the recognition of them as unique to this family only occurs {{when compared to other}} families. [...] This is also an area of family folklore that is most exposed to change or modification. With each additional marriage or committed relationship, a new member from a different family gets added, an individual who does not recognize the family customs as [...] "traditional". These new members bring their own traditions which need to be reconciled, perhaps added or even substituted into the <b>current</b> <b>performance.</b> Not only through marriage, but births and deaths also add a fluid dynamic to the family traditions. When the first grandchild is born, everyone moves into a new role, Mom becomes Grandmom, Brother becomes Uncle, and the family Benjamin loses his position to the new baby. These factors lead to a dynamic development of new and renewed family traditions.|$|E

40|$|The work {{described}} here was performed at ISOLDE, CERN. It aimed at giving an objective {{report of the}} <b>current</b> <b>performances</b> of Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion sources used as charge breeders, with both stable and radioactive ion beams. As a prerequisite, some technical developments were undertaken during the PhD thesis to improve the setup and to lead the tests with optimal conditions. A major part of these developments concerns beam purity, and is detailed in this thesis. Then, measurements of the charge breeding efficiencies of various isotopes were completed with different charge breeding modes. Results of these experiments are analyzed and compared to the <b>current</b> <b>performances</b> {{of other types of}} charge breeding methods. At the end, some conclusions are drawn from this investigation in perspective of the choices to make for future ISOL postaccelerators.

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} {{performances}} of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils, {{it is necessary to}} store more energy within a shorter HTS tape length and to reduce leakage magnetic fields. To attain these goals, we need to increase the critical current of the coil. The critical currents and n-values of the HTS tape generally depend on the magnitudes and angles of the applied magnetic field. Therefore, we calculated the transport <b>current</b> <b>performances</b> of HTS coils with anisotropic properties. In general, anisotropy generates relatively large electric fields at the coil edges, limiting the transport <b>current</b> <b>performances</b> of the coil. To solve this problem, we proposed a new symmetric, lattice shaped HTS coil cross sections. The coil assembly consists of small ring-shaped coils of rectangular cross section forming pairs of Helmholtz coils. As a result, the angle between the magnetic field and tape and electric fields decreased, resulting in an increase in the critical current of the coil. Through this optimization, the stored energy increased 2. 2 times compared with a normal rectangular solenoid coil with the same HTS tape length. Furthermore, the leakage magnetic field was substantially reduced...|$|R
40|$|Road safety {{management}} controlling means {{the process of}} finding out the information whether the road safety is improving in a measure to achieve the objectives. The process of control consists of three basic elements: definition of performances and standards, measurement of <b>current</b> <b>performances</b> and comparison with the set standards, and improvement of <b>current</b> <b>performances,</b> if they deviate from the set standards. The performance standards of road {{safety management}} system are focused on a performances measurement, {{in terms of their}} design and characteristics, in order to support the performances improvement of road safety system and thus, ultimately, improve the road safety. Defining the performance standards of road safety management system, except that determines the design of the system for performances measurement, directly sets requirements whose fulfillment will produce a road safety improvement. The road safety management system, based on the performance standards of road safety, with a focus on results, will produce the continuous improvement of road safety, achieving the long-term 'vision zero', the philosophy of road safety, that human life and health take priority over mobility and other traffic objectives of the road traffic...|$|R
