5|$|Afroyim v. Rusk, , {{is a major}} United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court ruled that {{citizens}} of the United States may not be deprived of their <b>citizenship</b> involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the <b>citizenship</b> of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his <b>citizenship</b> was guaranteed by the <b>Citizenship</b> Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In so doing, the Court struck down a federal law mandating loss of U.S. <b>citizenship</b> for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which it had upheld loss of <b>citizenship</b> under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|Almost 90% {{of ethnic}} Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents of Cambodia, {{and do not}} carry <b>citizenship</b> papers such as identity cards or birth certificates. The 1996 Cambodian law on nationality technically permits Vietnamese residents born in Cambodia to take up <b>citizenship,</b> but faced resistance from mid-ranking interior ministry officials who generally refrain from registering Vietnamese residents due to concerns of political implications from opposition parties if <b>citizenship</b> were to be granted. A minority of Vietnamese residents were able to obtain <b>citizenship</b> only after paying bribes to interior ministry officials, or were married to Khmer spouses. The minority of Vietnamese residents who hold <b>citizenship</b> reported of interior ministry officials confiscating their <b>citizenship</b> papers. As a result, the Vietnamese faced legal restrictions from getting access to public healthcare, education, employment and buying land for housing as the majority do not carry Cambodian <b>citizenship.</b> Stateless Vietnamese built floating settlements in-lieu of buying land-based dwellings which require <b>citizenship</b> papers. According to field research carried out by Cambodia's Minority Rights Organisation, interior ministry officials would confront Vietnamese fishermen in the Tonle Sap and demand bribes {{in order to allow}} them to carry out fishing.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{passed the}} Canadian <b>citizenship</b> test in June 1999, {{but it was}} {{suggested}} he should delay taking the Oath of <b>Citizenship</b> until the next year of the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) fair. He became a Canadian citizen at the 2000 CNE, during a <b>Citizenship</b> Ceremony in the Automotive Building. The <b>Citizenship</b> Oath was administered by Bill Withrow, C.M., longtime director of the Art Gallery of Ontario and great-grandson of John Withrow, the Canadian National Exhibition Association's first president.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} country's history, {{voluntary}} acquisition {{or exercise}} of a foreign <b>citizenship</b> was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national <b>citizenship.</b> This concept was enshrined {{in a series of}} treaties between the United States and other countries (the Bancroft Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), as well as Vance v. Terrazas (1980), holding that the <b>Citizenship</b> Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking <b>citizenship.</b> However, Congress can revoke <b>citizenship</b> that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The Afroyim {{decision}} {{stated that}} no one with United States <b>citizenship</b> could be involuntarily deprived of that <b>citizenship.</b> Nevertheless, the Court distinguished a 1971 case, Rogers v. Bellei, holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired <b>citizenship</b> via jus sanguinis, through birth outside the United States to an American parent or parents, could still risk loss of <b>citizenship</b> in various ways, since their <b>citizenship</b> (unlike Afroyim's <b>citizenship)</b> {{was the result of}} federal statutes rather than the <b>Citizenship</b> Clause. The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship—a U.S. residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth—was repealed by Congress in 1978; the foreign voting provision, already without effect since Afroyim, was repealed at the same time.|$|E

5|$|The Nationality Act of 1940 {{provided}} for loss of <b>citizenship</b> based on foreign military or government service, when coupled with <b>citizenship</b> in that foreign country. This statute also mandated loss of <b>citizenship</b> for desertion from the U.S. armed forces, remaining outside the United States {{in order to}} evade military service during wartime, or voting in a foreign election. The provision calling for loss of <b>citizenship</b> for foreign military service was held by the Supreme Court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary, in a 1958 case (Nishikawa v. Dulles), and revocation of <b>citizenship</b> as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case (Trop v. Dulles).|$|E

5|$|Canadian <b>citizenship</b> is {{typically}} obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive <b>citizenship</b> by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian <b>Citizenship</b> Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian <b>citizenship,</b> Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.|$|E
