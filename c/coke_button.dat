This involves heating {{a small sample of}} coal in a standardised crucible to around 800 degrees Celsius (1500 °F).After heating for a specified time, or until all volatiles are driven off, a small <b>coke</b> <b>button</b> remains in the crucible.

The <b>coke</b> <b>button</b> obtained after cooling was then {{compared with the}} standard German profile, numbering from one to nine, increasing in half units.|$|E
40|$|The coal seams of Sawang Colliery, East Bokaro Coalfields are {{bituminous}} to sub-bituminous {{in nature}} and categorized as high gaseous seams (degree II to degree III level). These seams {{have the potential for}} coal bed methane (CBM) and their maturity increases with increasing depth, as a result of enhanced pressure–temperature conditions in the underground. The vitrinite maceral group composition of the investigated coal seams ranges from 62. 50 – 83. 15 %, whereas the inertinite content varies from 14. 93 – 36. 81 %. The liptinite content varies from 0. 66 % to 3. 09 %. The maximum micro-pores are confined within the vitrinite group of macerals. The coal seams exhibit vitrinite reflectance values (Ro % calculated) from 0. 94 % (sample CG- 97) to 1. 21 % (sample CG- 119). Proximate analyses of the investigated coal samples reveal that the moisture content (M%) ranges from 1. 28 % to 2. 98 %, whereas, volatile matter (VM%) content is placed in the range of 27. 01 % to 33. 86 %. The ash content (A%) ranges from 10. 92 % to 30. 01 %. Fixed carbon (FC%) content varies from 41. 53 % to 55. 93 %. Fuel ratio variation shows a restricted range from 1. 53 to 1. 97. All the coal samples were found to be strongly caking and forming <b>coke</b> <b>buttons.</b> The present study is based on the adsorption isotherm experiments carried out under controlled P–T conditions for determination of actual gas adsorption capacity of the coal seams. This analysis shows that the maximum methane gas adsorbed in the coal sample CG- 81 is 17 m 3 /t (Std. daf), at maximum pressure of 5. 92 MPa and experimental temperature of 30 ◦C. The calculated Langmuir regression parameters PL and VL range from 2. 49 to 3. 75 MPa and 22. 94 to 26. 88 m 3 /t (Std. daf), respectively. 1...|$|R
