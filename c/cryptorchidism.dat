5|$|Abnormal genitalia: usually <b>cryptorchidism</b> (retention of {{testicles}} in body) or monorchism (single testicle). In female patients, this presents {{as missing}} or single ovaries, much harder by nature to detect. Ultrasound imaging is performed at regular intervals, {{from the age}} of 1 year, to determine if ovaries are present.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{disorder}} in male Pomeranians is <b>cryptorchidism.</b> This is when either {{one or both}} of the testicles do not descend into the scrotum. It is treated through surgical removal of the retained testicle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptorchidism</b> is {{the absence}} of one or both testes from the scrotum. It is the most common birth defect of the male genital. About 3% of full-term and 30% of {{premature}} infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However, about 80% of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life (the majority within three months), making the true incidence of <b>cryptorchidism</b> around 1% overall. <b>Cryptorchidism</b> may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.|$|E
25|$|In horses, <b>cryptorchidism</b> is {{sufficiently}} common that affected males (ridglings) are routinely gelded.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptorchidism,</b> hypospadias, {{testicular}} cancer and poor semen quality {{make up the}} syndrome known as testicular dysgenesis syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In vitro fertilization, use of {{cosmetics}} by the mother, and preeclampsia {{have also}} been recognized as risk factors for development of <b>cryptorchidism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rarely, <b>cryptorchidism</b> {{is due to}} the {{presence}} of a congenital testicular tumor such as a teratoma, which has a tendency to grow large.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptorchidism</b> is {{distinct}} from monorchism, the condition of having only one testicle. The condition may occur on one or both sides; it more commonly affects the right testis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptorchidism</b> {{occurs at}} a much higher rate in a large number of {{congenital}} malformation syndromes. Among the more common are Down syndrome Prader–Willi syndrome, and Noonan syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Like other warmblood registries, the AWÖ {{does not}} give {{breeding}} licenses to stallions with congenital disorders including <b>cryptorchidism,</b> malocclusion, osteochondritis, or impaired breathing. As a result, Austrian Warmbloods are healthy and robust.|$|E
25|$|By his teens, Blount {{suffered}} from <b>cryptorchidism.</b> It {{left him with}} a nearly constant discomfort that sometimes flared into severe pain. Szwed suggests that Blount felt shame about it and the condition contributed to his isolation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptorchidism</b> is {{when one}} the {{testicles}} is {{retained in the}} abdomen or inguinal canal past a normal stage of development. It is a common occurrence in dogs and {{is thought to be}} a sex-limited autosomal recessive trait.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{factor contributing to}} infertility is {{the high rate of}} anomalies of the epididymis in boys with <b>cryptorchidism</b> (over 90% in some studies). Even after orchiopexy, these may also affect sperm maturation and motility at an older age.|$|E
25|$|Kelpies are a {{hardy breed}} with few health problems, {{but they are}} {{susceptible}} to disorders common to all breeds, like <b>cryptorchidism,</b> hip dysplasia, cerebellar abiotrophy and luxating patella. Current research is underway to find the genetic marker for cerebellar abiotrophy in the breed.|$|E
25|$|Many men {{who were}} born with undescended testes have reduced fertility, even after orchiopexy in infancy. The {{reduction}} with unilateral <b>cryptorchidism</b> is subtle, with a reported infertility rate of about 10%, compared with about 6% reported by the same study for {{the general population of}} adult men.|$|E
25|$|Methyltestosterone is or {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of delayed puberty, hypogonadism, <b>cryptorchidism,</b> and erectile dysfunction in males, and in low doses to treat menopausal symptoms (specifically for osteoporosis, hot flashes, and to increase libido and energy), postpartum breast pain and engorgement, and breast cancer in women.|$|E
25|$|In most full-term infant {{boys with}} <b>cryptorchidism</b> {{but no other}} genital abnormalities, a cause cannot be found, making this a common, sporadic, unexplained (idiopathic) birth defect. A {{combination}} of genetics, maternal health, and other environmental factors may disrupt the hormones and physical changes that influence {{the development of the}} testicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{fertility}} reduction after orchiopexy for bilateral <b>cryptorchidism</b> is more marked, about 38%, or 6 {{times that}} of the general population. The basis for the universal recommendation for early surgery is research showing degeneration of spermatogenic tissue and reduced spermatogonia counts after the second year of life in undescended testes. The degree to which this is prevented or improved by early orchiopexy is still uncertain.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{small body}} of {{research}} on the psychology of <b>cryptorchidism,</b> that attempts to determine whether this condition can cause lasting psychological problems. The psychological research on cryptorchism consists of only a few case reports and small studies. This research also has serious methodological problems: major variables are completely uncontrolled, such as the small physical stature of many cryptorchid boys, and the psychological effects of corrective surgery.|$|E
2500|$|... 5-ARD is {{associated}} with an increased risk of <b>cryptorchidism</b> and testicular cancer.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cryptorchidism</b> or [...] "undescended {{testicle}}s", {{when the}} testicle does not descend into the scrotum {{of the infant}} boy.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, fewer studies {{documented}} {{risks of}} prenatal exposure to DES on males (referred to as [...] "DES sons"). In the 1970s and early 1980s, studies published on prenatally DES-exposed males investigated {{increased risk of}} testicular cancer, infertility and urogenital abnormalities in development, such as <b>cryptorchidism</b> and hypospadias. Research published in the U.S. by Palmer et al. in 2009 further confirmed evidence of these findings. Additional research published in Finland in 2012 has further confirmed {{an increased risk of}} <b>cryptorchidism</b> among males exposed prenatally to DES.|$|E
2500|$|A 2010 study {{published}} in the European medical journal Human Reproduction examined the prevalence of congenital <b>cryptorchidism</b> among offspring whose mothers had taken mild analgesics, primarily over-the-counter pain medications including ibuprofen (e.g. Advil) and paracetamol (acetaminophen). Combining the results from a survey of pregnant women prior to their due date in correlation with the health of their children and an ex vivo rat model, the study found [...] that pregnant women who had been exposed to mild analgesics had a higher prevalence of baby boys born with congenital <b>cryptorchidism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{major risk}} factor for the {{development}} of testis cancer is <b>cryptorchidism</b> (undescended testicles). [...] It is generally believed that the presence of a tumor contributes to cryptorchidism; [...] when <b>cryptorchidism</b> occurs in conjunction with a tumor then the tumor tends to be large. [...] Other risk factors include inguinal hernias, Klinefelter syndrome, and mumps orchitis. [...] Physical activity is associated with decreased risk and sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased risk. Early onset of male characteristics is associated with increased risk. [...] These may reflect endogenous or environmental hormones.|$|E
2500|$|Risk {{factors may}} include {{exposure}} to regular alcohol consumption during pregnancy (5 or more drinks per week, {{associated with a}} 3x increase in <b>cryptorchidism,</b> when compared to non-drinking mothers. [...] Cigarette smoking is also a known risk factor.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{management}} of <b>cryptorchidism</b> is watchful waiting, {{due to the}} high likelihood of self-resolution. Where this fails, a surgery, called orchiopexy, is effective if inguinal testes have not descended after 4–6 months. [...] Surgery is often performed by a pediatric urologist or pediatric surgeon, but in many communities still by a general urologist or surgeon.|$|E
2500|$|Testes {{follow the}} [...] "path of descent" [...] from {{high in the}} {{posterior}} fetal abdomen to the inguinal ring and beyond to the inguinal canal and into the scrotum. In most cases (97% full-term, 70% preterm), both testes have descended by birth. In most other cases, only one testis fails to descend (<b>cryptorchidism)</b> and that will probably express itself within a year.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{studies have}} {{documented}} that endosulfan can also affect human development. Researchers studying children from many villages in Kasargod District, Kerala, India, have linked endosulfan exposure to delays in sexual maturity among boys. Endosulfan {{was the only}} pesticide applied to cashew plantations in the villages for 20 years, and had contaminated the village environment. The researchers compared the villagers to a control group of boys from a demographically similar village that lacked a history of endosulfan pollution. Relative to the control group, the exposed boys had high levels of endosulfan in their bodies, lower levels of testosterone, and delays in reaching sexual maturity. Birth defects of the male reproductive system, including <b>cryptorchidism,</b> were also more prevalent in the study group. The researchers concluded, [...] "our study results suggest that endosulfan exposure in male children may delay sexual maturity and interfere with sex hormone synthesis." [...] Increased incidences of <b>cryptorchidism</b> have been observed in other studies of endosulfan exposed populations.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>cryptorchidism</b> {{nearly always}} refers to {{congenital}} absence or maldescent, a testis {{observed in the}} scrotum in early infancy can occasionally [...] "reascend" [...] (move back up) into the inguinal canal. A testis which can readily move or be moved between the scrotum and canal {{is referred to as}} retractile. The word is from the Greek κρυπτός, kryptos, meaning [...] hidden ὄρχις, orchis, meaning testicle.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cryptorchidism</b> {{is common}} in male dogs, {{occurring}} {{at a rate of}} up to 10%. [...] Although the genetics are not fully understood, it is thought to be a recessive, and probably polygenetic, trait. [...] Some have speculated that it is a sex-limited autosomal recessive trait; however, it is unlikely to be simple recessive. Dog testes usually descend by ten days of age and it is considered to be <b>cryptorchidism</b> if they do not descend by the age of eight weeks. [...] <b>Cryptorchidism</b> can be either bilateral (causing sterility) or unilateral, and inguinal or abdominal (or both). [...] Because it is an inherited trait, affected dogs should not be bred and should be castrated. [...] The parents should be considered carriers of the defect and a breeder should thoughtfully consider whether to breed the carrier parent or not. [...] Littermates may be normal, carriers, or cryptorchid. [...] Castration of the undescended teste(s) should be considered for cryptorchid dogs due to the high rate of testicular cancer, especially sertoli cell tumors. [...] The incidence of testicular cancer is 13.6 times higher in dogs with abdominally retained testicles compared with normal dogs. [...] Testicular torsion is also more likely in retained testicles. [...] Surgical correction is by palpation of the retained testicle and subsequent exploration of the inguinal canal or abdomen, however, it is against AKC rules to show altered dogs, making this correction pointless for breeding stock. Surgical correction is termed orchiopexy, i.e., a surgery to move an undescended testicle into the scrotum and permanently fix it there. Surgical correction is an option for pet dogs that will not be used for breeding.|$|E
2500|$|The gonads in {{individuals}} with PAIS are testes, regardless of phenotype; during the embryonic stage of development, testes form in an androgen-independent process that occurs {{due to the}} influence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. [...] <b>Cryptorchidism</b> is common, and carries with it a 50% risk of germ cell malignancy. [...] If the testes are located intrascrotally, there may still be significant risk of germ cell malignancy; studies have not yet been published to assess this risk.|$|E
2500|$|Neutering {{is usually}} {{performed}} to prevent breeding, prevent unwanted behavior, or decrease risk of future medical problems. [...] Neutering is also performed {{as an emergency}} procedure to treat certain reproductive diseases, like pyometra and testicular torsion, and {{it is used to}} treat ovarian, uterine, and testicular cancer. [...] It is also recommended in cases of <b>cryptorchidism</b> to prevent torsion and malignant transformation of the testicles. Please see spaying and neutering {{for more information on the}} advantages and disadvantages of this procedure.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cryptorchidism</b> is rarer in cats {{than it is}} in dogs. In {{one study}} 1.9% of intact male cats were cryptorchid. [...] Persians are predisposed. [...] Normally the {{testicles}} are in the scrotum by the age of six to eight weeks. [...] Urine spraying is one indication that a cat with no observable testicles may not be neutered; other signs are the presence of enlarged jowls, thickened facial and neck skin, and spines on the penis (which usually regress within six weeks after castration). Most cryptorchid cats present with an inguinal testicle.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 a {{study was}} {{published}} that investigated the possible relationship between <b>cryptorchidism</b> and prenatal {{exposure to a}} chemical called phthalate (DEHP) which {{is used in the}} manufacture of plastics. The researchers found a significant association between higher levels of DEHP metabolites in the pregnant mothers and several sex-related changes, including incomplete descent of the testes in their sons. [...] According to the lead author of the study, a national survey found that 25% of U.S. women had phthalate levels similar to the levels that were found to be associated with sexual abnormalities.|$|E
2500|$|The Greek term [...] "eunuch" [...] {{is usually}} {{used to refer}} {{forcibly}} emasculated men, {{but it is also}} used in the Septuagint to denote certain foreign political officials (resembling the meaning of [...] "eunuch"). This category does not include men who were born without visible testicles (conditions including <b>cryptorchidism),</b> or without a visible penis (conditions including hermaphroditism). There is dispute, even in traditional Judaism, about whether this prohibited group of men should include those who have become, at some point since their birth, emasculated {{as the result of a}} disease ...|$|E
2500|$|Puberty {{in young}} adults with {{cerebral}} palsy may be precocious or delayed. [...] Delayed puberty {{is thought to be}} a consequence of nutritional deficiencies. [...] There is currently no evidence that CP affects fertility, although some of the secondary symptoms have been shown to affect sexual desire and performance. [...] Adults with CP were less likely to get routine reproductive health screening as of 2005. [...] Gynecological examinations may have to be performed under anesthesia due to spasticity, and equipment is often not accessible. Breast self-examination may be difficult, so partners or carers may have to perform it. [...] Women with CP reported higher levels of spasticity and urinary incontinence during menstruation in a study. [...] Men with CP have higher levels of <b>cryptorchidism</b> at the age of 21.|$|E
