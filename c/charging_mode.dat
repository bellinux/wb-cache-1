40|$|Abstract—A {{control method}} is {{described}} to charge series-connected ultraelectric double-layer capacitors (ultra-EDLCs) suitable for photovoltaic generation systems {{in combination with}} a {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT) control method. The EDLC charge control method allows the maximum power ac-quired by the MPPT control to be quickly charged into series-connected ultra-EDLCs no matter how the weather conditions may change. In the MPPT control, the output current of the solar arrays is controlled so that the output power converges on the maximum power in the prediction line previously determined based on the linearity between the maximum output power and the optimization current. The proportionality coefficient of the prediction line is automatically corrected using the hill-climbing method when the panel temperature of the solar arrays is changed. The EDLC charge control is performed with the three <b>charge</b> <b>modes,</b> i. e., the constant current <b>charge</b> <b>mode,</b> constant power <b>charge</b> <b>mode,</b> and the constant voltage <b>charge</b> <b>mode</b> while super-vising the maximum voltage and allowable temperature of each series-connected EDLC.

Besides the nanoparticle polarizability and the far-field response, the near-field enhancement around nanoparticles can be also conveniently expressed as an eigenmode sum of resonant terms. Moreover, the spatial configuration of the near-field enhancement depends explicitly on the eigenfunctions of both the BIE integral operator and of its adjoint.
