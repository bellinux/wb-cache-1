On some evenings, various groups from Cyprus and abroad perform folk dancing and there are also choirs and others.|$|R

[...] "But unhappily in England {{at present}} might makes right, {{and you may}} be sure that at King Richard's death, be it when it may, Prince John will make a bold throw for the throne, and, aided as he will be by the pope and by Philip of France, methinks that his chances are better than those of the young prince. A man's power, in warlike times, is more than a boy's. He can intrigue and promise and threaten, while a boy must {{be in the hands of}} partisans. I fear that Prince Arthur will have troubled times indeed before he mounts the throne of England. Should Richard survive until he becomes of age to take the field himself and head armies, he may succeed, for all speak well of him as a boy of {{singular}} sweetness of disposition, while Prince John is detested by all save those who flatter and live by him. But enough for the present of politics, Cuthbert; let us now to table. It is long since we two feasted together; and, indeed, such meals as we took in the Holy Land could scarcely have been called feasts. A boar's head and a good roasted capon are worthy all the strange dishes that we had there. I always misdoubted the meat, which seemed to me to smack in flavor of the Saracens, and I never could bring myself to inquire whence that strange food was obtained. A stoup of English ale, too, is worth all the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wines,</b> especially when the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wines</b> are half-full of the sand of the desert. Pah! it makes my throat dry to think of those horrible meals. So you have brought Cnut and your four archers safely back with you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|During the Ottoman {{occupation}} of the island, wine production went into decline. This was attributed to two factors: Islamic tradition and heavy taxation. Indicative are reports written mainly by French and British travelers of the time; Cyrus Redding writes in 1851:the vine grower of Cyprus hides from his neighbour the amount of his vintage, and always buries part of his produce for concealment; the exactions of the government are so great, that his profit upon what he allows to be seen is too little to remunerate him for his loss in time and labour. [...] The quality of the wine produced also lagged behind times with Samuel Baker referring to Cypriot wines in 1879 [...] "It should be understood that no quality of <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wines</b> is suitable to the English palate".|$|R

60|$|My {{very dear}} Friend,--I cannot be certain, from my recollections, whether I {{did or did}} not write to you before, as you suggest; but as you never {{received}} the letter and I was in a continual press of different thoughts, the probability is that I did not write. The <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine</b> in the second vial I certainly did receive; and was grateful to you with the whole force of the aroma of it. And now I will tell you an anecdote.|$|E
60|$|The time {{which he}} chose for his visit was noon; and the pretence, {{to present the}} Archduke with some choice <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine</b> which had lately fallen into his hands, and discuss its {{comparative}} merits with those of Hungary and of the Rhine. An intimation of his purpose was, of course, answered by a courteous invitation to partake of the Archducal meal, and every effort was used to render it fitting the splendour of a sovereign prince. Yet the refined taste of the Italian saw more cumbrous profusion than elegance or splendour in the display of provisions under which the board groaned.|$|E
50|$|The {{next big}} export product {{came in the}} form of Cyprus Sherry. It was first marketed by that name in 1937 and was {{exported}} mainly to northern Europe. By the 1960s, Britain was consuming 13.6 million litres of <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wines,</b> half the island's production, mostly as sweet sherry. A British market research study of fortified wines in 1978 showed Emva cream was the leading Cyprus sherry in terms of brand recognition, and second in that market only to Harveys' Bristol Cream.The island became the UK's third leading wine supplier behind France and Spain. A major factor was that Cyprus Sherry was more affordable than Spanish Sherry as British taxation favoured alcoholic beverages with an alcoholic content below the 15.5-18 percent bracket. This competitive advantage was lost a few years later with the re-banding of the alcohol content taxation. The fortified wine market also began to shrink as a whole due to a change in consumer taste and as a result Cyprus sherry sales in the UK fell from their peak in the early 1970s by some 65 percent by the mid 1980s. The final blow came when the EC ruled that as of January 1996 only fortified wine from Jerez could assume the title of sherry.|$|R
5000|$|In Greece, local Retsina is {{produced}} throughout the country. Major production centers around Attica, Boeotia and Euboea. The European Union treats the name [...] "Retsina" [...] as a protected {{designation of origin}} and traditional appellation for Greece and parts of the southern regions of <b>Cyprus.</b> An Australian <b>wine</b> style made in South Australia can be called [...] "resinated wine" [...] but not [...] "Retsina".|$|R
50|$|The {{first wave}} of {{expansion}} for Cypriot wines came with the misfortunes of the European viticulture sector. The phylloxera epidemic that affected mainland Europe in the late 19th century had destroyed the majority of <b>wine</b> producing vines. <b>Cyprus,</b> an island with strict quarantine controls managed to remain unaffected. As a consequence, demand for <b>Cyprus</b> grapes and <b>wines</b> coupled to the relatively high prices offered resulted in a mini boom for the industry. Further demand early in the early 20th century came from local consumption and from the regional forces of Britain and France in the Middle East. Cyprus produced quality cheap wine and spirits (mainly {{in the form of}} Cyprus brandy) and the big four companies prospered as a result.|$|R
60|$|All {{preliminaries}} being arranged and {{communicated to}} the defendant and his godfathers, Abdullah the Hadgi was admitted to a more private interview, where he heard with delight the strains of Blondel. Having first carefully put his green turban out of sight, and assumed a Greek cap in its stead, he requited the Norman minstrel's music with a drinking song from the Persian, and quaffed a hearty flagon of <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine,</b> to show that his practice matched his principles. On the next day, grave and sober as the water-drinker Mirglip, he bent his brow to the ground before Saladin's footstool, and rendered to the Soldan an account of his embassy.|$|E
60|$|My {{very dear}} Friend,--I have been {{intending}} {{every day to}} write {{to tell you that}} the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine</b> is as nectareous as possible, so fit for the gods, in fact, that I have been forced to leave it off as unfit for me; it made me so feverish. But I keep it until the sun shall have made me a little less mortal; and in the meantime recognise thankfully both its high qualities and your kind ones. How delightful it is to have this sense of a summer at hand. Shall I see you this summer, I wonder. That is a question among my dreams.|$|E
60|$|I feel {{here as a}} stranger; {{somewhat}} of Leonard's feeling. God bless Wordsworth for that poem![2] What tie have I to England? My London friends? There, indeed, I have friends. But if you and yours were with me, eating dates in a garden at Constantinople, you might assert {{that we were in}} {{the best of all possible}} places; and I should answer, Amen: and if our wives rebelled, we would send for the chief of the black eunuchs, and sell them to the Seraglio. Then should Moses [3] learn Arabic, and we would know whether there was anything in the language or not. We would drink <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine</b> and Mocha coffee, and smoke more tranquilly than ever we did in the Ship in Small Street.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Wine</b> Festival of <b>Cyprus</b> is {{an annual}} festival in Limassol, <b>Cyprus</b> that celebrates <b>wine</b> and winemaking. The festival was first {{organized}} in 1961 {{and since then}} {{it has become an}} established annual event of merrymaking and fun, in which the citizens of Limassol are not the only participants; visitors come also from every part of Cyprus. Its reputation is spread beyond the geographic boundaries of the island. In September of each year, Limassol becomes the attraction of thousands of locals and tourists who visit the Municipal Garden to enjoy the Wine Festival with the motto 'Drink wine, it gives you life!' (Πίνε κρασί, νάσιεις ζωή). They become the protagonists of the Festival banishing from their minds all concerns and worries, free from social conventions or protocols, in an atmosphere of unconditional fraternization, generated by the effects of free wine provided by local wineries ETKO, KEO, SODAP and LOEL. The Wine Festival can be regarded as a variant and a revival of ancient festive manifestations of worship in honour of Dionysus, the god of wine, and Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty and love. During these feasts people worshiped their gods, but primarily enjoyed themselves.|$|R
60|$|My dearest Mr. Boyd,--As Arabel {{has written}} {{out for you}} the glorification of 'Peter of York,'[130] I shall use an edge of the same paper to 'fall on your sense' with my {{gratitude}} about the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine.</b> Indeed, I could almost upbraid you for sending me another bottle. It is most supererogatory kindness in you to think of such a thing. And I accept it, nevertheless, with thanks instead of remonstrances, and promise you to drink your health in and the spring in together, and the east wind out, {{if you do not}} object to it. I have been better for several days, but my heart is not yet very orderly--not being able to recover the veins, I suppose, all in a moment.|$|E
60|$|It is {{the hour}} of love and of faro; now is the hour to press your suit and to break a bank; to glide from the {{apartment}} of rapture into the chamber of chance. Thus a noble Venetian contrived to pass the night, in alternations of excitement that in general left him sufficiently serious for the morrow's council. For more vulgar tastes there was the minstrel, the conjuror, and the story-teller, goblets of <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine,</b> flasks of sherbet, and confectionery that dazzled like diamonds. And for every one, from the grave senator to the gay gondolier, there was an atmosphere in itself a spell, and which, after all, {{has more to do}} with human happiness than all the accidents of fortune and all the arts of government.|$|E
60|$|Certainly I {{agree with}} you {{that there can be no}} {{necessity}} for explaining anything about the tutorship if you do not kick against the pricks of the insinuation yourself, and especially as I consider that you were in a sense my 'tutor,' inasmuch as I may say, both that nobody ever taught me so much Greek as you, and also that without you I should have probably lived and died without any knowledge of the Greek Fathers. The Greek classics I should have studied by love and instinct; but the Fathers would probably have remained in their sepulchres, as far as my reading them was concerned. Therefore, very gratefully do I turn to you as my 'tutor' in the best sense, and the more persons call you so, the better it is for the pleasures of my gratitude. The review amused me by hitting on the right meaning there, and besides by its percipiency about your remembering me during your travels in the East, and sending me home the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine.</b> Some of these reviewers have a wonderful gift at inferences. The 'Metropolitan Magazine' for March (which is to be sent to you when papa has read it) contains a flaming article in my favour, calling me 'the friend of Wordsworth,' and, moreover, a very little lower than the angels. You shall see it soon, and it is only just out, of course, being the March number. The praise is beyond thanking for, and then I do not know whom to thank--I cannot at all guess at the writer.|$|E
60|$|The most prosperous time {{of all the}} Turkish {{power was}} under Solyman the Magnificent, who spread his empire from the borders of Hungary to those of Persia, and held in truth nearly the same empire as Alexander the Great. He conquered the island of Rhodes, on the Christmas day of 1522, from the Knights of St. John, who were Frankish monks sworn {{to fight against the}} Mahommedans. Cyprus belonged to the Venetians, and in 1571 a Jew, who had renounced his faith, persuaded Sultan Selim to have it attacked, that he might gain his {{favourite}} <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine</b> for the pressing, instead of buying it. The Venetian stores of gunpowder had been blown up by an accident, and they could not send help in time to the unfortunate governor, who was made prisoner, and treated with most savage cruelty. However, fifty years later, in 1571, the powers of Europe joined together under Don John of Austria, the brother of the king of Spain, and beat the Turks in a great sea-fight at Lepanto, breaking their strength for many years after; but the king, Philip II. (the husband of our Mary I.), was jealous of his brother, and called him home, and after that the Venetians were obliged to make peace, and give up Cyprus. The misfortune was that the Greeks and Latins hated each other so much that they never would make common cause heartily against the Turks, and the Greeks did not like to be under Venetian protection; but Venice kept Crete, or Candia, as it was now called, till 1670, when the Turks took it, after a long and terrible siege, lasting more than two years, during which the bravest and most dashing gentlemen of France made a wild expedition to help the Christian cause. But all was in vain; Candia fell, and most of the little isles in the Archipelago came one by one under the cruel power of the Turks.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{days after}} the scene was quite changed. We were {{out of sight of}} the {{classical}} country, and lay in St. George's Bay, behind a huge mountain, upon which St. George fought the dragon, and rescued the lovely Lady Sabra, the King of Babylon's daughter. The Turkish fleet was lying about us, commanded by that Halil Pasha whose two children the two last Sultans murdered. The crimson flag, with the star and crescent, floated at the stern of his ship. Our diplomatist put on his uniform and cordons, and paid his Excellency a visit. He spoke in rapture, when he returned, of the beauty and order of the ship, and the urbanity of the infidel Admiral. He sent us bottles of ancient <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine</b> to drink: and the captain of Her Majesty's ship [...] "Trump," [...] alongside which we were lying, confirmed that good opinion of the Capitan Pasha which the reception of the above present led us to entertain, by relating many instances of his friendliness and hospitalities. Captain G- said the Turkish ships were as well manned, as well kept, and as well manoeuvred, as any vessels in any service; and intimated a desire to command a Turkish seventy-four, and a perfect willingness to fight her against a French ship of the same size. But I heartily trust he will neither embrace the Mahometan opinions, nor be called upon to engage any seventy-four whatever. If he do, let us hope he will have his own men to fight with. If the crew of the [...] "Trump" [...] were all like the crew of the captain's boat, they need fear no two hundred and fifty men out of any country, with any Joinville at their head. We were carried on shore by this boat. For two years, during which the [...] "Trump" [...] had been lying off Beyrout, none of the men but these eight had ever set foot on shore. Mustn't it be a happy life? We were landed at the busy quay of Beyrout, flanked by the castle that the fighting old commodore half battered down.|$|E

5000|$|The rabbis of the Talmud {{expanded}} {{the description of}} the recipe for the incenses from 4 ingredients of the Hebrew Bible to 11 ingredients. as follows: The Rabbis taught: How is the incense mixture formulated? Three hundred and sixty eight mina were in it: three hundred sixty five corresponding to the days of the solar year - a mina for each day, half in the morning and half in the afternoon, and three extra mina, from which the Kohen Gadol would bring both his handfuls the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur. He would return them to the mortar on the day preceding Yom Kippur, and grind them very thoroughly so that they would be exceptionally fine. Eleven kinds of spices were in it, as follows: (1) stacte, (2) onycha, (3) galbanum, (4) frankincense - each weighing seventy mina each comprising 19.02% of the total weight; (5) myrrh, (6) cassia, (7) spikenard, (8) saffron, each weighing sixteen mina each comprising 4.35% of the total weight; (9) costus - twelve mina 3.26% of the total weight; (10) aromatic bark - three 0.82% of the total weight; and (11) cinnamon - nine 2.45% of the total weight; Additionally Carshina lye, nine kab; <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine,</b> three se'ah and three kab - if he has no <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine,</b> he brings old white wine; Sodom salt, a quarter-kab; and a minute amount of maaleh ashan. Rabbi Nathan of Babylon says: Also a minute amount of Jordan amber. If he added honey, he invalidated it; if he deliberately omitted one of the spices, he was liable to the death penalty.Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: The stacte is nothing more than the sap that drips from the branches of the balsam tree. Why was Carshina lye brought? To refine the onycha, that it be pleasant. Why was <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine</b> brought? To steep the onycha, that it be pungent; while urine (מי רגליים - mei raglaiim) was more suited for this, nevertheless, one did not bring urine into the Temple, out of respect.|$|E
5000|$|The {{other big}} market for <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wine</b> {{during the same}} period was the former Soviet bloc. Large volumes of low-quality, mass-produced, blended wines were sold to the eastern block with the {{cooperative}} wine producers (LOEL and SODAP) taking the lion’s share. This market began to dry up in the 1980s and vanished altogether with the fall of communism. Indicative of the industry's mass production tactics comes in a report by The Times in 1968 commenting on [...] "the end of an underwater pipeline off the coast of Limassol linking to tankers taking on not gas or oil but wine - 100 tons an hour of it - destined for about 40 countries throughout the world." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{traditional}} industry confronting market {{change is}} examined here, for the wine industry {{is important to}} the economy of Cyprus. Cyprus had to reinvent itself as a wine producer after receiving a double blow: losing its main product, sherry, as a result of nomenclature protection by the European Union and the loss of its largest market after the fall of communism. The objective here is to examine the product (wine) and how it may be improved and upgraded for a more sophisticated market. Product quality and branding then immediately rise to the fore but to ensure that all the issues are being properly addressed, soundings were taken from local, Greek and international wine professionals as well as local consumers. There are 52 wineries in Cyprus but the industry is controlled by four main companies and tied mainly to a local grape variety, Mavro. The grapes are grown by people independent of the wineries and this has been a long-standing issue [...] affecting wine quality [...] as has the distance between where the grapes are grown and the wineries themselves. The methodology involved focus groups, depth interviews and an e-mail survey. Respondents were local consumers and wine experts who fell into three groups: local Cypriot, Greek and International. The findings reveal an industry that is still growing, but fragmented and dominated by the big four Cyprus wineries [...] KEO, ETKO, SODAP and LOEL, formulating the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Wine</b> Producers' Association (ΣOK [...] Συ´νδ[varepsilon]σμο[varsigma] Oινοπαραγωγω´ν Kυπρου), that possess 75. 5 per cent of the market. Way below is the market share of imported wines (16 per cent) and small local wineries (8. 5 per cent) that fall under the umbrella of the Bacchus Association (Bacchus is equated with Dionysus, the god of wine in Greek mythology). There is also great secrecy and unwillingness on behalf of local wineries to work together, which serves to perpetuate existing weaknesses and work against attempts to develop branding associations. The inescapable conclusion is that necessary change will require the adoption of branding that in turn will require greater investment in the product and then its promotion and labelling...|$|E
