5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.)

5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization. Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the <b>Curie</b> <b>point</b> phase transition in ferromagnetic materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization. The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on antiferromagnetism led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E

25|$|Type K (chromel–alumel) is {{the most}} common {{general-purpose}} thermocouple with a sensitivity of approximately 41µV/°C.

Type K was specified at a time when metallurgy was less advanced than it is today, and consequently characteristics may vary considerably between samples.

At 912°C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope, or ferrite. Finally, at 770°C (the <b>Curie</b> <b>point,</b> Tc) iron's magnetic ordering changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic.

In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation; however, the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10micrometres across. This happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the dz2 and dx2 − y2 orbitals, which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the body-centered cubic lattice and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding; thus, they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align.|$|E
