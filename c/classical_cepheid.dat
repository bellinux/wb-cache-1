50|$|In the mid 20th century, {{significant}} {{problems with the}} astronomical distance scale were resolved by dividing the Cepheids into different classes with very different properties. In the 1940s, Walter Baade recognized two separate populations of <b>Cepheids</b> (<b>classical</b> and type II). <b>Classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> are younger and more massive population I stars, whereas type II Cepheids are older fainter Population II stars. <b>Classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> and type II Cepheids follow different period-luminosity relationships. The luminosity of type II Cepheids is, on average, less than <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> by about 1.5 magnitudes (but still brighter than RR Lyrae stars).

40|$|Systematics of {{the light}} curves of <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> with the longest known periods have been {{investigated}} {{with the help of}} full-amplitude models of pulsating stellar envelopes. For periods exceeding about 60 days, flat-topped light curves of the S Vul type are found to replace the smooth, asymmetric light curves characteristic of the slightly faster Cepheids. Predicted light and velocity amplitudes (although not the predicted radius amplitudes) agree well with observations. Variables with fluctuating light minima are observed to lie well off the mean period-luminosity relation, as are a few other (more stable?) variables with similarly long periods. The explanation for the long periods is probably low effective temperature rather than a low stellar mass. Because of the abnormal slowness of the <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> with periods longer than about 100 days, it is recommended that these variables not be used to calibrate the mean period-luminosity relation.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{collection}} of 250 anomalous Cepheids (ACs) discovered in the OGLE-IV fields toward the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The LMC sample {{is an extension of}} the OGLE-III Catalog of ACs published in 2008, while the SMC sample contains the first known bona fide ACs in this galaxy. The total sample is composed of 141 ACs in the LMC and 109 ACs in the SMC. All these stars pulsate in single modes: fundamental (174 objects) or first overtone (76 objects). Additionally, we report the discovery of four ACs located in the foreground of the Magellanic Clouds. These are the first fundamental-mode ACs known in the Galactic field. We demonstrate that the coefficients phi_ 21 and phi_ 31 determined by the Fourier light curve decomposition are useful discriminators between <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> and ACs, at least in the LMC and in the field of the Milky Way. In the SMC, the light curve shapes and mean magnitudes of short-period <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> make them similar to ACs, which is a source of difficulties in the discrimination of both classes of pulsators. The presence of unidentified ACs in the catalogs of <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> may be partly responsible for the observed non-linearity of the period-luminosity relation observed for short-period Cepheids in the SMC. We compare spatial distributions of ACs, <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> and RR Lyr stars. We show that the distribution of ACs resembles that of old stars (RR Lyr variables), although in the LMC there are visible structures typical for young population (<b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids)</b> : the bar and spiral arms. This may suggest that ACs are a mixture of relatively young stars and mergers of very old stars. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Acta Astronomic...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheid's</b> {{luminosity}} {{is directly}} related to its period of variation. The longer the pulsation period, the more luminous the star. The period-luminosity relation for <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> was discovered in 1908 by Henrietta Swan Leavitt in an investigation of thousands of variable stars in the Magellanic Clouds. She published it in 1912 with further evidence. Once the period-luminosity relationship is calibrated, the luminosity of a given Cepheid whose period is known can be established. Their distance is then found from their apparent brightness. The period-luminosity relationship has been calibrated by many astronomers throughout the twentieth century, beginning with Hertzsprung. [...] Calibrating the period-luminosity relation has been problematic; however, a firm Galactic calibration was established by Benedict et al. 2007 using precise HST parallaxes for 10 nearby <b>classical</b> <b>Cepheids.</b> Also, in 2008, ESO astronomers estimated with a precision within 1% the distance to the Cepheid RS Puppis, using light echos from a nebula in which it is embedded.

We detected 34 candidate variable stars in the galaxy. We classify three of them as <b>Classical</b> <b>Cepheids,</b> with periods of 8. 71, 125. 0 and 130. 3 days, respectively, and other two as long period variables with periodicities longer than a hundred days.

The period distribution of the confirmed Cepheids is markedly different from what is seen in other nearby galaxies, which is likely related to the star bursting nature of IZw 18. By applying to the 8. 71 days Cepheid theoretical Wesenheit (V,I) relations based on new pulsation models of <b>Classical</b> <b>Cepheids</b> specifically computed for the extremely low metallicity of this galaxy (Z= 0. 0004, Y= 0. 24), we estimate the distance modulus of IZw 18 to be mu_ 0 = 31. 4 pm 0. 2 D= 19. 0 ^{+ 1. 8 }_{- 1. 7 }Mpc) for canonical models of <b>Classical</b> <b>Cepheids,</b> and of 31. 2 pm 0. 2 mag (D= 17. 4 ^{+ 1. 6 }_{- 1. 6 }Mpc) using over luminous models.
