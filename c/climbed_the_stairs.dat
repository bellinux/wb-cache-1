25|$|The {{design of}} the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus, with its Baroque nature {{emphasised}} by the zigzag form of its stairways, influenced many other sites in Portugal (like Lamego) and colonial Brazil, like the Sanctuary of Congonhas. As the pilgrims <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> (by tradition encouraged to do so on their knees) they encountered a theological programme that contrasted the senses of the material world with {{the virtues of the}} spirit, {{at the same time as}} they experienced the scenes of the Passion of Christ. The culmination of the effort was the temple of God, the church on the top of the hill. The presence of several fountains along the stairways give the idea of purification of the faithful.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Ogilby's daughter, Sharlene, had {{returned}} from the shops; she entered the club, <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{to the first floor}} and began banging on the door and crying for her mother. Although by this stage Ogilby had sustained severe head injuries from the brutal assault, Sharlene heard her screaming and pleading with her assailants for mercy while they danced to blaring disco music. Ignoring the injured woman's pleas for her life and Sharlene's cries, [...] Henrietta Cowan, once again wielding a brick, resumed beating Ogilby on the head with renewed vigour until she lay dead on the floor. The beating session had lasted for over an hour. Ogilby received (according to the later autopsy report) a total of 24 blows to the head and body with a blunt object, 14 of which had caused [...] "a severe fracture to the bulk of the skull".|$|E
2500|$|A metal {{staircase}} {{reaches the}} main deck level after 1,776 steps, and the SkyPod [...] above after 2,579 steps; {{it is the}} tallest metal staircase on Earth. These stairs are intended for emergency use only and are not open to the public, except for two times per year for charity stair-climb events. The average climber takes approximately 30 minutes to climb {{to the base of}} the radome, but the fastest climb on record is 7 minutes and 52 seconds in 1989 by Brendan Keenoy, an Ontario Provincial Police officer. In 2002, Canadian Olympian and Paralympic champion Jeff Adams <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> of the tower in a specially designed wheelchair. The stairs were originally on one of the three sides of the tower (facing north), with a glass view, but these were later replaced with the third elevator pair and the stairs were moved to the inside of the core. Top climbs on the new, windowless stairwell used since around 2003 have generally been over ten minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Dodge {{approached}} Jacques Gershkovitch, a Russian immigrant in Portland guest {{conducting the}} Portland Symphony (which {{would later become}} the Oregon Symphony), about the orchestra after seeing him conduct. Though Gershkovitch first explained {{that he did not}} teach children, Dodge insisted that he come listen to the youth ensemble she had assembled. One orchestra member recalled: [...] "I well remember the excitement of that night when Gershkovitch <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to Mary Dodge's attic, where we had assembled to play for him. He listened as we played our hearts out. He applauded us and said that if we got the missing instruments, he would take us on." [...] In an attempt to hand over the baton to Gershkovitch, he simply stated [...] "I take." [...] Initially, Dodge remained as associate director of the orchestra; she also assisted with sectionals, appointed a board of directors, and designated the ensemble as the Portland Junior Symphony Orchestra in 1924. The original board of directors established the mission of the orchestra: [...] "to encourage appreciation and rendition of orchestral music by young people, to give public symphonic and popular concerts, to discover and develop latent talent among the children of Portland." [...] Six years later, Dodge resigned while the orchestra was financially sound. She continued to teach and became increasingly dedicated to a scientific approach to bowing. Dodge died in 1954.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the murder {{was the result of}} a power struggle, a {{financial}} dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at [...] "outdoing" [...] the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes denies all of these rumours, stating that he killed Euronymous in self-defense: he says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: [...] "If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me." [...] He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous [...] "panicked" [...] and kicked him in the chest. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes contends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the slaying, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. The self-defense story is doubted by Emperor drummer Faust.|$|E
2500|$|According to Le Petit Parisien, Reichelt's initial {{attempt to}} ascend {{to the first}} stage of the tower was blocked by a guard, M. Gassion, who had {{witnessed}} previous unsuccessful dummy drops and feared that Reichelt's attempt would end in disaster, though Le Figaro reported that he had merely not received a copy of the order and had to wait for telephone confirmation from his superiors. Despite the guard's resistance, by 8:00a.m. the matter had been resolved: Reichelt, who was visibly shaken by his argument with the guard, was allowed to mount the tower with his two friends and a cinematographer (another was stationed near the foot of the tower to record the jump from below). As he <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> he paused, turned back to the crowd, raised his hand and wished them a cheery [...] "". (See you soon). His friends continued to try {{to talk him out of}} the jump, but Reichelt was quite determined. At 8:22a.m., observed by a crowd of about 30 journalists and curious onlookers, he readied himself – facing towards the Seine – on a stool placed on a restaurant table next to the interior guardrail of the tower's first deck, a little more than [...] above the ground. After adjusting his apparatus with the assistance of his friends and checking the wind direction by throwing a piece of paper taken from a small book, he placed one foot on the guardrail, hesitated for about 40 seconds, then leapt outwards. According to Le Figaro, he was calm and smiling just before he jumped. His parachute, which had seemed to be only half-open, folded around him almost immediately and he plummeted for a few seconds before crashing into the frozen soil at the foot of the tower.|$|E
