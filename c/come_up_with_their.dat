5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E

500|$|Overall, Yield {{resembles the}} {{straightforward}} rock {{approach of the}} band's early work. Gossard said, [...] "The songs {{were a little bit}} more structured. I don't know if it was poppier, but it seemed more professional." [...] O'Brien noted that during the Yield sessions, the band made a conscious effort to create more accessible songs. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has [...] "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten."

500|$|Birkenhead in 1928 {{challenged}} Indians to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> own {{proposal for}} constitutional change for India; in response, the Congress convened a committee {{under the leadership}} of Motilal Nehru. The Nehru Report favoured constituencies based on geography on the ground that being dependent on each other for election would bind the communities closer together. Jinnah, though he believed separate electorates, based on religion, necessary to ensure Muslims had a voice in the government, was willing to compromise on this point, but talks between the two parties failed. [...] He put forth proposals that he hoped might satisfy a broad range of Muslims and reunite the League, calling for mandatory representation for Muslims in legislatures and cabinets. These became known as his Fourteen Points. He could not secure adoption of the Fourteen Points, as the League meeting in Delhi at which he hoped to gain a vote instead dissolved into chaotic argument.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the short}} tour for No Code, the band {{went into the}} studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The {{sessions}} for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between {{all members of the}} group, with Ament stating that [...] "everybody really {{got a little bit of}} their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band." [...] On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has [...] "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten." [...] Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code, with Vedder saying, [...] "What was rage in the past has become reflection." [...] Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts. It included the singles [...] "Given to Fly" [...] and [...] "Wishlist". The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] from the album, its first music video since 1992. A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year.|$|E

2500|$|After Disney's {{acquisition}} of Marvel Entertainment in 2009, CEO Bob Iger encouraged the company's divisions to explore Marvel's properties for adaptation concepts.

We must then regard this as our abode for a long time, and make ourselves as comfortable as we can. Huts we can erect of the branches of trees, the skins of the goats we kill will provide us with bedding, and if needs be with clothing. Meat will not fail us, for should game become scarce we can buy goats and sheep from the shepherds who <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> flocks and herds from the villages by the sea. But besides this we need many things for comfort. We must have utensils for cooking, and drinking cups, and shall need flour and wine; we must therefore open communications with one of the towns by the sea.

6000|$|... “At {{this time}} the cavalry division, under General Sumner, which was lying {{concealed}} in the general vicinity of the El Pozo house, was ordered forward with directions to cross the San Juan River and deploy to the right on the Santiago side, while Kent’s division was to follow closely in its rear and deploy to the left. These troops moved forward in compliance with orders, but the road was so narrow as to render it impracticable to retain the column of fours formation at all points, while the undergrowth on both sides was so dense as to preclude the possibility of deploying skirmishers. It naturally resulted that the progress made was slow, and the long-range rifles of the enemy’s infantry killed and wounded a number of our men while marching along this road, and before there was any opportunity to return this fire. At this time Generals Kent and Sumner were ordered to push forward with all possible haste, and place their troops in position to engage the enemy. General Kent, with this end in view, forced {{the head of his}} column alongside the cavalry column as far as the narrow trail permitted, and thus hurried his arrival at the San Juan, and the formation beyond that stream. A few hundred yards before reaching the San Juan, the road forks, a fact that was discovered by Lieutenant-Colonel Derby of my staff, who had approached well to the front in a war balloon. This information he furnished to the troops, resulting in Sumner moving on the right-hand road while Kent was enabled to utilise the road to the left. General Wheeler, the permanent commander of the cavalry division, who had been ill, came forward during the morning, and later returned to duty and rendered most gallant and efficient service during the remainder of the day. After crossing the stream the cavalry moved to the right, with a view to connecting with Lawton’s left when he would <b>come</b> <b>up,</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> left resting near the Santiago road.|$|E
