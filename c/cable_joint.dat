40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>joint</b> is used {{to connect}} {{different}} sections of cable because a cable section {{is limited to a}} certain length. The design of a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> mainly depends on the cable type, the applied voltage and the cores. These factors contribute to the way of how electric field stress is distributed at the <b>cable</b> <b>joint.</b> If there are defects exist within the <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> insulation material, the electric field at that region is altered. The alteration may cause electrical discharges to occur within the defects if the electric field magnitude is larger than the breakdown strength at the defect sites. Therefore, this paper investigates the electric field distribution in a medium voltage <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> in the presence of defects. The investigation was done through modelling a medium voltage (MV) <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> using finite element analysis (FEA) software. Several parameters such as the defect size and location, insulation material dielectric constant and insulation thickness have been studied of their effects on the electric field distribution at the <b>cable</b> <b>joint.</b> The results obtained may be able to help in the designing of <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> structures which can reduce the electric field stress...|$|E

40|$|Defect in a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} reasons of a power system being faulty. A defect can cause the {{electric}} field in the <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> to become higher than the material surrounding the defect. This may result in partial discharge (PD) activity to occur within the defect site. When PD is repeating at the defect site, the material surrounding the defect will be affected, where PD may extend its path in the material. This may result in a breakdown at <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> and consequently causes breakdown on the whole system. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study the electric field distribution in 132 kV one piece premolded <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> with and without the presence of defects. A better understanding of the electric field distribution at a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> can be attained by modelling the <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> structure using finite element analysis (FEA) method.

In addition, an alternative PD off-line test method for <b>cable</b> <b>joints</b> or <b>cable</b> sections within long cable systems has been developed. By energising the joint or a short section of the cable screen only this method {{has the advantage of}} reducing the power supply requirement of the test source. The application of capacitive couplers for this PD off-line test method has been investigated. In order to use this approach there must be an insulation gap between the coupler and the outer sheath of the test cable. The effect of this gap on measured sensitivity has been investigated experimentally and {{through the use of a}} simulation model. Obtained results are in good agreement.

40|$|In {{order to}} address the {{detection}} and localization of partial discharge (PD) in cross-bonded (CB) high voltage (HV) cables, this paper investigates the characteristics of PD propagation in CB HV cables. On-line PD detection and location in power cables has been a research topic for many years. The issue has not been solved due to surrounding interference and complicated propagation modes in <b>cable</b> <b>joints.</b> It becomes even more complex with CB cables. The main challenge to PD monitoring of CB cables is {{as a result of}} the interconnectedness of the sheaths of the three single phase cables. The cross-bonding of the sheaths makes it difficult to localize which of the three phases a PD signal has emanated from. Co-axial cables are used to connect cable sheaths to cable link boxes, for ease of installation and protection against moisture. A second challenge is, therefore, the coupling characteristic when a PD pulse propagates in HV <b>cable</b> <b>joints</b> and the co-axial cables, making PD detection and localization more complex. The paper presents experimental investigations into PD pulse coupling characteristic between the cable center conductor and the sheath and the behavior of PD pulse propagation in CB HV cables, which can be used for PD localization in CB HV cable system...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} defects {{of cable}} joints always accelerate {{the deterioration of}} insulation, until finally accidents can arise due to {{the explosion of the}} joints. The formation process of this damage often involves changes in the electromagnetic, temperature and stress distribution of the <b>cable</b> <b>joint,</b> therefore, it is necessary to analyze the electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical distribution of cable joints. Aiming at solving this problem, the paper sets up a 3 -D electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical coupling model of cable joints under crimping process defects. Based on the model, the electromagnetic losses distribution, temperature distribution and stress distribution of a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> and body are calculated. Then, the coupling fields characteristics in different contact coefficient k, ambient temperature Tamb and load current I were analyzed, and according to the thermal-mechanical characteristics of a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> under internal defects, the temperature difference ΔTf and stress difference Δσf of cable surface are applied to evaluate the internal <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> defects. Finally, a simplified model of the <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> is set up to verify the accuracy of the coupling field model proposed in this paper, which indicates that the model can be used to analyze the coupling fields characteristics of cable joints and the method can be applied to evaluate crimping process defects of cable joints...|$|E

All findings presented were established from literature review involving data analysis and discussion with industry experts working across the wind industry. Application of forces, inadequate workmanship, incorrect thermal resistance or other contributing factors, all contribute to high conductor operating temperatures. High conductor operating temperatures highlight issues including insufficient environmental heat transfer due to the use of inadequate cable trenching materials. This in turn results in the imbalanced application of force, experienced at the <b>cable</b> <b>joint,</b> as a direct result of frequent thermal expansion and contraction. For most <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> failures, the root cause is insulation breakdown due to sustained deterioration of the cross-linked polyethylene insulation.

Therefore, {{it is vital}} to diagnose the insulation quality to detect early signs of insulation failure. It is well known that there is a correlation between Partial discharge (PD) and the insulation quality. Although many works have been done on PD pattern recognition, it is usually performed in a noise free environment. Also, works on PD pattern recognition in actual <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> {{are less likely to be}} found in literature. Therefore, in this work, classifications of actual <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> defect types from partial discharge data contaminated by noise were performed. Five cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared based on the defects commonly encountered on site. Three different types of input feature were extracted from the PD pattern under artificially created noisy environment. These include statistical features, fractal features and principal component analysis (PCA) features. These input features were used to train the classifiers to classify each PD defect types. Classifications were performed using three different artificial intelligence classifiers, which include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{long-term}} reliability of XLPE power cables, {{it is essential to}} understand the mechanisms of degradation and breakdown of solid insulation materials such as XLPE and its interfacial phenomena. The insulation performance of polymers usually decreases quickly with high voltage application, if partial discharges (PD) occur in voids or defects. Hence, PD detection and diagnosis {{are one of the most}} important means to test HV cables. In the recent years, PD tests have been widely conducted after XLPE cables were completed, and the importance of PD test has been already recognized [1]. Moreover, we have investigated physical phenomena and degradation processes by measuring PD of XLPE <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> [2 - 6].

The capacitive coupler has good detection sensitivity and PD location can be realised by studying the time of flight between signals from two sensors. The difference in pulse shape, spectrum and time of flight between an internal discharge and external interference has been investigated.

40|$|Cross linked {{polyethylene}} (XLPE) cables {{are widely}} used in power industries due to their good electrical and mechanical properties. Cable joints are the weakest point in the XLPE cables and most susceptible to insulation failures. Any <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> insulation breakdown may cause a huge loss to power companies. Therefore, {{it is vital to}} diagnose the insulation quality to detect early signs of insulation failure. Partial discharge (PD) measurement is a vital tool for assessing the insulation quality at cable joints. Since the past, there have been many pattern recognition methods to classify PD, where each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Although many works have been done on PD pattern recognition, it is usually performed in a noise-free environment. Also, works on PD pattern recognition are mostly done on lab fabricated insulators, where works using actual cable joints {{are less likely to be}} found in literature. Therefore, in this work, classification of real <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> defect types using partial discharge measurement under noisy environment was performed. Five cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared based on the defects commonly encountered on site. A novel high noise tolerance principal component analysis (PCA) -based feature extraction was proposed and compared against conventional input features such as statistical features and fractal features. These input features were used to train the classifiers to classify each PD defect type. Classifications were performed using three different artificial intelligence classifiers, which include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of each classifier and feature extraction method was evaluated. It was found that SVM and ANN performed well while ANFIS classification accuracy was the weakest.

The work undertaken here examines whether a repetitive pulse of varying amplitude and frequency, injected into an experimental arrangement that simulates buried power cables, is being detected by two simple antennae above ground.
