5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical <b>call</b> {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet <b>call.</b> It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell <b>call</b> resembles the clinking <b>call,</b> and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging <b>call</b> of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E
5|$|Singing also occurs {{outside the}} {{breeding}} season, taking place {{throughout the year}} apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of <b>call</b> have been described including a flock <b>call,</b> threat <b>call,</b> attack <b>call,</b> snarl <b>call</b> and copulation <b>call.</b> The alarm <b>call</b> is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making {{a great deal of}} noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.|$|E
5|$|The hoot is a short, soft <b>call</b> and {{is another}} form of contact <b>call.</b> It is a more {{intimate}} <b>call</b> than the wail and is used exclusively between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members know where it is. This <b>call</b> is often heard when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.|$|E

5|$|The main <b>call</b> of the American white ibis is a honking sound, {{transcribed}} as urnk, urnk, or hunk, hunk. The <b>call</b> {{is used in}} flight, courtship or when disturbed.

5|$|A {{different}} <b>call</b> is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain <b>call</b> that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial <b>call</b> that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress <b>call,</b> emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched <b>call.</b> It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E
5|$|A loon’s wail {{is a long}} <b>call</b> {{consisting}} of up to three notes, and is often compared to a wolf’s howl. It uses this <b>call</b> to communicate its location to other loons.

5|$|All {{members of}} a {{resident}} pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. <b>Call</b> patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently {{in the days following}} a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant <b>call</b> types decrease and subset <b>call</b> types increase. The use of both <b>call</b> types is called biphonation. The increased subset <b>call</b> types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.|$|E
5|$|Annalee <b>Call</b> (Winona Ryder) is {{the newest}} crew member of the Betty, an undercover, second-generation {{synthetic}} (an android manufactured by other androids to appear more human) on a secret mission to kill Ripley 8 and her unborn Alien Queen.

A short high whistle is the primary contact <b>call</b> between a pair, while a harsh scraping <b>call</b> is the most common <b>call</b> used by females and large young, and brooding females <b>call</b> to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|E

5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} <b>call</b> is repeated. This <b>call</b> is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this <b>call</b> when they hear it. The <b>call</b> is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The <b>call</b> varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck <b>call</b> when alone. Females make a whistling <b>call</b> composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah <b>call</b> in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm <b>call</b> when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic <b>call</b> than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement <b>call</b> which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This <b>call</b> is modified to a quieter courtship <b>call</b> on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement <b>call</b> and a release <b>call</b> given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright <b>call</b> is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain <b>call</b> when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E
