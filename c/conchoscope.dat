Then, bacterial flora was isolated from the respective part on urethra by means of the sterilized swab method, which was followed by direct smearing of the bacteria upon a medium. Besides, by using (5) Otoscope or (6) Urethroscope (each of same to the above mentioned), bacterial flora in urethra was printed on a gum-strip which is made of condom in a narrow girdle. In the method (7), urethral bacteria were adhered on a Glass-tube of 1 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length by making the tube touched on the wall of urethra through the lateral hole of Urethroscope. 2) In 170 n ormal female human subjects, bacterial flora was iso l a ted from appointed parts on the urethra by means of the above respective ' kinds of isolating method, and, as the control, the bacterial flora was also collected under conditions without cleaning of the urethra. The respective bacterial flora was subjected to the experiments of aerobic cultivation. 3) B e ing {{based on the results of}} the culture of bacterial flora which was isolated from an appointed part on urethra by means of the above 7 kinds of sterilization method as well as the control method, comparative studies were undertaken to determine the superiority or inferiority among the all 8 kinds of procedure mentioned above. It was suggested that the simple procedures with the least contamination are the method (3) so far as the isolation of flora is made from an inner part of 2. 5 cm in the distance from he external urethral orifice, and also method (4) so far, as the isolation is made from the further internal part of urethra. Satisfactory results were obtained in pure cultivation in case that both method, (3) and (4), were used conjunctively with each other...|$|E
