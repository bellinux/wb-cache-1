5|$|The Barons of the Cinque Ports {{also participated}} in the ceremony. Formerly, the barons were {{the members of the}} House of Commons {{representing}} the Cinque Ports of Hastings, New Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich. Reforms in the 19thcentury, however, integrated the Cinque Ports into a regular <b>constituency</b> <b>system</b> applied throughout the nation. At later coronations, barons were specially designated from among the city councillors for the specific purpose of attending coronations. Originally, the barons were charged with bearing a ceremonial canopy over the sovereign during the procession to and from Westminster Abbey. The last time the barons performed such a task was at the coronation of GeorgeIV in 1821. The barons did not return for the coronations of WilliamIV (who insisted on a simpler, cheaper ceremonial) and Victoria. At coronations since Victoria's, the barons have attended the ceremony, but they have not carried canopies.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome of}} voting under PR-STV is {{proportional}} in party terms {{within a single}} election to the collective preference of voters, assuming voters have ranked their real preferences and vote along strict party lines. However, due to other voting mechanisms usually {{used in conjunction with}} STV, such as a district or <b>constituency</b> <b>system,</b> an election using STV may not guarantee proportionality across all districts put together. Differential turnout across districts, for example, may alter the impact of individual votes in different constituencies, and when combined with rounding errors associated with a finite number of winners in each constituency the election as a whole may throw up anomalous results from a purely party perspective.|$|E
2500|$|A monarch-appointed senate with 100 {{members was}} established, equal {{in size to}} the house of representatives. As in {{previous}} constitutions, the monarch still did not have an absolute veto. However, the monarch-appointed senate could, through a simple majority over the combined houses of parliament, sustain a royal veto.

Thus in practice, the Supreme Council of State itself selected and appointed senators and had the power of veto).
