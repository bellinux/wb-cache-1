The physico chemical properties of the biodiesel/petro diesel blends were determined. The properties are specific gravity, viscosity, flash point, calorific value, sulphur content, <b>copper</b> <b>strip</b> <b>corrosion,</b> colour, diesel index, cetane number, and cloud point. It was observed that, 9 out of the 10 properties determined conform to ASTM standards except for the colour which was dark brown for the oil and biodiesel, and brown for the automotive gasoline oil. The specific gravity and viscosity increase with percentage increase of biodiesel in the blends.

However, the used oil-waste generated by the automobiles and other allied industries poses an environmental hazard. The motivation of the present research study was to study the merits and demerits of commonly applicable technique acid/clay for reclamation of waste oil. This process has been employed for many years as the premier type of re-refining in which concentrated sulfuric acid is introduced to dehydrate waste lubricating oil. An acidic sludge is produced which is treated with clay. In this study, the conventional process of reclamation of waste oil, which is acid/clay, has been reviewed in the light of recovered product quality and hazardous effects on the environment and human health. Forty samples, in which, waste oil (10), reclaimed oil (30) were collected from different blending and reclamation plants located in different areas of the Punjab Province and were compared with two stroke blended oil (10 samples). The samples were tested for kinematic viscosity at 40 and 100 ºC, Viscosity Index, Flash point, Sulfated Ash content, Copper Corrosion, Water content, Sediments and Color by following the standard ASTM Methods D- 445, D- 2270, D- 92, D- 482, D- 130, D- 95, D- 473 and D- 1500 (ASTM, 2002), respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1952 In the mid 1930 's the Diesel engine, which {{formerly}} {{was used}} {{only as a}} large, low-speed machine, was developed into a smaller high-speed engine for use in trucks, busses, and tractors. Along with these changes in mechanical design came many problems, of which a major one was lubrication. Because ordinary mineral lubricating oils quickly deteriorate, certain chemical compounds were mixed with the oils to improve their performance. Introduction of the chemical additives to the Diesel engine lubricants met with considerable success and the practice was soon followed in spark-ignition engine lubrication. The additives used now include such chemical compounds as anti-oxidants, anti-corrosive agents, extreme pressure agents, viscosity index improvers, and pour point depressants. In addition to the compounds developed by petroleum and chemical companies, other commercial addition agents, which are sold in auto supply stores and service stations, have appeared with many and varied claims. Today {{there are many of}} these "patent medicine" mixtures on the market. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the stability of a representative group of these commercial addition agents in an internal combustion engine. A small single cylinder, water-cooled Lauson was used as the test engine. It was mounted on a test stand with a direct current generator and a control panel. The procedure followed in the tests was adapted from the Coordinating Research Council Handbook. It consisted of a standardized break-in period with a reference oil, and a test time of 36 -hours with an additive-reference oil mixture. The reference oil, of high rating, was procured from the Coordinating Research Council for the control in these tests. The oil or additive mixture, after the 36 -hour test period, was analyzed by the following ASTM tests: Gravity, viscosity at 100 F and 210 F, flash and fire points, water and sediment, neutralization number, precipitation number, and <b>copper</b> <b>strip</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Photomicrographs were taken to observe the extent of corrosion on copper-lead bearing sections, cut from a bearing whose composition was 65 per cent copper and 35 per cent lead. These specimens had been present in the sump during the test run. Two different oil temperatures were utilized to obtain extremes in operating conditions. One oil temperature was 212 F and the second at 110 F, with 25 ml of water added to the crankcase. The first value simulated long, hot weather, driving conditions and the second town driving with many starts and stops and low oil temperature. The results of the tests are summarized as follows: 1. The addition of water to the crankcase accelerated the deterioration of the additive-reference oil mixture. 2. There were definite tendencies in most additives to corrode the copper-lead bearing strips. 3. The additives did not prevent carbon deposits or sludge formation to any greater degree than the reference oil. 4.

In this experiment, one size experimental unit is an individual <b>copper</b> <b>strip.</b> The treatments or factors that were applied to the individual strips are solution temperature and current (these factors were changed each time a new strip was placed in the solution). The other or larger size experimental unit is a set of four <b>copper</b> <b>strips.</b> The treatment or factor that was applied to a set of four strips is solution concentration (this factor was changed after four strips were processed).

The sensor consists of layers of thin-film copper and PDMS, and the model {{can be used to}} determine the effects on sensor sensitivity and durability of variations in material properties and geometry. The model was used to study the effect of variations in copper thickness. Four copper thicknesses, 0. 3 [mu]m, 0. 5 [mu]m, 3 [mu]m, and 9 [mu]m, were analyzed under a range of pressure loads. The thickness of the copper affected both the stress in the material and the displacement of the copper when a pressure load was applied to the sensor model. The stress in the sensor was highest for 3 [mu]m copper, potentially causing decreased durability in this sensor. The separation between the <b>copper</b> <b>strips</b> beneath the pressure load was highest for 9 [mu]m copper, so this sensor may have lower accuracy for small loads. Thin <b>copper</b> <b>strips</b> are challenging to manufacture, so the largest but most accurate and durable <b>copper</b> <b>strip</b> thickness, 0. 5 [mu]m, is recommended from this analysis. by Shira M.
