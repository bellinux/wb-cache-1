40|$|Since the {{characteristics}} of soil compressibility are not constant with depth, {{the main purpose of}} the thesis was the calculation of the settlements and their development during the consolidation process with strain-dependent material parameters (nonlinear parameters in short). To simplify the task only wide spread load was used for calculations. We focused mainly on comparison of the consolidation times, calculated with constant and with nonlinear parameters. To verify the AJDA code which was developed {{for the purpose of this}} thesis, several comparisons of the <b>calculated</b> <b>compression</b> curves were made to the existed code CONDES 0 (Yao, Znidarcic, 1997). Because of the different material model used in both codes the overconsolidation pressure and swelling constant were suitably modified to obtain the agreement of the <b>calculated</b> <b>compression</b> lines. According to expectations the compression lines obtained with the above mentioned codes did not fully fit the oedometer measurements in the first load step, while in next load steps a satisfying agreement was obtained. A comparison of the calculated and measured response was performed for the test embankment on Ljubljana marshland and comparable settlements were obtained. On the basis of the presented calculations and comparisons to other computer codes and the performed measurements we can conclude that the AJDA code is suitable for the calculation of the consolidation settlements and their development during time for constant as well as for the nonlinear parameters. The main difference between these two calculations is the required time period of the consolidation process. In average the calculated time with the nonlinear parameters is approximately half of time calculated with the constant parameters...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Understanding {{the spatial}} {{variability}} of the snowpack {{is a crucial}} step to improve accuracy in field data collection and avalanche forecasting. While there has already been a large volume of literature assessing the spatial variability of the snowpack, inconsistent sampling designs make comparing results difficult. This work uses an overlapping 10 by 10 m grid to collect Extended Column (ECT), <b>Compression</b> (<b>CT)</b> and Stuffblock (SB) test data at the slope scale {{across a range of}} environmental settings and climatic regimes in Montana and New Zealand. The overlapping grid methodology standardizes data collection between our sites, as well as allowing for repeat data collection on the same slope, thereby providing a new method for attempting to assess changes in spatial variability over time. Preliminary results suggest that the spatial variability of fracture propagation and fracture initiation may increase over time, and that the spatial variability of the fracture propagation propensity {{may be related to the}} processes causing the instability. As we collect more data, these results will provide further insight into the problem of snow pit location and representivity, both in terms of space and time...|$|R

The complete elastic tensor for each polymorph was determined at room temperature and pressure via analysis of microscopic strain fluctuations using formalism due to Rahman and Parrinello [J. Chem.

Additionally, the isothermal compression curve was computed for {beta}-HMX for 0 {le} p {le} 10. 6 GPa; the bulk modulus K and its pressure derivative K{prime} were obtained from two fitting forms employed previously in experimental studies of the {beta}-HMX equation of state. Overall, the results indicate good agreement between the bulk modulus predicted from the measured and <b>calculated</b> <b>compression</b> curves. The bulk modulus determined directly from the elastic tensor of {beta}-HMX is in significant disagreement with the compression curve-based results.

Materials and Methods: We reviewed 23 patients operated with the diagnosis of retrosternal goiter. Twelve (52 %) of the cases were female and 11 (48 %) were male. Mean age was 53. 8 Â± 10. 9 years. Shortness of breath was seen in 12 (52 %) of the patients as the most frequent preoperative symptom. On the chest posteroanterior radiography, 18 (78 %) cases were found to have tracheal <b>compression.</b> <b>CT</b> images demonstrated retrosternal extension to the level of the aortic arch in all patients. All 23 patients were prepared for a thoracic approach. Results: Among 448 cases operated with the diagnosis of goiter, 23 patients (5. 1 %) had evidence of retrosternal goiter. Of those 23 patients, only 10 had deep retrosternal extension of the goiter that actually required a thoracic approach, which accounted for 2. 2 % of all thyroidectomies performed. Total median sternotomy in seven cases, partial sternotomy in two cases and right thoracotomy in one case were performed. Hypoparathyroidism was not detected postoperatively and no hospital mortality occurred. Conclusions: Goiters extending to the mediastinum can be excised successfully by cervical incision.

The pressure on cone crusher liners is the key factor that influences the hydraulic pressure, power draw and liner wear. In order to dynamically analyze and calculate cone crusher performance along with liner wear, a series of experiments are performed to obtain the crushed rock material samples from a crushing plant at different time intervals. In this study, piston die tests are carried out and a model relating compression coefficient, compression ratio and particle size distribution to a corresponding pressure is presented. On this basis, a new wear prediction model is proposed combining the empirical model for predicting liner wear with time parameter. A simple and practical model, based on the wear model and interparticle breakage, is presented for <b>calculating</b> <b>compression</b> ratio of each crushing zone along with liner wear. Furthermore, the size distribution of the product is calculated based on existing size reduction process model.

Working chamber geometry was defined by âcutting â it with the gate rotor blade; flute volume was computed using Greene formula; suction and discharge ports were intersected with this volume so that port opening contours were defined and their respective cross sectional areas were calculated.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare radiological evaluation of spiral CT with MRI in patients suspected of herniated discs. 57 patients with lumbosacral radicular syndrome underwent spiral CT and 1. 5 T MRI. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated 171 intervertebral discs for herniation or "bulge" and 456 nerve roots for root <b>compression,</b> once after <b>CT</b> and once after MRI. We compared interobserver agreement using the kappa statistic and we performed a paired comparison between CT and MRI. For detection of herniated or bulging discs, we observed no significant difference in interobserver agreement (CT kappa 0. 66 vs MRI kappa 0. 71; p = 0. 40). For root compression, we observed significantly better interobserver agreement at MRI evaluation (CT kappa 0. 59 vs MRI kappa 0. 78; p = 0. 01). In 30 of 171 lumbar discs (18 %) and in 54 of 456 nerve roots (12 %), the observers disagreed on whether CT results were similar to MRI. In the cases without disagreement, CT differed from MRI in 6 discs (3. 5 %) and in 3 nerve roots (0. 7 %).

Quicker transmission of electrocardiogram signals through channels like across wireless networks, telephone networks, hospital networks is not possible without compressing them. Here I implement an algorithm for ECG (electrocardiogram) signal compression based on Delta Coding and LZW (LempelâZivâWelch) encoding. To carry out compression, real time ECG data has been recorded through EKG sensors and Labview. Since the recorded signal was analogue it was first converted to digital by applying Savitzky Golay Filter, uniform sampler and quantizer sequentially. Then the signal was compressed using delta coding and LZW coding. Then the compressed signal was decompressed and then further converted to analogue. Finally the reconstructed signal was compared with the original signal. This was done for six different analogue samples.

40|$|The spin {{crossover}} of iron in Fe$^{ 3 +}$-bearing bridgmanite, {{the most}} abundant mineral of the Earth's lower mantle, is by now a well-established phenomenon, though several aspects of this crossover remain unclear. Here we investigate effects of disorder, iron concentration, and temperature on this crossover using ab initio LDA + U$_{sc}$ calculations. The effect of concentration and disorder are addressed using complete statistical samplings of coupled substituted configurations in super-cells containing up to 80 atoms. Vibrational/thermal effects on the crossover are addressed within the quasiharmonic approximation. The effect of disorder seems quite small, while increasing iron concentration results in considerable increase in crossover pressure. Our <b>calculated</b> <b>compression</b> curves for iron-free, Fe$^{ 2 +}$-, and Fe$^{ 3 +}$-bearing bridgmanite compare well with the latest experimental measurements. The comparison also suggests that in a close system, Fe$^{ 2 +}$ present in the sample may transform into Fe$^{ 3 +}$ by introduction of Mg and O vacancies with increasing pressure. As in the spin crossover in ferropericlase, this crossover in bridgmanite {{is accompanied by a}} clear volume reduction and an anomalous softening of the bulk modulus throughout the crossover pressure range. These effects reduce significantly with increasing temperature. Though the concentration of [Fe$^{ 3 +}$]$_{Si}$ in bridgmanite may be small, related elastic anomalies may impact the interpretation of radial and lateral velocity structures of the Earth's lower mantle.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the rapid}} {{development}} in design of multistory buildings and, because {{of the variation in}} stories height with the fixed length of the steel reinforcing bars, steel is usually wasted particularly in columns. Hence, compression lap splice may be used within the column height in order to avoid such waste in steel reinforcement which necessitates the optimization of this splice length. In the ACI 318 - 11 Provisions, the <b>calculated</b> <b>compression</b> lap splice in members with high strength concrete can be longer than tension splice. Hence, an optimization of compression lap splice would contribute to significant saving particularly in columns. This paper presents an experimental study to investigate the behavior of compression lap splice in circular reinforced concrete columns. The objective of the present investigation is to study the influence of splice length, volume of transverse reinforcement and end bearing condition on the behavior of compression lap splice. The conducted investigation included experimental tests of nine circular columns under uniaxial compression loads.

Based on the experimental investigation and test results, concluding remarks have been drawn, based on which a design simplified equation for splice length in compression has been developed.
