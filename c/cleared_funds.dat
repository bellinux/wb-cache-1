5000|$|The use {{of checks}} in a scam {{hinges on the}} {{practice}} or law in many countries concerning checks: when an account holder presents a check for deposit, the bank will usually make the funds available to the account holder within 1-5 business days, although checks, particularly if international, may take longer than that to clear. The clearing process may take 7-10 days, and {{can take up to}} a month when dealing with foreign banks.

5000|$|In {{government}} finance, {{a warrant}} is a written {{order to pay}} that instructs a federal, state, or county government treasurer to pay the warrant holder on demand or after a maturity date.

If the warrant is conditional on funds being available, the warrant is not a negotiable debt instrument. In the U.S., warrants are issued by government entities such as the military and state and county governments. Warrants are issued for payroll to individual employees, accounts payable to vendors, to local governments, to taxpayers receiving tax refunds, to recipients of unemployment benefits, and to owners of unclaimed money.

In response to criticism, Lloyds TSB changed its fee structure; rather than a single monthly fee for an unauthorized overdraft, they now charge per day. They also allow a 'grace period' where you can pay money in before 3:30pm (Mon - Fri) before any items are returned or any bank charges incurred (with exception from standing orders which debit at beginning of working day). Lloyds TSB allows their customers, if they have gone into an unplanned overdraft on a Friday for example, to pay money in before 10am on Monday morning and the daily fees for the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) to be waived.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{progress}} towards achieving the National Electronic Conveyancing system (NECS) and analyse its {{significance in the}} general context of e-Government. The NECS {{is one of the}} most significant e-government projects ever undertaken. NECS was created by Australian State and Territory Governments in 2005 and significant progress has been made over the past five years [...] This is a significant development because property transactions are one of the most significant and pervasive commercial activities engaged in by almost all Australians at some time in their lives. Conveyancers, legal practitioners, financial institutions, mortgage processors and other players involved in conveyancing will be able to access the NECS online with an electronic workspace provided for each property transaction. The system will allow users to provide, secure, certify and sign documentation that will be used to update the Torrens Title Registers in each State and Territory. This will involve the issuance of Digital Signature Certificates issued under the Australian Governments Gatekeeper Framework which will ensure authentication and prevent repudiation and various risk mitigation and fraud prevention measures will be taken. Financial settlement will occur through the Reserve Bank's Information and Transfer System (RITS) with disbursements received promptly and cleared for reuse. The State and Territory Revenue Offices will receive duty and tax payments electronically as <b>cleared</b> <b>funds</b> from the settlements through the NECS. Consumers will authorise their practitioners to use NECS on their behalf and be able to track the progress of their transaction via limited Internet access to the NECS. Financial institutions will be able to integrate their services and mortgage documentation systems with the NEC system. Collectively, the NECS is an excellent example of what is required if the promises of e-government are to be realised.

40|$|The Working for Water (WfW) Programme is {{a public}} works {{programme}} designed to clear South Africa of invasive alien vegetation and to restore lowwater consuming indigenous vegetation in the areas that have been <b>cleared.</b> <b>Funds</b> to clear alien invasives were initially secured {{on the basis that}} such a programme would increase water runoff, facilitate biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and provide social benefits through job creation. The economic merits of the Programme, in terms of increased water yields, has been established in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, but questioned in the Eastern and Southern Cape. However, there are economic aspects of the studies carried out in the Eastern and Southern Cape that merit more attention than was given them; one of these being the issue of non-water benefits. Preliminary figures emanating from contingent valuation pilot studies conducted at six WfW projects sites indicated that one of these non-water benefits, namely the biodiversity and ecosystem resilience benefit, could be substantial. As such, the primary objective {{of the present study was}} to apply the contingent valuation method (CVM) to value people’s preference for indigenous vegetation. This value was intended to serve as a proxy for increased biodiversity and ecosystem resilience at three WfW sites. Despite the controversy surrounding the CVM, it has been found that it is a credible valuation tool. The CVM’s merits lie in its versatility and in the fact that it is the only method available which is capable of obtaining estimates of both nonuse and use values, thus making it applicable for valuing biodiversity. The primary aim of a CVM study is to determine an estimate of the total willingness-to-pay (WTP). In this study, the total WTP figure was calculated by multiplying the median WTP for the local WfW Programme by the total number of user households. The respective total WTP amounts are shown in Table 1. It was anticipated that respondents would be willing to pay more for the national WfW Programme, than for the less inclusive good (i. e. the local WfW Programme). The results correspond with this expectation at the Port Elizabeth and Underberg sites. However, due to strategic factors Worcester respondents were willing to pay more for the local WfW Programme than for the national Programm...|$|E

On the whole, however, a single CCP solution appears less resilient than a two-CCP arrangement when the magnitude of the crisis is large and only more resilient when the magnitude of the crisis is small in relation to the <b>clearing</b> <b>fund</b> of the CCP(s).

This research aims to get a clear description on the system and procedure occurring during the direct <b>fund</b> <b>clearing</b> and to find out the effectiveness of such system and procedure. The data of research was obtained by conducting interview with and the observation on the parties related to the research, documentation of research object, and literary study. In this research, there is a description about the related elements in the system and procedure of direct <b>fund</b> <b>clearing.</b> The result of research shows some strengths and weaknesses. The strengths include: each transaction occurring gets authorization from the competent official, there is position rotation from one division to another; the incoming SPM list can be monitored from DPP (the Accomplishment Supervision List), SP 2 D document left in KPPN or archived is only 1 sheet and it is archived in the verification and accounting section, and the erroneous agenda because of the counter officers’ lack of precision in recording the incoming SPM. Considering such weaknesses, the writer gives the following recommendations to the company: SP 2 D document that is archived in KPPN should consists of 2 sheets, one for the treasury and one for the verification sections; the improvement of human resource’s quality of KPPN Surakarta by following a variety of education through the technical education and training organization related directly to the work, and general education to increase their knowledge. Thus, with the improvement of education and knowledge, the officers can improve the quality of KPPN Surakarta’s service. The better improvement of service quality should be followed with the improved function of direct superior supervision to its subordinate. Thus, the good result will be improved consistently.
