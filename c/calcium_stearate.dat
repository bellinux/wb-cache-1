The influence of the water repellent admixtures on the chemical and physical properties was evaluated by FT-IR analyses, by testing the mechanical properties and the behaviour in presence of water. The durability of the water-repellent mortars was evaluated after the exposure to artificial weathering (UV-light and water) and to immersion/drying cycles in saturated sodium sulphate solution.

In order to select the most suitable water-repellent mixtures {{in the presence of}} salt solutions, investigations were carried out upon mono-material mortar specimens and macro-samples (masonry–render systems). Alongside pore structure characterization, the behaviour in connection with water and mechanical properties were determined. In addition, a non-invasive diagnostic methodology is proposed for the study of masonry macrosamples, including thermal imaging, water absorption at low pressure, and sclerometric measurments. The results revealed the difference between the behaviour of the mortar specimens in comparison to the masonry/render systems.

40|$|Water {{represents}} {{without any}} doubt {{one of the}} most important degradation factors for a wide typology of materials like plasters, mortars, concretes, bricks and natural stones [1]. The degradation processes due to the water action towards architectural materials has been over time a problem with an increasing importance in the last years, as a consequence of the intensification of precipitations and world climate changes. The damages caused by water to buildings and architectures are often serious, with high costs for the reparation of materials and structures which are not well protected. Solutions able to prevent and limit this problem should be seen and studied as a sustainability tools for the protection of new and old buildings. This research deals with the study and development of in-mass-hydrophobized rendering mortars, which can be applied for the protection of building facades. Previous studies have focused on in mass water-repellent mortars, showing that hydrophobic compounds can be mixed to different binders and aggregates to obtain mortars whose water-repellent effectiveness depends most on the binder system chosen [2 - 5]. In this research lime cement mortars, which have not been deeply investigated yet, were taken in account. Integral water repellent lime cement mortars were prepared using different hydrophobic compounds. <b>Calcium</b> <b>stearates,</b> zinc stearates, powder silanes, liquid silanes were added to lime cement mortars. The influence of the additives on the setting and structure of mortars were investigated as well as the effectiveness of these agents in protecting the mortars against damages caused by the water action. Instrumental techniques such FT-IR and XRD were used in order to understand the chemical-physical interaction between agents and cement mortars. MIP analysis, ultrasonic measurements, water absorption tests and contact angle measurements were carried out to investigate the effectiveness of the water-repellent additives in hydrophobizing the final mortars. Workability variation of fresh mortars and a slight influence on the hydration times and products were observed.

40|$|The {{photodegradation}} (432 h under irradiation of Xe-Lamp-solar filter) of an ethylene {{vinyl acetate}} (EVA) copolymer with vinyl acetate content of 9 % was studied, {{and the effect of}} iron and <b>calcium</b> <b>stearates</b> was evaluated using different techniques such us attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and thermal analysis methods (DSC and TGA). A re-arrangement in crystallization and consequent decrease in thermal stability were found through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which were in agreement with the chain scission tendency. The presence of Ca and Fe pro-oxidants additives in EVA films increased the ketone carbonyl formation and decreased the ester absorption band of the acetate respect to the pure EVA, as it was evidenced by the significant changes in Carbonyl Indexes found by FTIR. The activity of stearates has been also evaluated by chemiluminescence, where the temperature-ramping tests under nitrogen showed the formation of a peroxide peak at lower temperature. The lower stability of the films containing pro-oxidants was evidenced by the values of oxidation induction time (OIT) determined by DSC. The results were supported by GC-MS, where the concentration of extracted products identified in the EVA containing pro-oxidants was significant and a much greater decrease in molecular weight was determined by GPC, which confirmed the development of degradation for EVA with Ca and Fe stearates in comparison to pure EVA. Biodegradation of photodegraded EVA films were studied at 45 °C during 90 days using a mixture of Bacillus (MIX) (B. cereus, B. megaterium, and B. subtilis) and, in parallel, by Brevibacillus borstelensis as reference strain. Biodegradation of EVA-films was studied by Chemiluminescence, ATR-FTIR and GC-product analysis and the data confirm more efficient biodegradation on the materials containing pro-oxidants. The chemiluminescence emissions due to decomposition of oxidation species was observed at lower temperatures on the biodegraded samples. Also, the drastic decrease of carbonyl index and the disappearance of photogenerated low molecular products with biodegradation were more efficient on the biodegraded films containing pro-oxidants. EVA mineralization was evaluated by carbon dioxide measurement using indirect impedance technique. Biodegradation by B. borstelensis and MIX at 45 °C was similar and exhibited a pronounced difference between the pure photodegraded EVA film (around 15 % of mineralization) and the corresponding photodegraded films containing Ca and Fe stearates where biodegradation extent reached values of 23 - 26 % of biodegradation after 90 days.

The tensile {{strength}} and {{elongation at break}} of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) was investigated by adding different concentration of <b>calcium</b> <b>stearate.</b> Two grades of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), namely, ENR 25 and ENR 40 were used as model materials. Semi-efficient vulcanization (semi-EV) was used throughout the study. The tensile property of unaged and aged ENR vulcanizates was determined by using U-CAN electron tensile testing machine. Results indicate that {{tensile strength}} and elongation at break of unaged ENR 25 and ENR 40 vulcanizates increase gradually with increasing concentration of <b>calcium</b> <b>stearate</b> up to about 1 phr of <b>calcium</b> <b>stearate</b> and after which, the tensile strength and elongation at break drop with a further increase in <b>calcium</b> <b>stearate</b> loading.
