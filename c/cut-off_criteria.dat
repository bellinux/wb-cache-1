In addition, variability in effect sizes across studies {{and its relation to}} the nonverbal cognitive test used, the <b>cut-off</b> <b>criterion</b> employed, participants’ age, and their linguistic skills were investigated. Method: We searched computerized databases and reference sections to find studies published between 2005 - 2011 of children with SLI who were age-matched (and not nonverbal cognitive matched) to TD peers, were given a norm-referenced nonverbal cognitive test, and reported sufficient data for an effect size analysis. Results: Across 80 studies, on average children with SLI relative to their TD peers exhibited lower nonverbal cognitive performance consistent with a medium effect size. Results of moderator analyses investigating the nonverbal cognitive test, the <b>cut-off</b> <b>criterion,</b> the children’s age and language skills will be discussed. Discussion: The findings of this investigation have theoretical implications regarding the characterization of SLI and have clinical implications for how nonverbal cognitive tests are used and interpreted for children with this disorder...|$|R

Evaluation of negative symptoms of schizophrenia validated the divergence of SAD and depression symptoms from negative symptoms. Implications of this study are discussed in terms of a potential heightened vulnerability to SAD among people with schizophrenia.

30|$|A further {{regulatory}} {{alternative is}} offered by the “cut-off criteria” of the EU Regulation on Plant Protection Products [10], which provide for a ban on active substances with particularly hazardous properties, the so-called PBT substances [persistent (P), bio-accumulative (B), and toxic (T)]. A further exclusion criterion is targeting endocrine disruptors. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>criteria</b> represent a very progressive instrument in several pieces of Europe’s chemicals legislation, which is oriented more towards the precautionary principle than other international regulations. These criteria have been introduced by policy-makers and require a paradigm shift in the decision-making process. The decision on an approval or ban should in future only {{be based on the}} undesirable substance properties and not, as previously, on a quantitative risk assessment (i.e., the comparison of the expected environmental exposure concentrations with (eco)toxicological threshold concentrations/doses for the harmful impacts on non-target organisms). Experts justify the hazard-based regulation by referring to the high level of uncertainty in the risk assessment for the targeted hazardous properties. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>criteria</b> provide an impulse to develop and use active substances and PPPs that have lower environmental impacts. However, a practical implementation is currently not possible, because the scientific and technical details of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>criteria</b> have not yet been developed and specified in subordinate regulations. The delays in implementation have been due not least to the massive interventions of the European PPP industry, which categorically rejects hazard-based regulation and demands a return to risk assessment, even for undesirable substance properties [50]. The UBA believes that the <b>cut-off</b> <b>criteria</b> are in principle well suited to improve the protection of the environment against particularly hazardous PPPs. Because of this conviction and in accordance with its responsibilities, UBA is also involved in the discussion about the specification and implementation of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>criteria</b> [51, 52]. One particular challenge {{is that it is not}} always clear from an environmental point of view whether an alternative active substance really is better than the banned active substance it is meant to replace. The same task of comparative assessment applies for PPP approval: The EU regulation provides that a PPP containing so-called substitution candidates (e.g., active substances with two out of three PBT properties) should be replaced by a PPP with a lower environmental impact. The methodology of comparative assessment of the environmental hazard or risks of PPPs is—both from a scientific and regulatory viewpoint—challenging and has not been sufficiently tested so far [53]. However, the general public and users rightly demand that in future the assessment authorities should make increased use of their expertise to provide information about the more environmentally favourable alternatives. It remains to be seen how effective the instrument of comparative assessment will prove in terms of making environmental impacts measurable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} carbohydrate absorption in well-nourished children with asymp-tomatic giardiasis. Two groups were selected based on results of stool examination of 211 children attending pre-school centers in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico: a control group of six non-infected children, and an infected group of seven children harboring Giardia intestinalis, without gastrointestinal symptoms of disease. Carbohydrate absorption was determined in the control group, before and after drug therapy in the infected group by the hydrogen breath test. Hydrogen production after lactose ingestion was higher in children with giardiasis compared with control group and after anti-parasite treatment; however, hydrogen production was not high enough to classify children as lactose malabsorbers by the <b>cut-off</b> <b>criteria.</b> Similar results were obtained for xylose absorption.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we apply {{the idea of}} a barcode from {{persistent}} homology to four hierarchical clustering methods: single, average, complete, and Ward 2 ̆ 7 s linkage. Desirable theoretical properties of dendrograms, the standard tool to visualize the output of hierarchical clustering methods, were described by Carlsson. We define analogous properties for hierarchical clustering quasi-barcodes and prove that average and complete quasi-barcodes possess a property that dendrograms do not. We discuss how to decide where to 2 ̆ 2 cut 2 ̆ 2 the output of hierarchical clustering quasi-barcodes based on the distance between the heights at which clusters merge. We find the best possible matching for calculating the Wasserstein distance between quasi-barcodes built from the same number of data points all born at time 0.

The aims of this study were to examine the construct validity of the Massachusetts Youth Screening Inventory-second version (MAYSI- 2), and its likelihood to identify youths who might have a psychiatric disorder. Data from up to 781 male adolescents (mean age = 16. 73 years) were gathered as part of the standardized mental health screening and assessment in two all-male Youth Detention Centers in the Netherlands. Categorical assessments were based on two structured diagnostic interviews. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the area under the curve were calculated to evaluate the likelihood of the MAYSI- 2 to identify youths with a psychiatric disorder. Youths with a disorder scored significantly higher on the corresponding MAYSI- 2 subscale than youths without a disorder. In the total sample, 70 % of the youths with a disorder met the Caution <b>cut-off</b> <b>criteria</b> on at least one MAYSI- 2 scale, while youths without a psychiatric disorder were very unlikely to meet <b>cut-off</b> <b>criteria</b> for multiple MAYSI- 2 scales.
