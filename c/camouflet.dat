500|$|The British {{had begun}} a mining {{offensive}} against the German-held [...] salient in 1916. Sub-surface conditions were especially complex and separate ground water tables made mining difficult.

50|$|In June 1916, {{during the}} height of the {{underground}} war on the Western Front, British tunnellers fired 101 mines or <b>camouflets,</b> while German tunnellers fired 126 mines or <b>camouflets.</b> This amounts to a total of 227 mine explosions in one month - one detonation every three hours. The last British deep mine of World War I was fired by 251st Tunnelling Company at Givenchy (10 August 1917).|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{presence}} of high levels of toxic fumes from the explosive, including carbon monoxide, and the weakness of the soft earth overlying the cavern, <b>camouflets</b> are extremely hazardous to bomb disposal personnel.|$|R
5000|$|Well known {{examples}} are the mines on the Italian Front laid by Austro-Hungarian and Italian miners, where the largest individual mine contained {{a charge of}} 50,000 kg of blasting gelatin, and {{the activities of the}} Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers on the Western Front.

5000|$|Mining saw a brief {{resurgence}} as {{a military}} tactic during the First World War, when army engineers attempted to break the stalemate of trench warfare by tunneling under no man's land and laying large quantities of explosives beneath the enemy's trenches. As in siege warfare, mining was possible due to the static nature of the fighting. During {{the height of the}} underground war on the Western Front in June 1916, British tunnellers fired 101 mines or <b>camouflets,</b> while German tunnellers fired 126 mines or <b>camouflets.</b> This amounts to a total of 227 mine explosions in one month - one detonation every three hours. [...] Large battles, like the Battle of the Somme in 1916 (see mines on the Somme) and the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917, were also supported by mine explosions.|$|R
50|$|In early {{military}} engineering, a saucisson (French for a large, dry-filled sausage) was {{a primitive}} type of fuse, {{consisting of a}} long tube or hose of cloth or leather, typically about an inch and half in diameter (37 mm), damp-proofed with pitch and filled with black powder. It was normally laid in a protective wooden trough, and ignited by use of a torch or slow match. Saucissons were used to fire fougasses, petards, mines and <b>camouflets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Counter-mining {{activity}} by the Tunnelling Companies RE began at St Eloi {{in the spring}} of 1915. Much of the mining in this sector was done by the 177th Tunnelling Company and the 172nd Tunnelling Company. The Ypres area has a shallow soil layer of loam or sand above waterlogged semi-liquid sand and patches of sand and clay called slurry. Beneath the second layer is a thick seam of blue clay. The early mining took place above the blue clay which put very heavy pressures of water and wet sand on the underground works. In August the digging of galleries had begun to be ready by the end of June 1916. Both sides spent 1915 mining and counter-mining, the British springing 13 mines and 29 <b>camouflets</b> against 20 German mines and 2 <b>camouflets.</b> In September, Brigadier-General George Fowke the Engineer in Chief, proposed a mining offensive in the blue clay 60 - 90 ft underground. Since the Germans were on the higher ground, galleries could be driven horizontally into the blue clay from shafts about 300 - 400 ft back from the front line. By January 1916, the 172nd Tunnelling Company had sunk shafts into the blue clay and began to dig galleries 80 - 120 ft under the German front position. After the Second Army offensive in the summer of 1916 was postponed the mining offensive was made even more ambitious, with a plan to mine Messines Ridge.|$|R
2500|$|January began frosty, which {{solidified}} {{the ground}} but wet weather followed and soon caused trenches {{and all other}} diggings to collapse, which made movement impossible after a few days, leading to tacit truces to allow supplies to be carried to the front line at night.

2500|$|When {{galleries}} came close, a <b>camouflet</b> (a small mine {{insufficient to}} disturb the surface) would be planted, to collapse the opponents' gallery and then the digging of the offensive gallery would resume. If the gallery reached the target, a chamber would be dug and then loaded with explosives, ready to fire. The nearing of a German gallery, listening for clues, breaking into a rival gallery {{and waiting for the}} mine to explode, caused great strain to the miners and was nerve-racking for troops in front line positions on the surface, who knew that a mine could be sprung under them at any moment. To reduce the danger to front-line troops, the area was held by posts rather than a continuous front line, with only the minimum number of troops. German mining had formed craters in no man's land, named craters [...] the British and which were held by each side, dug in on their respective near lips. In February 1916, mining was being conducted at the Quarries and near , where explosions were frequent and were followed by infantry attacks to occupy the near lip and by sapping forward.|$|E
50|$|Two shafts were sunk by 250th Tunnelling Company late in 1916 from Maedelstede Farm.

The Germans blew several heavy <b>camouflets</b> {{in the area and}} work was delayed as the miners had to be withdrawn from the tunnel regularly.

One of the busiest areas for the miners on both sides was Railway Wood, an area at Hooge where the old Ypres-Roeselare railway crossed the Ypres-Menen road. Aerial photographs clearly show the proliferation of mine warfare in the Railway Wood sector during the unit's presence there, with craters lying almost exclusively in no man's land between the British and German trenches.

5000|$|The {{earthquake}} bomb, or seismic bomb, was {{a concept}} that was invented by the British aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis early in World War II and subsequently developed and used during the war against strategic targets in Europe. [...] A seismic bomb differs somewhat in concept from traditional bombs, which usually explode {{at or near the}} surface, and destroy their target directly by explosive force. In contrast, a seismic bomb is dropped from high altitude to attain very high speed as it falls and upon impact, penetrates and explodes deep underground, causing massive caverns or craters known as <b>camouflets,</b> as well as intense shockwaves. In this way, the seismic bomb can affect targets that are too massive to be affected by a conventional bomb, as well as damage or destroy difficult targets such as bridges and viaducts.|$|R

50|$|A <b>camouflet,</b> in {{military}} science, is an artificial cavern created by an explosion. If the explosion reaches the surface {{then it is}} called a crater.|$|E
50|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} {{defined as a}} countermine dug by defenders to prevent the undermining of a fortress's walls during a siege.

On 29 July, Canadian troops raided the German lines at St Eloi and inflicted about [...] and repulsed a German raid at Hill 60 on 12 August. Mining and tunnel warfare continued at the Bluff, carried out by tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers. After a prisoner drew {{a map of the}} German mine workings, the British dug a deep system under the galleries beyond the German lines. On 11 December, several big <b>camouflets</b> were sprung and the German mine galleries were captured, making it impossible for German tunnellers to retaliate and the area was declared safe. On 7 June 1917, the Germans were driven from the area during the Battle of Messines Ridge. The Germans re-took the Bluff during the Spring Offensive of 1918 and it changed hands for the last time on 28 September 1918, after an attack by the 14th (Light) Division.|$|R
50|$|After {{release from}} the Avro Lancaster B.Mk 1 (Special) bomber, the Grand Slam would reach near-supersonic speed, {{approaching}} 1,049 ft/s (320 m/s), 715 mph (1150 km/h). When it hit, it would penetrate deep underground before detonating. The resulting explosion could cause {{the formation of a}} <b>camouflet</b> (cavern) and shift the ground to undermine a target's foundation.|$|E
5000|$|Wallis {{also argued}} that, if the bomb {{penetrated}} deep enough, the explosion would not breach {{the surface of}} the ground and would thus produce an underground cavern (a <b>camouflet)</b> which would remove the structure's underground support, thus causing it to collapse. The process was graphically described as a [...] "trapdoor effect" [...] or [...] "hangman's drop".|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{the term}} {{has been used}} to {{describe}} the effects of very large bombs like the Grand Slam bomb, which are designed to penetrate next to a large target structure and create a <b>camouflet</b> to undermine the foundations of the structure. It has been observed that it is more efficient to penetrate ground next to the target than to hit the target directly.|$|E
50|$|The tunnellers {{developed}} counter tactics, {{which both}} sides deployed. The {{first was the}} use of large mines placed in one's own tunnels - some actually dug towards enemy noise to create damage - which when exploded would create fissures and cracks in the ground, making the ground either unsuitable for tunnelling or destroying existing tunnels and works. A small device, called the <b>camouflet,</b> created a localised underground chamber designed not to break the surface and form craters, but to destroy a strictly limited area of underground territory - and its occupants. The second tactic, deployed when the enemy tunnel was too close to your existing works or trenches, was the deployment of rod-fed torpedo shaped <b>camouflet</b> charges. Effectively land mines on the end of long iron sticks, the technique was a defensive tactic against an immediate threat. Towards {{the end of the tunnel}} war, forces also deployed mines at greater depths, which, coupled with the use of listening devices, could be exploded away from friendly trenches as a defensive measure.|$|E
50|$|The {{bomb was}} aimed at the target during an {{operation}} and proved capable of penetrating deep into hardened reinforced concrete when it hit. This, however, was not the primary intention of Barnes Wallis's design. The bomb was designed to make impact close to the target, penetrate the soil or rock beneath or around the target, and then detonate, transferring all of its energy into the structure, or creating a <b>camouflet</b> (cavern or crater) into which the target would fall.|$|E

Finally if the walls were breached, they could either place obstacles in the breach, for example a cheval de frise to hinder a forlorn hope, or construct a coupure. The great concentric ringed fortresses, like Beaumaris Castle on Anglesey, were designed so that the inner walls were ready-built coupures: if an attacker succeeded in breaching the outer walls, he would enter a killing field between the lower outer walls and the higher inner walls.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of so much mining {{activity}} by both sides, detection and breakthrough into each other's tunnelling systems occurred frequently. The result was often the deployment of the emergency <b>camouflet,</b> a pre-prepared charge which was always ready in the British and Allied forces sectors when tunnelling was taking place. Vicious hand-to-hand fighting in the dark with picks, shovels and wood used as weapons might also take place. Although all miners were trained to use rifles, the restrictions of tunnel construction and {{the conditions of the}} tunnels where the miners had to operate often meant they could not be used.

5000|$|A <b>camouflet</b> set {{is used to}} {{describe}} a system used in the British Army for cratering tracks and other routes. A tube is driven into the ground using a manual post driver. The end of the tube is a disposable steel point. A small charge connected to a detonator is lowered down the tube. The tube is then removed, and the hole tamped. The charge is then blown, leaving a void and a hole to the surface.

The mining skills could also be used to move troops unseen. On one occasion a whole British division was moved through interconnected workings and sewers without German observation. The British detonated 19 mines of varying sizes on July 1, 1916, {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Somme. The largest mines—the Y Sap Mine and the Lochnagar Mine—each containing 24 tons of explosives, were blown near La Boiselle, throwing earth 4,000 feet into the air.|$|E
