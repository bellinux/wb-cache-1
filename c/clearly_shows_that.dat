5|$|Up to the pontificate of Pope Alexander III (1159–1181), all the {{cardinals}} who were {{appointed to the}} external episcopal sees, resigned their membership in the College of Cardinals after receiving episcopal consecration, which <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the episcopate was considered a higher dignity than that of cardinal-priest or deacon. On the other hand, the bishops were never appointed cardinals. Certainly, the episcopate and cardinalate were considered incompatible dignities. However, during Alexander’s pontificate a change is apparent; although there were still the cases of {{the cardinals}} leaving the College of Cardinals after assuming episcopal office (Lombardo of Benevento, Rainaldo of Gaeta), there also appeared members of the College who were simultaneously cardinals and bishops. Perhaps Alexander III followed here an example of his rival, Antipope Victor IV, who in 1162 appointed Aicardo Cornazzano bishop of Parma and cardinal-priest. The first such instance in the legitimate obedience was Conrad of Wittelsbach, who was appointed cardinal-priest of S. Marcello in December 1165 and subsequently promoted to the suburbicarian see of Sabina, but continued to act also as archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop of Reims Guillaume aux Blanches Mains was named cardinal priest of S. Sabina in 1179, but retained archdiocese of Reims; similarly bishops Giovanni of Toscanella, Ruffino of Rimini and Gerardo of Novara, elevated to the cardinalate in 1189, 1190 and 1211 respectively. On the other hand, when cardinal-priest Uberto Crivelli was elected and consecrated archbishop of Milan in 1185, he retained his cardinalate and his Roman titulus (S. Lorenzo in Damaso). The posts of cardinal and bishop were no longer considered incompatible with each other. Moreover, the rank of cardinal-priest or cardinal-deacon became {{equal to that of}} bishop. However, it seems that the elected, but not yet consecrated, bishops who were appointed cardinals were generally obliged to resign their sees.|$|E

It looks {{as though they are}} using their hands for the game; however, kicking {{certainly}} cannot be excluded. It is notable for the fact that most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> small balls were also used.|$|E
25|$|The Church of Scientology {{claims that}} their belief system is {{different}} from Christianity because it is based “solely on reason” and that its members “possess a practical system of ethics and justice.” The church likewise claims that “anything religious teachers said or Buddha promised, even the visions of Christianity, are attained in Scientology as a result.” Muck, Netland and McDermott emphasize that this <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> Scientology is incompatible with Christianity.|$|E
25|$|A {{compromise}} {{theory that}} the church was begun in the 1630s and then completed or modified fifty years later, resulting in the present edifice is also posited. According to this assertion, the church walls were laid in 1632 while the interior, and possibly the roof, were not completed until the 1680s. Evidence for this {{can be found in}} the bell tower that <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the lower two stories were built earlier than the upper story.|$|E

25|$|In early Christian times, 'Nazranis' {{were not}} a {{separate}} religion, but a sect in the Jewish community. The term was used to denote followers of Jesus of Nazareth. (Acts. 24:5; 28:22). 'Khristianos' (or Christians) was initially used largely to refer non-Jewish people who followed Christ (Acts 11:26). In Kerala, the sect was known as 'Nazraani Margam'. Margam in Malayalam means, 'The Way'. (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22). Thus, the word Nazraani <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> many who joined them were Jews. But in Kerala this name {{was replaced by the}} word 'Christians' in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{figure on}} the right (figure 3), shows the {{consumption}} patterns of the consumer of two goods X1 and X2, the prices of which are p1 and p2 respectively, where B1 and B2 are the budget lines and I1 and I2 are the indifference curves. Figure 3 <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that,</b> with {{a rise in the}} income of the consumer, the initial budget line B1 moves outward parallel to itself to B2 and the consumer now chooses X' bundle to the initial bundle X*. The figure shows that, the demand for X2 has risen from X21 to X22 with an outward shift of the budget line from B1 to B2 (caused due to rise in the income of the consumer). This essentially means that, good X2 is a normal good as the demand for X2 rose with an increase in the income of the consumer.|$|E
25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer {{to know something about}} the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access to}} the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know something about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E

In 1876, when registering her business in Aalborg, she {{became one of the first}} officially recognized female photographers in Denmark when she gave her profession as [...] "Photographin", a German word which <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> she was a woman. Specializing in portraits, she also became one of the earliest female members of the Dansk Fotografisk Forening in 1883.

The narration states, [...] "What the TV stations didn't broadcast was , which <b>clearly</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the streets below were empty. The opposition march had never taken that route." [...] Later, the state television signal is cut; rumors circulate that the opposition has taken over the studio. At the palace, members of the military high command demand Chávez's resignation, threatening to bomb the building. The president refuses to resign, but submits to their custody. He is led away, and Carmona announces on television that a transitional government will be established.|$|E
