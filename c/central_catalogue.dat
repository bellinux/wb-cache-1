The project collected data related to Augusta County in Virginia and Franklin County in Pennsylvania during the American Civil War. In 1996, William G. Thomas III joined Ayers on the Valley Project. Together, they produced an online article entitled [...] "The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities," [...] which also appeared in the American Historical Review in 2003 http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/AHR/.

Smith, {{as well as}} by Dr. Sulmasy and Dr. Siegler, exists as a non-lending resource for faculty, fellows, and students working in the field of clinical medical ethics. The library currently houses an interdisciplinary collection of over five-thousand books and visual media. The library subscribes to twenty-five journals related to medicine and ethics, and presently maintains complete collections from Volume 1 of many of the core journals in medical ethics including the “Hastings Center Report”, Journal of Clinical Ethics, “Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics”, “Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal”, “Journal of Medicine and Philosophy”, “"National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly"”, and “Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics”. The library recently received an additional donation of over 1,300 books from the personal libraries of Drs. Edmund Pellegrino and Professor Alan J. Wiesbard. The library is currently working to digitize and catalog its collection of over 400 videos related to medical ethics that date back to the 1980.

40|$|Many researchers, {{from the}} {{humanities}} and other domains, have a strong need to study resources in close detail. Nowadays {{more and more of}} these resources are available online. To make these resources discoverable, they are described with metadata. These metadata records are collected and made available via <b>central</b> <b>catalogues.</b> Often, resource providers want to include specific properties of the resource in the metadata. The purpose of catalogues will be more generic and addresses a broader target audience. It is hard to strike the balance between these two ends of the spectrum with one metadata schema, and mismatches can negatively impact the quality of metadata provided. The European CLARIN infrastructure (CLARIN ERIC, 2016 b) was confronted with this specific problem, and designed a solution based on a flexible mechanism to build resource specific metadata schemas, potentially using domain, community or project specific terminology, out of shared components and semantics. This paper introduces this approach and the infrastructure built for it, which is applicable to any domain with the same needs...|$|R

40|$|The Municipal/Public Libraries are {{approached}} as {{a separate}} category of libraries, which could become an active component within the Hellenic National System of Libraries. Aiming in demonstrating the common perspectives of the category the following issues are traced: - the common features (mission, local vs. subject character, user groups information needs, users-citizens, similarities in their book and material collections, relations with the elected Authorities and the corresponding Ministries), - the common problems (neglect, chance, necessity and priority, lack of vision, institutional frame, infrastructure, equipment, internet presence), - common weaknesses (occasional communication among homologous entities and people, absence of a forum for expressing views and a mechanism for promoting solutions, lack of coordination of common actions, guidance and central support, conscience of community) - emphasis on common perspectives (Union Catalogue and contribution to the <b>central</b> <b>cataloguing</b> service, complementarity on digitization actions, provision of information literacy and preparation of the digital citizen, integration in the local information society, accessibility at a national range) The examination leads {{to the conclusion that}} the nature of the common problems of the Public/Municipal Libraries precludes a solution at the level of the individual library. In the majority of the cases solutions are not feasible even at the category level, but probably only at the cooperation and the coordination of different categories and even higher levels of systemic hierarchy.
