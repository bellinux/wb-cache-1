40|$|A {{distributed}} amplifier with a stable gain of 10, risetime of 2. 5 nanoseconds for 125 ohm load impedance is described. The maximum output voltage is 3. 2 volts with negative polarity. The amplifier consists of 2 stages of 6 Philco 2 N 1742 transistors each and an <b>emitter</b> <b>follower</b> using a 2 N 1500. Design formulae are derived and detailed {{performance of a}} specific amplifier is given...|$|R
5000|$|An {{amplifier}} {{may have}} an asymmetrical output swing, perhaps because a transistor is biased so its collector voltage is not half the supply voltage (or the [...] "balanced" [...] power supply rails aren't perfectly balanced); clipping may begin earlier on {{one half of the}} output waveform. Bootstrapping or a redesign of the circuit may alleviate this when it is caused by difficulties in driving <b>emitter</b> <b>follower</b> output stages.|$|R
50|$|ECL {{is based}} on an emitter-coupled (long-tailed) pair, shaded red in the figure on the right. The left half of the pair (shaded yellow) {{consists}} of two parallel-connected input transistors T1 and T2 (an exemplary two-input gate is considered) implementing NOR logic. The base voltage of the right transistor T3 is held fixed by a reference voltage source, shaded light green: the voltage divider with a diode thermal compensation (R1, R2, D1 and D2) and sometimes a buffering <b>emitter</b> <b>follower</b> (not shown on the picture); thus the emitter voltages are kept relatively steady. As a result, the common emitter resistor RE acts nearly as a current source. The output voltages at the collector load resistors RC1 and RC3 are shifted and buffered to the inverting and non-inverting outputs by the <b>emitter</b> <b>followers</b> T4 and T5 (shaded blue). The output emitter resistors RE4 and RE5 do not exist in all versions of ECL. In some cases 50 Ω line termination resistors connected between the bases of the input transistors and −2 V act as emitter resistors.|$|R

The output impedance was matched by appropriate matching circuitry to 50 in the frequency band of operation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a graphical method of nonlinear circuit analysis. The method combines circuit analysis using driving-point impedances and signal flow graphs with distortion analysis using the Volterra series. The {{result is a}} method of distortion analysis which is more intuitive and flexible than traditional methods. The method is demonstrated {{in the analysis of}} a common-emitter amplifier in which the second- and third-order harmonic distortion ratios are determined. The method is also applied to comparing the distortion of different voltage buffer circuits based on an <b>emitter</b> <b>follower</b> and on a differential pair with unity gain feedback. circuits realizations that are based on an <b>emitter</b> <b>follower</b> and a differential pair. THE VOLTERRA SERIES Many practical circuits can be assumed to behave in a weakly nonlinear way, and under this condition, closed form expressions for the nonlinearity can be obtained using the Volterra series. The Volterra series for a circuit is generally represented as a summation of n th order operators as shown in Figure 1, where H n [x (t) ] = … hn (τ 1, …, τn) x 1 (t – τ 1) …x n (t – τn) dτ 1 …dτn –...|$|R
5000|$|Normal. At {{differential}} mode (the two input voltages change in opposite directions), the two voltage (<b>emitter)</b> <b>followers</b> oppose each other - {{while one of}} them tries to increase the voltage of the common emitter point, the other tries to decrease it (figuratively speaking, one of them [...] "pulls up" [...] the common point while the other [...] "pulls down" [...] {{it so that it}} stays immovable) and v.v. So, the common point does not change its voltage; it behaves like a virtual ground with a magnitude determined by the common-mode input voltages. The high-resistive emitter element does not play any role it is shunted by the other low-resistive <b>emitter</b> <b>follower.</b> There is no negative feedback since the emitter voltage does not change at all when the input base voltages change. The common quiescent current vigorously steers between the two transistors and the output collector voltages vigorously change. The two transistors mutually ground their emitters; so, although they are common-collector stages, they actually act as common-emitter stages with maximum gain. Bias stability and independence from variations in device parameters can be improved by negative feedback introduced via cathode/emitter resistors with relatively small resistances.|$|R

50|$|Low-dropout (LDO) {{regulators}} work in {{the same}} way as all linear voltage regulators. The main difference between LDO and non-LDO regulators is their schematic topology. Instead of an <b>emitter</b> <b>follower</b> topology, low-dropout regulators use open collector or open drain topology. In this topology, the transistor may be easily driven into saturation with the voltages available to the regulator. This allows the voltage drop from the unregulated voltage to the regulated voltage to be as low as the saturation voltage across the transistor.|$|R
