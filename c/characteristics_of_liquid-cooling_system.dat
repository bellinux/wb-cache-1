50|$|If {{the design}} <b>of</b> the <b>liquid-cooling</b> <b>system</b> allows for high coolant temperatures, energy {{can be saved}} or even reused, {{depending}} on the climate conditions and on the local infrastructure. For example, free cooling is possible if the coolant temperature {{is higher than the}} ambient temperature. In that case the energy for chillers can be saved. If the coolant temperature is even higher, the waste heat from the compute equipment could be used for heating purposes or to drive an adsorption chiller to generate chilled water. The former option is implemented, e.g., by theLeibniz-Rechenzentrum in Germany, where SuperMUC drives the heating of the data center during winter with roughly 1 MW recovered from the compute equipment. The latter option, which is the design target of iDataCool, requires a high quality of the heat, which can only be achieved by direct hot-water cooling. One example for direct hot-water cooling is the Aquasar project at ETH Zürich, which is operated at coolant temperatures around 60°C.The aim of iDataCool was to achieve coolant temperatures of more than 65°C, at which commercially available adsorption chillers tend to become efficient, and to demonstrate the long-term stability of a large production machine under these conditions.|$|R

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the {{operating}} cooling fluid, internal combustion engine cooling systems can be classified in two macro areas: air-cooling <b>system</b> and <b>liquid-cooling</b> <b>system.</b> In four-stroke engines, <b>liquid-cooling</b> <b>system</b> is generally preferred to the air-cooling system because of its efficiency in the engine heat dissipation. However, thanks to its simplicity, today the engine air-cooling system is still widely used in the engine market, especially on two-stroke engine applications like small motorbike, light aircraft, and handheld products. To assure the necessary heat waste in air-cooled engines, the key point is the optimization of the air flow over the cylinder external surface. Air flow separation from cylinder external surface can result in high temperature gradients inside the cylinder volume causing destructive heat problem for the engine. It can be avoided only by a fine optimization of the cylinder fin design placed externally to the cylinder surface. To fulfil this need, the definition of specific methodology to evaluate the air-cooling effect on the engine is mandatory. In the present paper, the authors present a 3 D-CFD simulation methodology designed to perform a detailed evaluation of two-stroke air-cooled engines. The methodology was applied on two different engines equipping handheld brush-cutter machines. The optimization of the air-cooling system of such a machine is a very challenging task because the machine design must be very compact forcing all the engine parts to remain quite close each other. The simulation results are compared to experimental evidences in order to verify the validity of the proposed approach...|$|R

For a constant heating power of 90 W from an LED lighting module, an optimal thermal resistance of 0. 563 K/W is obtained that shows a significant improved result then the conventional LED module’s.

The engine is air cooled, simplifying engine modification, and the absence of a radiator and <b>liquid-cooling</b> <b>system</b> eliminates multiple sources of failure. The low price, robustness of the front suspension, and the sizable quantity of spare parts from other VW Beetles and Type 2 (Microbus) are a further advantage.

Appropriate modeling for predicting thermal behavior of battery systems in vehicles helps to make decisions for improved design and shortens the development process. For this paper, {{we looked at the}} impact of cooling strategies with air and direct/indirect liquid cooling. The simplicity of an air-cooling system is an advantage over a <b>liquid-cooling</b> <b>system.</b> In addition to its intrinsically lower heat transfer coefficient, another disadvantage of air cooling is that the small heat capacity of air makes it difficult to accomplish temperature uniformity inside a cell or between cells in a module. Liquid-cooling is more effective in heat transfer and takes up less volume, but the added complexity and cost may outweigh the merits. The surface heat transfer coefficient, h, and the blower power for air cooling are sensitive to the hydraulic diameter of the cooling channel (Dh). However, because of the added thermal resistances, h evaluated at cell surface is not as sensitive to the variation of Dh in an indirect (water/glycol jacket) cooling system. Due to the high heat transfer coefficient at small Dh, direct liquid cooling using dielectric mineral oils may be preferred in spite of high pressure loss in certain circumstances such as in highly transient large heat generating battery systems. In general, air-cooling should be considered first, as the power demand increases with heavier vehicles and more aggressive driving, water/glycol jacket cooling should be considered next.

Experiments were made in 2 - and 4 -inch-diameter straight metal tubes with air flows at temperatures from 600 degrees to 2000 degrees F. and diameter Reynolds numbers from 2. 2 to 14 x 10 (5). The film coolant, water, was injected around the circumference at a single axial position on the tubes at flow rates from 0. 02 to. 24 pound per second per foot of tube circumference (0. 8 to 12 percent of the air flow). Liquid-coolant films were established and maintained around and along the tube wall in concurrent flow with the hot air. The results indicated that, in order to film cool a given surface area with as little coolant flow as possible, {{it may be necessary to}} limit the flow of coolant introduced at a single axial position and to introduce it at several axial positions.
