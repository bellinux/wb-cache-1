5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi {{wanted to see if}} he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus.</b> This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus</b> by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E
25|$|Electronegativity, symbol χ, is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself.

25|$|At {{the time}} of the experiment, the most {{prevalent}} model for describing the atom was the Bohr model, which described electrons as going around the positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus</b> only in certain discrete atomic orbitals or energy levels. Since the electron was quantized to be only in certain positions in space, the separation into distinct orbits was referred to as space quantization. The Stern–Gerlach experiment was meant to test the Bohr–Sommerfeld hypothesis that the direction of the angular momentum of a silver atom is quantized.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{experiments}} by Ernest Rutherford established that atoms {{consisted of a}} diffuse cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounding a small, dense, positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Given this experimental data, Rutherford naturally considered a planetary-model atom, the Rutherford model of 1911 – electrons orbiting a solar nucleus – however, said planetary-model atom has a technical difficulty. The laws of classical mechanics (i.e. the Larmor formula), predict that the electron will release electromagnetic radiation while orbiting a nucleus. Because the electron would lose energy, it would rapidly spiral inwards, collapsing into the nucleus on a timescale of around 16 picoseconds. This atom model is disastrous, because it predicts that all atoms are unstable.|$|E
25|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{consists}} of neutrons and protons, {{which in turn}} are the manifestation of more elementary particles, called quarks, that are held in association by the nuclear strong force in certain stable combinations of hadrons, called baryons. The nuclear strong force extends far enough from each baryon so as to bind the neutrons and protons together against the repulsive electrical force between the positively charged protons. The nuclear strong force has a very short range, and essentially drops to zero just beyond {{the edge of the}} nucleus. The collective action of the positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus</b> is to hold the electrically negative charged electrons in their orbits about the nucleus. The collection of negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus display an affinity for certain configurations and numbers of electrons that make their orbits stable. Which chemical element an atom represents is determined by the number of protons in the nucleus; the neutral atom will have an equal number of electrons orbiting that nucleus. Individual chemical elements can create more stable electron configurations by combining to share their electrons. It is that sharing of electrons to create stable electronic orbits about the nucleus that appears to us as the chemistry of our macro world.|$|E

2500|$|In atomic physics, the Rutherford–Bohr {{model or}} Bohr model or Bohr diagram, {{introduced}} by Niels Bohr and Ernest Rutherford in 1913, depicts the atom as a small, positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus</b> surrounded by electrons that travel in circular orbits around the nucleus—similar to {{structure of the}} Solar System, but with attraction provided by electrostatic forces rather than gravity. After the cubic model (1902), the plum-pudding model (1904), the Saturnian model (1904), and the Rutherford model (1911) came the Rutherford–Bohr model or just Bohr model for short (1913). The improvement to the Rutherford model is mostly a quantum physical interpretation of it.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the dawn}} of the 20th century, {{evidence}} required a model of the atom with a diffuse cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounding a small, dense, positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus.</b> These properties suggested a model in which the electrons circle around the nucleus like planets orbiting a sun. [...] However, it was also known that the atom in this model would be unstable: according to classical theory, orbiting electrons are undergoing centripetal acceleration, and should therefore give off electromagnetic radiation, the loss of energy also causing them to spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in a fraction of a second.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the most}} basic level, {{electronegativity}} is determined by factors like the nuclear charge (the more protons an atom has, the more [...] "pull" [...] it will have on electrons) and the number/location of other electrons present in the atomic shells (the more electrons an atom has, the farther from the nucleus the valence electrons will be, {{and as a result}} the less positive charge they will experience—both because of their increased distance from the nucleus, and because the other electrons in the lower energy core orbitals will act to shield the valence electrons from the positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus).</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission occurred in 1938 in the buildings of Kaiser Wilhelm Society for Chemistry, today {{part of the}} Free University of Berlin, following nearly five decades of work on the science of radioactivity and the elaboration of new nuclear physics that described the components of atoms. In 1911, Ernest Rutherford proposed {{a model of the}} atom in which a very small, dense and positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus</b> of protons (the neutron had not yet been discovered) was surrounded by orbiting, negatively charged electrons (the Rutherford model). Niels Bohr improved upon this in 1913 by reconciling the quantum behavior of electrons (the Bohr model). Work by Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie, Pierre Curie, and Rutherford further elaborated that the nucleus, though tightly bound, could undergo different forms of radioactive decay, and thereby transmute into other elements. (For example, by alpha decay: the emission of an alpha particle—two protons and two neutrons bound together into a particle identical to a helium nucleus.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 19th century, experimenters {{began to}} detect {{unexpected}} forms of radiation: Wilhelm Röntgen caused a sensation with his discovery of X-rays in 1895; in 1896 Henri Becquerel discovered that {{certain kinds of}} matter emit radiation on their own accord. In 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered the electron, and new radioactive elements found by Marie and Pierre Curie {{raised questions about the}} supposedly indestructible atom and the nature of matter. Marie and Pierre coined the term [...] "radioactivity" [...] to describe this property of matter, and isolated the radioactive elements radium and polonium. Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy identified two of Becquerel's forms of radiation with electrons and the element helium. Rutherford identified and named two types of radioactivity and in 1911 interpreted experimental evidence as showing that the atom consists of a dense, positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus</b> surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Classical theory, however, predicted that this structure should be unstable. Classical theory had also failed to explain successfully two other experimental results that appeared in the late 19th century. One of these was the demonstration by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley—known as the Michelson–Morley experiment—which showed there {{did not seem to be}} a preferred frame of reference, at rest with respect to the hypothetical luminiferous ether, for describing electromagnetic phenomena. Studies of radiation and radioactive decay continued to be a preeminent focus for physical and chemical research through the 1930s, when the discovery of nuclear fission opened the way to the practical exploitation of what came to be called [...] "atomic" [...] energy.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} quantum mechanics to atomic structure by proposing what {{is now known as}} the Bohr model of the atom, where electrons exist only in strictly defined circular orbits around the nucleus similar to rungs on a ladder. The Bohr Model is a planetary model in which the negatively charged electrons orbit a small, positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus</b> similar to the planets orbiting the Sun (except that the orbits are not planar) - the gravitational force of the solar system is mathematically akin to the attractive Coulomb (electrical) force between the positively <b>charged</b> <b>nucleus</b> and the negatively charged electrons.|$|E
