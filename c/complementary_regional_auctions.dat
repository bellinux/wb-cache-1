5000|$|The exact auction {{procedures}} varies somewhat {{between the}} different <b>regional</b> <b>auctions,</b> but have several things in common. The wines put up for auction {{must be approved by}} a tasting panel of the auctioning society before being admitted to the auction. After that, a calling price is decided upon after a tasting by commissioners (explained below). The seller is in principle free to decide how many bottles he wishes to sell, but there is a minimum quantity depending on the wine's classification, and the seller must also provide sufficient bottles for the auction tasting. Typically, a pre-auction tasting is held in the morning of the auction day, where the participants may taste the wines in any order. A small tasting portion of each wine is served to all participants during the auction itself, just before the wine is auctioned. This procedure is sometimes called a [...] "wet wine auction" [...] to differentiate it from a [...] "dry wine auction" [...] where no wines are served. For wines made in very small lots, this means that {{a significant portion of the}} quantity produced must be served up for free.

40|$|Long-period orbital forcing is {{a crucial}} {{component}} of the major global climate shifts during the Cenozoic as revealed in marine pelagic records. A <b>complementary</b> <b>regional</b> perspective of climate change can be assessed from internally drained lake basins, which are directly affected by insolation and precipitation balance. The Ebro Basin in northeastern Iberia embraces a 20 Myr long continuous sedimentary record where recurrent expansions and retractions of the central lacustrine system suggest periodic shifts of water balance due to orbital oscillations. In order to test climatic (orbital) forcing a key-piece of the basin, the Los Monegros lacustrine system, has been analyzed in detail. The cyclostratigraphic analysis points to orbital eccentricity as pacemaker of short to long-term lacustrine sequences, and reveals a correlation of maxima of the 100 -kyr, 400 -kyr and 2. 4 -Myr eccentricity cycles with periods of lake expansion. A magnetostratigraphy-based chronostratigraphy of the complete continental record allows further assessing long-period orbital forcing at basin scale, a view that challenges alternate scenarios where the stratigraphic architecture in foreland systems is preferably associated to tectonic processes. We conclude that while the location of lacustrine depocenters reacted to the long-term tectonic-driven accommodation changes, shorter wavelenght oscillations of lake environments, still million-year scale, claims for a dominance of orbital forcing. We suggest a decoupling between (tectonic) supply-driven clastic sequences fed from basin margins and (climatic) base level-driven lacustrine sequences in active settings with medium to large sediment transfer systems...|$|R

The present study aimed to give an accurate picture of the 2012 – 2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica by combining data from several surveillance systems: general practice, emergency general practice, hospital emergency units, intensive care units, and nursing homes. Twenty-eight respiratory viruses were retrospectively investigated from patients in general practice with ILI. Sequence analysis of the genetic changes in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses (A(H 1 N 1) pdm 2009, A(H 3 N 2) and B) was performed. The trends in ILI/influenza consultation rates and the relative illness ratios (RIRs) of having an ILI consultation were estimated by age group for the different surveillance systems analyzed. Of the 182 ILI patients enrolled by general practitioners, 57. 7 % tested positive for influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a genetic drift for influenza B and A(H 3 N 2) viruses. The ILI/influenza surveillance systems showed similar trends and were well correlated. In accordance with virological data, the RIRs of having an ILI consultation were highest among the young (, 15 years old) and decreased with age.

40|$|Territorial {{cohesion}} {{has become}} one of the main objectives in transport planning. This has fostered the development of assessment methodologies to quantitatively estimate the territorial impact of major transport infrastructures, which are particularly scarce at the intra-regional level. Linked to cohesion, polycentricity has been defined as the best spatial configuration to achieve balanced regions where population and opportunities are distributed among several entities linked by functional relationships. This paper aims to present a methodology to estimate these impacts based on the use of a new regional composite polycentricity indicator. The proposed indicator is tested by comparing the effects of conventional and high-speed railway (HSR) alternatives in the territorial system of a northern region of Spain. This quantitative assessment is a ranking tool for prioritizing rail network alternatives in terms of achieving the most balanced territory, which is especially relevant in countries where HSR networks follow cohesion goals. Our results show that new HSR links should only be <b>complementary</b> to <b>regional</b> railway services, and that the suppression of secondary lines should be avoided if a reduction in polarization is to be achieved.
