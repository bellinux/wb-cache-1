25|$|A {{delegation}} {{from the}} Arab League <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> {{to try to}} persuade the architects of the UN draft, France and USA, to base it on the Siniora Plan. This, combined with a strong opposition to the existing draft from several of the 15 Council members, especially Qatar, resulted in a change of France's position. In order to avoid a total collapse of the UN efforts to end the hostilities, this eventually led to a substantial revision of the draft proposal (with several re-drafts in between), which included many elements from the Siniora Plan.|$|E

25|$|The New York native Edward MacDowell {{was a major}} late 19th-century composer, {{though he}} spent most of his {{productive}} time in Boston. His first concerto was premiered in New York in 1888, and he returned the following year to premier another concerto. MacDowell eventually began using elements of American folk music in his compositions, especially the Woodland Sketches. The Bohemian composer Antonín Dvořák <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in 1892 to head the National Conservatory. A fervent nationalist, Dvořák used the folk music of his native land in his music, and encouraged American composers to do the same. One of the Conservatory's students, the African American Harry Burleigh, introduced him to the songs of the minstrel shows and spirituals, and Dvorak was deeply moved, enough to write a well-known essay in an 1895 issue of Harper's declaring that American composers should use the diverse folk elements of their country in their compositions.|$|E

Later that year, he told interviewers, he went on a ship to Europe as a cabin boy, jumped ship, and traveled around Europe [...] "introducing the American strut step" [...] in return for meals and lodging. In Marseilles he joined the French Foreign Legion, serving as a bugler in Algiers. He also represented a rubber company in St. Louis and Kansas City.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{remained}} on cordial terms with Senator Seward, Greeley never seriously considered supporting {{him in his}} bid for the Republican nomination for president. Instead, during {{the run-up to the}} 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he pressed the candidacy of former Missouri representative Edward Bates, an opponent of the spread of slavery who had freed his own slaves. In his newspaper, in speeches, and in conversation, Greeley pushed Bates as a man who could win the North and even make inroads in the South. [...] Nevertheless, when one of the dark horse candidates for the Republican nomination, Abraham Lincoln, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> to give an address at Cooper Union, Greeley urged his readers to go hear Lincoln, and was among those who accompanied him to the platform. [...] Greeley thought of Lincoln as a possible nominee for vice president.|$|E
500|$|The Stork Club {{was owned}} and {{operated}} by Sherman Billingsley (1896–1966) an ex-bootlegger who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> from Enid, Oklahoma. [...] The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, just down the street from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street. Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, [...] "Don't ask me how or why I picked the name, because I just don't remember." [...] New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor. [...] Unlike its competitors, the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months.|$|E

[...] On his first visit, he found Barber absent, but had a productive talk with long-time Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan. [...] Other visits followed, and on , Woolley wrote to Superintendent Joyce, [...] "confidentially, the sculptors designing the new coins felt that on their last trip Mr. Morgan was much more cordial and cooperative than Mr. Barber was. [...] I realize I am dealing with artistic temperaments at both ends." [...] Woolley <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> twice in April to examine MacNeil's evolving reverse design for the quarter, on [...] he also visited Weinman's studio and viewed progress on the models of his designs.

[...] Charles was the second of three children, with an older brother Ralph Jr. and a younger sister Frances. [...] Ralph Rangel {{sometimes}} worked as a laborer in a garage, but he was mostly a frequently absent, unemployed man who was abusive {{to his wife and}} who left the family when Charles was six years old. [...] Charles was raised by his mother, who worked as a maid and as a seamstress in a factory in New York's Garment District, and by his maternal grandfather. [...] Many summers were spent in Accomac, Virginia, where his maternal family had roots. [...] Charles was brought up as a Roman Catholic.|$|E
500|$|By 1956, the Zappa {{family had}} moved to Lancaster, a small {{aerospace}} and farming town in the Antelope Valley of the Mojave Desert close to Edwards Air Force Base; he would later refer to Lancaster in the 1973 track [...] "Village of the Sun". Zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests. Although she disliked Varèse's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long distance call to the composer as a 15th birthday present. Unfortunately, Varèse was in Europe at the time, so Zappa spoke to the composer's wife and she suggested he call back later. In a letter Varèse thanked him for his interest, and told him about a composition {{he was working on}} called [...] "Déserts". Living in the desert town of Lancaster, Zappa found this very exciting. Varèse invited him to visit if he ever <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> The meeting never took place (Varèse died in 1965), but Zappa framed the letter and kept it on display {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as she was up for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E
500|$|When Andros <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> {{he moved}} to {{stabilize}} the situation. [...] He befriended the Lenape sachems (chiefs), convincing them to act as mediators between the English and other tribes. [...] Peace appeared to be imminent when Bacon's Rebellion broke out in Maryland, resulting in {{an attack on the}} Susquehannock fort on the Potomac. [...] The surviving Susquehannocks sneaked out of the fort one night, some of them making their way east toward Delaware Bay. [...] In June 1676 Andros offered, in exchange for their moving into his jurisdiction, to protect them from their enemies among the Virginian and Maryland settlers. He also extended an offer given by the Mohawk for the Susquehannocks to settle among them. [...] These offers were well received, but Maryland authorities were unable to convince their Indian allies to make the peace offered by Andros, and organized them to march toward the Delaware, which would also fulfil the goal of strengthening the Maryland claim to the area. [...] Andros responded by urging the Susquehannocks to retreat into New York, where they would be beyond Maryland's reach, and delivering a strongly worded threat to Maryland, that it would either have to acknowledge his sovereignty over the Susquehannocks, or they would have to peacably take them back. [...] He also offered his services as a mediator, pointing out that the absence of the Susquehannocks now left Maryland settlements open to direct attack by the Iroquois.|$|E
