The number of enantiomorphic pairs are given in parentheses. Here the term [...] "enantiomorphic" [...] has a different meaning than in the table for three-dimensional crystal classes.

During ensiling the amount of crop of 104 grass silage clamps, 42 maize silage clamps and 108 big bales (54 round and 54 square) were weighted and after ensiling the dimensions were measured and the chemical composition was analysed. For round and square bales a new regression formula was derived, which estimates the density more accurate than the <b>current</b> <b>table</b> values. It is recommended to calculate the density of round en square bales with the following formula: Density (kg/m 3) = 994. 81 - 0. 5335 x dry matter content (g/kg) - 1. 196 x crude fibre content (g/kg ds).

Wastewater receives secondary treatment, including basic disinfection with chlorine. 6. 2 Capacity and Use in South Florida South Florida has six publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities that discharge treated municipal wastewater to the ocean. These six facilities are the Miami-Dade Central District, Miami-Dade North District, City of Hollywood, Broward County, Boca Raton, and Delray Beach facilities (Figure 6 - 1).

40|$|Ad hoc {{networks}} are wireless mobile networks {{that do not}} rely on preexisting infrastructure and these networks allow a more flexible model of communication than traditional networks since the user {{is not limited to}} a fixed physical location. In order to facilitate communication within the network, a routing protocol is used to discover routes between nodes. The primary goal of such an ad hoc network routing protocol is correct and efficient route establishment between a pair of nodes so that messages may be delivered in a timely manner. Route construction should be done with a minimum of overhead and bandwidth consumption. In this paper, we present routing protocols designed for these ad hoc networks by describing the operation of each of the protocols. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a discussion of two subdivisions of ad hoc routing protocols. Another section discusses <b>current</b> <b>table</b> driven protocols, while a later section describes those protocols which are classified as ondemand. The paper then presents qualitative comparisons of table-driven protocols, followed by demand-driven and on-demand protocols; and finally, the last section concludes the paper...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to summarize the}} present state of understanding of electron linac instabilities which result in beam loss along the accelerator. The major emphasis is placed on the type of instability which is caused by cumulative interaction of the beam with a multisection accelerator, as distinguished from the effect observed in short high-current accelerators where the instability is due to local regenerative interaction. The manifestations of the effect are first described and physical models are proposed. The properties of the HEM 11 mode which is responsible for the instability are discussed in detail. Following, a short summary of the Panofsky theory is presented to illustrate various scaling laws which have been verified experimentally on the SUC accelerator. Measured results are also compared with a detailed computer study made by R. Helm and agreement is generally found to be very good. After the discussion of beam break-up gain, a few conjectures are presented on the possible starting mechanisms of the effect. In conclusion, the program presently underway at SLAC to increase the <b>current</b> <b>Table</b> I threshold of the instability is outlined and early results of this program are presented...|$|E
40|$|Relational {{database}} schemas {{are widely}} used in nuclear explosion monitoring applications (Carr, 2004) and they work well for many aspects of monitoring, but have some limitations {{that can only be}} addressed through fundamental redesign. In this paper we present a new seismic schema that captures all of the information in the current core schema, but is better normalized, more extensible, and provides a better basis for next generation seismic monitoring research and system development. Past modifications of the core schema have typically been minor, avoiding significant changes to the existing tables because software that interfaces with them may have to be modified also. Introducing custom tables is equally problematic and similarly avoided. In the short term, keeping the original tables makes sense because software modifications can be expensive. For conducting new seismic monitoring research and developing next generation monitoring software systems, however, keeping the <b>current</b> <b>table</b> structure can become a significant impediment. Using the Object Role Modeling (ORM) component of Visio Enterprise Architect Edition, and starting from the basic object fact relationships, we have developed a data model and resultant schema that supports many-to-many event-to-origin relationships, completely captures complex model prediction information, properly records array membership, and properly normalizes network magnitude storage, {{to name just a few}} features.

While, as reported previously, a remarkable promotion of the growth of Porphyra tenera is to be occationed by the supplement of vitamin B_ 12 to the media. With the purpose of accertaining the relation between the vitamin B_ 12 content and the laver productivity in the farm, the determination of the vitamin B_ 12 content in the laver-farm was done. The experiments were carried out on a laver-farm near the estuary, of the river named Shinkawa running throuth Kagoshima city, and the following results were obtained.
