Senate Bill 131, Laws of 1928, approved April 26, 1928, authorized the establishment of junior colleges, and also created a State Commission for oversight of these institutions. The first action of the Commission <b>consisted</b> <b>of</b> <b>identifying</b> its authority, establishing standards by which existing junior colleges must meet to qualify for state aid and develop criteria required of agricultural high schools seeking junior college status. This action of the Commission constituted the birth of Mississippi State System of Public Junior Colleges, giving Mississippi the distinction of having the first state system of comprehensive two-year colleges in the nation. The Commission had no staff but was served by personnel within the State Department of Education. In 1968, a separate operational division for junior colleges was created in the State Department of Education, which provided state services and oversight until 1986.|$|E

5000|$|Danilov used {{linguistics}} {{to solve}} {{day to day}} practical political problems and his works were intimately related to social class. His approach to Marxism was dogmatic, always asking what the real Marxism was in linguistics and who could be called a true Marxist linguist.The social purpose of his work emerged from a linguistic study, done in Ukraine, which is entitled: [...] "Язык общественного класса (по данным говора мест. Белик Полтавского округа), The language of social class (according to the dialect of Beliki, {{in the region of}} Poltava) ”.4.The greatest achievement of this linguistic survey has been the modernity of his methods, using what he called mass observation that in a way reminding of modern sociolinguistics. The area where Danilov and his team worked was the village of Beliki in the region of Poltava, in the summer of 1927. In his work, dated 1928, the author wanted to focus his interest on the language of people, conducting a “linguistic survey” and studying data according to different linguistic axes. To do so, he interviewed several people. The study <b>consisted</b> <b>of</b> <b>identifying</b> citizen class types and of demonstrating their particular speech and how this contributes to the class struggle. The main method to search for material and information consisted of a systematic investigation of many people of different ages, gender and social status. What emerged from this linguistic analysis was the strong role that language can have in the class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie. Also Danilov shared the common belief, which was widespread {{in the second half of}} the 1920s, namely: the socio-economic conditions of a social group or class are reflected by their psychology and their language used. The different uses of language in these classes introduce a new hierarchy in which poor peasants occupy the bottom of the ladder, as they use the archaic lexicon reduced to the terminology of agriculture. In this classification, skilled workers and local cadres occupy a high place - they are bilingual, they use the Russian language of the October Revolution but they also speak Ukrainian. Danilov's diversity of language is interpreted as the result of differences between the psychologies of classes. Danilov suggested to adopt a new language that can finally unite the classes and his proposal was Russian, since it relates to the Revolution (taken into consideration that it was a proposal and not a prerequisite).He later understood the limitations of this work affirming that he should have looked beyond the results and should not have considered these results as answers but as the key to get to the answers.|$|E
