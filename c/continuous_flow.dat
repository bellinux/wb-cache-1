5|$|The large {{reservoirs}} {{along the}} Longdendale valley {{known as the}} Longdendale Chain were designed in the 1840s and completed in February 1877. They provided compensation water to ensure a <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> along the River Etherow which was essential for local industry, and provided pure water for Manchester. The Upper Derwent Valley reservoirs were built from the mid 20th century onward to supply drinking water to the East Midlands and South Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|The TDRS-1 {{program was}} overall less successful, with the {{satellite}} suffering several computer failures and an overall loss of telemetry for several hours. In all, the orbiter {{was able to}} use the satellite for 65 of the planned 89 orbits, and could make successful use of the connection on about forty. The <b>Continuous</b> <b>Flow</b> Electrophoresis System equipment functioned as planned, processing several hundred times more material than would have been possible on Earth, and the Asahi Shimbun crystal experiment, flown for the second time, was able to produce snow crystals after the canister was redesigned.|$|E

5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter crew compartment. Among these was the <b>Continuous</b> <b>Flow</b> Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to try {{to determine if they}} worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E
5|$|The {{maker of}} the work is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this. There are a number of goldsmiths' names known from {{accounts}} and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux, secular and religious, produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.|$|E

30|$|Understanding {{the role}} of {{feedback}} is crucial {{in the study of}} dynamical systems; see, e.g., [2, 3] for relevant surveys. The absence of negative feedback loops tends to favor steady state attractors. For example, <b>continuous</b> <b>flows</b> without negative feedback loops are known as monotone systems. In these systems trajectories converge generically towards an equilibrium under mild regularity hypotheses; see, e.g., [4 – 6]. In particular, this implies that chaotic trajectories are not generic in cooperative <b>continuous</b> <b>flows.</b> Similarly, [7, 8] show that in Boolean networks with asynchronous updating, negative feedback loops are necessary for the existence of attracting limit cycles.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Structural {{stability}} and structural {{change in a}} continuous two-dimensional model of a space economy are considered, and {{it is suggested that}} structural stability of flows or parametric families of flows is a reasonable assumption and secures the robustness of the models constructed. Within the format of <b>continuous</b> <b>flows</b> it is possible to characterize globally the structurally stable flows, by use of the generic theory of differential equations, and to characterize locally, the structural change of flows up to topological equivalence, by use of two-dimensional catastrophe theory. 1 <b>Continuous</b> <b>flows</b> In this paper the Beckmann model of <b>continuous</b> <b>flows</b> in two-dimensional space is considered (Beckmann, 1952; 1953). Such <b>flows</b> are <b>continuous</b> vector fields with direction and magnitude being continuous functions of the location coordinates. This means an abstraction from real road networks. Space is traversible everywhere in all directions at a cost determined by location. For simplicity this local cost of displacement could be taken to be independent of the direction of traversal, though dependent on location; that is, the case of an isotropic transportation model...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} a new optimal scheduling approach with an application to a flexible <b>flow</b> shop with <b>continuous</b> <b>flows</b> and uniform alternative machines is considered. The peculiarity of the considered problem is the simultaneous consideration of both <b>continuous</b> <b>flows</b> in the operations and discrete assignments. The scheduling approach {{is based on a}} dynamic non-stationary interpretation of the execution of the operations and a temporal decomposition of the scheduling problem. The algorithmic realization is based on a modified form of the continuous maximum principle blended with mathematical optimization. The novelty of this study as compared with previous works on this method consists of a detailed theoretical analysis of the temporal decomposition and computational complexity with an application to flow-shop scheduling with <b>continuous</b> <b>flows</b> and discrete assignments. The optimality conditions as well as the structural properties of the model and the algorithm are investigated. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed. The results of this study can be used as an extension to the existing mathematical programming models subject to the following issues: dynamics and non-stationarity of the operation execution, non-stationarity of the machine structures and capacity parameters, and representation o...|$|R
