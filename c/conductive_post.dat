40|$|Generally, {{the present}} {{invention}} {{can be viewed}} as providing a method for manufacturing a multilayer wiring substrate. Briefly described, the method can be broadly conceptualized by the following steps: forming a first conductive connection on a first insulating layer; forming a <b>conductive</b> <b>post</b> on the first conductive connection; forming a second insulating layer on the first conductive connection, the first insulating layer, and the conductive post; exposing the <b>conductive</b> <b>post</b> by removing a portion of the second insulating layer; and forming a second conductive connection on the second insulating layer such that the second conductive connection is electrically connected to the first conductive connection via the <b>conductive</b> <b>post.</b> The second insulating layer can be formed via dry film lamination. In addition, the conductive posts can be exposed by either forming holes in the second insulating layer or by roughening the surface of the second insulating layer. Georgia Tech Research Corp...|$|E

40|$|A {{device is}} {{reported}} for facilitating {{the passage of}} electrical signals from an external source through {{the skin of a}} patient to internal portions of the body such as muscles and nerves. The connector device includes a bio-compatible shell having an enlarged disk shaped portion for being implanted below the skin of the patient. The shell has a first and second electrically <b>conductive</b> <b>post</b> carried therein upon which a plug can be readily connected and disconnected. A modified form of the invention utilizes a unipolar connector that is adapted to be plugged into a shell implanted below the skin of a patient. Both of the connector devices are designed to be separated when a predetermined force is applied. This prevents excessive force from being applied to the implanted bio-compatible shell...|$|E

[Poster] [Meeting] [Final Report]This {{project is}} {{investigating}} {{a novel approach}} to trustworthy system development based on 3 D integration, an emerging chip fabrication technique in which two or more integrated circuit dies are combined into a single stack using vertical <b>conductive</b> <b>posts.</b> Since the dies may be manufactured separately, 3 D circuit integration offers the option of enhancing a commodity processor {{with a variety of}} custom security functions, which are manufacturing options applicable only to those systems that require them. This research introduces a fundamentally new method to incorporate security mechanisms into hardware and has the potential to significantly shift the economics of trustworthy systems...|$|R
40|$|Trustworthy system {{development}} entails a high nonrecurring engineering (NRE) cost {{together with a}} low volume of units over which to amortize that cost. For example, the potential for developmental and operational attacks against hardware requires countermeasures that make it very expensive to design and manufacture custom hardware used to build high assurance systems. To address these problems, we propose an approach to trustworthy {{system development}} based on 3 -D integration, an emerging chip fabrication technique in which two or more integrated circuit dies are fabricated individually and then combined into a single stack using vertical <b>conductive</b> <b>posts.</b> With 3 -D integration, a generalpurpose die, or computation plane, can be combined with a special-purpose die, or control plane. We discuss the security advantages of using 3 -D integrated hardware in sensitive applications, where security is of the utmost importance, and we outline problems, challenges, attacks, solutions, and topics for future research.

40|$|Application-specific coprocessors, {{including}} those for cryptography and compression, can provide significant acceleration and power savings to programs requiring their services. While most coprocessors {{have traditionally been}} constructed as a separate chip connected to the main CPU over a relatively slow bus connection, 3 D integration, providing a more direct connection, is an emerging technology that offers significant performance advantages and power savings over such systems. With 3 D integration, two or more dies can be fabricated separately and later combined into a 3 D integrated circuit (3 D IC), a single stack {{of two or more}} dies connected by vertical <b>conductive</b> <b>posts.</b> We propose a novel coprocessor architecture in which one layer houses application-specific coprocessors for cryptography and compression, which provide acceleration for applications running on a general-purpose processor in another layer. A compelling application for such a system is one that performs real-time trace collection, compressing the trace prior to its transmission to permanent off-chip storage for offline program analysis. Furthermore, an optional encryption step, performed by the cryptographic circuitry in the coprocessor layer, can protect this compressed data from interception. In another application, a high-performance stand-alone encryption service can be provided...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional {{integration}} is an emerging chip fabrication technique in which multiple integrated circuit dies are joined using <b>conductive</b> <b>posts.</b> 3 D integration offers several performance and security advantages, including extremely high bandwidth {{between the two}} dies {{and the ability to}} augment a processor with a separate die housing custom security features. This thesis performs a feasibility and requirements analysis of a data transformation coprocessor in a three-dimensional integrated circuit. We propose a novel coprocessor architecture in which one layer (control layer) houses application-specific coprocessors for cryptography and compression, which provide acceleration for applications running on a general-purpose processor in another layer (computational layer). The main application supported from our proposed 3 DIC is the one that performs real-time trace collection, compresses the trace, and optionally encrypts the compressed trace, which protects the data from interception during transmission to permanent off-chip storage for offline program analysis. Although we are not building a hardware device for simulation we present the architecture for a 3 D data transformation processor and a rationale for each of the key design decisions, including a compression study that determined the optimal compression algorithm for a specific set of traces.

40|$|Carbon-supported porous {{electrodes}} {{are used}} in low-temperature fuel cells to provide maximum catalyst surface area, while taking up little volume and using minimum catalyst material. In Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs), however, much of the catalyst included in the anode is significantly under-utilized, while {{a small fraction of}} the catalyst facilitates the bulk of the oxidation reaction. In this thesis, the porous carbon electrode used as the anode in a DMFC is analyzed using Axiomatic Design theory. The imbalance of catalyst utilization in these electrodes is determined to be a result of coupled design, in which large amounts of catalyst can compromise ionic resistance and fuel transport within the electrode. This design flaw is confirmed experimentally using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. Tests of standard electrodes show that they have a maximum Nafion content of about 30 % Nafion by weight and that excessive catalyst loading eventually results in less available catalyst, not more. An alternative design is proposed to alleviate the coupling between functions by applying micron-scale structure to the nano-porous electrode. The proposed design introduces ionically conductive channels through the thickness of the porous electrode to greatly reduce ionic resistance to catalyst particles far from the ion exchange membrane without compromising access to catalyst particles near the membrane accessible for fuel delivery and product removal. The influence of the proposed design on ionic conductivity is analyzed using a twodimensional analog of the transmission line model for porous electrodes. The model suggests that ionic resistance can be decreased by up to 87 % with the addition of ionically <b>conductive</b> <b>posts.</b> Structured electrodes with 75 pm diameter posts spaced 175 tm apart are shown in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments to perform notably better than standard cells. The structured cells show a 6 % increase in available catalyst area and a 46 % decrease in ionic resistance. Peak cell power is estimated to increase by 4 % as a result of the best electrode tested while an electrode with ideal geometry could increase peak cell power by 9 %. Even greater benefits could be realized if, as predicted, structured cells can keep ionic resistance constant while catalyst loading is increased. by Anthony J. Schrauth. Thesis (Ph. D.)
