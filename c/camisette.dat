50|$|During World War II, {{the villagers}} of Mijanès were {{involved}} in the rescue of six British airmen of the Royal Air Force after their plane crashed on the Pic de la <b>Camisette,</b> a nearby mountain, in December 1944. Wreckage of the plane is displayed today at the Château d'Usson.|$|E
50|$|On 5 December 1944 a British Douglas Dakota III aircraft, {{serial number}} FL588, of the Royal Air Force crashed on the Pic de la <b>Camisette,</b> a {{mountain}} {{close to the}} commune of Mijanès, Ariège, in the French Pyrenees. It was on a military transport operation during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Around 15:30 {{one of the}} Dakota {{aircraft}} {{crashed on}} the Pic de la <b>Camisette</b> (alt 2426m [...] ), striking the north face above the Roc de la Musique before coming down facing south-east near a lake. The exact cause of the crash is not known, although {{it is known that}} the aircraft came down in a blizzard.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} morning, 6 December, {{the injured}} Blatch and Baker located Dawkins by following his cries {{of pain and}} attempted {{to bring him to}} shelter in the plane, but were unable to move him. In spite of having broken both his legs, Dawkins managed to drag himself towards the plane, where the other men gave him shelter in the wrecked fuselage. Blatch and Baker, who were barely able to walk, then went down into the valley to the village of Mijanès and sought help from the local inhabitants. A group of villagers from Mijanes formed a search party and went up to look for survivors, but were thwarted by nightfall and a fierce snowstorm. On 7 December, villagers from neighbouring Artigues retraced the steps of the two airmen and discovered the plane wreck on the Pic de la <b>Camisette.</b> Amid the wreckage they heard cries for help and found the officers Ainsworth, Henwood, Wigmore and Dawkins in the fuselage of the plane, alive but too severely injured to move. With great difficulty, the villagers carried the airmen down from the mountain, following the Barbouillère stream through the snow. The injured men were then taken from Le Pla by ambulance to Carcassonne hospital.|$|E
