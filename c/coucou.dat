5|$|Fourteen {{fighters were}} sent to strafe from low altitude, German ground targets ahead of the British infantry, roving behind German lines, attacking infantry, transport, gun-teams and machine-gun nests; the attacks {{continued}} all day, {{with two of the}} British aircraft being shot down. Organised attacks were made on the German airfields at Bisseghem and Marcke near Courtrai and the day bombing squadrons attacked airfields at Ramegnies Chin, <b>Coucou,</b> Bisseghem (again) and Rumbeke. Reconnaissance reports of German troops concentrating from Quesnoy to Warneton, led to aircraft setting out to attack them within minutes. German fighters made a considerable effort to intercept corps observation aircraft over the battlefield but were frustrated by patrols on the barrage line and offensive patrols beyond; only one British corps aircraft was shot down by German aircraft during the day. After dark, the night-bombing specialists of 100 Squadron bombed railway stations at Warneton, Menin and Courtrai. Ignorance of the situation at the northern end of the II Anzac Corps front was resolved by air reconnaissance at dawn on 8 June.|$|E

2500|$|Ouvrage Mont des Welches, a gros ouvrage of the Maginot Line fortifications, {{is part of}} the Fortified Sector of Boulay. [...] It {{comprises}} two entrance blocks, one infantry block, one artillery block, one observation {{block and}} two combination blocks. [...] It is located between petit ouvrage <b>Coucou</b> and gros ouvrage Michelsberg, facing Germany. Relatively small for a gros ouvrage, Mont des Welches saw a brief period of sharp action in June 1940, when German forces moving along the rear of the Maginot Line engaged the position without success. After modest renovations in the 1950s, Mont des Welches was abandoned in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Following World War II, the French {{military}} reclaimed the Maginot Line {{with the}} aim of renovating and improving it against a possible attack by Warsaw Pact forces through southern Germany. The strongest positions, Hackenberg, Mont des Welches, Michelsberg, and Anzeling were designated the môle de Boulay ("breakwater") in 1951 and were placed back into service after a period of rehabilitation. The petits ouvrages from <b>Coucou</b> to Denting were repaired and incorporated into the breakwater as well. [...] After the establishment of the French nuclear strike force, the importance of the Line declined, and maintenance ceased in the 1970s, with most of the casemates and petit ouvrages sold to the public.|$|E
2500|$|Ouvrage Hackenberg, one of {{the largest}} (a gros ouvrage) of the Maginot Line fortifications, is part of the Fortified Sector of Boulay. It is {{situated}} twenty kilometers east of Thionville, in the Moselle département, near the village of Veckring, on the Hackenberg (343 meters). [...] It is located between gros ouvrage Billig and petit ouvrage <b>Coucou,</b> facing Germany. The fort occupies the wooded Hackenberg ridge. Before World War II it was considered a showpiece of French fortification technology, and was visited by British King George VI. In 1940 Hackenberg was never directly attacked, providing covering fire to neighboring positions and harassing nearby German forces. Its garrison was {{one of the}} last French units to surrender after the June 1940 armistice. In 1944, under German occupation, it was in action against American forces advancing along the Maginot Line. It resisted for three days before artillery bombardment from the rear forced the Germans to evacuate. Following World War II it became part of a strongpoint meant to delay a potential advance by Soviet forces into northeastern France. Hackenberg has been preserved and operates as a museum.|$|E
60|$|Says the Cuckoo: 'My lord, {{there is}} not a word to lose. I beg of you to seize {{carefully}} the character of my singing; above all things, deign, my lord, to mark its artifice and its method.' Then filling its throat, and flapping its wings at each note, it sang out, 'Coucou, <b>coucou,</b> <b>coucou,</b> <b>coucou,</b> <b>coucou,</b> coucou.' And after having combined this in every possible way, it fell silent.|$|E

He {{appears to be}} the Cuculus Indicator (le <b>Coucou</b> Indicateur) and the Om-Shlanvo of the Kafirs; the Somal call him Maris. Described by Father Lobo and Bruce, he is treated as a myth by Le Vaillant; M. Wiedman makes him cry [...] "Shirt! Shirt! Shirt!" [...] Dr. Sparrman [...] "Tcherr! Tcherr!" [...] Mr. Delegorgue [...] "Chir! Chir! Chir!" [...] His note suggested to me the shrill chirrup of a sparrow, and his appearance that of a greenfinch.|$|E
60|$|My {{excursions}} in the environs {{have made}} me acquainted with {{a great variety of}} modes of communication between the capital and its adjacent, villages. Although Paris is pared down so accurately, and is almost without suburbs, the population, within a circuit of ten miles in each direction, is almost equal to that of Paris itself. St. Denis has several thousands, St. Germain the same, and Versailles is still a town of considerable importance. All these places, with villages out of number, keep up daily intercourse with the city, and in addition to the hundreds of vegetable carts that constantly pass to and fro, there are many conveyances that are exclusively devoted to passengers. The cheapest and lowest is called a <b>coucou</b> for no reason that I can see, unless it be that a man looks very like a fool to have a seat in one of them. They are large cabriolets, with two and even three seats. The wheels are enormous, and there is commonly a small horse harnessed by the side of a larger, in the hills, to drag perhaps eight or nine people. One is amazed to see the living carrion that is driven about a place like Paris, in these uncouth vehicles. The river is so exceedingly crooked, that it is little used by travellers above Rouen.|$|E
