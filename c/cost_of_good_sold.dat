This study employs Anderson, Banker, Janakiraman (ABJ) model to identify the sticky cost behaviour on selling expense and general administrative expense. The samples of this study are 351 firm years of manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange during 2009 - 2012. This study found that selling, general and administrative cost increase 0, 475 percent and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>sold</b> increase 1, 063 percent when sales increase 1 percent.

The basic method employed {{in this study}} was a descriptive method and the research location selection done in intend that is in KUD Banyumanik Semarang City. Data used is secondary data and primary data with technique of collecting data employed was record keeping and interview. Method of analyzing data used analysis ratio consist of liquidity, solvability, rentability, and activity ratios and also trend analysis and common size percentage analysis. The examination result shows if we see from liquidity ratio, current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio, it shows in good position because it is been above the standard needed, it means that cooperation is able to pay current liabilities using its currents asset. From solvability ratio, total debt to equity ratio and total debt to total capital ratio, it shows in bad position because cooperation is not able to pay the current liabilities using its own capital but also able to pay the liabilities using all the properties they have. Cooperation earning power seen from Return of Investment (ROI) and Return of Equity (ROE) still low because it is below the standard. Activity ratio shows inventory and fixed asset turnover shows good preference, but total asset and receivable turnover are below the standard because still less effective in use. The trend percentage in balance and the common profit and loss report shows decreasing trend. The decreasing because KUD is undeveloped that causes decreasing net income.

The report of Capital Structure Analysis of Padma Poly Cotton Ltd. is based on Annual Reports of 2 years 2011 & 2012. This analysis based on the different ratios analysis of capital structure (C. S) and Financial Structure (F. S) and their sensitivity to the company’s efficiency. The study is basically based on secondary data. The sources of secondary data were Annual Report, Company brochure and website. Some primary data were collected by interviewing The Padma PollyCotton Knit Fabrics Ltd Officials. Before using {{the data for the}} purpose of evaluation of capital structure, the documents were carefully scanned and their reliability was judged. The growth rate, Earning per Share (EPS), ROE, of the Company will able to find out the trend of the Company. Again the common size statement is used to find out the proportion of the Company. The yearly financial ratios regarding capital structure were calculated by EXCEL Sheet, graphically plotted 2 years data 2011 & 2012 are taken in this report. Assets and Equity were increasing from 2011 to 2012 but asset turnover ratios (ROA/ROE) were decreasing. The present situation of the company is not impressive. This Company is too reluctant to make the payments of interest charges, basically Padma PollyCotton Knit Fabrics Ltd is not paying debts in due time. Though the inventory turnover ratio is higher, it does not claim higher income because of higher <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>sold.</b> From the ratio analysis of financial data from annual reports of Padma Poly Cotton Ltd. 2011 & 2012 we find the average EPS is 1. 14, ROA is 0. 94 %, ROE is 3. 05 %, Debt Ratio is 69. 27 %, ROA/ROE is 0. 32 and Debt : Equity is 21 : 79. The historical Debt: Equity (capitalization ratio) is 21 : 79.

One of the ways to control {{production}} costs is applying production standard costs that comparing the realization to production costs standard. So, it can be know the difference among the reality with the standardized production costs, in the form of profitable or lost difference. The purposed to be attained in this research is to review the production cost control conducted by the company and to know how far the company performing production control {{in order to be}} effective and efficient. Research design used is case study. Research is done in Saradan Forestry Department of Madiun. Data used in this research is secondary data in the form of data issued by the company for management party in period of 2005 - 2007. Its data collecting technique is documentation and the collected data are production cost data and organization structure. The collected data are analyzed by assessing company’s effectiveness level, efficiency level and by analyzing company’s overhead cost difference. From the research results, it can be known that production volume effectiveness for period of 2005 is 14. 270 m 3 in the budgeted production with the actual production is 15. 922 and 112 % in comparison value. For 2006, it is 16. 157 m 3 in the budgeted production, while its actual production is 17. 427 and 108 % in comparison value. And for 2007, it is 18. 954 m 3 in the budgeted production, with its actual production is 19. 486 and 103 % in comparison value. It means that the company has been effective, where the actual production has met the budgeted production target. From the cost efficiency, it seems that the actual production cost for period 2005 - 2006 is still below the budgeted production costs. In 2005, the actual cost is 98 % from production cost budget and 98. 3 in 2006. It means that company has efficient. If production cost is too high hence <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>sold</b> will also high. Last, in company’s volume/capacity difference is occurred profitable BOP difference where there is capacity difference in 2005 as much as Rp. 63. 732. 198, Rp. 27. 789. 963 in 2006 and Rp. 6. 750. 989 in 2007. Thus, it can be said that the company’s standardized capacity need a higher cost tariffs than the standardized capacity cost. Thus, it can be suggested that company should improves its control in each works and it needs a good coordination among each division in its job authority and assignment according to the existing organization chart. Thereby, it can be created a better work circumstance and harmonious to support all policy and the established goal...|$|E
