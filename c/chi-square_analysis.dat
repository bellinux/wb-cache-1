40|$|AbstractObjectives: {{the aim was}} to {{test the}} {{predictive}} accuracy of POSSUM and P-POSSUM on patients undergoing CEA. Design: retrospective and prospective study. Materials: 499 CEAs performed by four vascular surgeons from a single unit from 1992 – 99. The median age was 68 (range 38 – 86) and 60 % were men. Methods : physiological parameters, operative parameters and the 30 -day mortality were collected. Predicted mortality for each patient was calculated using POSSUM and P-POSSUM equations. Patients were stratified into risk groups and observed and predicted deaths were compared. Accuracy of the prediction was assessed using <b>chi-squared</b> <b>analysis.</b> Results: the observed 30 -day mortality was 1. 8 % (9 / 499). The predicted deaths using POSSUM and P-POSSUM analysis were 49 and 25 respectively compared to nine observed deaths. There was significant evidence of lack of fit of both models in predicting mortality (<b>chi-squared</b> <b>analysis,</b> p< 0. 05). Conclusions: POSSUM and P-POSSUM overpredict mortality and are unsuitable for comparative audit of CEA. Models developed specific for CEA might accurately predict mortality...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Panoramic {{radiography}} is {{a common}} radiographic examination {{carried out in the}} UK. This study was carried out to determine if acquisition site has an impact on image quality. Methods An image quality audit was carried out in South Wales across a number of dental and general radiology settings. The image quality was assessed retrospectively against national standards. A total of 174 radiographs were assessed from general radiology departments and 141 from dental radiology units. <b>Chi-squared</b> <b>analysis</b> was used to investigate whether there were differences in the grading between dental radiology units and general radiology departments. Differences between the two settings {{in terms of the number}} of errors in the radiographs was analysed using the Mann–Whitney test. <b>Chi-squared</b> <b>analysis</b> was used to see if there were differences between the types of errors in the two clinical settings. Results There was a significant association (p = 0. 021) between the quality of the radiograph grading and type of radiology department. However when excellent and diagnostically acceptable radiographs were grouped together there was no significant difference between the two clinical settings.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the reduction of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in L- 02 hepatocytes by hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) using <b>chi-square</b> <b>analysis.</b> Cells were treated with 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 &# 956;M Cr(VI) for 12, 24, or 36 h. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) experiments and measurements of intracellular ATP levels were performed by spectrophotometry or bioluminescence assays following Cr(VI) treatment. The chi-square {{test was used to}} determine the difference between cell survival rate and ATP levels. For the <b>chi-square</b> <b>analysis,</b> the results of the MTT or ATP experiments were transformed into a relative ratio with respect to the control (%). The relative ATP levels increased at 12 h, decreased at 24 h, and increased slightly again at 36 h following 4, 8, 16, 32 &# 956;M Cr(VI) treatment, corresponding to a "V-shaped" curve. Furthermore, the results of the <b>chi-square</b> <b>analysis</b> demonstrated a significant difference of the ATP level in the 32 -&# 956;M Cr(VI) group (P < 0. 05). The results suggest that the chi-square test can be applied to analyze the interference effects of Cr(VI) on ATP levels in L- 02 hepatocytes. The decreased ATP levels at 24 h indicated disruption of mitochondrial energy metabolism and the slight increase of ATP levels at 36 h indicated partial recovery of mitochondrial function or activated glycolysis in L- 02 hepatocytes...|$|E
