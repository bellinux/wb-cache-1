5|$|The shore at Clevedon is {{a mixture}} of pebbled beaches and low rocky cliffs, with the old harbour being at {{the western edge of the}} town at the mouth of the Land Yeo river. It is remembered as the place at which John Ashley {{conceived}} of the idea of creating The Mission to Seafarers. The rocky beach, which has been designated as the Clevedon Shore geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is the side of a mineralised fault, which runs east-west adjacent to the pier, and forms a small cliff feature in Dolomitic Conglomerate on the north side of Clevedon Beach, containing cream to pink baryte together with sulfides. The minerals identified at the site include: haematite, chalcopyrite, tennantite, galena, tetrahedrite, bornite, pyrite, marcasite, enargite and sphalerite. Secondary alteration of this assemblage has produced idaite, <b>Covellite</b> and other Copper sulphides.|$|E

25|$|In Attappadi region gold grains {{are found}} only in native state and occur in {{different}} shapes and sizes. Visible specks of gold were noticed in the samples collected from veins, particularly where the associated sulphides {{have been subjected to}} weathering and leaching resulting in the formation of limonite. Gold grains with maximum dimension of 2mm were reported. Pyrite is the dominant sulfide phase within the quartz lodes (occurring as stringers and fracture fillings). Chalcopyrite, <b>covellite,</b> chalcocite, and galena are commonly observed in the mineral assemblage.|$|E
500|$|<b>Covellite</b> {{and other}} copper sulfides {{found in the}} area appear to have formed through postvolcanic epithermal {{mineralization}} above deep porphyry copper mineralization. The sulfur itself formed at temperatures of [...] in a now extinct fumarole.|$|E
50|$|Covellite's {{occurrence}} {{is widespread}} in the United States. In Silver Bow County, Montana, <b>covellite</b> {{has been found in}} veins at depths of 1,150 m, as the primary mineral. <b>Covellite</b> formed as clusters in these veins reaching one meter across in Leonard mines, Montana. As a secondary mineral, <b>covellite</b> also forms as descending surface water in the supergene enrichment zone oxidizes and redeposits <b>covellite</b> on hypogene sulfides (pyrite and chalcopyrite). Locally, findings of <b>covellite</b> have been discovered in salt domes and at the McCellan copper mine in Foard County, Texas. An unusual occurrence of <b>covellite</b> was found replacing organic debris in the red beds of New Mexico.|$|E
50|$|<b>Covellite</b> is {{commonly}} found as a secondary copper mineral in deposits. It is rarely a primary mineral in copper deposits, and {{is even less}} likely to be found as a volcanic sublimate. <b>Covellite</b> is known to form in weathering environments near the surface in deposits where copper is the primary sulfide. As a primary mineral, the formation of <b>covellite</b> is restricted to hydrothermal conditions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Covellite</b> was {{the first}} {{identified}} naturally occurring superconductor. [...] The framework of CuS3 /CuS2 allow for an electron excess that facilitate superconduction during particular states, with exceptionally low thermal loss. Material science is now aware of several of covellite's favorable properties and several researchers are intent on synthesizing <b>covellite.</b> [...] Gramp et al. (2006) discovered that <b>covellite</b> can also be produced in the lab under anaerobic conditions by sulfate reducing bacteria {{at a variety of}} temperatures. However, further research remains, because although the abundance of <b>covellite</b> may be high, the growth of its crystal size is actually inhibited by physical constraints of the bacteria. [...] It has been experimentally demonstrated that the presence of ammonium vanadates is important in the solid state transformation of other copper sulfides to <b>covellite</b> crystals.|$|E
5000|$|Copper sulfide {{crystallizes}} in the {{hexagonal crystal}} system, {{and this is}} the form of the mineral <b>covellite.</b> There is also an amorphous high pressure form [...] which {{on the basis of the}} Raman spectrum has been described as having a distorted <b>covellite</b> structure. An amorphous room temperature semiconducting form produced by the reaction of a Cu(II) ethylenediamine complex with thiourea has been reported, which transforms to the crystalline <b>covellite</b> form at 30 °C.The crystal structure of <b>covellite</b> has been reported several times, and whilst these studies are in general agreement on assigning the space group P63/mmc there are small discrepancies in bond lengths and angles between them.

50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1844 from the type locality of Sangerhausen, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The name {{is from the}} Greek digenus meaning of two origins in reference to its close resemblance with chalcocite and <b>covellite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the 1750s, colonists {{tried to}} mine copper at the Pahaquarry Copper Mine in Warren County. [...] The copper occurs as chalcocite, bornite, <b>covellite,</b> cuprite, and malachite, in {{quartzite}} of the Silurian High Falls Formation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Covellite</b> {{and other}} copper sulfides {{found in the}} area appear to have formed through postvolcanic epithermal {{mineralization}} above deep porphyry copper mineralization. The sulfur itself formed at temperatures of 450 C in a now extinct fumarole.|$|E
5000|$|Copper ions {{that move}} down into this {{reducing}} environment form {{a zone of}} supergene sulfide enrichment. [...] <b>Covellite</b> CuS, chalcocite Cu2S and native copper Cu are stable in these conditions and they are characteristic of the enriched zone.|$|E

50|$|The Toncrae deposit near Floyd was mined for iron (from the gossan) {{from about}} 1790-1850. Copper was mined from 1854-1855, 1905-1908, and 1938-1947. The deposit {{is a massive}} sulfide, {{composed}} mainly of pyrrhotite and magnetite. The main copper ore minerals are chalcocite and <b>covellite.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Covellite</b> (also {{known as}} covelline) {{is a rare}} copper sulfide mineral with the formula CuS. This indigo blue mineral is {{ubiquitous}} in copper ores, it is found in limited abundance and is not an important ore of copper itself, although {{it is well known}} to mineral collectors.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs as}} a {{dissemination}} within copper sulfide minerals in mineralization replacing dolostone at the type locality in the Fletchermine {{where it is}} associated with vaesite, pyrite, <b>covellite,</b> chalcopyrite, bornite and digenite. In an occurrence in Kalgoorlie, Australia it is found in black slate associated with pyrrhotite.|$|E
5000|$|The ore {{profile of}} the 132 North deposit is, from base upwards, 0.1 to 1m of massive pentlandite-pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite sulfide, matrix sulfide {{containing}} 40-80% sulfide, and disseminated sulfide. Accessory nickeline and gersdorffite are reported. The transition zone supergene sulfide phases include; violarite, smythite, <b>covellite,</b> chalcocite and marcasite after pyrite.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Covellite</b> (CuS) {{belongs to}} the binary copper sulfides group, which has the formula CuxSy and can have a wide-ranging copper/sulfur ratio from 1:2 to 2:1 (Cu/S)., However this series {{is by no means}} a {{continuous}} one and the width of the homogeneity range of <b>covellite</b> CuS is narrow. Materials rich in sulfur CuSx where x~ 1.1- 1.2 do exist but they exhibit [...] "superstructures" [...] a modulation of the hexagonal ground plane of the structure spanning a number of adjacent unit cells. This indicates that several of covellite's special properties are the result of molecular structure at this level. Even though the peculiar monovalent nature of copper in sulfides has been known since the 1980s there are many places in the later literature, even in standard texts, where the divalent copper idea pops up again.|$|E
50|$|In the Deflector and Deflector West Cu-Au lode {{deposits}} of the Gullewa Greenstone Belt, Western Australia, digenite {{is an important}} constituent of the transitional Cu-Au ore. However, {{it is difficult to}} treat metallurgically and remains a refractory ore type. In this locality digenite is found with <b>covellite,</b> chalcocite and bornite.|$|E
50|$|On {{exposure}} to air, chalcopyrite oxidises {{to a variety}} of oxides, hydroxides and sulfates. Associated copper minerals include the sulfides bornite (Cu5FeS4), chalcocite (Cu2S), <b>covellite</b> (CuS), digenite (Cu9S5); carbonates such as malachite and azurite, and rarely oxides such as cuprite (Cu2O). Chalcopyrite is rarely found in association with native copper.|$|E
50|$|Cerro Verde is a {{very large}} {{porphyry}} copper deposit, that has oxide and secondary sulfide mineralization, above primary sulfide mineralization. The main oxide copper minerals are brochantite, chrysocolla, malachite and copper “pitch.” Chalcocite and <b>covellite</b> are the most important secondary enrichment copper sulfide minerals. Chalcopyrite and molybdenite are the dominant primary sulfides.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a medium}} to low {{temperature}} hydrothermal mineral occurring with quartz, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, bornite, tetrahedrite-tennantite, chalcocite, <b>covellite</b> and baryte. It {{occurs in the}} mineral deposits at Butte, Montana, San Juan Mountains, Colorado and at both Bingham Canyon and Tintic, Utah. It {{is also found in}} the copper mines of Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|Since {{chalcocite}} is {{a secondary}} mineral that forms from the alteration of other minerals, {{it has been}} known to form pseudomorphs of many different minerals. A pseudomorph is a mineral that has replaced another mineral atom by atom, but it leaves the original mineral's crystal shape intact. Chalcocite {{has been known to}} form pseudomorphs of the minerals bornite, <b>covellite,</b> chalcopyrite, pyrite, enargite, millerite, galena and sphalerite.|$|E
50|$|Covellite's unique crystal {{structure}} {{is related to}} the conditions of its formation. Its distinct framework is produced during oxidative formation conditions. Attempts to synthesize <b>covellite</b> indicate it undergoes a complex oxidation process, and that its formation depends on the state and history of the associated sulfides it was derived from. Experimental evidence shows ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) to be a potentially important catalyst for covellite's solid state transformation from other copper sulfides.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the side}} of a mineralised fault, which runs east-west {{adjacent}} to the pier, and forms a small cliff feature in Dolomitic Conglomerate {{on the north side of}} Clevedon Beach, containing cream to pink baryte together with sulphides. The minerals identified at the site include: haematite, chalcopyrite, tennantite, galena, tetrahedrite, bornite, pyrite, marcasite, enargite and sphalerite. Secondary alteration of this assemblage has produced idaite, <b>Covellite</b> and other Copper sulphides.|$|E
5000|$|Prominent copper sulfide {{minerals}} include Cu2S (chalcocite) and CuS (<b>covellite).</b> In {{the mining}} industry, the minerals bornite or chalcopyrite, which consist of mixed copper-iron sulfides, are {{often referred to}} as [...] "copper sulfides". In chemistry, a [...] "binary copper sulfide" [...] is any binary chemical compound of the elements copper and sulfur. Whatever their source, copper sulfides vary widely in composition with 0.5 ≤ Cu/S ≤ 2, including numerous non-stoichiometric compounds.|$|E
50|$|Fukuchilite, Cu3FeS8, is {{a copper}} iron sulfide {{named after the}} Japanese {{mineralogist}} Nobuyo Fukuchi (1877-1934), that occurs in ore bodies of gypsum-anhydrite at the intersection points of small masses of barite, <b>covellite,</b> gypsum and pyrite, and is mostly found in the Hanawa mine in the Akita prefecture of Honshū, Japan where it was first discovered in 1969. It occurs in masses within the third geologic unit of the Kuroko type deposits within the mine.|$|E
