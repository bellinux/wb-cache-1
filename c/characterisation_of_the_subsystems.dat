It is found that (i) the larger the anisotropic parameter γ, the bigger <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> maintaining <b>the</b> initial state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two qubits; (ii) with increasing temperature T, the bath plays a more strong destroy effect on <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subsystem,</b> so does <b>the</b> interaction g_ 0 between <b>the</b> <b>subsystem</b> and <b>the</b> bath; (iii) <b>the</b> time evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subsystem</b> {{is dependent on the}} initial state. <b>The</b> revival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concurrence does not always means <b>the</b> restore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state.

40|$|Purpose: The {{accountant}} {{has been}} characterised {{in popular culture}} as dull and boring. Accounting scholarship consistently describes this stereotype as negative. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this research is to enhance our understanding of this stereotype by comparing <b>the</b> <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accountant found in contemporary jokes with a similar characterisation found in commedia dell'arte, which {{is a form of}} improvisational theatre. Design/methodology/approach: This research employs netnography to identify <b>the</b> stereotype <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accountant portrayed in jokes on social networking sites. To enrich our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stereotype <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accountant in contemporary jokes, it is compared with <b>the</b> <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> il dottore, <b>the</b> stock character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professional man in commedia dell'arte. Findings: <b>The</b> <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accountant in contemporary jokes is consistent with <b>characterisations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accountant in other areas of popular culture, confirming that the stereotype is widely entrenched in popular culture. Contemporary jokes provide a more detailed characterisation than previously identified in accounting scholarship. Since <b>the</b> stereotype <b>of</b> il dottore in commedia dell'arte resembles <b>the</b> stereotype <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accountant as portrayed in contemporary jokes, studying commedia dell'arte provides an approach that enhances our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accountant in popular culture. Originality/value: <b>The</b> contribution <b>of</b> this research to accounting scholarship is <b>the</b> deployment <b>of</b> commedia dell'arte to capture <b>the</b> essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stereotype <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accountant as portrayed in popular culture.

The motivation for this work is large-scale telecommunications networks. The time to failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subsystem</b> hardware is modeled by an appropriate Markov process and is hence a phase-type distribution. The network structure defines a failure rule in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subsystems,</b> allowing computation by Monte Carlo simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time to failure distribution for the network. This is illustrated by some simple examples.
