50|$|The {{body of the}} mummichog is {{elongate}} but thick, with a deep caudal peduncle. Usual {{length is}} 7.5 to 9 cm but maximum lengths of 13 to 15 cm are possible. The mouth is upturned and the lower jaw protrudes when the mouth is closed. Pectoral and tail fins are round. Mummichogs have 10-13 dorsal fin rays, 9-12 anal fin rays, 16-20 pectoral fin rays. Males have larger dorsal and anal fins than females. There is no lateral line on the body, but lateral line pores are present on the head. The colour is variable (and may even <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>shade</b> within the same individual when placed near different backgrounds) but is generally olive-brown or olive-green. There can be vertical bars on the sides that are thin, wavy, and silvery. Colors are more intense in males during the reproductive season, as they become dark olive-green on the back, steel-blue on the sides with about 15 silvery bars, and yellow or orange-yellow on the underside; the dorsal fin is mottled and a small eyespot may be present near the rear edge. Females tend to be paler, without bars or the intense yellow on the belly, and their dorsal fin is uniformly coloured.|$|E
40|$|Purpose:  A {{number of}} {{provisional}} restorative materials {{exist on the}} market. This study tested marginal fit and color stability of three provisional restorative materials and a control. Materials and Methods:  Two auto-cure materials, Protemp Garant and Integrity, and one dual-cure material, Luxatemp Solar, were tested against SNAP, a polyethyl methacrylate control. A maxillary right central incisor ivorine tooth was prepared for a full coverage all-ceramic crown, with a 1. 5 -mm chamfer margin. Four points were engraved at a point 1 mm below the facial, lingual, mesial, and distal margins, and replicas (n = 40) were produced by the manufacturer. Provisional crowns (n = 10 × 4) were fabricated on the individual replicas using a polyethylene coping template. The crowns were trimmed under magnification using an acrylic bur. The distance from the crown margins to a point tangent to the engraved markings was measured under 10 × magnification and recorded. For color stability, 10 -mm diameter × 2 -mm thick discs (n = 10 × 4) were fabricated and immersed cyclically in tea for 1 week in a Tucillo/Nielson apparatus. Color measurements were recorded for each specimen at baseline and after staining. ΔE values were calculated {{to determine the extent}} of the color change. Results:  The means of the four marginal discrepancy measurements for each specimen were analyzed using a 1 -way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc comparison. Luxatemp Solar had statistically significant marginal discrepancy (319 Μm, p < 0. 05) when compared to the other provisional materials. A significant color change (ΔE = 4. 33, p < 0. 05) was found for Protemp Garant. Conclusion:  The dual-cure temporary material (Luxatemp Solar) exhibited significantly more discrepancy at the margin than the auto-cure bis-acryl materials or acrylic control. Protemp Garant exhibited a clinically noticeable <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>shade</b> after 1 week in staining solution, whereas the other materials did not exhibit a clinically noticeable change. Clinical Implications:  Provisional crowns fabricated from SNAP, Protemp Garant, and Integrity exhibited similarly low marginal discrepancy. SNAP, Luxatemp Solar, and Integrity did not demonstrate a clinically detectable <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>shade</b> after 1 week in a staining solution...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a novel idea {{of using}} ozone {{oxidation}} {{at the end of}} reactive dyeing process was explored in order to achieve zero discharge dyeing. An advanced oxidative treatment was given during the dyeing process to remove unfixed and hydrolyzed reactive dyes from cotton substrate. Three different shades were dyed using vinylsulphone reactive class of dyes. At the end of fixation step, washing of fabrics was carried out using appropriate quantities of ozone in the process. Ozone oxidation continued until the liquor was decolorized around 95 - 100 % and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) was reduced about 80 - 90 %, thus achieving zero liquid discharge dyeing process. The decolouration efficiency of wastewater was regarded as an indicative of removal of dyes from the textile materials because fabric was being washed continuously in the same liquor. Fabric samples dyed with conventional and new methods were compared in terms of <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>shade,</b> colourfastness properties, colour stripping, and fabric appearance. Overall results showed that the use of ozone during reactive dyeing can result in less water consumption, reduced process time, and zero discharge of coloured effluents from textile dyeing factories...|$|E

Many distinct features, such as light intensity and light quality, <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>shade</b> habitats, because of neighbouring vegetation, increased far-red (FR) light, reduced blue (B) and red light (R) and decreasing photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), and these have a direct effect on photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis. In apricot cultivar populations, a wide range of growth habit ideotypes are revised: from upright, standard, to open and spreading. To ascertain if the modified light quality surrounding the plant affects photosynthetic activity and habit development of four cultivars, potted plants were grown in dense-community canopies and in an open-clearing habitat. The assimilation rate differed between genotypes and was also influenced strongly by the proximity signal generated by neighbouring plants inside the canopies. Based on the observed results, all genotypes showed a strong plasticity adaptation to the open-clearing and dense-community growth habitats. Individual genotypes differ from each other in their capacity to adapt their photosynthetic system and morphological growth traits under community-canopy conditions, in relation to their intrinsic fitness strategy in shade habitats...|$|E

Methods: We selected 60 patients with central incisors A 2 or darker: 30 smokers (experimental group) and 30 nonsmokers (control group). The bleaching was carried out with 10 % carbamide peroxide for {{three hours a day}} for three weeks. The color was evaluated using a shade guide, Vita Bleachedguide 3 D-Master, at baseline, during bleaching (first, second, and third weeks), and one week and one month after bleaching. Smears were obtained with a moistened wooden spatula from marginal gingiva. All the cytologic smears were stained with Giemsa solution. From each slide, 1000 cells were examined under 403 magnification and where micronuclei (MN) were located, they were examined under 1003 magnification. The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>shade</b> guide units at the different assessment periods and the frequency of MN were subjected to a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey test (alpha= 0. 05).

40|$|Diketodiphenylpyrrolopyrroles (DPP) are industrially {{important}} red pigments. The title compound (DPPP) is a dipyridyl derivative that {{possesses a}} high proton affinity {{because of the}} N atoms of the pyridyl ring. A drastic <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>shade</b> as well as electrical conductivities by several orders of magnitude is observed due to protonation at the N-atom. Therefore, DPPP has newly attracted attention as a material for H- 2 gas sensors. Then, we noticed {{that there are two}} crystal phases: one is quite sensitive to protons (phase I grown from the vapor phase) while the other is rather resistant to protonation (phase II recrystallized from solution). Therefore, structure analysis has been carried out in the present investigation in order to clarify the correlation between the structure and proton affinity. A striking difference is recognized in intermolecular hydrogen bonds between two phases: phase I is characterized only by (NHO) -O- [...] . hydrogen bonds where two N atoms of the pyridyl rings remain free. On the other hand, phase II includes two types of the H-bond based on (NHO) -O- [...] . and (NHN) -N- [...] . where the one N atom of the pyridyl ring is used by (NHN) -N- [...] . hydrogen bond and the other remains unused (i. e. free). Therefore, phase I is found to correspond to the phase which exhibits a high proton affinity while phase II is the one which is rather inactive for protons. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{qualitative}} shape recovery from moving surfaces. Our analysis is unique in that we consider specular interreflections and explore the effects of both motion parallax and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>shading.</b> To study this situation we define an image flow field called the reflection flow field, which describes the motion of reflection points and the motion of the surface. From a kinematic analysis, we show that the reflection flow is qualitatively different from the motion parallax because it is discontinuous at or near parabolic curves. We also show that when the gradient of the reflected image is strong, gradientbased flow measurement techniques approximate the reflection flow field and not the motion parallax. We conclude from these analyses that reliable qualitative shape information is generally available only at discontinuities in the image flow field. 1 Introduction We consider the qualitative shape recovery problem for a moving specular surface surrounded by multiple o [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Colorization is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a computerized process for adding color to black and white pictures, movies or TV programs.

During colorization process a scalar value representing pixel's intensity is being replaced by a vector in a given color space. Since the mapping between intensity and color has no inherently correct solution, human interaction and external information usually plays a large role. In this paper we present a novel colorization method based on the morphological distance transformation which considers the image structures to automatically propagate the color inserted into the image by a user.

We compared the bird diversity and community structure in organic cacao farms and nearby forest fragments throughout mainland Bocas del Toro, Panama. We used this dataset to ask the following questions: (1) How do bird communities using cacao habitat compare to communities of nearby forest fragments? (2) To what extent do Northern migratory birds use shaded cacao farms, and do communities of resident birds shift their abundances in cacao farms seasonally?

40|$|Although shade {{tolerance}} {{is often}} {{assumed to be}} a fixed trait, recent work suggests ontogenetic <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the light requirements of tree species. We determined the influence of gas exchange, biomass distribution, and self-shading on ontogenetic variation in the instantaneous aboveground carbon balance of Acer saccharum. We quantified the aboveground biomass distributions of 18 juveniles varying in height and growing in low light in a temperate forest understory in Minnesota, USA. Gas exchange rates of leaf and stem tissues were measured, and the crown architecture of each individual was quantified. The YPLANT program was used to estimate the self-shaded fraction of each crown and to model net leaf-level carbon gain. Leaf respiration and photosynthesis per gram of leaf tissue increased with plant size. In contrast, stem respiration rates per gram of stem tissue declined, reflecting a shift in the distribution of stem diameter sizes from smaller (with higher respiration) to larger diameter classes. However, these trends were outweighed by ontogenetic increases in self-shading (which reduces the net photosynthesis realized) and stem mass fraction (which increases the proportion of purely respiratory tissue) in terms of influence on net carbon exchange. As a result, net carbon gain per gram of aboveground plant tissue declined with increasing plant size, and the instantaneous aboveground light compensation point increased. When estimates of root respiration were included to model whole-plant carbon gain and light compensation points, relationships with plant size were even more pronounced. Our findings show how an interplay of gas exchange, self-shading, and biomass distribution shapes ontogenetic <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>shade</b> tolerance. 11 page(s...|$|R

The technology of LED units promises longer lifetime, without heating and with production of specific light for activation of camphorquinone. However, further studies are still required {{to check the}} real curing effectiveness of these units. Purpose: This study evaluated the microhardness of 4 shades (B- 0. 5, B- 1, B- 2 and B- 3) of composite resin Filtek Z- 250 (3 M ESPE) after light curing with 4 light sources, being one halogen (Ultralux - Dabi Atlante) and three LED (Ultraled - Dabi Atlante, Ultrablue - DMC and Elipar Freelight - 3 M ESPE). Methods: 192 specimens were distributed into 16 groups, and materials were inserted in a single increment in cylindrical templates measuring 4 mm x 4 mm and light cured as recommended by the manufacturer. Then, they were submitted to microhardness test {{on the top and}} bottom aspects of the cylinders. Results: The hardness values achieved were submitted to analysis of variance and to Tukey test at 5 % confidence level. It was observed that microhardness of specimens varied according to the shade of the material and light sources employed. The LED appliance emitting greater light intensity provided the highest hardness values with shade B- 0. 5, allowing the best curing. On the other hand, appliances with low light intensity were the least effective. It was also observed that the bottom of specimens was more sensitive to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>shade.</b> Conclusion: Light intensity of LED light curing units is fundamental for their good functioning, especially when applied in resins with darker shades...|$|R

The sun normal plane was employed as there are some activities that have exposures to {{parts of the body}} that are orientated in a sun normal plane. The horizontal plane shade ratios for the medium density canopy dropped by 47 % - 56 % from the ratios in the range 301 to 310 nm to the ratios in the range 391 to 400 nm. In absolute terms, the largest <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the <b>shade</b> ratio of 0. 28 was for the centre and edge sites compared to 0. 07 for the trunk. Similarly, for the sun normal plane, the ratio dropped by 40 % - 49 % with an absolute reduction of 0. 19 for the edge and 0. 04 for the trunk. For the sparse density canopy, the decrease <b>in</b> the <b>shade</b> ratios over the same wavelength range were a drop by 37 % - 42 % on a horizontal plane, or in absolute terms, a reduction by 0. 22 for the edge and 0. 13 for the trunk. Similarly, the decrease was 34 - 39 % on the sun normal plane, or in absolute terms, a reduction by 0. 19 for the edge and 0. 12 for the trunk...|$|R
40|$|Shade needles {{of hybrid}} larch (Larix decidua × leptolepis) {{had the same}} rates of {{photosynthesis}} as sun needles per dry weight and nitrogen, and a similar leaf conductance under conditions of light saturation at ambient CO 2 (Amax). However, on an area basis, Amax and specific leaf weight were lower <b>in</b> <b>shade</b> than <b>in</b> sun needles. Stomata of sun needles limited CO 2 uptake at light saturation by about 20 %, but under natural conditions of light <b>in</b> the <b>shade</b> crown, <b>shade</b> needles operated <b>in</b> a range of saturating internal CO 2 without stomatal limitation of CO 2 uptake. In both needle types, stomata responded similarly to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> light, but <b>shade</b> needles were more sensitive to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> vapor pressure deficit than sun needles. Despite a high photosynthetic capacity, the ambient light conditions reduced the mean daily (in summer) and annual carbon gain of shade needles to less than 50 % of that in sun needles. In sun needles, the transpiration per carbon gain was about 220 mol mol– 1 on an annual basis. The carbon budget of branches was determined from the photosynthetic rate, the needle biomass and respiration, the latter of which was (per growth and on a carbon basis) 1. 6 mol mol– 1 year– 1 in branch and stem wood. <b>In</b> <b>shade</b> branches carbon gains exceeded carbon costs (growth + respiration) by only a factor of 1. 6 compared with 3. 5 in sun branches. The carbon balance of sun branches was 5 times higher per needle biomass of a branch or 9 times higher on a branch length basis than shade branches. The shade foliage (including the shaded near-stem sun foliage) only contributed approximately 23 % to the total annual carbon gain of the tree...|$|R
