2500|$|Acetaldehyde is an {{irritant}} of the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, throat, {{and respiratory}} tract. This occurs at concentrations up to 1000 ppm. Symptoms {{of exposure to}} this compound include nausea, vomiting, and headache. These symptoms may not happen immediately. The perception threshold for acetaldehyde in air is in the range between 0.07 and 0.25 ppm. [...] At such concentrations, the fruity odor of acetaldehyde is apparent. Conjunctival irritations have been observed after a 15-minute exposure to concentrations of 25 and 50 ppm, but transient conjunctivitis and irritation of the respiratory tract have been reported after exposure to 200 ppm acetaldehyde for 15 minutes. It has a general narcotic action and large doses can even cause death by respiratory paralysis. It may also cause drowsiness, delirium, hallucinations, and loss of intelligence.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hundreds of {{millions}} of people of all ages suffer from <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> which include asthma and <b>respiratory</b> allergies, <b>chronic</b> obstructive pulmonary disease, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension. More than 500 million patients live in developing countries or in deprived populations. <b>Chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> are increasing in prevalence. Although the cost of inaction is clear and unacceptable, <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> and their risk factors receive insufficient attention from the healthcare community, government officials, media, patients and families. The Fifty-Third World Health Assembly recognised the enormous human suffering caused by chronic diseases and requested the World Health Organization (WHO) Director General to give priority to the prevention and control of chronic diseases, with special emphasis on developing countries. This {{led to the formation of}} the WHO Global Alliance against <b>Chronic</b> <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Diseases</b> (GARD). GARD is a voluntary alliance of organisations, institutions and agencies working towards a common vision to improve global lung health according to local needs. GARD is developed in a stepwise approach using the following three planning steps: estimate population need and advocate action; formulate and adopt policy; and identify policy implementation steps...|$|R

Aim: To validate the Spanish version of the <b>Chronic</b> <b>Respiratory</b> Questionnaire (CRQ) {{to be used in}} Chilean population.

The Internal Consistency analysis showed a Cronbach a between 0. 60 and 0. 89.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the epidemiological situation regarding <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> in populations that inhabit different climaticâgeographical regions of Russia, and to develop targeted programs for prevention of these diseases. Methods: (1) a comparative analysis of the standardized mortality data in Russia and other selected regions of the Russian North using the European standard for <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases,</b> in a population aged 25 â 64; and (2) data from a randomized cross-sectional epidemiological study, with subjects from three different climatic-geographical regions of Russia. Results: (1) the respiratory disease-related mortality rates in the majority of Russian Northern regions were much higher compared to the national average. Although death rates from <b>chronic</b> lower <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> were higher among the Northern regions and in the whole of Russia relative to the countries of European Union (EU), the cause of death in the populations of the Northern regions tend to be lower respiratory infections and pneumonia; and (2) despite the absence of any significant differences in the prevalence of smoking, the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> (COPD) is significantly higher in Far North Yakutsk compared to the other two regions in this studyâChelyabinsk and Vologda.

40|$|The {{management}} {{of patients with}} <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> affected by difficult to treat infections {{has become a challenge}} in clinical practice. Conditions such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis require extensive treatment strategies to deal with multidrug resistant pathogens that include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia species and non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM). These challenges prompted scientists to deliver antimicrobial agents through the pulmonary system by using inhaled, aerosolized or nebulized antibiotics. Subsequent research advances focused on the development of antibiotic agents able to achieve high tissue concentrations capable of reducing the bacterial load of difficult-to-treat organisms in hosts with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> conditions. In this review, we focus on the evidence regarding the use of antibiotic therapies administered through the respiratory system via inhalation, nebulization or aerosolization, specifically in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> that include CF, non-CF bronchiectasis and NTM.

It is therefore necessary to measure each individualâs required amount of energy in order to provide nutritional support. There are few reports regarding the RMR of patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> that have used indirect calorimetry. We investigated the association between body composition, pulmonary function, and dyspnea grade by measuring RMR using indirect calorimetry in 23 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ï¼COPDï¼ and 21 patients with interstitial pneumonia ï¼IPï¼. We found no increase in RMR in COPD patients without any decrease in weight or muscle mass and increase in RMR in IP patients. Fat mass was suggested to influence RMR in IP patients. Early nutritional support for COPD patients in whom no reduction in body weight or muscle mass is seen may possibly prevent RMR enhancement and malnutrition.

Effective vaccines could reduce the burden of respiratory infections and acute exacerbations in COPD patients, {{but what is the}} evidence for this? This article reviews and discusses the existing evidence for pneumococcal vaccination efficacy and its changing role in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases,</b> especially COPD. Specifically, the recent Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPITA) showed the efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in older adults, many of whom had additional risk factors for pneumococcal disease, including chronic lung diseases. Taken together, the evidence suggests that pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations can prevent community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations in COPD patients, while pneumococcal vaccination early in the course of COPD could help maintain stable health status. Despite the need to prevent pulmonary infections in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> and evidence for the efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine coverage and awareness are low and need to be improved.
