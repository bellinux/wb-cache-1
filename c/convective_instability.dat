5|$|The {{hurricane}} strengthened slightly {{further to}} a peak intensity of 80mph (130km/h) by 00:00UTC on September 2. At around 05:30UTC (1:30a.m.EDT) that day, Hermine made landfall {{just east of}} St. Marks, Florida, at peak intensity, with a minimum pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 29.00inHg). Hermine became the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma on October 24, 2005. Within four hours of landfall, the winds dropped below hurricane force as the appearance on radar imagery degraded. The convection diminished while Hermine crossed into Georgia, with the strongest winds near the Atlantic coast. The center elongated as it continued quickly northeastward ahead of the trough. With the convection {{far ahead of the}} circulation, Hermine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 12:00UTC on September3 as it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Dry air wrapped into the eastward-moving center, while convection pulsed north of the former hurricane, possibly due to the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. By September5, the system devolved into several rotating circulations as the overall system slowed and turned to the northwest, steered by a ridge to the north. The convection began waning on the next day, as the storm turned due westward. At 18:00UTC on September6, the NHC ceased issuing advisories on the post-tropical cyclone as Hermine continued to weaken, due to cooler waters and <b>convective</b> <b>instability.</b> The remnants continued to meander offshore New Jersey and Long Island, until dissipating near Chatham, Massachusetts, late on September8.|$|E

50|$|A {{good example}} of <b>convective</b> <b>instability</b> {{can be found in}} our own atmosphere. If dry mid-level air is drawn over very warm, moist air in the lower troposphere, a hydrolapse (an area of rapidly {{decreasing}} dew point temperatures with height) results in the region where the moist boundary layer and mid-level air meet. As daytime heating increases mixing within the moist boundary layer, some of the moist air will begin to interact with the dry mid-level air above it. Owing to thermodynamic processes, as the dry mid-level air is slowly saturated its temperature begins to drop, increasing the adiabatic lapse rate. Under certain conditions, the lapse rate can increase significantly in a short amount of time, resulting in convection. High <b>convective</b> <b>instability</b> can lead to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes as moist air which is trapped in the boundary layer eventually becomes highly negatively buoyant relative to the adiabatic lapse rate and escapes as a rapidly rising bubble of humid air triggering the development of a cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud.|$|E

40|$|In rapidly {{rotating}} convective stars, {{the effect}} of Coriolis forces is predominant and the dynamics of <b>convective</b> <b>instabilities</b> is fundamentally different from that in slowly rotating stars. Coriolis forces not only enforce two-dimensionality of the fluid motions driven by <b>convective</b> <b>instabilities</b> but also generate strong differential rotation even {{in the vicinity of}} the onset of the instabilities. This characteristic suggests a quasi-geostrophic approximation taking advantage of quasi two-dimensionality of the fluid motions. We investigate <b>convective</b> <b>instabilities</b> and differential rotation generated by the instabilities in rapidly rotating stars using a new quasi-geostrophic approximation incorporating full spherical geometry and the equation of mass conservation. We model a rapidly rotating stellar convection zone of inner radius r(i) and outer radius r(o) by a large-gap spherical annulus defined by s(i) <= s <= s(o) and -(r(o) (2) - s(2)) (1 / 2) <= z <= (r(o) (2) -s(2)) (1 / 2), where (s, phi, z) are cylindrical polar coordinates with the axis of rotation at s = 0 and r(i) = s(i) < s(o) approximate to r(o). In the limits si ! 0 and so ! ro, the corresponding spherical annulus represents a fully convective rapidly rotating star in the full sphere. For the purpose of comparison, fully three-dimensional solutions in spherical geometry are also calculated. It is demonstrated that the primary features of the <b>convective</b> <b>instabilities</b> in rapidly rotating spheres or spherical shells are quantitatively captured by large-gap spherical annuli using the new quasi-geostrophic approximation, providing an exciting opportunity to analyze and compute convective flows in rapidly rotating stars (very small Ekman numbers), which cannot be achieved by fully three-dimensional numerical simulations. Implications of the results for several rapidly rotating stars are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|In meteorology, <b>convective</b> <b>in{{stability}}</b> or {{stability of}} an air mass refers to its ability to resist vertical motion. A stable atmosphere makes vertical movement difficult, and small vertical disturbances dampen out and disappear. In an unstable atmosphere, vertical air movements (such as in orographic lifting, where an air mass is displaced upwards as it is blown by wind up the rising slope of a mountain range) tend to become larger, resulting in turbulent airflow and convective activity. Instability can lead to significant turbulence, extensive vertical clouds, and severe weather such as thunderstorms.|$|E

The Peregrine soliton, a specific breather solution, has attracted attention as a possible type of rogue wave that may have significance in optics and hydrodynamics, and this solution has been observed experimentally in both contexts.

50|$|There are {{factors that}} can affect pattern {{formation}}. Changes in pattern formation are not homogeneous and {{can be caused by}} several factors. Different types of dye in solution will give the same pattern because of the bond's formation and the dynamics remain the same, this is because the solution has the same colour as the dye.

Different amounts of dye can bring in different amounts of convention cell which are also formed by different amounts of glucose and oxidized product. This can result in an interesting spatial phenomena. Time can also affect pattern formation. As the time passed, one pattern gradually faded away. Spirals and branches started to disappear and eventually disappeared fully. These facts indicate that oxygen affects the chemical reaction and this plays a fundamental role in the pattern formation.
