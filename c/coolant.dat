5|$|A <b>coolant</b> {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber <b>coolant</b> bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle <b>coolant</b> loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber <b>coolant</b> valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery <b>coolant</b> system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery <b>coolant</b> system to monitor <b>coolant</b> levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} the battery <b>coolant</b> reservoir to help prevent potential <b>coolant</b> overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and <b>coolant</b> jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set.

The variation of the surface and near surface composition of samples machined either dry or with <b>coolants</b> was negligible after cleaning. The use of such <b>coolants</b> in the machining process is therefore recommended...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Grinding <b>coolants</b> {{have the}} {{functions}} of cooling, lubrication, cleaning and rust prevention in grinding process. To avoid the environment pollution, we should develop environmental protection grinding <b>coolants.</b> So {{it is important to}} research the performance evaluation for grinding <b>coolants.</b> In this paper, three different test methods for grinding performance evaluation of grinding <b>coolants</b> are used to investigate the influence of three <b>coolants</b> on grinding process. The three test methods are four balls test, tapping torque test and real grinding test. The test results showed that the mechanism of four balls test is simple, and the test results have good repeatability, but there is a large divagation with real grinding test results. The tapping torque test has a good relativity with cutting process. The real grinding test is the best test method for grinding performance evaluation...|$|R

5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} production reactor with water cooling. The choice of water as a <b>coolant</b> was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a <b>coolant</b> would delay the project.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Water vapor is a good, pollution-free and {{economical}} <b>coolants</b> and lubricants in green machining. In order {{to research the}} cutting temperature distributions with water vapor as <b>coolants</b> and lubricants in machining, the experiments conducted under the conditions of water vapor as <b>coolants</b> and lubricants and dry cutting. The cutting temperatures are studied by metal cutting theory, and then by employing the finite element method (FEM), the temperature distribution of cutting region is simulated with application of water vapor as <b>coolants</b> and lubricants and dry cutting conditions. The {{results show that the}} water vapor jet flow has high force-convection heat transfer coefficient and directly cooling action to reduce cutting temperature, and the stress, the length of tool-chip interface are reduced with application of water vapor lubrication. So that the cutting thermal is decreased and water vapor has indirect cooling action. Under the conditions of indirect and direct cooling action, the cutting temperature is reduced obviously with application of water vapor as <b>coolants</b> and lubricants...|$|R

50|$|Before the Brazilian race, the FOCA teams found a {{loophole}} in the weighing procedure {{used at the}} races. The rules stated a car would be weighed with all <b>coolants</b> and lubricants on board, and said nothing about whether those <b>coolants</b> and lubricants needed {{to be in the}} car when the race finished. The FOCA teams claimed this meant that all <b>coolants</b> and lubricants could be 'topped up' after the race. This practice was illegal in all other forms of FIA racing, but was not explicitly banned in Formula One.|$|R
5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, <b>coolant,</b> moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the <b>coolant</b> may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, <b>coolant,</b> and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E

5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the <b>coolant</b> of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary <b>coolant</b> system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary <b>coolant</b> piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a <b>coolant</b> (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway.

40|$|Modern furnace designs often {{incorporate}} {{extensive use}} of cooled elements to achieve long campaign lives at high operating intensities. However, contact between water and high temperature fluids can result in powerful Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (BLEVEs). Therefore cooling such elements with water carries inherent risks when used under slag and particularly below molten metal or matte. Alternative cooling media exist that can reduce or eliminate the risk of BLEVEs. These media are analysed and discussed {{in the context of}} deeply cooled furnace elements. Important factors in selecting alternative <b>coolants</b> are explored including: critical heat flux, thermal limits, toxicity, flammability, unit cost, etc. Key cooling system design criteria are reviewed in the context of both traditional and alternative <b>coolants.</b> Results of Computational Fluid Dynamics are presented for an example tap-block cooler design using a number of selected <b>coolants.</b> Research needs to advance the safe use of alternative <b>coolants</b> are presented...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber <b>coolant</b> valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber <b>coolant</b> valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} of what <b>coolant</b> to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, {{because it could}} be both a <b>coolant</b> and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, {{and it would have}} to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{nuclear reactor}} design has, in recent years, focused {{increasingly}} {{on the use}} of heavy-liquid-metal <b>coolants,</b> such as lead and lead-bismuth eutectic.

Of significant concern is the compatibility of structural materials with these <b>coolants.</b> We have used a thermal convection-based test method to allow exposure of candidate materials to molten lead and lead-bismuth flowing under a temperature gradient. The gradient was deemed essential in evaluating the behavior of the test materials in that should preferential dissolution of components of the test material occur we would expect dissolution in the hotter regions and deposition in the colder regions, thus promoting material transport. Results from the interactions of a Si-rich mild steel alloy, AISI S 5, and a ferritic-martensitic stainless steel, HT- 9, with the molten lead-bismuth are presented...|$|R
