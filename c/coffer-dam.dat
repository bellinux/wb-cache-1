On 1 September 1837 work started on building a 920-foot long <b>coffer-dam</b> to enclose the building site along the river. The construction of the embankment started on New Year's Day 1839. The first work consisted of the construction of a vast concrete-raft to serve as the building's foundation. After the foundations had been dug by hand, 70,000 cubic yards of concrete were laid. The site of the Victoria Tower was found to be of Quicksand, necessitating the use of piles.

60|$|As fortune {{would have}} it, Neale {{happened}} on the moment to be standing in a significant and thrilling position, for himself and for all who saw him. And that {{happened to be in}} the middle of the stream opposite the trestle on the masonry of the middle pier, now two feet above the <b>coffer-dam.</b> He was as wet and muddy as the laborers with him.|$|E
60|$|Then came two fine days when, {{although}} the sun shone, heavy clouds rolled about the hills. Jim, knowing the fine weather would not last, drove his men hard, {{since there was}} work he must push forward before the next flood. The new bank had reached a creek where he must build a strong sluice-gate and hold back the water by a rude <b>coffer-dam</b> while he dug for the foundation.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} {{involved the}} use of troops from the 1st and 4th battalions of the Madras Pioneers as well as Portuguese carpenters from Cochin who were employed {{in the construction of}} the <b>coffer-dams</b> and other structures. The greatest challenge was the diversion of the river so that lower portions of the great dam could be built. The temporary embankments and <b>coffer-dams</b> used to restrain the river waters were regularly swept away by floods and rains. Due to the coffer dam failures, the British stopped funding the project. Officer Pennycuick raised funds by selling his wife's jewelry to continue the work. In Madurai, Major Pennycuick's statue has been installed at the state PWD office and his photographs are found adorning walls in peoples homes and shops. In 2002, his great grandson was honoured in Madurai, a function that was attended by thousands of people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{drew the}} {{original}} plans for Number Ten. They had not followed them. To be exact, {{they did not}} drive piles to hold the cribbings for the piers. They did not go deep enough. They sank shafts, they built <b>coffer-dams,</b> they put in piers over and over again. There was forty feet of quicksand under all their work {{and of course it}} slipped and sank." ...|$|R
40|$|The Thames Barrier {{is one of}} {{the largest}} civil {{engineering}} schemes built in England. It was necessary because of the increasing landward migration of the tidal effect due to eustatic rise and the relative land/sea level changes due to the subsidence of the North Sea area, resulting mainly from post-glacial isostatic effects. This meant hat up to 116 km 2 of London could be flooded under a high surge tide. The nine piers and two abutments were built in <b>coffer-dams.</b> Construction began in 1975 and was completed in 1982...|$|R
60|$|A shallow {{stream of}} muddy water came murmuring {{down from the}} hills. It covered the wide bed that Neale remembered had been a dry, sand-and-gravel waste. On each side the {{abutment}} piers had been undermined and washed out. Not a stone remained in sight. The banks were hollowed inward and shafts of heavy boards were sliding down. In {{the middle of the}} stream stood a <b>coffer-dam</b> in course of building, and near it another that had collapsed. These frameworks almost hid the tip of the middle pier, which had evidently slid over and was sinking on its side. There was no telling what had been sunk in that hole. All the surroundings--the tons of stone, cut and uncut, the piles of muddy lumber, the platforms and rafts, the crevices in the worn shores up and down both sides--all attested to the long weeks of fruitless labor and to the engulfing mystery of that shallow, murmuring stream.|$|E
6000|$|I observed, however, {{that one}} of them held {{somewhat}} aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a <b>coffer-dam.</b> I have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favorite with them, they raised a cry of [...] "Bulkington! Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" [...] and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.|$|E

6000|$|Upon {{investigation}} Neale found that, {{although many}} cribbings had been sunk for the piers, {{they had never}} been put deep enough. And there were <b>coffer-dams</b> that did not dam at all--useless, senseless wastes of time and material, not to say wages. His plans called for fifty thirty-foot piles driven to bedrock, which, according to the excavations he had had made at the time of survey, was forty feet below the surface. Not a pile had been driven! There had been no solid base for any of the cribbings! No foundations for the piers! ...|$|R
60|$|Next morning, {{bright and}} early, Neale {{went down to}} the river to make his close {{inspection}} of what had been done toward building Number Ten. From Colohan he ascertained the number of shafts and <b>coffer-dams</b> sunk; from the masons he learned the amount of stone cut to patterns. And he was not only amazed and astounded, but overwhelmed, and incensed beyond expression. The labor had been prodigious. Hundreds of tons of material had been sunk there; and that meant that {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} also had been sunk.|$|R
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of devastating hurricanes and heavy seas made it imperative {{that the structure}} be unusually strong. First, {{the positions of the}} piers were charted under Coe’s direction; then dredgers scooped the sand from the seas bed, exposing the coral rock necessary for foundations. Next, tugs towed up <b>coffer-dams,</b> huge steel cylinders, which were lowered over the dredged positions. Floating pile-drivers then drove steel-pointed piles into the coral rock until they were securely fixed. Through this method of working there was less risk of the piles slipping owing to shifting of rock, for the constructors were able to determine if the rock was solid or unstable and crumbling.|$|R
50|$|On 30 November 1945 a storm {{smashed the}} Outarde against the Consul-Hall Coal Dock at Clayton, New York. A <b>coffer-dam</b> {{needed to be}} erected to salvage the vessel, and clear the {{approach}} to the dock. Salvage took over four months, and repairs to return to service were not completed until June 1946.|$|E
50|$|Matthews went on {{to design}} over a dozen lighthouses for Trinity House. He also worked on {{illumination}} systems, notably a lamp designed to burn oil vapour. Matthews' most significant achievement was the construction of Beachy Head Lighthouse. Completed in 1902, {{it was the last}} rock lighthouse built by Trinity House. The work took two years to finish; it involved building a <b>coffer-dam</b> and an aerial ropeway from the cliffs to transport materials.|$|E
5000|$|Operations for {{removing}} the reef at Hallett's Point were begun in August, 1869. A <b>coffer-dam</b> was built of timber, securely {{fastened to the}} rocks by bolts passing through the framework. The <b>coffer-dam</b> was pumped out about the middle of October; and operations on the interior for sinking the shaft were begun early in November, and continued till the middle of June, 1870, when work was suspended {{on account of the}} funds appropriated for this part of the work being exhausted. At that time four hundred and eighty-four cubic yards of rock had been taken out, at a cost. of $5.75 per yard. In the latter part of July operations were resumed and, during that fiscal year, the shaft was sunk to the required depth of thirty-three feet below mean low water, and the heads of the ten tunnels opened to distances varying from fifty-one to one hundred and twenty-six feet. Two of the cross-galleries had also been opened. The amount of rock excavated from this place that year was 8,306 cubic yards, and the drilling was all done by hand. During the next year the use of steam-drills partially succeeded hand-drilling, and the work was pushed more rapidly. The number of feet of tunnel driven during the year was 1,653, and of transverse galleries 653.75. The quantity of rock removed was 8,293 cubic yards. A ground-plan of the work herewith gives an excellent idea of the excavation as completed. An exceedingly well-executed model of the works was exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. It is made exactly to scale, and well represents {{the nature and extent of}} the vast operations that have now been successfully completed.|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms of the {{parallel}} structure, possessing {{six degrees of}} mobility with three and two kinetic joint chains are investigated in the paper aiming at the development of algorithms of the kinetic and dynamic analysis of mechanisms of {{the parallel}} structura with elastic elements and kinetic pairs, made {{in the form of}} <b>coffer-dams</b> of the lowered rigidity. Parameters of mechanisms and a form of a side surface of elastic pairs have been optimized. Two new mechanisms of the parallel structure with the optimum combination of parameters have been synthesized. Algorithms for the modelling of working zones without singular positions have been developed. Elasticity of units in problems of the dynamic analysis has been taken into consideration. The application package for the two-criterial optimization synthesis, dynamic analysis and calculation of the stressed-deformed state of elastic kinetic pairs has been developed. The mechanisms suggested are recommended for the use in enterprises of electronics, aviation industry, etcAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
50|$|Unlike British carriers, whose {{aviation}} fuel was stored in separate cylinders or <b>coffer-dams</b> surrounded by seawater, all pre-war Japanese carriers had their {{aviation fuel}} tanks built integral with the ship's hull and Shōkaku was no exception. The dangers this posed, however, {{did not become}} evident until wartime experience demonstrated these were often prone to cracking and leaking as the shocks and stresses of hits or near-misses to the carrier's hull were inevitably transferred to and absorbed by the fuel tanks. Following the debacle at Midway in mid-1942, the empty air spaces around Shōkakus aviation fuel tanks, normally pumped full of inert carbon dioxide, were instead filled with concrete {{in an attempt to}} protect them from possible damage. But this did little to prevent volatile fumes spreading to the hangar decks in the event damage did occur, particularly demonstrated when Cavalla torpedoed and sank her. Shōkaku normally stowed 150,000 gallons of AvGas for operational use.|$|R
