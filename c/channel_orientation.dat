See Fiber-reinforced plastic.) The resulting porous network is filled with monomer.

There are many things {{to take into account}} when introducing hollow tubes into a crystalline structure. First to consider is that the created channels may compromise the load bearing ability of the material due to the removal of load bearing material. Also, the channel diameter, degree of branching, location of branch points, and <b>channel</b> <b>orientation</b> are some of the main things to consider when building up microchannels within a material. Materials that don’t need to withstand much mechanical strain, but want self-healing properties, can introduce more microchannels than materials that are meant to be load bearing.

40|$|The ThFFF {{retention}} of polymers is enhanced in certain liquid mixtures. Previous studies of thermal diffusion in such mixtures {{indicate that the}} enhancement is due to an additional solubility-based force induced by a solvent gradient in the channel. The partitioning of solvent mixtures in a temperature gradient was shown to be correlated to solvent density, just as the thermal diffusion of polymers is correlated to polymer density. This work examines the density effect more closely {{by looking at the}} effect of <b>channel</b> <b>orientation</b> on both polymer retention and the partitioning of liquids. A difference in the profiles of solvent partitioning with <b>channel</b> <b>orientation</b> indicates the presence of convection currents in an inverted ThFFF channel, yet polymer retention is independent of <b>channel</b> <b>orientation</b> in homogeneous solvents as well as solvent mixtures. The results indicate that the effect of density on polymer retention is rooted in thermal diffusion and not convection, but that either the previously proposed mechanism of enhanced retention is incorrect or convection currents are confined to the channel edges, becoming significant only in the tapered regions of the channel. Finally, the effect of polymer concentration on retention is more pronounced in mixed carrier liquids...|$|E

Multichannel {{customer management}} is about using more than one channel, such as brick-and-mortar store, telephone or the Internet to manage customers in a consistent and coordinated way. This thesis takes a previously unexplored view to the topic by studying {{it in the context}} of an art and antiques auction. Not only is there a difference between auctions and fixed price trade as transaction mechanisms, but also between the commodities sold in art and antiques auctions and conventional retail stores. Items sold at this kind of auctions tend to be unique. Art above all other product categories is most prone to uncertainty concerning authenticity especially when sold online. The purpose of this study is to identify customer groups of a private art and antiques auction house based on customers' previous purchase behavior that is related to their individual psychographic and demographic profiles. The auction house organizes auctions both live and online. Identifying customer groups is one of the primary issues in multichannel customer management. By identifying these groups and understanding their characteristics, companies can design their channels better and target marketing more efficiently. In addition to previously studied psychographics, an additional psychographic is included to measure customer trust in online shopping. Trust is a particularly significant factor in the uncertain environment of electronic commerce. Its role is even more enhanced in the art and antiques market. An online questionnaire was used for data collection. Principal components analysis was conducted to find a smaller number of underlying psychographic variables. Customers were grouped with k-means clustering based on the number of purchases they had made live and online since both channels had been simultaneously available. Cross tabulations were conducted to study the relationship between the identified groups and demographics. Finally, a multinomial logistic regression was used to answer the main research question of how the customers' psychographic profiles relate to their purchase <b>channel</b> <b>orientation.</b> In other words, the relationship between cluster membership and the principal components derived from factor analysis was studied. As a final result, four distinctive customer groups, which all differ in their purchase <b>channel</b> <b>orientation,</b> were identified.

The results proved once again to be very different from previous studies, where customers' individual differences were used to identify clearly defined customer groups. They show that the outcome for identified groups depends on the context and variables used in the study...|$|E
