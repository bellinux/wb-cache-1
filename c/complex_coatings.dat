Those deposited at 700 °C are composed of γ-Al 2 O 3 nanocrystals dispersed in a matrix of amorphous alumina. Their mechanical properties and adhesion to the substrates were investigated by indentation, scratch and micro tensile tests. Hardness and rigidity of the films increase with increasing deposition temperature. The hardness of the coatings prepared at 350 °C and 480 °C is 5. 8 ± 0. 7 GPa and 10. 8 ± 0. 8 GPa respectively. Their Young's modulus is 92 ± 8 GPa (350 °C) and 155 ± 6 GPa (480 °C).

Advances in emulsion polymerization have allowed <b>complex</b> latex <b>coatings</b> {{to be made by}} combining two or more immiscible polymers into a single latex particle. The polymers phase separate within the particle, which can then form unique coating microstructures. The goal of this project is to study the film formation of <b>complex</b> latex <b>coatings,</b> using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) in conjunction with other tools. Block copolymer latexes were synthesized at Arkema Inc. and their film formation properties were studied using cryo-SEM and AFM. The coatings complete the three stages of film formation: consolidation, compaction and coalescence. The two immiscible polymers phase separate on a scale of a few nanometers in fully formed films. The film formation of polymer latex blends was also characterized. Here, microstructure formation was studied along side with stress development and cracking. Coatings of polymer blends were shown to hold a residual tensile stress after drying completed, although lateral drying fronts convoluted results. Cryo-SEM showed cracks to form with water still present between the particles, and deformation to occur after cracking and after most of the water had evaporated. Lateral drying fronts complicated studies of film formation. To reduce or eliminate lateral drying, walled substrates were fabricated such that uniform drying could occur.

The goals of our work were to define the solubility of apatites in seawater better and to examine the differences in solubility of apatites of different composition, We found that the solubility behavior is best described in terms of complex reactions on the apatite surface rather than by simple solubility theory. Studies of the solubility oE apatites in sea-water have heretofore been based on the assumption of simple phases equilibrating with the seawater. Sill&r (1961) suggested that hydroxyapatite controls the equilib-rium concentration of phosphate in seawa-ter. Kramer (1964) and Roberson (1966) postulated that francolite, a carbonate fluor-apatite, rather than hydroxyapatite is the solid phase which occurs in seawater and that its solubility is the one that should be studied. Differences in their results and those of Smirnov et al. (1962), and the relatively poor precision obtained by Ro-berson, made it impossible to determine accurately the saturation state of seawater with respect to apatite. The apatite surface is very susceptible to rearrangement or to complex formation in distilled water solutions (Dictz et al. 1964; Smith ct al. 1974).

40|$|Thin films {{composed}} of molecular mixtures {{of metal and}} dielectric are being considered for use as solar selective coatings {{for a variety of}} space power applications. By controlling the degree of molecular mixing, the solar selective coatings can be tailored to have the combined properties of high solar absorptance, alpha, and low infrared emittance, epsilon. On orbit, these combined properties would simultaneously maximize the amount of solar energy captured by the coating and minimize the amount of thermal energy radiated. Mini-satellites equipped with solar collectors coated with these cermet coatings may utilize the captured heat energy to power a heat engine to generate electricity, or to power a thermal bus that directs heat to remote regions of the spacecraft. Early work in this area identified the theoretical boundary conditions needed to operate a Carnot cycle in space, including the need for a solar concentrator, a solar selective coating at the heat inlet of the engine, and a radiator. A solar concentrator that can concentrate sunlight by a factor of 100 is ideal. At lower values, the temperature of the solar absorbing surface becomes too low for efficient heat engine operation, and at higher values, cavity type heat receivers become attractive. In designing the solar selective coating, the wavelength region yielding high solar absorptance must be separated from the wavelength region yielding low infrared emittance by establishing a sharp transition in optical properties. In particular, a sharp transition in reflectance is desired in the infrared to achieve the desired optical performance. For a heat engine operating at 450 C, a sharp transition at 1. 8 micrometers is desired. The radiator completes the heat flow through the Carnot cycle. Additional work has been done supporting the use of molecular mixtures for terrestrial applications. Sputter deposition provides a means to apply coatings to the tubes that carry a working fluid at the focus of trough-style collectors. Sputtering offers considerable flexibility in coating conditions, including a wide variety of metal and dielectric targets. Coating designs range from simple two or three layer coatings to <b>complex</b> <b>coatings</b> that are purposely graded to be metal-rich at their base and oxide-rich at their surface in order to yield the desired solar selective properties. In these cermet coatings, molecular islands of metal are thought to be embedded in a three dimensional matrix of dielectric. Recent work has identified the use of custom made ion beam sputter deposition targets to produce coatings containing molecular mixtures of metal and dielectric. The targets are cylindrical and the surface consists of a gradually changing composition of metal and dielectric. Rotating the cylinder under the beam during ion beam sputter deposition yields a coating that is a molecular mixture of metal and dielectric, with the composition changing through the thickness of the coating. The optical properties of these coatings are not only dependent on their thickness and chemical composition, but are also dependent on the extent of the through thickness gradient established during deposition. This paper presents a summary of the optical properties of several thin film molecular mixtures designed as solar selective coatings. Optical performance is first identified as a function of wavelength, from the ultraviolet to the visible and infrared. Coating composition, thickness, and gradient from metal to dielectric also play an important role. Additional work for future activities is also identified...|$|E
40|$|This project alms to {{determine}} the fracture toughness of thin coated systems by nanoindentation. The development of techniques {{for the assessment of}} coating toughness lags behind the determination of Young's modulus and hardness of thin coatings. No universal model or technique has been agreed to estimate coating toughness. With the development of complex coating stacks (e. g. multilayered coated systems) and the presence of variable crack patterns, the difficulty of generating a solution by stress analysis based models is dramatically increased. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of models to deal with <b>complex</b> <b>coatings</b> and varied cracking patterns. The most successful models in this respect are energy-based. In this thesis the existing models and techniques to assess coating toughness and adhesion have been critically reviewed. The stress analysis based models usually require empirical fitting parameters and they only deal with specific crack patterns. In contrast, the energy based models can deal with different cracking patterns without empirical constants; but they usually require that the crack propagates during loading cycle only, whilst, stress analysis based models do not have such a restriction. Several new models have been developed to assess coating toughness in this work. Two of them are based on excursions in load-displacement (P-c 5) curves resulting from fracture during nanoindentation. The first model (Wcdp method) is based on extrapolating the plot of total work during indentation versus displacement. Compared to a literature model based on extrapolating P-c 5 curve, this approach removes the influence on fracture dissipated energy from plastic deformation of the substrate. The second is a modified model to estimate the limiting value of coating toughness which could equally give the upper and lower boundary for toughness from nanoindentation performed under load control and displacement control, thus improving on the initial boundary model by Toonder et al which could only provide an upper boundary of coating toughness for nanoindentation under displacement control. However, it is often observed that fracture does not result in an excursion in the P-c 5 curve, which requires a different modelling approach. The third model (Wirr-W p model) developed addresses this problem. All the previous models address through-thickness fracture which is widely observed in nanoindentation testing of hard coatings. In addition, another energy based method is proposed to estimate the adhesion of coatings by analysing the extra linear recovery of unloading curve associated with the rebound of the coating during unloading. Models were validated by experiments carried out by a range of nanoindentation techniques. The low load tests were performed by a Hysitron Triboindenter fitted with a sharp cube comer tip and a Berkovich tip. The maximum penetration was in the range of 40 - 400 nm. Higher load tests were performed using a Nanoindenter II ™ fitted with a Berkovich tip in the range of lOmN-SOOmN. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), highresolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and reflected light microscopy have been employed to investigate the fracture behaviour. To examme the models developed in this work, two different coated systems were investigated: one is multilayer optical coatings (total thickness <SOOnm) including ITO, Sn 02, ZnO, and TiOxNy on glass, which is the case of harder coating on hard (but relatively softer) substrate and they are the main samples investigated in this project; the other is a Ij. lm fullerene-like CNx coating on various ceramic substrates such as SiC, Si, and Ah 03, which is the case of hard (but relatively softer) coating on a harder substrate. Some common brittle bulk materials (e. g. Si) were also tested to examine the applicability of the models. Reasonable toughness values for both coated systems and bulk materials have been obtained by the new models developed in this work. To gain more insight into the fracture mechanisms of coated systems, the threshold of fracture is also an important issue to be addressed. The loading rate may influence the critical load for fracture in brittle materials. It was observed that within the penetration rate range used in this study (lO- 40 nmls) the higher the penetration rate the higher was the threshold for cracking in the optical multilayer coatings on glass indented by a cube comer tip. When analysing the P-J curves at different loading rates, significantly different behaviour was observed for ITO and Sn 02 coatings which is possibly due to a pressureinduced phase transformation in these coatings.

40|$|International audienceA {{classical}} way of coloring {{a surface}} {{in order to}} create a still image is the application of a colored coating. The more recent digital printing systems enable depositing thick coatings or successive ink layers. The color rendering of the surface depends on the optical properties of the coated materials (optical index, spectral scattering and absorption coefficients) and their thickness. In order to predict its spectral reflectance as a function of these parameters, the so-called two-flux approach is to be tested in first since the model is simple and relies on analytical equations. It has a good chance to provide accurate predictions for coatings made of solid layers of strongly scattering or nonscattering media, or even <b>complex</b> stratified <b>coatings</b> obtained by stacking nonsymmetrical components such as printed films.

But it has limitations and may provide poor color predictions for certain types of layered materials. We therefore propose a simple method based on parameters of the model to check the precision of the two-flux model for a given type of coating...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAdhesion of {{proteins}} and bacteria was reduced {{by a factor}} close to one order of magnitude, and adhered bacteria were dramatically damaged on copper surfaces by grafting a PEG-modified PMMA-based (polymethyl methacrylate) copolymer together with an antimicrobial peptide. To obtain PEG and a peptide grafted together on the surface, a UV sensitive copolymer (containing PMMA, PEG and a UV sensitive reagent) was primary synthesized and deposited. After selective UV irradiation of this copolymer layer, an antimicrobial peptide, Magainin I, was grafted onto freed-polymer coated-copper surface via a spacer molecule (a mercapto carboxylic acid). The functionalization was characterized at each step by Polarization Modulation Reflection Absorption Infrared Spectroscopy (PM-RAIRS). The antiadhesive properties of the copolymer layer and antibacterial activity of the anchored Magainin I, were individually tested toward adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) proteins, and against Gram positive bacteria, Listeria ivanovii, respectively. The results revealed that adhesion of both proteins and bacteria has been considerably reduced; moreover, the peptide still displays some antimicrobial activity after grafting. This work gives new ideas and perspectives to elaborate <b>complex</b> surface <b>coatings</b> where several agents are needed like for anti-biofilm or sensing applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} setup of {{quartz crystal}} microbalance and generalized ellipsometry {{can be used}} to comprehensively investigate <b>complex</b> functional <b>coatings</b> comprising stimuli-responsive polymer brushes and 3 D nanostructures in a dynamic, noninvasive in situ measurement. While the quartz crystal microbalance detects the overall change in areal mass, for instance, during a swelling or adsorption process, the generalized ellipsometry data can be evaluated in terms of a layered model to distinguish between processes occurring within the intercolumnar space or on top of the anisotropic nanocolumns. Silicon films with anisotropic nanocolumnar morphology were prepared by the glancing angle deposition technique and further functionalized by grafting of poly-(acrylic acid) or poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide) chains. Investigations of the thermoresponsive swelling of the poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide) brush on the Si nanocolumns proved the successful preparation of a stimuli-responsive coating. Furthermore, the potential of these novel coatings in the field of biotechnology was explored by investigation of the adsorption of the model protein bovine serum albumin. Adsorption, retention, and desorption triggered by a change in the pH value is observed using poly-(acrylic acid) functionalized nanostructures, although generalized ellipsometry data revealed that this process occurs only on top of the nanostructures. Poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide) is found to render the nanostructures non-fouling properties. Includes supplemental materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} for the commercial use of EPD as a manufacturing technique has been established. Rigs and equipment have been designed and constructed for the EPD of ceramic components {{to a range of}} geometries including tubes and plates. Components have been produced with uniform thickness up to 3 mm, or with varying thickness. Systems have also been operated to produce ceramic coatings on metal substrates including flat foils, tubes, rods and <b>complex</b> shapes. <b>Coatings</b> of ZrO 2, cerium gadolinium oxide (CGO), cermet mixtures, (La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2) 0. 98 Mn oxide (LSM), TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 have all been successfully produced and such layers can be achieved with a deposition time of < 2 minutes. Multiplying the number of EPD cells which can be operated simultaneously enables the average deposit time to be reduced to a level where commercial production becomes feasible. Thicker crack-free layers of the above materials up to 150 micron have been produced for applications where a robust porous structure is required. XRD, SEM and EDX results have shown that the EPD methods developed for use in these systems are capable of producing layers from binary or ternary mixtures of suspension without segregation within the formed layers...|$|R
40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{and mechanical}} stability of thin film coatings on substrates is increasingly becoming {{a key issue}} in device reliability as magnetic and storage technology driven products demand smaller, thinner and more <b>complex</b> functional <b>coatings.</b> In the present study, chemical vapor deposited Co and Co 3 O 4 thin films on SiO 2 and Si substrates are produced, respectively. Chemical vapor deposition is {{the most widely used}} deposition technique which produces thin films well adherent to the substrate. Co and Co 3 O 4 thin films can be used in innovative applications such as magnetic sensors, data storage devices and protective layers. The surface topography of the produced thin films is investigated with Atomic Force Microscopy and the mechanical behavior of them is evaluated. The produced thin films are also characterized using nanoindentation technique. Typical load-displacement curves are obtained and the local changes observed are explained. The nanomechanical properties (hardness and elastic modulus) of the thin films are obtained with Oliver & Pharr model. Finally, an evaluation of the reliability of each thin film (wear analysis) is performed using the hardness to elastic modulus ratio in correlation to the ratio of irreversible work to total work for a complete loading-unloading procedure...|$|R
40|$|Planar-supported {{phospholipid}} bilayers {{formed by}} the adsorption of vesicles are increasingly used {{in the investigation of}} lipid-dependent reactions. We have studied the way in which these bilayers are formed with phospholipid vesicles containing the transmembrane protein Tissue Factor (TF). TF complexed with the serine protease, factor VIIa, is the primary initiator of blood coagulation by way of activation of the zymogen factor X. TF has been shown to orient randomly on the inner and outer leaflets of vesicles. We used proteolytic digestion to produce vesicles in which the extracellular domain of TF is located on the inner leaflet. These vesicles show no cofactor activity for factor VIIa {{as a result of the}} inability of the extracellular domain of TF to bind VIIa. After freeze/thawing, 50 % of the cofactor activity was regained, indicating reorientation of the sequestered, inner leaflet TF. Adsorption of these vesicles to the inner surface of glass microcapillaries results in a continuous phospholipid bilayer. The microcapillaries were perfused with a solution of factors VIIa and X, and the effluent was monitored for factor Xa production, a sensitive measure of the activity of the TF-VIIa <b>complex.</b> For <b>coatings</b> produced with the digested vesicles, minimal TF-VIIa activity was observed, showing that the supported bilayer preserves the orientation of the leaflets in the vesicles, i. e., the outer leaflet of the vesicles forms the outer leaflet of the supported bilayer...|$|R
40|$|Different {{critical}} load determination {{techniques such as}} microscopy, acoustic emission, normal, tangential, and lateral forces used for scratch test evaluation of <b>complex</b> or multilayer <b>coatings</b> are investigated. The applicability of the scratch test to newly developed coating techniques, systems, and applications is discussed. Among the methods based {{on the use of}} a physical measurement, acoustic emission detection is the most effective. The dynamics ratio between the signals below and above the {{critical load}} for the acoustic emission (much greater than 100) is well above that obtained with the normal, tangential, and lateral forces. The present commercial instruments are limited in load application performance. A scratch tester able to apply accurate loads as low as 0. 01 N would probably overcome most of the actual limitations and would be expected to extend the scratch testing technique to different application fields such as optics and microelectronics...|$|R
