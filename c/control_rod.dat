5|$|The {{process was}} {{abruptly}} halted by the automatic <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> reinserting itself, {{due to its}} trip level being set too low. At 11:25, Fermi ordered the control rods reinserted. He then {{announced that it was}} lunch time.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} resumed at 14:00. Weil {{worked the}} final <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi {{announced that the}} pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they drank from paper cups.|$|E
50|$|Bottom entry {{bottom mounted}} <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> allow {{refueling}} without {{removal of the}} <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> and drives, while also allowing drive testing with an open vessel prior to fuel loading.|$|R
50|$|In BWRs, the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> are {{inserted}} up {{from underneath}} the reactor vessel. In this case a hydraulic control unit with a pressurized storage tank provides the force to rapidly insert the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> upon any interruption of the electric current. In both the PWR and the BWR there are secondary systems (and often even tertiary systems) that will insert <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> {{in the event that}} primary rapid insertion does not promptly and fully actuate.|$|R
50|$|Post trip {{evaluations}} {{have confirmed}} that all <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> were fully inserted within four minutes of the reactor SCRAM. A review indicates the problem was with the indication sensors, and that all <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> were fully inserted immediately {{at the time of}} the reactor scram. Follow-up evaluations also demonstrated that even if the three subject <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> remained fully withdrawn in a cold shutdown condition, the reactor would have remained adequately shutdown.|$|R
25|$|There are 1693 fuel {{channels}} and 170 <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> channels {{in the first}} generation RBMK reactor cores. Second generation reactor cores (such as Chernobyl-4) have 1661 fuel {{channels and}} 211 <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> channels.|$|E
25|$|Manual <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> count {{increased}} from 30 to 45.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in fuel enrichment from 2% to 2.4% {{to compensate for}} <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> modifications {{and the introduction of}} additional absorbers.|$|E
50|$|In most reactor designs, {{the routine}} {{shutdown}} procedure also uses a SCRAM to insert the <b>control</b> <b>rods,</b> {{as it is}} the most reliable method of completely inserting the <b>control</b> <b>rods,</b> and prevents the possibility of accidentally withdrawing them during or after the shutdown.|$|R
25|$|The normal {{reactivity}} margin is 43–48 <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
50|$|Innovative {{reactivity}} {{control systems}} without <b>control</b> <b>rods,</b> etc.|$|R
25|$|The fastest {{method for}} {{adjusting}} levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is via {{movement of the}} control rods. Control rods are made of neutron poisons and therefore tend to absorb neutrons. When a <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs more neutrons than the material it displaces—often the moderator. This action results in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor's power output. Conversely, extracting the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> will result {{in an increase in}} the rate of fission events and an increase in power.|$|E
25|$|At SL-1, {{control rods}} would {{get stuck in}} the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> channel sporadically. Numerous {{procedures}} were conducted to evaluate control rods to ensure they were operating properly. There were rod drop tests and scram tests of each rod, in addition to periodic rod exercising and rod withdrawals for normal operation. From February 1959 to November 18, 1960, there were 40 cases of a stuck <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> for scram and rod drop tests and about a 2.5% failure rate. From November 18, 1960 to December 23, 1960, there was {{a dramatic increase in}} stuck rods, with 23 in that time period and a 13.0% failure rate. Besides these test failures, there were an additional 21 rod sticking incidents from February 1959 to December 1960; 4 of these had occurred in the last month of operation during routine rod withdrawal. The central <b>control</b> <b>rod,</b> No. 9, had the best operational performance record even though it was operated more frequently {{than any of the other}} rods.|$|E
25|$|George Leon Weil (September 18, 1907 – July 1, 1995) was an American physicist. On December 2, 1942, {{he removed}} the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> from the Chicago Pile-1 nuclear reactor, {{initiating}} the first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2016 it was {{announced}} that super-articulated <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> would be installed at Hunterston B and Hinkley Point B because of concerns about the stability of the reactors' graphite cores. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) had raised concerns over the number of fractures in keyways that lock together the graphite bricks in the core. [...] An unusual event, such as an earthquake, might destabilise the graphite so that ordinary <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> that shut the reactor down could not be inserted. Super-articulated <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> should be insertable even into a destabilised core.|$|R
25|$|About 80–85% of {{the core}} thermal power is removed by the fuel rod coolant channels, via the {{graphite}} rings. The rest of the heat is removed by the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> channel coolant. The gas circulating in the reactor {{plays the role of}} enabling the heat transfer to the coolant channels.|$|E
25|$|Some {{sources and}} {{eyewitness}} accounts confuse {{the names and}} disposition of each victim. In Idaho Falls: The untold story of America's first nuclear accident, the author indicates that Byrnes was the man found alive initially, Legg's body was recovered the night after the accident, and that McKinley was impaled by the <b>control</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rod {{sticking}} {{has been}} attributed to misalignment, corrosion product build-up, bearing wear, clutch wear, and drive mechanism seal wear. Many of the failure modes that caused a stuck rod during tests (like bearing and clutch wear) would only apply to a movement performed by the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> drive mechanism. Since the No. 9 rod is centrally located, its alignment may have been better than Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 which were more prone to sticking. After the accident, logbooks and former plant operators were consulted to determine if there had been any rods stuck during the reassembly operation that Byrnes was performing. One person had performed this about 300 times, and another 250 times; neither had ever felt a <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> stick when being manually raised during this procedure. Furthermore, no one had ever reported a stuck rod during manual reconnection.|$|E

25|$|The molten {{reactor core}} {{releases}} volatile elements and compounds. These may be gas phase, such as molecular iodine or noble gases, or condensed aerosol particles {{after leaving the}} high temperature region. A high proportion of aerosol particles originate from the reactor <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> materials. The gaseous compounds may be adsorbed {{on the surface of}} the aerosol particles.|$|E
25|$|On 4 December 2003 a Dornier 228 {{operating}} Flight 603 {{was struck}} by lightning, causing a fracture to the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> that operated the elevator. The aircraft subsequently landed heavily {{just short of the}} runway at Bodø Airport and was written off. Both crew members sustained serious injuries while both passengers sustained slight injuries. The aircraft, registered LN-HTA, was written off.|$|E
25|$|RBMK reactor fuel {{was used}} in Soviet-designed and built RBMK-type reactors. This is a low-enriched uranium oxide fuel. The fuel {{elements}} in an RBMK are 3 m long each, and two of these sit back-to-back on each fuel channel, pressure tube. Reprocessed uranium from Russian VVER reactor spent fuel is used to fabricate RBMK fuel. Following the Chernobyl accident, the enrichment of fuel was changed from 2.0% to 2.4%, to compensate for <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> modifications {{and the introduction of}} additional absorbers.|$|E
50|$|Reactivity is <b>controlled</b> by <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> {{that can}} be {{inserted}} into the reactor from above. These rods are made from a neutron absorbing material and, depending on depth of insertion, hinder the chain reaction. If there is an emergency, a reactor shutdown can be performed by full insertion of the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> into the core.|$|R
5|$|Boron carbide's {{ability to}} absorb {{neutrons}} without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> and shut-down pellets. Within <b>control</b> <b>rods,</b> boron carbide is often powdered, {{to increase its}} surface area.|$|R

25|$|CP-1 {{was ready}} on December 2, 1942; Weil worked the final <b>control</b> <b>rod,</b> while Fermi {{monitored}} the neutron activity. The pile went critical at 15:36, initiating the first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Fermi {{shut it down}} 28 minutes later, by having the control rods re-inserted. Weil continued to work in reactor development and in April 1945, went to the Los Alamos laboratory, where {{he worked on the}} Trinity nuclear test. In October 1945, he was appointed the American representative at the Chalk River Laboratories in Canada.|$|E
25|$|During a meltdown, the {{temperature}} of the fuel rods increases and they can deform, in the case of Zircaloy cladding, above 700–900°C (1,292-1,652 °F). If the reactor pressure is low, the pressure inside the fuel rods ruptures the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> cladding. High-pressure conditions push the cladding onto the fuel pellets, promoting formation of uranium dioxide–zirconium eutectic with a melting point of 1200–1400°C (2,192-2,552 °F). An exothermic reaction occurs between steam and zirconium, which may produce enough heat to be self-sustaining without the contribution of decay heat from radioactivity. Hydrogen is released in an amount of about 0.5m3 (17.65 cu. ft.) of hydrogen (at normal temperature/pressure) per kilogram of zircaloy oxidized. Hydrogen embrittlement may also occur in the reactor materials and volatile fission products can be released from damaged fuel rods. Between 1300 and 1500°C (2,372-2,732 °F), the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods melts, together with the evaporation of <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> cladding. At 1800°C (3,272 °F), the cladding oxides melt and begin to flow. At 2700–2800°C (4,892-5,072 °F) the uranium oxide fuel rods melt and the reactor core structure and geometry collapses. This can occur at lower temperatures if a eutectic uranium oxide-zirconium composition is formed. At that point, the corium is virtually free of volatile constituents that are not chemically bound, resulting in correspondingly lower heat production (by about 25%) as the volatile isotopes relocate.|$|E
25|$|The high {{temperature}} water coolant with boric acid dissolved in it is corrosive to carbon steel (but not stainless steel); this can cause radioactive corrosion products to circulate in the primary coolant loop. This not only limits the lifetime of the reactor, but the systems that filter out the corrosion products and adjust the boric acid concentration add significantly to the overall cost of the reactor and to radiation exposure. In one instance, this has resulted in severe corrosion to <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> drive mechanisms when the boric acid solution leaked through the seal between the mechanism itself and the primary system.|$|E
50|$|In the {{prismatic}} designs, <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> are {{inserted in}} holes {{cut in the}} graphite blocks {{that make up the}} core. The VHTR will be controlled like current PBMR designs if it utilizes a pebble bed core, the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> will be inserted in the surrounding graphite reflector. Control can also be attained by adding pebbles containing neutron absorbers.|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of the pebble-bed reactor over a conventional light-water reactor is in operating at higher temperatures. A technical advantage is that some designs are throttled by temperature, not by <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> The reactor can be simpler {{because it does not}} need to operate well at the varying neutron profiles caused by partially withdrawn <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
50|$|In December 1983, when Ignalina Unit 1 came online, {{a design}} flaw of the RBMK was noticed {{for the first}} time. The {{graphite}} moderated tips on the <b>control</b> <b>rods,</b> which partially caused the Chernobyl accident, were entered into the reactor. They immediately caused a power surge. In this case the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> did not get stuck, and could {{get down to the}} bottom of the reactor. The boron in the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> stopped the nuclear reaction. Other nuclear organizations and RBMK plants were informed of the problem, but it was not addressed until after the accident at Chernobyl. The subsequent modifications were tested at Ignalina during 1987 and 1988.|$|R
