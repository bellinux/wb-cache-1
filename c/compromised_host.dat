30|$|Attackers on the Internet often launch network {{intrusions}} through <b>compromised</b> <b>hosts,</b> {{in order}} to reduce the chance of being detected. The <b>compromised</b> <b>hosts</b> used by the attacker are called stepping-stones. In a stepping-stone attack, an attacker uses a chain of hosts on the Internet as relay machines and remotely log in these hosts using tools such as telnet, rlogin, or SSH. On the intruder’s local machine, he enters commands that are relayed via the stepping-stone hosts in the chain till they finally reach the victim machine. Since each interactive TCP session between a client and a server is independent of other sessions even though the sessions may be relayed, so accessing a server via multiple relayed TCP sessions can make it harder to tell the intruder’s geographical location unless all the <b>compromised</b> <b>hosts</b> collaborate with each other and work efficiently. Due to such a nature of TCP protocol, the final victim machine can only see the traffic from the last session of the connection chain. So it is extremely difficult for a victim host to learn any information about the origin of an attack.|$|R

40|$|Internet attackers control {{hundreds}} of thousands to perhaps millions of computers, which they can use {{for a variety of}} different attacks. Common attacks include spam delivery, phishing, and DDoS. The current research community focus is on defenses for each specific attack type <b>compromised</b> <b>hosts</b> may launch. However, attack-specific approaches almost always have two fundamental drawbacks: they do not address the root problem that attackers control an army of <b>compromised</b> <b>hosts,</b> and they do not provide the right incentives for users to properly secure their machines. As a result, attack-specific defenses may be defeated by new attacks, even those that may be only slightly different from old attacks.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of botnets as an attack tool and the awareness attackers have of blocking lists leads {{to the question of}} whether we can effectively predict future bot locations. To that end, we introduce a network quality that we term uncleanliness: an indicator of the propensity for hosts in a network to be compromised by outside parties. We hypothesize that unclean networks will demonstrate two properties: spatial and temporal uncleanliness. Spatial uncleanliness is the tendency for <b>compromised</b> <b>hosts</b> to cluster more densely within unclean networks. Temporal uncleanliness is the tendency for unclean networks to contain <b>compromised</b> <b>hosts</b> for extended periods. We test for these properties by collating data from multiple indicators (spamming, phishing, scanning and botnet IRC log monitoring). We demonstrate evidence for both spatial and temporal uncleanliness. We further show evidence for cross-relationship between the various datasets, showing that botnet activity predicts spamming and scanning, while phishing activity appears to be unrelated to the other indicators. ...|$|R
50|$|To {{ensure that}} only valid {{initiators}} connect to storage arrays, administrators most commonly run iSCSI only over logically isolated backchannel networks. In this deployment architecture, only the management ports of storage arrays {{are exposed to}} the general-purpose internal network, and the iSCSI protocol itself is run over dedicated network segments or virtual LANs (VLAN). This mitigates authentication concerns; unauthorized users are not physically provisioned for iSCSI, and thus cannot talk to storage arrays. However, it also creates a transitive trust problem, in that a single <b>compromised</b> <b>host</b> with an iSCSI disk can be used to attack storage resources for other hosts.|$|E

Figure 1 shows an agent system and its two distinct layers of communication: host-to-host and agent-toagent. Given {{the plethora of new}} techniques for identifying network intruders, we study the <b>compromised</b> <b>host</b> problem: determining the appropriate response to an identified intruder.

While keeping the <b>compromised</b> <b>host</b> can result in information disclosure, removal of the host can degrade or even sever the network. We develop a state description for an agent system and introduce a measure of information assurance for the system in terms of the integrity of the messages delivered to the agents in a given network state. Agents have three responses to a compromised host: ignore the compromised host; reroute around the <b>compromised</b> <b>host</b> using network route redundancies; or remove the <b>compromised</b> <b>host,</b> by having the agents instruct their hosts to eliminate it from the network.
