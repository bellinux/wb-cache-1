25|$|The least {{expensive}} models only detect and display {{a small number}} of pitches, often those pitches that are required to tune a given instrument (e.g., E, A, D, G, B, E of standard guitar tuning). While this type of tuner is useful for bands that only use stringed instruments such as guitar and electric bass, it is not that useful for tuning brass or woodwind instruments. Tuners at the next price point offer chromatic tuning, the ability to detect and assess all the pitches in the chromatic scale (e.g., C, C, D, D, etc.). <b>Chromatic</b> <b>tuners</b> can be used for B and E brass instruments, such as saxophones and horns. Many models have circuitry that automatically detects which pitch is being played, and then compares it against the correct pitch. Less expensive models require the musician to specify the target pitch via a switch or slider. Most low- and mid-priced electronic tuners only allow tuning to an equal temperament scale.|$|R

50|$|Peterson engineer, Bill Hass (born February 6, 1939, died May 3, 2008), {{built the}} first commercially {{available}} battery-powered handheld tuner, the Model 70, in 1964. The Model 70 was a <b>chromatic</b> <b>tuner</b> that generated twelve fixed pitch reference tones. The user tuning an instrument set the tuner to a pitch and matched the tone.|$|E

He was given his own signature Fulltone Robin Trower Overdrive in late 2008.|$|E
50|$|Party Music was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} released in early September 2001, but the release was delayed until November of that year due to the cover art, which depicted Boots Riley and Pam the Funkstress destroying the twin towers of the World Trade Center using a Covert-Labs digital <b>chromatic</b> <b>tuner</b> as a detonator. The original cover was created in June 2001.|$|E

50|$|Most recently, while {{performing}} with Bosnian Rainbows, Rodriguez-Lopez {{began to use}} a mid-1960s era left-handed Supro 3/4 scale guitar with a single pickup in the bridge position. Shortly afterwards, he was seen playing a custom Ibanez guitar that closely resembled his Supro. In addition, Rodriguez-Lopez now uses flatwound strings on his guitar.

5000|$|Webster {{currently}} uses Spector 'Alex Webster Signature Edition' (based on Euro 5XL basses), DR Strings, and EMG pickups. Before {{his signature}} model, he used Modulus Quantum and Spector Euro 5XL basses. He also used a white 1987 Fender Precision bass {{on the album}}s [...] "Eaten Back to Life" [...] and [...] "Butchered at Birth", an Ibanez Sabre SB900 on the album [...] "Tomb of the Mutilated", an Ibanez Soundgear SR1500 on [...] "The Bleeding" [...] and both a 1971 Precision Bass {{as well as a}} Spector NS Series 5-string bass on [...] "Vile".

Later, he signed an endorsement deal with SWR and used 2 SWR SM-1500 and 2 SWR Megoliath 8x10 cabinets. Currently he is using Aguilar DB 751 and DB810 cabinets. Not much of an effects user, however on the album [...] "Torture" [...] he stated that he began using a Darkglass Microtubes B3K overdrive pedal and commented that it's the heaviest tone he has achieved yet. He also uses a Radial Bassbone and a Boss TU-2 <b>Chromatic</b> <b>Tuner.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Valensi's main guitar, {{which he}} uses for nearly every live show and {{recorded}} song, is a 1990s Epiphone Riviera with Gibson P-94 pick-ups, which {{was given to}} him by friend and fellow Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. In a 2004 interview with Epiphone, he called it [...] "the greatest guitar never made" [...] because Gibson had never produced a semi-hollow with P-94 style pickups, except for the fully hollow ES-330 and the Epiphone Casino. He has several models in different colours (all with P-94s), including multiple naturals, one in vintage sunburst, one in red, and a 12-string elite in red. In 2005, Epiphone released a signature model of his guitar, the Elitist Nick Valensi Riviera P-94, and followed it up with a standard model Nick Valensi Riviera P-94 in 2007. Back-up/warm-up guitars include an Epiphone Dot fitted with 2 P-94s, an Epiphone Casino, an Epiphone Sheraton, and a Gibson Faded Special Double Cutaway with 2 P-90s. Valensi often borrows fellow Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr.'s backup guitars, which include a Gibson Les Paul Jr. and a Les Paul Special. New guitars used for the First Impressions of Earth tour include a Les Paul Custom in black, a Fender Telecaster Custom (which he can be seen using in the music video for Under Cover of Darkness [...] ), and a Duesenberg semi-hollow. Valensi's main amplifier is a 2x12" [...] Fender Hot Rod DeVille, used with Fender 4x12" [...] extension cabinets during live shows. He also recently purchased a Carr amplifier to use on the last few stops of the First Impressions tour. His pedalboard consists of a Visual Sound Jekyll & Hyde Ultimate Overdrive pedal, Boss TR-2 Tremolo, Vox Cooltron Bulldog Distortion, MXR Micro Amp (2) and a Boss TU-2 <b>Chromatic</b> <b>Tuner.</b> He has also been seen with an Electro Harmonix Memory Man and a Boss Blues Driver.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{intonation}} in live professional trombone auditions {{is one of}} the most critical factors for which execution is paramount. However, the musician who practices dutifully and precisely with a <b>chromatic</b> <b>tuner,</b> even to the point of technical mastery, will not be prepared sufficiently. He or she will find that in certain environments where heavy reverberation is present, the harmonies inadvertently created are not in tune, even when equal-tempered tuning is executed perfectly, due to the harmonic interactions that those reverberations create. Therefore, it is important that trombonists know how to play auditions excerpts with just intonation, a system that accounts for harmony to deliver results that are truly in tune, for use in the solo round of an audition in such an acoustically "wet" space. This document demonstrates the need for a solution in this regard, the factors involved in a practical application of these concepts in varying scenarios, and presents analyses in just intonation of ten of the most commonly requested excerpts. In addition, guidance and resources are provided for application beyond the excerpts that have been included. It is intended that the trombonist who reads this document will have a better understanding of the basics of just intonation as they apply to solo auditions, so that the quality of his or her audition is improved by leaving at least one less element, intonation, up to chance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the memory of {{different}} musical pitch levels of the human brain. The randomly selected vocal music students were asked to sing two lines of their preferred song. The department of music of the University of Jaffna of the Sri Lankan Government was used as the setting for this study. The class rooms and the surroundings were kept silence and also kept without any interruption from any pitch generating musical instrument. The students who were on their final year Bachelor of Fine Arts (Vocal music), were recruited for the study. Their vocals were recorded with a digital recorder and measured with an automatic <b>chromatic</b> <b>tuner</b> to find out the pitch level of the each student, while they sung in the each 5 class rooms. There were 40 recordings taken for analysis. Music therapy is an effective nursing intervention in decreasing anxiety, depression. But, the research in therapeutic music is still going on worldwide, to find out how music therapy works. According to the findings of this research, the musical pitch and the therapeutic music had no relationship, because the different musical pitch levels were not memorable or not identical by the human brain. In Sri Lanka, the implementation of music therapy in the government hospitals will relieve the depressed public by the war, without any side effects and also without high expenses and without the importation of drugs. It will help for the post-war economic development of the nation...|$|E
