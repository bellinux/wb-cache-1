5|$|Male {{students}} and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings, but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.|$|E
5|$|There were, however, {{a number}} of irregularities. In the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, four Liberal workers were convicted of various {{offences}} for adding almost five hundred names to the electoral register. One of the four was also convicted for two counts of perjury. While the unsuccessful Liberal candidate, former MP James Rooney, was not charged, Ontario Chief Justice James Chalmers McRuer, who investigated the matter, doubted that this <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> without the candidate's knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Under the new plan, freight {{would still}} only operate at night through the tunnel. Spurs {{connecting}} the tunnel in Brooklyn to the Long Island freight belt line, to the B freight sidings on Staten Island, {{and to the}} new city piers on Staten Island would have all been built. The project was projected to cost $60,000,000 and if the job was done quickly, it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by 1929. The route would help develop the waterfront areas in Staten Island and Jamaica Bay. Provisions would be made for connections with the subway system's Fourth Avenue Line, even though the Transit Commission refused {{to be involved with}} the plans.|$|E

60|$|He clambered ponderously {{into the}} trap; leaned out sideways, {{and only then}} {{wondered}} wheezily what on earth Captain Whalley <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> with himself of late.

5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described as many years of second-guessing what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to save Ruiz's life.|$|E
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E
5|$|The {{builders}} {{would have}} made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle pulleys to lift the stones into place. Much of the work <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> using simple sheers operated by a windlass. For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered treadmill would have been used; such machines were still {{being used in the}} quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century. A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left protruding from the bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction. The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; Émile Espérandieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces, equivalent to 50 years' pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.|$|E
60|$|At {{dinner that}} day she fished round carefully. Felix spoke of him almost warmly. What Cuthcott <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> at Becket, of all places, {{he could not}} imagine--the last sort of man one {{expected}} to see there; a good fellow, rather desperate, perhaps, as men of his age were apt to get if they had too many women, or no woman, about them.|$|R
60|$|He {{wondered}} {{a little}} what Jellicoe <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> {{to run up}} a bill as big as that, {{but it did not}} occur to him to ask, which was unfortunate, as it might have saved him a good deal of inconvenience. It seemed to him that it was none of his business to inquire into Jellicoe's private affairs. He took the envelope containing the money without question.|$|R

25|$|On 15 July, Alain Juppé, {{former prime}} {{minister}} of France {{and one of the}} final two candidates to become the Republican candidate for the April–May 2017 presidential election; and Christian Estrosi, former Nice mayor, raised the question of whether more <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to prevent the attack.|$|E
25|$|The Old Testament of the Peshitta was {{translated}} from Hebrew, although {{the date and}} circumstances of this are not entirely clear.

25|$|Jaffa Gate is {{the only}} one of the Old City gates {{positioned}} at a right angle to the wall.

25|$|The two {{surviving}} crewmen, Thomsen and Fitzsimmons, gave {{evidence that}} the capsize was so swift that nothing more <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to avert the tragedy.

They were unanimous in their praise for the efforts of Captain Bell to save the vessel, and for his example and leadership during and after its foundering.|$|E

50|$|Boyd {{was born}} in 1921 into a family long {{connected}} with the Scottish textile machinery industry. His lifelong work was considerably helped by an inheritance from his family, without which much of his work <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the end, {{the inquiry}} had a larger {{focus on the}} crews of the San Juan and S.C.T. Dodd. After {{interviewing}} survivors, it became disputed whether the crew acted appropriately towards the disaster or not. Turner claimed that either way, nothing <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to help passengers survive the sinking as {{there was no time}} for action. First Officer Charles Tulee of the San Juan reported a similar statement to the inquiry. The inquiry claimed the San Juan had veered off course. Third Officer Robert Papenfuss of the San Juan, despite having claimed the S.C.T. Dodd had been the ship which veered off course, was found guilty of negligence, leading to his license being revoked. Evidence surfaced after the inquiry's conclusion, proving that the S.C.T. Dodd had veered off course rather than San Juan, proving Papenfuss' innocence.|$|E
25|$|Scientists Emily Craig and Randall Bresee have {{attempted}} to recreate the likenesses of the shroud through the dust-transfer technique, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by medieval arts. They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it {{with a piece of}} linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes. However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.|$|E
25|$|Considerable scepticism is {{therefore}} warranted {{as to whether}} this type of south-pointing chariot, using a differential gear for the whole time, was used in practice to navigate over long distances. Conceivably, the south-pointing doll was fixed {{to the body of}} the chariot while it was travelling in straight lines, and coupled to the differential only when the chariot was turning. The charioteer could have operated a control to do this just before and after making each turn, or maybe shouted commands to someone inside the chariot who connected and disconnected the doll and the differential. This <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> without stopping the chariot. If turns were brief and rare, this would have greatly reduced the pointing errors, since they would have accumulated only during the short periods when the doll and differential were connected. However, it raises the problem of how the chariot could have been kept travelling in straight lines with sufficient accuracy without using the pointing doll.|$|E

500|$|Although the Olympus inquiry had {{questioned}} the auditors' signing {{off on the}} accounting treatment of preferred shares, and whether the handover from KPMG to Ernst & Young in 2009 was thorough, E's own review in turn questioned [...] "the thoroughness and accuracy" [...] of the Olympus inquiry's findings. The E concluded there were [...] "no problems with the handover {{in terms of the}} guidelines," [...] but were looking into what more <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> It further said that its powers of investigation were limited by their inability to question the outgoing audit firm.|$|E
