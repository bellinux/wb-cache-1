40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with {{an analysis of the}} differences in demand for meat, especially lamb and beef, between different regions in the United Kingdom. It represents an extension of earlier published work in which presented an analysis of the overall retail demand for meat in that country. It was shown that the quarterly retail demand for five types of meat (lamb and mutton, beef and veal, pork, poultry and non <b>carcase</b> <b>meat)</b> was related to prices of each type of meat and consumer incomes, and also that there were significant seasonal changes in demand which were different in their pattern for each type of meat...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the possible carriage of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and related species from faeces of farmed Red deer presented for slaughter and the contamination of deer <b>carcase</b> <b>meat</b> and venison products with these organisms. Experiments were conducted to study the growth patterns of Y. pseudotuberculosis in vacuum-packed venison stored at chilling and freezing temperatures. The serological status of slaughtered deer in regards to Y. pseudotuberculosis serogroups 1, 2 and 3 was assessed by Microplate Agglutination Tests. Forty sera were examined comprising 19 from positive and 20 from negative intestinal carriers. Included in this study was one serum from an animal that yielded <b>carcase</b> <b>meat</b> from which Y. pseudotuberculosis was isolated. Caecal contents were collected from 360 animals, and cold-enriched for 3 weeks before being subjected to bacteriological examination for Yersinia spp. A total of 345 and 321 carcases surface samples for bacteriological examination for Yersiniae were collected at the Deer Slaughter Premises (DSP) and meat Packing House respectively. A total of 70 venison sausages were purchased from local supermarkets. Direct plating and plating after 21 days cold-enrichment were carried out to examine for Yersiniae. Venison samples were obtained from the DSP and seeded with a known approximate number of Y. pseudotuberculosis organisms. The samples were vacuum-packed and stored at temperatures of + 10 °C, + 4 °C, - 1 °C, - 10 °C, - 13 ± 2 °C,and - 20 °C; recovery and enumeration of the test organism was made at predetermined times. The results of the Microplate Agglutination Tests showed that deer presented for slaughter at this DSP had low (1 : 10) or undetectable antibody titres to Y. pseudotuberculosis. The prevalence of Yersinia spp, in faeces was 5. 3 % (19 / 360) of Ypseudotuberculosis, 2. 6 % (9 / 360) of Y. enterocolitica. 3. 6 % (13 / 360) of Y. kristensenii, 20. 5 % (74 / 360) of Y. frederiksenii. 0. 6 % (2 / 360) of Y. intermedia and 0. 6 % (2 / 360) of Y. rohdei. Five of nine strains of Y. enterocolitica isolated were found to be potentially pathogenic by means of the virulence marker tests. Two of them were identified as biotype 3 serovar 0 : 5, 27. There was only one isolation (0. 3 %) of Y. pseudotuberculosis from 321 carcases sampled at the Packing House. The prevalence of Yersinia spp, in venison sausages was 11. 4 % (8 / 70) Y. enterocolitica. 1. 4 % (1 / 70) Y. kristensenii and 5. 7 % (4 / 70) Y intermedia. Y. pseudotuberculosis grew very well in vacuum-packed venison stored at chilling temperature although a long lag phase was observed at - 1 °C. When frozen, the organisms remained viable {{for a long period of}} time and recovered and multiplied rapidly when transferred to chill temperature. The study showed that there was no serological evidence of yersiniosis in deer presented for slaughter during the study period despite the fact that 5. 3 % of the animals were carrying Y. pseudotuberculosis in their faeces. While there was a low prevalence of Y. pseudotuberculosis on <b>carcase</b> <b>meat</b> their presence could be a source of cross contamination of other carcases especially during deboning. The finding of Yersiniae in venison sausages showed that there was contamination during their preparation. The multiplication of the bacteria in vacuum-packed venison and their long survival in frozen venison are of public health concern while its presence may affect export markets...|$|E

Syntaxin 1 B and GFAP were detected in many of the sponge samples taken along the slaughter line and in the chill rooms of all three abattoirs; GFAP was also detected in one sample of longissimus muscle (striploin) taken in the boning hall of one of the abattoirs but not in the other two abattoirs or in retail meats...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to determine whether}} active immunization against gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) induced a long-term suppression of testicular function in bulls, and to ascertain the effects of immunization against GnRH on <b>carcase</b> and <b>meat</b> quality characteristics. In experiment 1, 6 -month-old Zebu bulls were assigned to: control (n = 25), no treatment: immunized (n = 31). immunized against GnRH at 0 and 4 months (anti-GnRH(2)). with a sub-set of bulls (n = 17) immunized again at 10 months (anti-GnRH(3)). After the second immunization, testicular growth ceased for 2 months in 14 / 31 (45 %) bulls and for at least 6 months in 17 / 31 (55 %) bulls. Among the latter bulls (anti-GnRH 3) the testes did not grow for > 1 year after the third immunization in 5 / 17 (30 %) bulls. In experiment 2, 22 -month-old Zebu bulls were assigned to: control (n = 14), no treatment; immunized (n = 17), immunized against GnRH at 0, 2 and 4 weeks. The testes decreased (P < 0. 05) in size for 2 months after immunization in 11 / 17 (65 %) bulls and then re-initiated growth, whilst in 6 / 17 (35 %) bulls the testes continued to decrease in size for 4 months and did not re-initiate growth for 1 year. At slaughter, the latter immunocastrated bulls had <b>carcase</b> and <b>meat</b> quality characteristics the same as contemporary bulls that had been castrated before puberty. The findings demonstrated that active immunization against GnRH can induce a long-term suppression of testicular function in a proportion of bulls. Also, when bulls are immunocastrated after puberty, <b>carcase</b> and <b>meat</b> quality traits change from those typical of entire bulls to traits that are characteristic of long-term castrated bulls.

40|$|The New Zealand meat {{industry}} has been undergoing significant changes during the past decade. These changes have prompted the carrying out {{of research on the}} New Zealand meat industry and the likely development of new marketing systems. This paper deals with an investigation carried out with a view to recommending an improved marketing system relevant to the situation faced by the industry in the 1980 's. The research involved extensive interviews with senior management in many of the firms involved in the New Zealand meat industry and, from those interviews, the identification of the characteristics of the various sectors of the industry and the problems faced by the industry, especially in the marketing field. The survey of the industry was carried out between June and October 1981. From the results of the survey it was possible to identify two general sectors within the New Zealand meat industry. One sector is characterised by its ownership of killing facilities and the second sector is characterised by its marketing orientation. This second sector identified as a major problem the obtaining of product for its marketing operation. With the exception of this area, however, there was a high degree of consensus within the industry regarding the problems faced. A major problem identified by almost everyone interviewed was the instability of the United Kingdom lamb market. Since the United Kingdom market is often used as an indicator in the setting of prices in other markets, this instability can affect prices received for a large proportion of total New Zealand lamb exports. New markets were seen as presenting a further group of problems. Some are single buyer markets, and there is much concern as to the appropriate methods of supplying meat and setting prices for these markets. In other new markets there is a fear that market development is being stifled because of the inability of exporters to recoup market development costs. As soon as a market is developed to the stage where returns can be expected which are fully comparable with returns from other markets, new firms which have no need to recoup development costs enter the market. A third problem area which was identified by some was the development of vertical integration within the New Zealand meat industry. Firms which were once concerned only with the marketing of lamb have, largely because of worries about their ability to obtain meat for export, entered the field of killing and processing. On the other hand there is a feeling that some companies whose strength and major expertise lies in the operation of meat works have engaged in marketing largely because the meat is available to them. They may increase their perceived return by this action, but their marketing return may not be as high as that which could be achieved by a specialist company. Less specialisation within the industry may mean that the efficiency with which certain operations are carried out is reduced. When that possibility exists we cannot be sure that we are obtaining the highest possible returns from our meat for the nation. As a major step towards overcoming many of the problems outlined above, it is suggested that a <b>carcase</b> <b>meat</b> market be established in New Zealand through which the bulk of our <b>carcase</b> <b>meat</b> should be required to pass. Such a market would mean that all <b>carcase</b> <b>meat</b> was available for sale to licensed meat exporters, and so ensure that all potential exporters had access to product in a competitive market situation. This would also ensure that prices for meat were set in New Zealand, and that the demand from different markets around the world would be accurately expressed in the average prices achieved on the New Zealand market. In this way the problem of price dominance by the United Kingdom market would be overcome. A satisfactory price setting mechanism for single buyer markets would also be established. The separation of killing and marketing functions would encourage specialisation of operation, and meat would be made available to those companies which have the greatest marketing ability and therefore the ability to obtain and pay the best prices possible. There would be nothing to stop a company which had expertise in both fields from continuing to operate in both killing and marketing. The detailed operation of the carcase market is subject to further investigation, but at this stage it is suggested that it should operate on an electronic auction basis with product being sold daily. Market support judged necessary by the Meat Board could be provided {{at this stage of the}} marketing chain, as could any desired support for farmers provided by the Government. The objective in establishinq such a market would be to ensure that competitive pressures would guarantee the most efficient and profitable operation of the meat industry at all its stages. Returns to farmers and the nation should therefore be maximised...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} {{harmonised}} epidemiological indicators are proposed for food-borne biological hazards {{to public health}} {{that are related to}} bovine animals and meat thereof and that can be addressed within meat inspection. These hazards include Salmonella, pathogenicverocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, Cysticercus (Taenia saginata) and mycobacteria. An epidemiological indicator is defined as the prevalence or the concentration of the hazard at a certain stage of the food chain or an indirect measure of the hazard that correlates with the human health risk caused by the hazard. The indicators can be used by the European Commission and the Member States to consider when adaptations to meat inspection methods may be required, and to carry out risk analysis to support such decisions. It is foreseen that the indicators will be used in the bovine <b>carcase</b> <b>meat</b> safety assurance system outlined in the EFSA Scientific Opinion, particularly to help categorise farms/herds and slaughterhouses according to the risk related to the hazards as well as setting appropriate specific hazard-based targets in/on bovine carcases and, when appropriate, in bovine farms/herds. Depending on the purpose and the epidemiological situation risk managers should decide on the most appropriate indicator(s) to use, either alone or in combination, at national, regional, slaughterhouse or farm/herd level. It is recommended that risk managers should define the harmonised requirements for controlled husbandry conditions of farms, and the requirements for food chain information. Member States are invited to organise training regarding the implementation of the indicators and the reporting of data generated by the implementation in accordance with Directive 2003 / 99 /EC. The proposed indicators should be regularly reviewed in the light of new information and the data generated by their implementation...|$|E
40|$|Growth, conformation, <b>carcase</b> and <b>meat</b> quality {{traits of}} {{crossbred}} calves {{obtained in the}} Alps from selected Belgian Blue sires (BB) and Brown Swiss (BS), Simmental (Si) and Rendena (Re) dams were studied, emphasising differences on dairy and dual purpose maternal breed. Six pens with five heifers (3 BB BS, 1 BB Si, 1 BB Re) and six pens with four young bulls (2 BB BS, 1 BB Si, 1 BB Re) were used. In total 53 crossbred calves were tested: 30 from BS dams and 23 from dual purpose (12 from Si and 11 from Re dams). Growth performances were measured, carcases were scored for muscle conformation and fatness, the fifth rib was dissected, and the Longissimus thoracis (LT) was analysed. The maternal breed had significant effects when the calves from dairy cows (BB BS) were compared {{to those of the}} dual pur- pose breeds (BB Si and BB Re), as at slaughter the former were 1. 2 % taller, 6. 0 % less in vivo muscle score, 5. 0 % less carcase muscle score, with a 13 % greater proportion of bone in the rib, and their LT had 12. 5 % less drip losses, but 3 % greater cooking losses and 25 % greater shear force. It was concluded that when using a BB as a sire, the dam breed has influ- ence on the growth performance traits of the derived crossbreds, but the major influence would regard the <b>carcase</b> and <b>meat</b> quality traits. In the Alps, these differences are reflected in different sold prices of the crossbred calves from dairy and dual purpose breeds at local auctions...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to check the {{influence}} of broiler chicken origin on dressing percentage, meat yield and physicochemical traits of breast muscle quality. The comparative study was carried out in the period from 05. 01. to 16. 02. 2007 on three commercial: Cobb 500 (group I), Hybro G+ (group II) and Ross 308 (group III) meat chicken hybrids. The observed differences in the quality of <b>carcases</b> and <b>meat</b> of the examined commercial meat hybrids were statistically significant (p≤ 0. 05), and indicate that origin of the chickens is the main modifying factor.

50|$|Packing {{methods and}} meat grading {{could not be}} {{included}} in the archaeological investigation because samples of meat included in the investigation were highly disturbed, meaning they were not in situ {{at the time of their}} recovery. Conservation restraints made the excavation of intact casks too costly, however, analysis of both beef and pork carcasses artefacts recovered from William Salthouse found that these examples of imported salted meats would be indistinguishable from Australian terrestrial sites in Australia due to commonalities in butchering techniques. Similarities between the butcher marks on both ribs and vertebrae recovered from the wreck and Australian butchered meats from the First Government House make the cuts of meat indistinguishable. This similarity merits further consideration, since the square cutting of beef samples shows a high degree of similarity. Butchering practices are further complicated by factors such as type of <b>carcase,</b> quality, <b>meat</b> bearing capacity, consumer taste, economic climate and the source of trade training. The range of external factors that impact use of meat type require investigations to address the relationship of site occupants to forms of supply, and the butchering mark morphology and frequency.|$|R
40|$|In a Beef CRC project {{undertaken}} {{over the}} period 2001 - 2006, different combinations of beef cattle genetics, growth/nutritional pathways and calving seasons were examined across a number of sites in Southern Australia {{for their ability to}} achieve targeted market specifications. In this paper {{the focus is on the}} Western Australian experimental site. The target market was a heavy domestic steer of around 500 kg liveweight, and the steers were all Angus crossbreeds. Comparisons were made between Angus sires selected for high retail beef yield (RBY), for high intramuscular fat (IMF), and for both high RBY and high IMF. Three different growth treatments were imposed following weaning: (Fast ~ 1. 0 kg/day, then feedlot finishing; Slow ~ 0. 6 kg/day, then pasture finishing; Compensatory ~ Weight loss of approximately 10 per cent from weaning, over the next 4 - 5 months, followed by compensatory growth and pasture finishing). Autumn and Winter calving systems were also compared. The consequences on carcase weight, <b>carcase</b> and <b>meat</b> quality and enterprise profitability (as measured by enterprise gross margins) were then examined. The primary drivers of profitability for the cattle enterprises evaluated were weight gain and feed costs. Those sires selected for high RBY outperformed other sires in terms o...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} perceived that {{high quality energy}} and protein sources in diets for newly-weaned pigs, such as milk powders, lactose and cooked cereals, promote better performance after weaning. However, their higher cost and stability of supply sometimes requires nutritionists to explore potential for other ingredients {{for use in the}} formulation of weaner diets. Recent research in grower pigs demonstrated that lupins could be included at up to 350 g/kg in place of soybean meal, without compromising growth, <b>carcase</b> composition or <b>meat</b> quality (Kim et al., 2007). However, the use of lupins in a weaner diet to reduce or replace more expensive protein sources, such as milk products, has not been examined to date. The hypothesis tested was that increasing the concentration of whole or dehulled Australian sweet lupins in place of milk by-products such as skim milk powder and dried whey in a diet would reduce performance of weaner pigs...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the effect of recombinant porcine somatotropin (PST) and genetic selection on performance, <b>carcase</b> and <b>meat</b> quality traits of entire male and female pigs grown from 50 kg to 90 kg liveweight and fed ad libitum. Pigs of each sex were drawn from a selected and an unselected control line of common genetic origin and subjected to daily intramuscular injections of either 90 g PST or saline per kg body weight. The selected line had undergone a period of selection for low backfat (P 2) depth and high growth rate. The effects of PST and selection were additive for all traits. For performance traits, growth rate was increased 17 % by PST and 22 % by selection, food conversion ratio was reduced 20 % by PST and 14 % by selection. For carcase traits P 2 fat depth was reduced 15 % by PST and 14 % by selection. Both PST and selection caused a 1. 3 % reduction in killing out. For chemical composition of soft tissue, fat was reduced 9. 1 % by PST and 2. 4 % by selection, water was increased 6. 9 % by PST and 2. 2 % by selection, and protein was increased 2. 1 % by PST. For lean quality traits, PST had the slightly adverse effect of increasing paleness, cooking loss and firmness of certain muscles, particularly in males, but selection had no adverse effect. The changes brought about by PST could be accounted for by the repartitioning of metabolisable energy away from fat and toward protein whereas both repartitioning and increased appetite accounted for the effects of selection...|$|R

The final results showed that there was no significant negative affect for the dried medicinal crops on the performance and carcase traits. On the other hand a significant (p< 0. 01) positive flavour was indicated for the medicinal crop fed broilers compared to the control, when a cooked samples from breast were evaluated though a taste panel test using a Triangle test method.

40|$|Increasing {{lean meat}} yield % and {{redistribution}} of lean tissue to more highly priced {{parts of the}} carcase will increase its value. Selection for the Australian Sheep Breeding Value (ASBV) for greater post weaning eye muscle depth (PEMD) increased eye muscle area and weight of {{the eye of the}} short loin, although had minimal impact on <b>carcase</b> lean <b>meat</b> yield %. We hypothesised that selection using the PEMD-ASBV would increase saddle lean weight, without altering whole carcase lean weight when animals were compared at the same carcase weight Lamb carcases (ie 1218) from the Sheep CRC Information Nucleus were scanned in ‘quarters’ (fore, saddle, and hind) using Computed Tomography (CT) to determine fat lean and bone weights. Data was analysed using the allometric equation y=axb, fitted in its log-Iinearised form logy = log a +b. logx. Fixed effects were site-yeast sex, sire type, bulb-type rear-type and kill group within site-year, with random terms sire and dam by year. At a given carcase weight the lean tissue was 4. 2 % heavier (P< 0. 01), and fat 8. 7 % lighter in the whole carcase (P< 0. 05) across the 7 unit PEMD range. When compared at the same lean weight, the lean tissue in the saddle was 4. 9 % heavier (P< 0. 01), and lean in the forequarter was 4. 8 % lighter (P< 0. 01) across the PEMD range. Aligning with our hypothesis, there was more lean tissue in the saddle, although unexpectedly this was {{at the expense of the}} forequarter only. The mechanistic reason for this redistribution is not clear, and will be investigated with more extensive sampling from tissues across the carcase. In contrast to our hypothesis, PEMD was associated with increased total carcase lean, and reduced fat. The leaner and more muscular composition appears to be independent of maturity as there was not a corresponding increase in bone weight. These impacts on lean weight and distribution to the loin will increase carcass value...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} of the behaviour, {{physiology}} and meat quality of 24 -week-old male veal calves (mean live weight 234 kg) that were slaughtered either at the veal unit (the control group) or following 3 h transportation at space allowances of either 0. 7 or 0. 95 m 2 calf- 1 and 1. 5 h of lairage.

The transported calves did not lie down during the journey. There was no effect of space allowance on either the heart rate or frequency of potentially traumatic events during the journey or the plasma cortisol concentration and plasma creatine kinase activity sampled after the journey.
