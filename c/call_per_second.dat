This analysis application {{may become a}} performance bottleneck when monitoring several programs resulting in reduced monitoring quality or violated service level agreements of the monitored applications. We present an approach for elastic, distributed application-level monitoring for large software landscapes consisting of several hundreds of applications by utilizing cloud computing. Our approach dynamically inserts and removes worker levels to circumvent overloading the analysis master application without interrupting or pausing the actual live analysis of the monitored data. To evaluate our approach, we conduct an experiment in which we generate load - following a real workload pattern - on web applications in a 24 hour experiment. In our experiment, 160 monitored JPetStore instances generate roughly 20 million analyzed method <b>calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> in the peak. Furthermore, two worker levels are dynamically started and removed {{in line with the}} imposed workload on the monitored applications.

50|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the species Pseudacris triseriata (Chorus Frog) can be divided into two subspecies, P. t. maculata and P. t. triseriata, due to {{speciation}} events from mating call differences. The Chorus Frog has a very large home range, from New Mexico to Southern Canada. These two subspecies have an overlapping range from South Dakota to Oklahoma. In this overlapping range, both the call duration and the <b>calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for each species is much different than outside of this range. This means that calls of these two subspecies are more similar outside of this range, and starkly different within the range. For this reason, scientists suggest that these subspecies evolved from differences in mating call type. Additionally, these subspecies are rarely recorded to have hybrid offspring, which further suggests that there is complete speciation due to mating call differences. The differences in mating calls also help to reinforce the speciation process.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn extremal {{optimization}} algorithm for initial Java program placement on clusters of Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) is presented.

Java programs are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs in which tasks correspond to methods of distributed active Java objects that communicate using a RMI mechanism. The presented probabilistic extremal optimization approach {{is based on the}} local fitness function composed of two sub-functions in which elimination of delays of task execution after reception of required data and the imbalance of tasks execution in processors are used as heuristics for improvements of extremal optimization solutions. The evolution of an extremal optimization solution is governed by task clustering supported by identification of the dominant path in the graph. The applied task mapping is based on dynamic measurements of current loads of JVMs and inter-JVM communication link bandwidth. The JVM loads are approximated by observation of the average idle time that threads report to the OS.

40|$|In recent times, {{the usage}} of Voice and Video over Internet Protocol (VoIP) {{services}} has increased tremendously. There are many signaling protocols such as Bearer Independent Call Control (BICC), H. 323, Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), Session Initiation protocol (SIP) etc., that are used for establishment of sessions and to carry out voice and video data services. SIP has become popular because of its easy implementation, flexibility and good scalability. Choice of Open Source SIP server software (OS-SIP Server Software) is important when deploying in a VoIP based network. So we need to evaluate the performance of OS-SIP Server Softwares in an ideal condition before it is deployed to real environment. This document evaluates and compares the performance of three OS-SIP Server Softwares which are quite popular. A SIPp traffic generator tool is used to generate scenarios namely Registration with authentication, Registration without authentication, Session establishment, and Session establishment with response delay at User Agent Server (UAS) side. Using these scenarios, the performance of OS-SIP Server Softwares is evaluated with respect to parameters such as Registrations <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> <b>Calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> Response delay, and Percentage of successful calls and registrations. From the experimental results, we observed {{that there is a}} significant performance difference among the SIP server softwares.

40|$|Abstract. We {{carry out}} attacks using Internet {{services}} that aim to keep telephone devices busy, hindering legitimate callers from gaining access. We {{use the term}} DIAL (Digitally Initiated Abuse of teLephones), or, in the simple form, Dial attack, to refer to this behavior. We develop a simulation environment for modeling a Dial attack in order to quantify its full potential and measure the effect of attack parameters. Based on the simulation’s results we perform the attack in the real-world. By using a Voice over IP (VoIP) provider as the attack medium, we manage to hold an existing landline device busy for 85 % of the attack duration by issuing only 3 <b>calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and, thus, render the device unusable. The attack has zero financial cost, requires negligible computational resources and cannot {{be traced back to}} the attacker. Furthermore, the nature of the attack is such that anyone can launch a Dial attack towards any telephone device. Our investigation of existing countermeasures in VoIP providers shows that they follow an all-or-nothing approach, but most importantly, that their anomaly detection systems react slowly against our attacks, as we managed to issue tens of thousands of calls before getting spotted. To cope with this, we propose a flexible anomaly detection system for VoIP calls, which promotes fairness for callers. With our system in place it is hard for an adversary to keep the device busy for more than 5 % of the duration of the attack. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend of}} the service {{architectures}} developed in telecommunications today is {{that they should be}} open {{in the sense that they}} can communicate over the borders of different networks. Instead of each network having their own service architecture with their own applications, all networks should be able to use the same applications. 3 GPP, the organization developing specifications for the 3 G networks has specified the standard Open Service Access (OSA), as a part of the 3 G specification. OSA offers different Application Protocol Interfaces that enable an application that resides outside a network to use the capabilities of the network. This paper analyses the performance of an OSA gateway. It is examined how the overload control can be dealt with in a way to best satisfy the operators and the 3 'rd parties. There are some guiding principles in the specifications, but a lot of decisions have to be made by the implementors of application servers and OSA gateways. Proposals of different requirements for an OSA architecture exist such as, minimum amount of accepted <b>calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and time constraint for the maximal total delay for an application. Maximal and fair throughput have to be prioritized from the 3 'rd parties view, but profit is the main interest from the operators point of view.
