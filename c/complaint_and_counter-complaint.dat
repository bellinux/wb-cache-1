25|$|One {{academic}} has, however, {{suggested that}} rather than invoke legal sanctions, offensive speech of this nature should just be ignored. This is because legal sanctions chill free speech, which is a social good. Furthermore, complaining about wounding speech fuels inter-class hostility and ill-will and generates a culture of escalating <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> <b>counter-complaints,</b> resulting in a further net loss of speech.|$|R

5000|$|Cohn {{states in}} his {{autobiography}} that he was ordained as a rabbi in his native Hungary in the 1880s, though Jews doubted this claim. Yaakov Shalom Ariel writes that [...] "there could {{be little doubt that}} he was well read in rabbinical literature and had acquired, after his conversion to Christianity, a good knowledge of Christian theology as well." [...] Even his name was contested: Rabbi David Max Eichhorn writes that [...] "As early as October 13, 1893, Adolph Benjamin wrote in the Hebrew Standard that Cohn's real name was Itsak Leib Joszovics". In a 1913 court case, a number of people claiming to be Cohn's relatives and friends stated that Cohn was in fact Joszovics, a saloonkeeper who had been arrested and sentenced for fraud in Hungary in 1891, and that he left Hungary to avoid serving a {{two and a half years}} sentence, leaving behind his wife and children. [...] The relationship between Cohn and his detractors was acrimonious, resulting in several lawsuits <b>and</b> <b>counter-complaints.</b> Cohn denied the accusations and the court refused to act upon the charge.|$|R
40|$|Remedial sport {{hunting of}} {{predator}}s {{is often used}} to reduce predator populations <b>and</b> associated <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations. We assessed the effects of remedial sport hunting on reducing cougar <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations in Washington from 2005 to 2010 (6 years). The number of complaints, livestock depredations, cougars harvested, estimated cougar populations, human population and livestock populations were calculated for all 39 counties and 136 GMUs (game management units) in Washington. The data was then analyzed using a negative binomial generalized linear model to test for the expected negative relationship between the number of <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> depredations in the current year with the number of cougars harvested the previous year. As expected, we found that <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> depredations were positively associated with human population, livestock population, and cougar population. However, contrary to expectations we found that <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> depredations were most strongly associated with cougars harvested the previous year. The odds of increased <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations increased dramatically (36 to 240 %) with increased cougar harvest. We suggest that increased young male immigration, social disruption of cougar populations, and associated changes in space use by cougars - caused by increased hunting resulted in the increased <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations. Widespread indiscriminate hunting {{does not appear to be}} an effective preventative and remedial method for reducing predator <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations...|$|R
