50|$|Approved Drop out (or drop-out) {{ceilings}} {{allow the}} installation of a dropped ceiling beneath existing fire sprinklers because the tiles, sometimes called melt-out ceiling tiles, are heat sensitive and designed to fall from the dropped <b>ceiling</b> <b>suspension</b> grid {{in the event of}} a fire, allowing the sprinklers to do their job.|$|E
5000|$|On October 30, 2010, a two-ton {{piece of}} the ceiling {{collapsed}} into the building lobby. [...] The building was evacuated, and all suspended ceilings (some of which were also found to be coming loose) were removed before the building reopened after several days. [...] The University later reported that defective <b>ceiling</b> <b>suspension</b> anchors were at fault, and {{said there was no}} connection between the ceiling problems and the building's sustainable design.|$|E
5000|$|The {{measures}} were again implemented on December 31, 2012 being {{the start of}} the debt ceiling crisis of 2013 with the default trigger date ticking to February 2013. The crisis was deferred with the suspension of the limit on February 4, and the cancellation of the extraordinary measures. The {{measures were}} again invoked {{at the end of the}} <b>ceiling's</b> <b>suspension</b> on May 19, 2013 with the date of exhaustion of the resources and the default trigger date being estimated by Treasury as October 17. [...] The ceiling was again suspended by legislation on that date until February 4, 2014.|$|R

The 68" [...] sphere {{with a single}} seam at the equator weighs under 50 lb. The sphere {{is attached to the}} <b>ceiling</b> or <b>suspension</b> structure with a three-point suspension system to hold the sphere in place and reduce lateral movement. If the sphere moves, the images become un-focused. The cables are designed for strength yet small enough to blend into the background.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{insulation}} {{performances of}} floor/ceiling systems {{are yet to}} be fully understood as the mechanisms responsible for the transmission of sound are complex. An analytical model predicting the performances of such systems has been developped {{in order to develop}} and explain structures with improved insulation. The paper presents briefly the modelling approach and the accuracy of the predictions. The model, by focusing on the low frequencies range, employs a modal decomposition method. The solution relies neither on the periodicity of the stiffened <b>ceiling</b> panels or <b>suspension</b> system nor on the infinite extend of the floor. The quadratic vibration velocity of the ceiling panel is predicted. Comparisons are made between measurements and prediction...|$|R
40|$|Ergonomic {{problems}} of surgical lighting {{systems have been}} indicated by surgeons; however, the underlying causes are not clear. The aim of this dissertation is to assess the problems in detail, and subsequently clarify the underlying causes. In {{the first stage of}} the research, the observation method was used to quantify the luminaire use during 46 hours of open routine surgical procedures in the field of general surgery. The location of the observation study was the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis hospital in Delft, which employs the Berchtold Chromophare C series as the surgical lighting system. The results showed that every 7. 5 minute a luminaire action takes place, intended to reposition the luminaire. Of these LAs, 74 % was performed by surgeons and residents. For 64 % of these LAs the surgical tasks of OR-staff were interrupted. Observed difficulties were collision of the luminaire against any object, or that the luminaire was out of reach for the surgeon in a sitting posture. The primary difficulty appeared in the kinetic relation during the SLS and user interaction, as manoeuvrability of the luminaire was cumbersome and in some situations the system was immovable. These problems primarily occur during the repositioning of the luminaire 2 dimensional plane of the pendant arms. In the second research stage a valid simulation model of the surgical lighting system was constructed in MSC Adams software to allow virtual experiments to analyse the system mechanics. The model showed that the required force during luminaire usage depends on the location of the luminaire its work field and are on average higher than ergonomically acceptable. Primary cause of this difficulty with the current systems is the two pendant arms construction as the highest forces were found when the luminaire was directly below the <b>ceiling</b> <b>suspension</b> or in the peripheral region of the work field. In those regions the pendant arms are either in parallel or serial alignment. The force spectrum for luminaire use showed a diffuse image, ranging from 14 Newton till unlimited quantities when the system is unmovable. The average required force is 136 Newton in the region where the observed luminaire use was primarily undertaken. In addition, the software engineering model which was constructed in this study is applicable as a test procedure to analyse surgical lighting systems. As a result, this dissertation stated novel insights into the OR lighting problem during open routine surgical procedures in the field of general surgery. And it presented a valid simulation model of a surgical lighting system Berchtold Chromophare C series. The protocol for the model construction can be user to analyse surgical lighting system of different brands using engineering software simulation. Furthermore, this dissertation presented a direction for future research and an improved user system interaction of the luminaire during surgical procedures.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the transmission of sound in building elements such as floor/ceiling systems are complex and not yet fully understood. In an attempt to understand some of these phenomena, an analytical model was developed for finite and non-periodical floor/ceiling systems to predict their low frequency response to impact excitations. The finite dimensions of the structure are taken into consideration by adopting a modal approach whereby the displacements and pressure fields are expanded into infinite series of admissible functions. The solution relies neither on the periodicity of the stiffened <b>ceiling</b> panels or <b>suspension</b> system nor on the infinite extend of the floor. The paper presents briefly the modelling approach leading {{to the prediction of}} the quadratic vibration velocity of the ceiling panel. Finally, comparisons are made between measurements and prediction...|$|R
