50|$|The Majesty's engine {{features}} suction-piston-type fuel injection with a step-motor controlled, automatic {{idle speed control}} and throttle position sensor, an automatic decompression system and a dual-chamber airbox, air-injection system and catalyst. The fuel tank holds 3.7-gallons. The transmission is a double-cog V-belt constantly variable automatic transmission. The bike's controlled-fill (cast) aluminum alloy main frame has a steel tube subframe and 41 mm fork tubes and rear suspension with two long-travel coil-over shock absorbers. The cast wheels have 14-inch front and 13-inch rear tires. Braking is via 267 mm hydraulic front and rear disc brakes with a left handlebar-mounted parking brake lever. The bike's riding posture is between Standard and Cruiser. Bodywork features include an integrated passenger grab rail, locking underseat storage with 16 gallon capacity, two glove boxess (one lockable in the inner front apron), and LED taillight. Instrumentation includes analog speedometer and tachometer, LCD multifunction display with fuel gauge, <b>coolant</b> <b>temp</b> gauge, ambient temp gauge, V-belt and oil indicators.|$|E
