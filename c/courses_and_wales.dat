40|$|AbstractAfter fabric relaxation, {{there is}} a {{reduction}} in wale and course density due {{to a reduction in}} loop length and this actually will affect the fabric properties. Then, it is useful to find a relation between loop length and <b>courses</b> <b>and</b> <b>wales</b> per unit length as well as the yarn thickness because wales and courses per unit length can be easily measured at any state while it is difficult to measure the loop length in the knitted fabrics. Therefore, it is required to find an equation, through which the value of loop length can be easily calculated from the measured values of <b>courses</b> <b>and</b> <b>wales</b> per unit length at any state after the knitting process. In this work estimated equations to calculate the knitted loop length for open to normal structure and for normal to compact structure are developed. By comparing the value of the loop length predicted from this work with the other mentioned models, {{it was found that the}} calculated values are very near to the L value of the case study; so the developed equations are acceptable. The tightness factor and the porosity of single jersey fabrics were also calculated theoretically...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{conductive}} yarn can be knitted into fabrics to endow {{the traditional}} textile product with special attributes, such as shielding electromagnetic waves, detecting and transferring electrical signals, replacing {{fingers in the}} operation of touch-screen panels, etc. Research on the electrical properties of conductive knitted fabrics can {{contribute to the development of}} such functional textiles. A few studies have been conducted, and it has been found that the variation of the knitted structure can impact the properties of a conductive knitted fabric. Among the properties of conductive fabrics, the resistance value is an important index to decide the performance of electrical functions. Several researchers have conducted practical experiments and theoretical analyses to predict the resistance of plain weft knitted structure. However, in addition to the plain weft knitted structure, the float structure is another important basic knitted structure. Therefore, a geometric model incorporated with a simplified resistive network is proposed for the calculation of the electrical resistance of conductive knitted fabrics with float stitches and will be studied in this paper. The aim of the model is to determine the resistive effects of conductive float stitches on knitted structures with different numbers of knitted <b>courses</b> <b>and</b> <b>wales.</b> The geometric model can provide a detailed mathematical description of a single knitted loop in the Cartesian coordinate system. With the simplified resistive network, the resistance of conductive float stitches in knitted fabrics can be modeled and computed. The experimental results revealed that the proposed model could approximate the equivalent electrical resistance of the conductive float stitches in knitted fabrics to an acceptable degree.

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of elastane linear density and loop length on the stretch, recovery, and compression properties of the weft-knitted polyamide/elastane (PA/EL) stretchable fabrics used in sportswear. Two different tests were performed to study the stretch and recovery properties of the fabric 1 st: under low power force and 2 nd: cyclic loading under high tension force. Kikuhime pressure sensor was used to measure the pressure generated by different PA/EL knitted sample garment sleeves. It was found that with the increase in elastane linear density there is an increase in fabric course density, areal density, recovery percentage, and compression, and fabric stretch percentage and elongation percentage decreased in both <b>course</b> <b>and</b> <b>wale</b> direction.

The characteristics of fibre, the characteristics of knitwear structure, pattern of fabric and conditions of technological processes influence geometrical and {{dimensional stability}} of knitwear’s. The main goal of this work {{was to investigate the}} behaviour of knitted fabric during drying at different conditions, and the influence of these conditions on finished knitwear dimensional stability. The samples were knitted on a circular single face and interlock knitting machines from cotton yarns and their combination with PES yarns. Special method of knitted fabric drying was developed for the experimental testing. Thus industrial drying of knitted fabrics was simulated in experimental conditions. The samples were dried in six different modes: hanged on a line in <b>course</b> <b>and</b> <b>wale</b> directions, spread on a smooth surface, winded by hot air, spread on a heated surface, and in a tumbler-dryer. Shrinkage potential of knitwear samples dried in different conditions was determined. After that samples were washed and dried in domestic conditions.

40|$|Auxetic spacer fabrics are a novel kind of {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) fabric {{structure with}} a negative Poisson's ratio. They have found a number of applications in functional garments, protective pads and sportive shoes due to their unusual properties. In this paper, a study on deformation behaviors of 3 D spacer fabrics that could be fabricated {{on a large scale}} is reported. Through experimental observations of deformation of a basic hexagonal unit at different tensile strains, two different geometrical models are proposed for the fabric structure when extended in the <b>course</b> direction <b>and</b> <b>wale</b> direction, respectively. Based on the geometrical models, two semi-empirical equations between the Poisson's ratio and tensile strain are established for both tensile directions. The study shows that the established semi-empirical equations fit well with experimental results. Therefore, they could be used in the design and prediction of 3 D auxetic spacer fabrics with different values of geometrical parameters. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} tensile {{deformation}} behavior of an auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric structure {{by using the}} finite element (FE) method. The precise geometry of the outer layer structure of the fabric was firstly obtained from a micro X-ray computerized tomography scan and then inputted to an ANSYS 13. 0 software to generate geometrical models. The geometrical models were then meshed using the PLANE 183 element to build FE models. Based on the FE models built, deformation behaviors of the auxetic fabric in the <b>course</b> direction <b>and</b> <b>wale</b> direction were simulated and compared with experimental results. The FE analysis showed that the simulated fabric deformations at different tensile strains were {{very close to the}} real fabric deformations and the FE-generated Poisson's ratio-strain curves agreed well with the experimental ones. Therefore, the FE models could be used for predicting the deformation behaviors of the auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric stretched in different fabric plane directions.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate new models for the mechanical behaviour of knitted fabrics in quasi-static deformation from an initiallyrelaxed state to the extended state. In order to do so a mechanism for plain knitted structure deformation in plane was proposed, implemented and tested on a range of real samples. The problem of extension of a knitted structure is complicated by the combination of non-linear properties derived from both the characteristics of the knitted structure and the properties of the yam. To obtain a solution to this problem a finite-elementtechnique was used to evaluate the proposed model. The proposed model of mechanical behaviour of knitted fabrics is an analogue of the thin membrane problem in mechanics. The model developed is applicable to a wide range of mechanical problems where it is possible to assume that fabric is a thin membrane with zero bending rigidity. To facilitate the mechanical properties of the proposed model, standard dimensional parameters of fabric and yam combined with the mechanical properties have been used. With the purpose of obtaining important yam characteristics for the subsequent evaluation of the model, an advanced analysis of the yam path in plain knitted fabric was performed. An algorithm for loop geometry from the given fabric dimensions in <b>course</b> <b>and</b> <b>wale</b> directions <b>and</b> yam properties were developed. In order to implement the algorithms developed during this investigation complex software was written. This software allows simulation of the mechanical behaviour of different plain knitted structures under various loading and boundary conditions. At the approval stage of the model, a number of fabric samples were produced and tested; models of real samples have been simulated and compared with experimental data. The model used could be developed further to extend the application to tackle complex 3 D deformation and to simulate a range of different knitted structures...|$|R

A digital x-ray imaging system was {{coupled with a}} climatic chamber to control temperature and relative humidity during the cycle.

Finally, an image correlation process {{was used to compare}} the recorded images and to determine the 2 D strain. The deformations along <b>course</b> (εcc) <b>and</b> <b>wale</b> (εww) directions <b>and</b> the shear (εwc) were measured for four identical samples.

40|$|Temperature {{control of}} thermal fabrics has {{recently}} become {{a topic of}} interest. It was reported that the electrical resistance of fabrics embedded with conducting yarns can be affected by temperature change. In this paper the quantitative relationship between electrical resistance of a conductive knitted fabric and temperature was established. Based on this relationship, a theoretical model was proposed to control the temperature of conductive knitted fabrics in different <b>courses</b> <b>and</b> different <b>wales.</b> One important parameter of fabrics, which reflects how the electrical resistance of a fabric changes in percentage corresponding to the temperature change and is independent of the sizes of the fabrics, is the β value (=kαR 0, where k, α, R 0 are the electrical resistance decrease speed, thermal diffusivity and initial resistance of the fabrics). By analyzing the β value, initial resistance R 0 and thermal diffusivity α of the fabrics, satisfactory simulation of the experimental data was achieved by using the model, which indicates that the model {{can be used in}} temperature control in future applications.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{performance}} of hosiery made from a new fiber, polypropylene, with the performance of hosiery made from a better known fiber, nylon, and to get some indication of consumer reaction to a new textile product. Information was obtained through two wear tests and selected laboratory tests using different brands of hosiery with both fiber types represented. Two questionnaires were used as part of the wear tests. The first obtained information about the subjects and about some of their opinions concerning hosiery wear in general. The second questionnaire obtained information about the subjects' opinions concerning the hosiery worn in the wear tests. Thirty subjects participated in the first wear test with each wearing one pair of hosiery made of each fiber. Ten subjects participated in the second wear test, six of whom had also been part of the first test. The performance of the hosiery was checked by considering the number, severity and position of faults which occurred in relation to the number of days worn and by measuring to find the amount of stretch found in the worn hosiery. Laboratory tests were conducted to verify certain information obtained about the hosiery during the wear tests as well as to obtain further information about the hosiery. The questionnaires were analyzed by using percentages of the number responding to each part of each question. In this way, a general picture of the majority could be made to find out something about the subjects as a group and about their opinions of the hosiery. The wear life of the hosiery as shown by the number of days worn was related to the number of total faults found in the test hosiery. In addition, each type of fault, snags, runs, and abrasion marks, was considered. The two fiber types of hosiery were compared by testing to find if the differences between means were significant using F ratios. An additional check was made for covariance between the number of runs and the total days worn, and between the number of abrasion marks and the total days worn. All hosiery increased in width and decreased in length during the wear periods. The average amounts of dimensional change were analyzed by comparing the mean differences of the two fiber types of hosiery. The results were verified in the laboratory using a stretch and recovery test under controlled conditions. The differences in the means found in the laboratory test were checked for significance using F ratios. The rates of recovery were plotted on a time graph. An evaluation of the degree of fading was made by a panel of judges using a ranking system. The amount of, and the deviation from linear regression was found. Hosiery of both fiber types were washed in the laboratory and used as control groups to check with hosiery worn and washed by the subjects. Four laboratory tests were conducted to help describe the hosiery used in the study and to supply further information as to the differences in performance of hosiery made of polypropylene and of nylon. The yarn numbers <b>and</b> the <b>course</b> <b>and</b> <b>wale</b> counts were found. Yarn breaking strengths and the percents of elongation were analyzed by using a t test. Standard deviations checked the amounts of variation from the means. The same types of analyses were done to compare the two fiber types of hosiery as to the differences found in the bursting strengths of the knee and toe areas of the hosiery. In addition the F ratios were also found...|$|R
