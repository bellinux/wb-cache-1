40|$|A slow {{rate of curing}} and {{the long}} time {{necessary}} to achieve full strength has led cold asphalt mixes (CAM) to be considered poorer in comparison to hot mix asphalt over the last decades. This piece of research aimed {{to develop a new}} fast-curing and environmentally friendly cold asphalt concrete for binder courses mixture (CACB). It has the same gradation as that of traditional hot asphalt concrete mixtures but incorporates a binary blended <b>cementitious</b> <b>filler</b> (BBCF) containing waste, high calcium fly ash (HCFA) and fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue (FC 3 R) activated by a waste alkaline NaOH solution. The research concludes that incorporating an alkali activated binary blended <b>cementitious</b> <b>filler</b> (ABBCF) with CACB significantly improves the mechanical properties and water susceptibility. In addition, the high performance ABBCF mixture has a substantial lower thermal sensitivity than traditional hot asphalt concrete binder course mixtures. SEM analysis revealed that the main crystallisation had taken place at an early stage of the new ABBCF. More significantly, the new CACB mixture has a comparable stiffness modulus with the traditional asphalt concrete binder course after a very short curing time (less than one day) ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} {{the performance of}} concrete mixtures incorporating 5 %, 7. 5 % and 10 % of discarded tyre rubber as aggregate and cement replacements was investigated. Numerous projects have been conducted on replacement of aggregates by crumb rubbers but scarce data are found on <b>cementitious</b> <b>filler</b> addition in the literature. Hence to examine characteristics of tyre crumb-containing concrete, two sets of concrete specimens were made. In the first set, different percentages by weight of chipped rubber were replaced for coarse aggregates {{and in the second}} set scrap-tyre powder was replaced for cement. Selected standard durability and mechanical test were performed and the results were analysed. The mechanical tests included compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity. The durability tests included permeability and water absorption. The results showed that with up to 5 % replacement, in each set, no major changes on concrete characteristics would occur, however, with further increase in replacement ratios considerable changes were observed...|$|E
40|$|Superfine cement is {{a cement}} {{ground to a}} much higher {{fineness}} than ordinary cement. The addition of a small quantity of superfine cement to fill into the voids of ordinary cement can improve the packing density of the cement and thereby {{reduce the amount of}} mixing water needed to fill the voids. In this study, the effects of superfine cement on the packing density of cement (directly measured by a wet packing test), the water film thickness of cement paste (taken as the excess water to solid surface area ratio), and the flowability, rheology and strength of cement paste were investigated. The results showed that the addition of 10 % to 20 % superfine cement can significantly increase the packing density of the cement and the water film thickness of the cement paste. Such increases in packing density and water film thickness would then improve the flowability, rheology and strength of the cement paste. Hence, superfine cement is an effective <b>cementitious</b> <b>filler</b> for improving cement performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{objective of}} this study was to define such a cement composite with the addition of white (ladle) slag, which will provide functionality for selected purposes and furthermore, prevent the leaching of toxic elements into the environment. The recovery (recycling) of secondary metallurgical slags from stainless steel production has an important synergistic impact on the environment. In this study, detailed characterization of slag derived from two different ladle refining processes of stainless steel production has been performed. In order to assess its potential for use as a supplementary cementitious material, slag cement composites as well as slag itself were investigated. A comparative study of reference cement composites and cement composites to which a conventional supplementary <b>cementitious</b> material (limestone <b>filler)</b> had been added, was also performed.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the detailed {{investigation of the}} combined effect of the <b>cementitious</b> materials (<b>Fillers)</b> on the fresh and hardened properties of Self Compacting Concrete (SCC). Totally four cementitious blends like Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), Fly ash (FA), Marble Powder (MP) and Lime stone powder (LP) were used for this study. The investigation includes the Binary effect (OPC+FA), Ternary effects (OPC+FA+LP or OPC+FA+MP) and Quaternary effect of fillers (OPC+FA+LP+MP) in the fresh and strength properties of SCC. The Control mixture contained Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) with 25 % of Fly ash (FA) {{by the weight of}} OPC, while the remaining mixtures incorporated with MP and LP. The use of fillers (LP and MP) reduced the cost as well as the hydration in cement. The total binder content of 550 kg/m 3 and water binder ratio of 0. 34 were taken as constant for all the mixes. This paper {{presents the}} experimental investigation of fresh properties like Slump flow test, L Box, U Box,V funnel and T 50 time and the Hardened properties in the strength aspects like Compressive strength, Split tensile strength and the Flexure strength were carried out for all the mixes and the results were compared with the control mix. Based on the results the feasibility of using the filler in SCC was studied. As a whole, all the mixes satisfy the workability characteristics of SCC. But the mix combined with all the fillers produced better results in strength aspects as well as workability aspects than all other mixes...|$|R
40|$|Internationally {{a debate}} has been {{on-going}} {{about the influence of}} active or inactive fillers when recycling pavement materials with foamed bitumen or bitumen emulsion. A research project carried out during the last few years investigated the effect of a number of cementitious binders and inactive fillers on the dry and soaked Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) of a recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) material and foamed bitumen or a bitumen emulsion. The aim of the paper is to present {{the results of the study}} to provide guidance for future use. The research programme conducted tests on a RAP material using 1, 5 % of a range of cementitious stabilization agents with various percentages of foamed bitumen and bitumen emulsion binder content. An experimental design matrix covering quantities of binder, type of binder and type of filler was presented. It was found that inactive fillers had no influence on the dry or soaked ITS compared with the bitumen emulsion or foamed bitumen treated materials without any <b>filler.</b> <b>Cementitious</b> binders resulted in increased ITS values for both bituminous materials. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study on full-depth reclamation (FDR) of pavements with foamed asphalt {{has been completed}} for the California Department of Transportation by the University of California Pavement Research Center. A literature review revealed that very little research had been carried out on the reclamation of thick asphalt pavements (multiple overlays over a relatively weak base or subgrade). A mechanistic sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify key variables {{in the design of}} recycled pavements consisting primarily of recycled asphalt pavement. The findings of this analysis and the literature review were used to formulate a work plan for laboratory and field studies to address issues specific to recycling these thick asphalt pavements. A number of FDR projects were observed {{during the course of the}} study. Material was collected for a comprehensive laboratory investigation, which identified a number of key issues pertaining to mix design, including appropriate test methods for California, preparation of specimens (mixing moisture content and aggregate temperature), asphalt binder selection, target asphalt and active filler contents, aggregate gradations (fines content), specimen curing, and the interpretation of results. Visual assessments and Falling Weight Deflectometer testing were also carried out on selected projects at regular intervals. The study concluded that FDR with foamed asphalt combined with a <b>cementitious</b> <b>filler</b> is an appropriate pavement rehabilitation option for California. Projects should be carefully selected with special care given to roadside drainage. Appropriate mix and structural design procedures should be followed, and construction should be strictly controlled to ensure that optimal performance and life are obtained from the pavement. The following recommendations are made: 1) FDR with foamed asphalt combined with a <b>cementitious</b> <b>filler</b> should be considered as a rehabilitation option on thick, cracked asphalt pavements on highways with an annual average daily traffic volume not exceeding 20, 000 vehicles. The technology is particularly suited to pavements where multiple overlays have been placed over relatively weak supporting layers, and where cracks reflect through the overlay in a relatively short time. Higher traffic volumes can be considered provided that adequate strength and durability can be achieved with the in-place materials. Alternatively, the recycled layer can be used as a subbase under a new base layer. 2) Project selection, mix design, and construction should be strictly controlled to ensure that optimal performance is obtained from the rehabilitated roadway. 3) Full-depth reclamation with asphalt emulsions and partial-depth reclamation with asphalt emulsions and foamed asphalt should also be evaluated, and guidelines prepared for choosing the most appropriate technology for a given set of circumstances.

40|$|Abstract. The Supercontainer (SC) is a {{reference}} concept, {{adopted by the}} Belgian Agency for Radioactive Waste and Enriched Fissile Materials (ONDRAF/NIRAS), for the packaging of high level vitrified radioactive waste (HLW) and spent fuel (SF). The waste package consists of different components all designed to fulfil specific functions. One of these is a carbon steel overpack developed to prevent contact of the waste with the engineered barrier system and the host geological formation during the thermal phase. Another is a concrete buffer and <b>cementitious</b> <b>filler,</b> both developed to provide a high pH environment during at least the thermal phase, which ensures passivation of the overpack and provides radiological shielding during construction and handling of the SC. Finally, {{the presence of an}} outer steel envelope serves as a mould for the casting of the outer buffer while providing additional mechanical strength and confinement during transportation and handling of the waste package. As part of the first safety and feasibility case (SFC- 1), ONDRAF/NIRAS has to demonstrate that no fundamental flaws exist regarding the feasibility to construct the SC. To this end, ONDRAF/NIRAS established a research programme consisting of desk studies, modelling, theoretical development and experimental testing. The primary objective of the experimental testing programme is to demonstrate the feasibility to construct the SC. This paper describes the test’s setup and design and provides a summary of the main observations obtained during an experimental test performed to evaluate the construction feasibility of the SC. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{micronized}} sand {{is selected}} {{as a kind}} of filler to partially replace cement in <b>cementitious</b> materials. This <b>filler</b> is considered as chemically inert material, which can not react with water or hydration products, but still indirectly influences the hydration in a positive way. In the experimental program, non-evaporable water test was carried out to determine the degree of hydration of cement paste with and without micronized sands. The influence of different finenesses of sand particles, 240 m 2 /kg, 400 m 2 /kg and 1300 m 2 /kg, and different curing ages were investigated. The SEM image analysis was used to characterize the morphological changes of microstructure by the presence of the micronized sand during the cement hydration process. Hydration reaction is enhanced by the use of inert micronized sands. The fineness of micronized sands influences the degree of hydration a lot. The fineness factor has been taken into account in the simulation. There is a clear interface area between sand particle and hydration products...|$|R
50|$|SCC can be {{used for}} casting heavily {{reinforced}} sections, places where there can be no access to vibrators for compaction and in complex shapes of formwork which may otherwise be impossible to cast, giving a far superior surface than conventional concrete. The relatively high cost of material used in such concrete continues to hinder its widespread use in various segments of the construction industry, including commercial construction, however the productivity economics take over in achieving favorable performance benefits and works out to be economical in pre-cast industry. The incorporation of powder, including supplementary <b>cementitious</b> materials and <b>filler,</b> can increase the volume of the paste, hence enhancing deformability, and can also increase the cohesiveness of the paste and stability of the concrete. The reduction in cement content and increase in packing density of materials finer than 80 µm, like fly ash etc. can reduce the water-cement ratio, and the high-range water reducer (HRWR) demand. The reduction in free water can reduce the concentration of viscosity-enhancing admixture (VEA) necessary to ensure proper stability during casting and thereafter until the onset of hardening. It has been demonstrated that a total fine aggregate content ("fines", usually sand) of about 50% of total aggregate is appropriate in an SCC mix.|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact can be minimised by {{making use of}} many industrial wastes in a sustainable manner. Recycling and reutilisation of industrial waste and by-products {{is of paramount importance}} in cement and concrete industry. In view of rapid infrastructure growth, there is an emerging need for development of <b>cementitious</b> materials or <b>fillers</b> either to replace cement or fine aggregate for stable growth. One of the industrial wastes is secondary aluminium dross. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the mechanical and durability aspects of concrete incorporated with secondary aluminium dross. Cement has been partially replaced by secondary aluminium dross in different proportions to study the mechanical and durability aspects. Various properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, sorptivity, water absorption, rapid chloride penetration have been studied for the usefulness of secondary aluminium dross as construction material. It is observed that up to 15 % replacement of cement by secondary aluminium dross, the responses are comparable with the conventional concrete. Studies have also been carried out by adding other supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash and silica fume in various proportions along with secondary aluminium dross and found the improved mechanical and durability properties. From the overall study, it can be concluded that the concrete incorporated with secondary aluminium dross can be used for making paver blocks, refractory bricks and for normal concrete strength applications...|$|R
40|$|The overall solid packing see {{mix design}} method of Brouwers and Radix was {{modified}} by developing an optimisation tool, facilitating the proportioning normal weight SCCs (NWSCCs) and L WSCCs. The method comprised two concepts: filling the voids within the loosely packed aggregate fraction with appropriate paste and comparing the overall {{particle size distribution}} (PSD) of solids in the mix with the model PSD. To implement this method, the influence of supplementary <b>cementitious</b> materials (SCMs), <b>fillers</b> and chemical admixtures on the paste properties was investigated; moreover, physical properties and packing of normal and lightweight aggregates (L W As) were studied. The influence of two L WAs, three superplasticisers and three SCMs/fillers on the fresh properties and compressive strength of LWSCCs was evaluated, followed by a detailed study on L WAs and SCMs/fillers effect on engineering and durability properties of L WSCCs. The proposed mix design modification yielded highly flowable, strong and durable L WSCCs for structural precast applications. Successful LWSCCs required carefully optimised paste composition and paste/aggregate content. L W As water absorption characteristics and cement-superplasticiser compatibility strongly influenced workability and workability retention of LWSCCs. The effect of aggregate composition and aggregate/paste content on fresh, hardened and durability properties of structural NWSCCs was studied. The proposed mix design allowed manufacturing NWSCCs with moderate workability, high strength and paste content lower than typically reported. Most of NWSCCs properties correlated with the average spacing between the aggregate particles, allowing for engineering of NWSCC properties by its adjustment.

40|$|Cement, a main {{composition}} of concrete, {{is the major}} contributor to the greenhouse effect. During the production of cement, {{a significant amount of}} carbon dioxide is released to the environment. As the world is moving towards a more sustainable environment, the durability of concrete becomes a concern. The durability of concrete can be improved with proper quality control and resistivity measurement is one of the methods used to indicate the quality of concrete. Because of the importance of resistivity, the present study is to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} electrical resistivity of concrete. The effect of various concrete mixtures to concrete resistivity is examined in this study. For the evaluation, surface resistivity is measured on 150 mm concrete cubes. The concrete mixtures involves different combination of paste volume, W/C ratio, curing condition and supplementary <b>cementitious</b> materials / <b>fillers.</b> The supplementary <b>cementitious</b> materials are pulverised fuel ash (PFA), condensed silica fume (CSF) and the filler is limestone fines (LF). While PFA and CSF are used as cement replacement, the LF is used for the substitution of cement paste. The results have indicated that the electrical resistivity is affected by the paste volume, W/C ratio, curing condition and the combination of PFA, CSF and LF. Concrete resistivity increases as a result of a decrease in paste volume. A strong correlation exists between the W/C ratio and the surface resistivity. The R^ 2 = 0. 9211 and 1 for 30 % and 34 % paste volume respectively. Also, the curing condition affect the moisture content of the concrete. The surface resistivity is higher for a drier surface. With the addition of PFA, CSF and LF, the surface resistivity increases significantly. The present study also examines the correlation between surface resistivity and different concrete properties such as compressive strength, moisture content, water penetration and rapid chloride penetration. The results shows that there is a strong correlation between surface resistivity and compressive strength for plain mixtures with R^ 2 = 1. However, this correlation decrease with the addition of other cementitious materials. As a result, the correlation would be better for a separated resistivity curve for different cementitious materials. The surface resistivity and the water penetration only has a moderate correlation. For plain mixtures, the correlation value is R^ 2 = 0. 6814. R^ 2 = 0. 7069 is the correlation value for concrete mixtures with PFA and CSF. Finally, there is a strong relationship between rapid chloride penetration and the surface resistivity. The surface resistivity is inversely proportional to the rapid chloride penetration with a correlation of R^ 2 = 0. 9472. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{emission}} {{from ordinary}} Portland cement manufacturing {{is one of}} the major sustainability issues facing the concrete industry. In fact, the annual worldwide CO 2 emission from cement manufacturing is nearly 7 % of the global emissions. Roughly 60 % of these emissions come from the calcination of limestone, the main raw material for making Portland-cement clinker. The remaining CO 2 emission is as a result of fuel combustion required to generate the heat necessary for the reactions forming clinker. Although considerable gains in energy efficiency have been achieved during the production of cement for the last two decades, calcination of limestone is the major concern as a source of CO 2 emissions. Utilization of high-volume of by-products or natural pozzolanic material, such as basaltic ash pozzolan or fly ash as a replacement of Portland cement clinker, is a possible approach to reduce the clinker factor of Portland cement. In addition, self-consolidating concrete mixtures are being increasingly used for the construction of highly reinforced complex concrete elements and for massive concrete structures such as thick foundation due to its technical advantages such as shortened placement time, labor savings, improved compaction, and better encapsulation of rebar. Self-consolidating concrete requires utilization of high dosage of a plasticizing agent or viscosity-modifying chemical admixtures. The purpose of this study is to develop highly flowable self-consolidating concrete mixtures made of high proportions of cement replacement materials such as basaltic ash pozzolan, fly ash and pulverized limestone instead of high dosage of a plasticizer or viscosity-modifying admixtures, and characterize the effects of Portland cement replacement on the strength and durability. The two replacement materials used are high-volume finely-ground basaltic ash, a Saudi Arabian aluminum-silica rich basaltic glass and high-volume Class-F fly ash, from Jim Bridger Power Plant, Wyoming US. As an extension of the study, limestone powder was also used to replace Portland cement, alongside finely-ground basaltic ash and Class-F fly ash, forming ternary blends. Along with compressive strength tests, non-steady state chloride migration, water absorption and gas permeability tests were performed, as durability indicators, on self-consolidating concrete (SCC) specimens. The results were compared to two reference concretes; 100 % ordinary Portland cement and 85 % ordinary Portland cement – 15 % limestone powder by weight. The high-volume of basaltic pozzolan and fly ash concrete mixtures showed strength and durability results comparable to those of the reference concretes at later ages; identifying that both can effectively be used to produce low-cost and environment–friendly self-consolidating concrete without utilizing viscosity-modifying admixture. Even though the slump flow diameter of SCC specimens was held in the similar range by utilizing varied amount of water reducer admixture, they were not identical. To enable a precise comparison among the specimens, the mortar specimens were produced that had same cement–replacement ratios with the ones in SCC specimens utilizing basaltic ash pozzolan (NP), Class-F fly ash (FA) and limestone powder without using water reducer admixture. Overall the binary and ternary FA samples had higher strength than NP mortar samples up to 1 year. This can be attributed to the higher pozzolanic reactivity of FA compared to NP which is supported by X-ray diffraction, isothermal calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The normal consistency and setting time of the mixtures were determined. It showed that cement replacement with limestone powder in the ternary blended cements containing either basaltic ash pozzolan or Class-F fly ash along with ordinary Portland cement lowered the initial and final time of setting relative to the binary blended cements containing similar ratio of cement replacement. Also, the water demand of mixtures incorporate with basaltic ash pozzolan was greater than the one with Class-F fly ash. The influence of the basaltic ash pozzolan, Class-F fly ash and limestone powder in the binary and ternary Portland cement blends is discussed, while following the physicochemical changes such as crystalline transition, hydration kinetics, and mechanical property that are a direct result of the addition of supplementary <b>cementitious</b> material or <b>filler.</b> Selected cement pastes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), petrographic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, isothermal calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Integrating these techniques helps to understand the fresh and hardened properties of concretes and brings new insight into the effect of basaltic ash pozzolan, Class-F fly ash and limestone powder on the hydration of Portland cement. Isothermal calorimetry analysis presents that the addition of limestone powder, for instance, increased the rate of hydration reaction relative to the control specimen. This suggests that as a result of the further participation of aluminate phases in hydration reaction, the hydration products were improved. This outcome was confirmed with the analysis of XRD results by the finding carboaluminates in the limestone powder containing blended cements. It is important to note that the enhancement of hydration reaction was not adequate to compensate for the dilution effect due to addition of limestone powder. While the replacement of ordinary Portland cement with Class-F fly ash retarded the rate of hydration reaction relative to the one with basaltic ash pozzolan at first, the reactivity of Class-F fly ash improved after 2 days of hydration and surpassed the cumulative heat of hydration of basaltic ash pozzolan. This result is supported by TGA analysis demonstrating that the mixtures containing Class-F fly ash had more hydrate water with respect to the one of with basaltic ash pozzolan. XRD analysis showed that the addition of limestone powder in the ternary cement containing either basaltic ash pozzolan or fly ash led to stabilize the transformation of ettringite to monosulfate and introduce the carboaluminates in the hydration products. TGA analysis indicated that the degree of pozzolanic reaction of fly ash was higher than the one with basaltic ash in the binary and ternary blended mixtures. For a comprehensive analysis and quantification of emissions and global warming potential (GWP) from concrete production, life-cycle assessment was used on the concrete mixture containing Class-F fly ash. It is found that high volume, up to 55 % by weight replacement of ordinary Portland cement with Class-F fly ash, or Class-F fly ash and limestone powder produces highly workable concrete that has high 28 -day and 365 -day strength, and extremely high to very high resistance to chloride penetration along with low GWP for concrete production...|$|R
