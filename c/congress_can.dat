5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} country's history, {{voluntary}} acquisition {{or exercise}} of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship. This concept was enshrined {{in a series of}} treaties between the United States and other countries (the Bancroft Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), as well as Vance v. Terrazas (1980), holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Section 3 {{prohibits the}} {{election}} or appointment to any {{federal or state}} office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion or treason. However, a two-thirds vote by each House of the <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> override this limitation. In 1898, the Congress enacted a general removal of Section 3's limitation. In 1975, the citizenship of Confederate general Robert E. Lee was restored by a joint congressional resolution, retroactive to June 13, 1865. In 1978, pursuant to Section 3, the Congress posthumously removed the service ban from Confederate president Jefferson Davis.|$|E

25|$|The {{power of}} a {{president}} to fire executive officials {{has long been a}} contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove purely executive officials at will.

25|$|The term <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> also {{refer to}} a {{particular}} meeting of the legislature.

Members of the Senate are referred to as senators; members of the House of Representatives are referred to as representatives, congressmen, or congresswomen.|$|E

25|$|The Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 {{extended}} congressional {{power of}} taxation to include income taxes without apportionment among the several States, and {{without regard to}} any census or enumeration. The Constitution also grants Congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds, and this power of the purse is one of Congress's primary checks on the executive branch. <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> borrow money on the credit of the United States, regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, and coin money.

If a U.S. citizen were to move to the District, that person would lose the ability to vote for a member of the Congress. U.S. citizens who have permanently left the United States are still permitted to vote absentee for the Congress in the state where they last held residency. Scholars have argued that if U.S. citizens who are residents of other countries are allowed to vote in federal elections, then the <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> extend the same rights to residents of the nation's capital.|$|E

As corporate entities, cities have the power to take, purchase, receive, hold, lease, convey, and dispose of real and personal property for its general interests, condemn private property for public use (eminent domain), contract and be contracted with, sue and exercise all the powers conferred to it by Congress.

25|$|Members of <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> {{object to}} any state's vote count, {{provided}} objection {{is presented in}} writing and is signed {{by at least one}} member of each house of Congress. An objection supported by at least one senator and one representative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of Congress; after both Houses deliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed. A state's certificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection. In that case, the votes from the State in question are simply ignored. The votes of Arkansas and Louisiana were rejected in the presidential election of 1872.|$|E
25|$|We risk {{erosion of}} First Amendment liberties unless we train our {{vigilance}} upon the methods whereby obscenity is condemned {{no less than}} upon the standards whereby it is judged. Questions of procedural safeguards loom large {{in the wake of}} an order such as the one before us. Among them are: (a) whether <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> close the mails to obscenity by any means other than prosecution of its sender; (b) whether Congress, if it can authorize exclusion of mail, can provide that obscenity be determined in the first instance in any forum except a court, and (c) whether, even if Congress could so authorize administrative censorship, it has in fact conferred upon postal authorities any power to exclude matter from the mails upon their determination of its obscene character.|$|E

25|$|A {{little less}} than two decades earlier, in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), the Court had held that <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> {{abrogate}} state sovereign immunity pursuant to its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment, which clearly contemplates limiting {{the power of the}} states. In Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1 (1989), the Court had held that Congress could also abrogate sovereign immunity under the Commerce Clause - but there was no majority in that decision. Justice Brennan was joined by three other justices in asserting that the Eleventh Amendment {{was nothing more than a}} reflection of common law sovereignty that could be swept aside by Congress; Justice Scalia was also joined by three other justices in taking the opposite view; and Justice Byron White wrote a separate opinion holding that Congress had such power, but stating his disagreement with Brennan's opinion (but not his own rationale).|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{also has}} a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this {{is dependent on the}} actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around {{the same time as the}} People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 Bill, H.R. 2389, to {{prohibit}} the Supreme Court's and most federal courts from considering any legal {{challenges to the}} government's requiring or promoting of the Pledge of Allegiance, died in the Senate after having passed in the House. This action is viewed in general as court stripping by Congress of the constitutional power of the Judiciary. Even if a similar bill is enacted, its practical effect may not be clear: proponents of the bill have {{said that it is}} a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, but opponents say Congress does not have the authority to prevent the Supreme Court from hearing claims based on the Bill of Rights, since amendments postdate the original text of the Constitution and may thus implicitly limit the scope of Article III, Section 2. Judges and legal analysts have said that if <b>Congress</b> <b>can</b> remove from the judicial branch the ability to determine if legislation is constitutional, the US separation of powers would be disturbed, or rendered non-functional.|$|E
