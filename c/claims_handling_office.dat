40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} a comparative legal analysis of wrongful <b>claims</b> <b>handling</b> {{by insurance companies}} in indemnity and liability insurance. From the outset, {{it is clear that}} {{it may be difficult to}} draw the line between legitimate claims denial and refusal to pay, on the one hand, and malicious protraction, procrastination and rejection of valid claims, on the other hand. Therefore, it is interesting to find that European legal systems diverge considerably in their stance against wrongful <b>claims</b> <b>handling.</b> In some legal systems, the issue of wrongfulness does not seem to play a significant role. There, the focus is on less value-laden concepts such as delay, default and the imputability of the delay. The result is that, at some point in time, statutory interest may become due. Sometimes, additional damages may be claimed as well. In other legal systems, ‘bad faith’ is considered a special category for all insurance contracts, allowing an escape from the limited amounts paid by way of interest. Again other legal systems seem to regard the obligation to pay interest as the only consequence of wrongful <b>claims</b> <b>handling.</b> The analysis of the different approaches towards wrongful <b>claims</b> <b>handling</b> shows that there are different solutions not only across legal systems but also within jurisdictions. Tort law and insurance law may have to compete with alternative sources of law such as insurance business regulation. Given the wide variety of positions, the Principles of European Insurance Contract Law (PEICL) seem to go beyond merely restating the current common core...|$|R

Therefore, excellence in <b>claims</b> <b>handling</b> gives an insurance company a competitive edge over its competitors.

Using a structured questionnaire, the study adopted exploratory research design using a simple random sampling technique. Inferential statistical method of Chi-square test was used to analyze the data in order to determine if there is any significant relationship between the variables in each hypothesis. The study reveals that there is a significant relationship between claims operation and effective claims management. It also reveals that there is a significant relationship between fraud detection and effective claims management. In order to strengthen these roles, it is recommended that head of claims should be part of top management team, staff in claims department must be exposed to training and insurance companies must internalize organizational philosophy on <b>claim</b> <b>handling</b> process. </p...|$|R
