5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E

50|$|A {{cable-stayed}} system assumes all {{static and}} dynamic loads {{on which the}} very existence of the bridge depends. <b>Cable</b> <b>stays</b> are not designed to endure the entire lifetime of the bridge, but they are repairable and have the best possible protection from natural disasters and other adverse impacts.PSS <b>cable</b> <b>stays</b> consist of parallel strands of 15.7 mm diameter; every strand consists of seven galvanized wires. <b>Cable</b> <b>stays</b> incorporate from 13 to 79 strands. The length of the shortest <b>cable</b> <b>stay</b> is 135.771 m; the longest, 579.83 m.

The total length of the bridge is [...] with length over water at , making it the longest bridge in Malaysia and the longest in Southeast Asia. China Harbour Engineering Co Ltd (CHEC), a main contractor for the second bridge was expected to start work on the second Penang bridge in November 2007 and complete the project in 2011, but the completion date was then postponed to May 2012, and later to February 2014. Construction started in November 2008. To {{reduce the cost of}} construction, its design was then modified to resemble the first <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> Penang Bridge. The bridge has been built with a large loan from the People's Republic of China to continue and maintain the economic relationship between China and Malaysia. The bridge was officially opened on 1 March 2014 at 20:30 MST and was named after the fourteenth Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the late Tuanku Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah of Kedah and was assigned with the route number E28.|$|E

The final layout of the <b>cable</b> <b>stays</b> was identified as “duplex”. The numerical investigation was carried out in the frequency domain. The results obtained show a sensible increasing of stiffness, as well as a reduction of the natural period of vibrations. In the analysis the deck was considered as thin and very light.
