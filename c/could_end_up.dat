He was insistent that he would also collaborate with Jordin Sparks, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and T.I. However, none of these collaborations (except Miley Cyrus) made it to the final track list. He also said that alongside T-Pain who would definitely appear, he hoped to get Jay-Z on board, although he ultimately failed to do so. Timbaland began working on the sequel to Shock Value in July 2008. In March 2009, he filed a lawsuit against his label, Blackground Records, alleging that they attempted to blackball him after he decided to move from music performance into production.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} the Gateway {{development}} leaves the railway capacity of the station more or less unaltered has not escaped attention.

25|$|The sectors {{from where}} the High Chiefs existed also {{consisted}} of their immediate abode and extended families, the existing lineages (idi) and groups which Llyod (1962:191) described as (idile or ebi) – the main patrilineage corporate group. Others in the sector are the abode and farm settlements of lesser chiefs and their families which Llyod (1962:55) regarded as hamlets (abule or Ileto) while describing typical settlement patterns in Ekiti in comparison with those from Ijebu and Ondo country. By Ado traditions, descendants in the male line have exclusive rights to land in perpetuity subject to communal rights of hunting and the Ewi’s right as Sovereign ruler to certain trees and game.

25|$|Made by Dorman & Smith Ltd. (using patents {{applied for}} in 1943) the {{plugs and sockets}} were rated at 13A and {{were one of the}} {{competing}} types for use on ring final circuits. They were never popular in private houses but were widely deployed in prefabricated houses and council housing. The BBC also used them. Some local authorities continued to use them in new installations until the late 1950s. Many D sockets were still in use until the early 1980s, although the difficulty in obtaining plugs for them after around 1970 often forced their users to replace them with BS1363 sockets. The D plug suffered from a serious design fault: the line pin was a fuse which screwed into the plug body and tended to come unscrewed on its own in use. A fuse that worked loose <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> protruding from the socket, electrically live and posing a shock hazard, when the plug was removed.|$|E

25|$|Britain {{feared that}} the French naval fleet <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> in German hands and be used against its own naval forces, which were so vital to {{maintaining}} North Atlantic shipping and communications. Under the armistice, France {{had been allowed to}} retain the French Navy, the Marine Nationale, under strict conditions. Vichy pledged that the fleet would never {{fall into the hands of}} Germany, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach by sending it to Britain or to faraway territories of the French empire such as the West Indies. This did not satisfy Winston Churchill, who ordered French ships in British ports to be seized by the Royal Navy. Shortly after the Armistice (22 June 1940), Britain conducted the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, killing 1,297 French military personnel, and Vichy severed diplomatic relations with Britain. The French squadron at Alexandria, under Admiral René-Emile Godfroy, was effectively interned until 1943 after an agreement was reached with Admiral Andrew Browne Cunningham, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet. After the Mers el Kebir incident, the United Kingdom recognized Free France as the legitimate government of France.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a major HIV outbreak, Indiana's largest-ever, {{occurred}} in two largely rural, economically depressed and poor {{counties in the}} southern portion of the state, due to the injection of a relatively new opioid-type drug called Opana (oxymorphone), which is designed be taken in pill form but is ground up and injected intravenously using needles. Because {{of the lack of}} HIV cases in that area beforehand and the youth of many but not all of those affected, the relative unavailability in the local area of safe needle exchange programs and of treatment centers capable of dealing with long-term health needs, HIV care, and drug addiction during the initial phases of the outbreak, it was not initially adequately contained and dealt with until those were set up by the government, and acute awareness of the issue spread. Such centers have now been opened, and short-term care is beginning to be provided; once the scope of the outbreak became clear, Governor Mike Pence, despite some initial reservations, approved a legislative measure to allow safe, clean needle exchange programs and treatment for those affected, which <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being instituted statewide.|$|E
500|$|Originally, joint legal custody meant joint custody. In {{this joint}} legal custody arrangement, the child's parents shared {{responsibility}} over discussing {{issues related to}} the child-rearing.

Though this implied that both parents had a [...] "significant period" [...] of time with the children, it did nothing to ensure this factor, which meant that the parent without primary custody of the child <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> having little opportunity to see his or her children.|$|E

I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten.
