5|$|Weinstein did not land {{a job on}} a major comedy series, as {{previous}} Harvard {{graduates who}} wrote for the Lampoon had done, despite writing numerous spec scripts for shows such as Saturday Night Live and Late Night with David Letterman; he moved back home to Washington, D.C.

5|$|While visiting Nintendo {{for other}} work, celebrity <b>copywriter</b> Shigesato Itoi pitched to the company's lead {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto, his {{idea for a}} role-playing game set in contemporary times. The modern setting worked against role-playing genre norms, and while Miyamoto liked the idea, he was hesitant until Itoi could show full commitment to the project. Itoi reduced his workload, formed a team, and began development in Ichikawa, Chiba. Nintendo tried to accommodate Itoi's ideal work environment to feel more like an extracurricular club of volunteers. Itoi wrote the game's script. Mother was developed by Ape, published by Nintendo, and released in Japan on July 27, 1989 for the Famicom (known as the Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan). The game was slated for an English-language localization as Earth Bound, but was abandoned when the team chose to localize Mother 2 instead. Years later, the complete localization was recovered by the public and distributed on the Internet, where it became known as EarthBound Zero. Mother received its English language debut in June 2015 as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console.|$|E

40|$|Creativity is an {{intangible}} {{concept that}} is in a perceived constant state of change, a state that necessitates the occasional reexamination of previous findings {{in an effort to}} further understand the roles and perceptions held by advertising practitioners. This qualitative study offers insights and expands on previous quantitative studies of agency creatives' views on advertising creativity (Reid, King, & DeLorme, 1998). Through ten semi-structured interviews of senior agency <b>copywriters,</b> the author compared past and present perceptions of creativity in advertising. The study's findings help to clarify what factors into such perceptions and what impact technological advancements have had upon said perceived levels of creativity. The study found that <b>copywriters</b> do not unanimously agree that creativity has increased, though a majority believes it has remained constant or slightly increased. <b>Copywriters</b> do perceive creativity to have changed since they entered the profession, and they assert that changes in approach, business models, and technological advancements are the primary factors contributing to change. This study provides practical and theoretical value by contributing to role-based models of advertising and by informing current <b>copywriters</b> of the opinions of their peers...|$|R
