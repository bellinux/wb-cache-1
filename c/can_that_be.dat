2500|$|Kant {{thinks that}} all of our actions, whether {{motivated}} by inclination or morality, must follow some law. For example, if a person wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee, he will have to follow a law that tells him to practice his backhand pass, among other things. Notice, however, that this law is only binding on the person who wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee. In this way, it is contingent upon the ends that he sets and the circumstances that he is in. We know from the third proposition, however, that the moral law must bind universally and necessarily, that is, regardless of ends and circumstances. [...] At this point, Kant asks, ‘what kind of law <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be,</b> the representation of which must determine the will, even without regard for the effect expected from it...?’ (4:402) He concludes that the only remaining alternative is a law that reflects only the form of law itself, namely that of universality. [...] Thus, Kant arrives at his well-known categorical imperative, the moral law referenced in the above discussion of duty. Kant defines the categorical imperative as the following: “I ought never to act except {{in such a way that}} I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.” (4:402) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} offset-aware response-time {{analysis of}} Controller Area Network (CAN) for mixed messages has certain practical limitations. It {{is based on}} the assumption that the jitter and deadline of a message are smaller or equal to the transmission period. However, practical systems may contain messages with release jitter greater than the period. Consequently, the deadlines specified for such messages are also greater than their periods. In this paper, we extend the existing response-time analysis for mixed messages in <b>CAN</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> scheduled with offsets and have arbitrary jitter and deadlines.
