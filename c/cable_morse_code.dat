40|$|Presents {{a current}} {{overview}} of the UK telecommunications group Cable & Wireless. Describes its existing global business, with subsidiaries in over 50 countries and links with many major companies and overseas governments. Discusses the development of communications, from copper <b>cables</b> transmitting <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> to modern fibre optic strands using laser light, reviewing the introduction of satellite and digital technology, computers and the Internet. Debates the convergence and possible future combination of these technologies in a multimedia communications revolution. Examines the precedents set in the early 20 th century with mergers of cable and radio companies, and considers the possibility of similar mergers in the future between cable, satellite, computer and media businesses. Describes C&W’s involvement with Microsoft and BSkyB in areas such as: Web TV; set-top boxes; video-on-demand and digitization...|$|R
40|$|<b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> is {{a unique}} exemplar of the {{inherent}} complexities of rhythm. Learning <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> in wartime presented challenges to expedite skill acquisition. This thesis explored the strategies used to teach and learn <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> in the second World War and investigated the resourceful techniques used by the WRANS in an empirical study. The first study investigated {{the teaching and learning}} strategies of wartime telegraphists to learn <b>Morse</b> <b>code.</b> Five WRANS described a series of techniques to learn <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> including rote learning and repetition, visualisation and pattern recognition, intoning and mnemonics, and music. Music provided effective training for the fundamental teaching and learning of <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> by matching the rhythmical properties of <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> to music. Music equipped <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> operators with a unique approach to <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> instruction. Learning <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> with music was described as a way of making sense of the ‘rhythm’ and ‘shape’ of the <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> letters and proved an invaluable aid to learning and teaching <b>Morse</b> <b>code.</b> The second study examined the effectiveness of learning <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> with the aid of music. Novices formed two groups, Control Group (no music aid) and Music Group (with music aid). Results confirmed the effectiveness of music training in three <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> letters, Q V, and A in two experiments, the first with known <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> letters (Q V A) and the second with unknown letters.

50|$|Rag chewer {{is a name}} {{applied to}} amateur radio <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> {{operators}} who engage in informal <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> conversations (known as chewing the rag) while discussing subjects such as: the weather, their location, signal quality, and their equipment. Meaningful rag chewing between fluent <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> operators having different native languages is possible because of a common Lingua Franca provided by: the prosigns for <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> the International Q code, Z code, RST code, the telegraph era Phillips Code and many well known <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> abbreviations as discussed in this Wikipedia article. Together all of these traditional conventions serve as a somewhat cryptic but commonly understood language (Lingua Franca) within the world-wide community of amateur radio <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> operators.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> preceded modern coded {{modulation}} techniques by {{more than}} a century, in terms of Claude Shannon's modern Information Theory, <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> may be regarded essentially as an encoded method of signaling that simultaneously comprises both: a source code (data compression code) and a channel code (modulation <b>code).</b> The <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> source code was created by Samuel Morse's assistant Alfred Vail when Vail assigned the shortest <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> symbols to the most often occurring (English language) source symbols (alpha-numeric characters and punctuation marks), in the style of today's modern data compression codes such as the modern Information Theory based: Huffman, Arithmetic, and Lempel-Ziv-Welsh <b>codes.</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> symbols are variable length sequences of: dot signals, dash signals, and dot duration silent periods. Vail based his <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> on the English language source with the shortest Morse symbol, a sequence composed of a single <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> dot followed by a single dot duration silent period, encoding the most often used English letter [...] "E" [...] with corresponding longer sequences used for less common English letters. Besides assigning <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> symbols to alpha-numeric and punctuation characters of the information source language symbols the early creators of <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> also assigned additional procedural symbols to the <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> related to page formatting of documents and to control and turn over of telegraph communication channels.|$|R

5000|$|In the mid-1800s, {{long before}} the advent of {{teleprinters}} and teletype machines, <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> operators or telegraphists invented and used <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> prosigns to encode white space text formatting in formal written text messages. In particular the Morse prosign represented by the concatenation of two literal textual <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> [...] "A" [...] characters sent without the normal inter-character spacing is used in <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> to encode and indicate a new line in a formal text message.|$|R
25|$|<b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> {{has been}} in use for more than 160 yearslonger than any other {{electrical}} coding system.

Gerke changed {{nearly half of the}} alphabet and all of the numerals, providing the foundation for the modern form of the code. After some minor changes, International <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> was standardized at the International Telegraphy Congress in 1865 in Paris and was later made the standard by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). <b>Morse's</b> original <b>code</b> specification, largely limited to use in the United States and Canada, became known as American <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> or railroad <b>code.</b> American <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> is now seldom used except in historical re-enactments.|$|R
