50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 11.5-12.5 mm. The forewings are white, {{with a faint}} rosy tinge, irregularly and sparsely {{sprinkled with}} black scales, especially toward the edges. A rather prominent group of them is found on the costa at the apical third. On {{the middle of the}} disc is a small light-brown spot and another similar spot is found {{at the end of the}} cell. On the middle of the dorsal edge is a patch of brown, and between this and the apex are two other small groups of brown scales. All of these brown markings are obscure, ill defined, and not constant in all specimens. The black scales form a nearly <b>continuous</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> at the base of the cilia around the apical edge. The hindwings are dark, shining fuscous.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Organogenesis is {{regulated}} by the sequential and reciprocal interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. Many molecules, including growth factors, transcription factors, extracellular matrices, cell surface receptors, and matrix degrading enzymes, {{have been found to}} be involved in this process. To investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for morphogenesis of the circumvallate papilla/von Ebners ’ gland complex, we examined the expres-sion patterns of selected cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix molecules, innervation and cell division in the circumvallate papilla of mouse embryos from embryonic day 11. 5 (E 11. 5) to E 14. At E 11. 5 -E 13. 5, the lingual epithelium, the site where the circumvallate papilla will develop, is negative for BrdU labeling. At E 14 -E 15, we detected cell division in the papillary area, especially in the epithelial invagination where von Ebners ’ minor salivary gland will form. The basement membrane component, laminin, is expressed as a <b>continuous</b> <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> separating the epithelia from the underlying mesenchyme, but it is broadly and strongly expressed in the area where the nerve fibers penetrate into the circumvallate papilla. At the E 12 -E 12. 5 stage of development, the epithelial thickening shows intense E-cadherin staining in the superficial and basal layers, but weak E-cadherin staining in the suprabasal layer. E-cadherin is strongly expressed, but appears dispersed among th...|$|E

40|$|Intravascular {{proteolytic}} enzymes {{participate in}} a variety of linked reactions which are triggered in inflammatory and hemostatic events (1 - 4). The mechanisms by which the action of these enzymes is limited to specific substrates, thereby sparing other proteins whose destruction would be deleterious to the organism, are not understood. Several different plasma proteins, however, function as proteolytic enzyme inhibitors in in vitro studies, suggesting that these naturally occurring inhibitors limit the digestive potential of intravascular proteases (1, 5, 6). In this report, the localization of a 2 -macroglobulin (a 2 M) ~ to the endothelial surface of human blood vessels and lymphatics has been demonstrated. By immunofluorescent-staining techniques, the a 2 M appears to form a <b>thin,</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>lining</b> on the luminal surface of endothelial cells. The immunologic specificity of the immunofluorescent techniques used was established by the demonstration that vessel wall staining was abolished when the antiserum was absorbed at equivalence with the purified a 2 M antigen.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{controllable}} and selectable synthesis of two-dimensional (2 -D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) by molybdenum trioxide sulfurization with chemical vapor deposition. By controlling the sulfurization timing and substrates positions, the selectable growth of MoS 2 isolated triangular islands and <b>continuous</b> <b>thin</b> film was successfully performed independently with the same home-built furnace setup. Also, {{we found that the}} hydrofluoric acid substrate treatment took effects on MoS 2 nucleation seed densities and modulated the sizes of the triangular islands. Atomic force microscopy and Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to characterize and compare the properties of MoS 2 triangular islands and <b>continuous</b> <b>thin</b> film. The MoS 2 triangular islands were monolayers and highly crystalline in nature; where the <b>continuous</b> <b>thin</b> film was formed by small grain size MoS 2 nanosheets with smooth surface morphology and a large covered area of up to centimeters. Back-gated field effect transistors (FETs) of as-grown MoS 2 triangular islands and <b>continuous</b> <b>thin</b> film were fabricated to analyze their electrical properties. The electron mobilities were measured to be 11. 42 and 4. 04 cm 2 /V·s respectively, and with an excellent on/off current ratio up to over 108, which demonstrated the good quality of the as-grown MoS 2 samples. Furthermore, both the MoS 2 triangular islands and <b>continuous</b> <b>thin</b> film FETs exhibited a near ideal current saturation characteristic, which shows the real potential of future applications for 2 -D electronic devices.
