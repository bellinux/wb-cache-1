50|$|When the {{depletion}} layer spans {{the width of}} the conduction <b>channel,</b> <b>pinch-off</b> is achieved and drain-to-source conduction stops. Pinch-off occurs at a particular reverse bias (VGS) of the gate-source junction. The pinch-off voltage (Vp) varies considerably, even among devices of the same type. For example, VGS(off) for the Temic J202 device varies from −0.8 V to −4 V. Typical values vary from −0.3 V to −10 V.|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} the drain current in the long-gate JFET and MESFET is {{proposed}} in which the electron velocity saturation is not mandatory-requirement for the drain current saturation. According to it the drain current saturation is result of the screening of the field, which the drain voltage creates, by the gates, and the appearing of the diffusion component of drain current. Silvaco simulation confirms the proposed model. Approximate analytical expressions for the drain current before the <b>channel</b> <b>pinch-off</b> and saturation of current after it was obtained.

40|$|In the paper, the {{behavior}} of AlGaN/GaN HEMT-type heterostructures in a water solution of (KOH + HCl) with differing pH was studied. The influence of the electrolyte pH on <b>channel</b> <b>pinch-off</b> voltage was measured using impedance spectroscopy methods. It was observed that the change of the pH of electrolyte has a strong effect on the pinch-off voltage of AlGaN/GaN HEMT-type heterostructures independently of the concentration of other ions. In high-pH environment the so-called memory effect of heterostructures was revealed. Its possible origin was discussed. A general theory to explain all results was proposed...|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} the effect, first {{the notion of}} <b>pinch-off</b> of the <b>channel</b> is introduced. The channel is formed by attraction of carriers to the gate, and the current drawn through the channel is nearly a constant independent of drain voltage in saturation mode. However, near the drain, the gate and drain jointly determine the electric field pattern. Instead of flowing in a <b>channel,</b> beyond the <b>pinch-off</b> point the carriers flow in a subsurface pattern made possible because the drain and the gate both control the current. In the figure at the right, the channel is indicated by a dashed line and becomes weaker as the drain is approached, leaving a gap of uninverted silicon {{between the end of}} the formed inversion layer and the drain (the pinch-off region).|$|R
40|$|As {{the device}} size downscales, hot carrier aging (HCA) scales up and remerges {{as a major}} {{challenge}} to the reliability of modern CMOS technologies. The conventional method for predicting the HCA device lifetime {{is based on a}} power law kinetics and critically depends on the accuracy of the time power exponent, n. In this work, we study how to extract the n accurately. It will be shown that the widely used forward saturation current degradation gives erroneous n, because of the <b>channel</b> <b>pinch-off.</b> To reduce the test time, it will be demonstrated that the voltage step stress technique is applicable to HCA. The accuracy of the extracted HCA model will be verified against independently measured test data...|$|E
40|$|The {{explanation}} of GaAs metal-semiconductor {{field effect transistor}} (MESFET) operation often {{involves the use of}} simplistic analytical formulae, which serve to obscure the more subtle physics of device action. The authors consider here a simple one-dimensional (1 -D) model for GaAs MESFETs, which avoids more confusing numerical modeling schemes, yet still facilitates an analysis of the physical functionality of the device. The model takes into account current saturation due to either velocity saturation or <b>channel</b> <b>pinch-off,</b> the modulation of effective gate length and the series resistance of the regions beyond the gate. The results of the model have been compared to experimental data readily obtained from the literature, and the agreement {{has been shown to be}} goo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{solution}} gate {{field effect}} transistor (SGFET) using an oxidised boron δ-doped channel on (111) diamond is presented for the first time. Employing an optimised plasma chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) recipe to deposit δ-layers, SGFETs show improved current–voltage (I–V) characteristics in comparison to previous similar devices fabricated on (100) and polycrystalline diamond, where the device is shown {{to operate in the}} enhancement mode of operation, achieving <b>channel</b> <b>pinch-off</b> and drain-source current saturation within the electrochemical window of diamond. A maximum gain and transconductance of 3 and 200 μS/mm are extracted, showing comparable figures of merit to hydrogen-based SGFET. The oxidised device shows a site-binding model pH sensitivity of 36 mV/pH, displaying fast temporal responses. Considering the biocompatibility of diamond towards cells, the device's highly mutable transistor characteristics, pH sensitivity and stability against anodic oxidation common to hydrogen terminated diamond SGFET, oxidised boron δ-doped diamond SGFETs show promise for the recording of action potentials from electrogenic cells...|$|E
40|$|Charge {{carriers}} in {{the quantum}} Hall regime propagate via one-dimensional conducting channels that form {{along the edges}} of a two-dimensional electron gas. Controlling their transmission through a gate-tunable constriction, also called quantum point contact (QPC), is fundamental for many coherent transport experiments. However, in graphene, tailoring a QPC with electrostatic gates remains challenging due to the formation of p-n junctions below gate electrodes along which electron and hole edge channels co-propagate and mix, short-circuiting the constriction. Here we show that this electron-hole mixing is drastically reduced in high mobility boron-nitride/graphene/boron-nitride van-der-Waals heterostructures thanks to the full degeneracy lifting of the Landau levels, enabling QPC operation with full <b>channel</b> <b>pinch-off.</b> We demonstrate gate-tunable selective transmission of quantum Hall edge channels through the QPC, both in the integer and the fractional quantum Hall regimes. This gate-control of edge channel propagation in graphene van-der-Waals heterostructures opens the door to quantum Hall interferometry and electron quantum optics experiments in the integer and fractional quantum Hall regimes of graphene.

40|$|Field {{emitters}} are {{an exciting}} technology for high-frequency, high-power applications {{because of their}} excellent free space electron transport, and their potential for high current density and high current, especially when they are used in an array format. However, a major challenge preventing {{the widespread use of}} this technology are the spatial and temporal variations that arise from non-uniformity in emitter tip radius and work function, respectively. To address the problems, various methods of controlling the supply of electrons to the emitter have been developed. One method of current limiting is the vertical ungated field effect transistor (FET), which uses the <b>channel</b> <b>pinch-off</b> and velocity saturation of carriers in silicon combined with a high aspect ratio to provide an effective method of controlling current. To reduce the operating voltage, and likewise the energy spread of the emitted electrons, we created vertical ungated FET current limiters that were 100 nm in diameter, 8 µm tall, and had a pitch of 1 µm that were patterned using optical lithography. These devices demonstrated excellent current saturation, with outpu...|$|E
30|$|When the probes {{are placed}} {{closer to the}} centre, source, or drain, the {{sensitivity}} of the device is significantly reduced. The source and drain ends seem to be less sensitive to the DNA charge than the centre. This can also be explained by noting that the drain and source surface potentials are much harder to modulate by charges on the gate, as they are in electrical contact with the drain and reservoirs. The harder charge modulation makes it more difficult for the DNA targets to induce an electrical signal. In the case of the drain aggregated probes, another phenomenon is noticed. As the device is put in deep saturation, the BioFET is desensitized. The <b>channel</b> <b>pinch-off</b> in saturation is responsible for this. On the onset of saturation, the drain’s ability to draw charges is dramatically increased, and the lateral electric field becomes very strong. The weak modulation of the vertical electric field due to hybridization will not result in any significant change in the underlying local surface potential, and the BioFET is desensitized along this region. In this case, several probes that are in close proximity to the drain are made redundant and will only weakly contribute to the total current change.|$|E
40|$|Electrodes at the Brain Machine Interface (BMI) must fulfil tall specifications: They {{must have}} {{excellent}} electrical properties to transduce electrogenic activity, be highly biocompatible and not degrade in a saline environment over {{the lifetime of}} the patient. In this respect, diamond is an excellent BMI material. In this thesis, the application of diamond at the BMI is investigated. Results Chapter 5 discusses the use of nanodiamond (ND) monolayers to promote the formation of functional neuronal networks. Neurons cultured on ND-coated substrates perform remarkably well, and similar to those grown on standard protein-coated materials {{with respect to their}} initial cell attachment, outgrowth, neuronal excitability and functionality of the resulting networks. NDs bypass the necessity of protein coating and show great potential for chronic medical implants. Chapter 6 describes the fabrication of nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) for the recording of electrogenic cells. MEAs are fabricated with metallic boron-doped nanocrystalline diamond (BNCD) and passivated with NCD, SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 stacks and SU- 8 epoxy. The recording of electrogenic activity of HL- 1 cardiac cells is demonstrated with high signal-to-noise ratios and low signal loss. Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 describe the development of boron-doped (111) diamond Solution Gate Field-Effect Transistors (SGFETs). In Chapter 7 an optimised Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) -doping recipe using the (111) diamond plane is presented. AC Hall characterisation yields desirable sheet carrier densities for FET application with enhanced carrier mobilities, and Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) measurements divulge metallic electrical properties with low activation energies, indicative of heavily doped diamond as confirmed by Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS). Chapter 8 describes the fabrication of boron δ-doped (111) diamond SGFETs (δ-SGFETs). δ-SGFETs show improved I-V characteristics in comparison to previous similar devices, whereby the enhancement mode operation, <b>channel</b> <b>pinch-off</b> and current saturation are achieved within the electrochemical window of diamond. Considering the biocompatibility of diamond towards cells, δ-SGFETs are promising for recording electrogenic cells...|$|E
