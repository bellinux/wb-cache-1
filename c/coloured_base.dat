50|$|From {{the eyes}} to halfway down each {{edge of the}} {{carapace}} (shell) are three tooth-like notches. The rear most pair of legs are the shortest, the third from rear are the longest. There {{is a lot of}} variation in colouration but there are two basic colour types; A paler form with pale to dark red patches on a white to light grey base colour, and a darker form where the patches merge and are a dark purple to blue-black colour with smaller patches of the light <b>coloured</b> <b>base</b> colour showing through. In both forms the colour tends to be darker towards the front, fading and becoming more sparse towards the back. The underside of the crab is white. The legs and claws are white with red to purple pigmentation to the same degree and hue as the carapace.|$|E
50|$|The red-fronted parrot is 28 cm (11 in) long. It {{is mostly}} green {{and has a}} short black squarish tail. Black {{feathers}} on the head, neck, back, and wings have lighter green edges giving a scalloped appearance. The lower mandible is dark grey and the upper mandible has a horn <b>coloured</b> <b>base</b> and a dark grey tip. The irises are red-orange, the eyerings are pinkish-grey, and the legs are grey-brown. The amount of red or orange on the forecrown, the bend of the wing, and thighs varies in the three subspecies but is absent in all young birds - juveniles having a dark smokey appearance above a paler beak and brown irises. The adult male and female are identical in external appearance. Gender determination of chicks is normally carried out by breeders using DNA analysis of a feather sample or by internal examination of the cloaca. This latter method is cheaper and quicker but does cause some distress to the bird.|$|E
50|$|The {{pattern was}} changed {{slightly}} with subsequent issues. On early 1960 Pattern (manufactured from 1966) and 1968 Pattern DPM uniforms the sand <b>coloured</b> <b>base</b> {{would appear to}} lighten in tone at night, becoming dangerously conspicuous. This was addressed in the late 1970s, when the sand and brown colours were slightly darkened. The 1985 Pattern has fewer, less precise dots and the brown is much darker; 1990 and later has a band of new shapes and is smaller; 1994 has an orangey colour instead of a tan. Tropical poly-cotton DPM uniforms varied even more; early versions were very brightly coloured notably with a russet brown and emerald green which faded to rather unexpected pastel tones of blueish green and pink-brown with washing. Late 1970s and early 1980s Tropicals have a more yellowish sand base and are greatly sought-after by those wishing to appear stylish, while the final production style in the early 1990s used colours closer to temperate uniforms.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 32 mm {{for males}} and 46 mm for females. It has an ochreous-brownish coloured head and thorax with its pedipalp being hairy on top. Its antennae are whitish-ochreous in colour, while its abdomen is ochreous-grey. The species has elongate and narrow forewings which are arched in males but are round in females. The termen is straight and obtuse in males, but it is oblique and rounded in females. Both sexes have black coloured scales, which are located on the veins, which occupy half of {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Its spiracle is white coloured and is facing toward its dorsum. The cilia of the females is whitish-yellow and becomes ochreous-yellow closer to the tornal area. The cilia of the males on the other hand is light grey, in combination with white. Males also have narrow hindwings while females have a grey <b>coloured</b> <b>base.</b> Its hair-pencil is costal and is grey coloured for males while it is lighter for females.|$|E

A metal school badge is worn over the left pocket, and a cloth name tag sewn on under the school badge. Students from different year groups would have different coloured name tags.
