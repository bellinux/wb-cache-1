500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two clubs was in the FA Cup semi-finals; the tie was decided by a replay as the initial game {{finished}} goalless. The match was settled in extra time when Giggs {{ran the length of}} the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. In the close season, Anelka was involved in a protracted transfer saga and vowed to never play for Arsenal again. He cited the media in England as a reason for wanting to leave the club: [...] "The one thing I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I can't stand the English Press, who cause me enormous problems on a personal level," [...] but it was implied that his [...] "gold-digging brothers" [...] wanted Anelka to move abroad to make more money – they served as his agents.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
2500|$|All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{completely}} and utterly changed my life. I {{was a white}} hippie boy and then I saw exit wounds from M1 rifles out of the backs of two people I knew.|$|E
5000|$|... "We can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how {{to dance}} Balboa, but we <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not dancing Balboa." [...] from dancers of Balboa's origin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know what}} you're drivin' at," [...] Bert said with asperity. [...] "An' all I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is,</b> livin' or dead, {{in a job}} or out, {{no matter what happens}} to me, if you will lead that way, you will, an' there's nothin' else to it." ...|$|R
60|$|OONA. The empty rattle-pate! Lean on this arm, That I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> a christened arm, And {{not like}} some, {{if we are}} to judge by speech. But as <b>you</b> please. It <b>is</b> time I was forgot. Maybe it is not on this arm you slumbered When <b>you</b> <b>were</b> as {{helpless}} as a worm.|$|R
2500|$|June: Taliban {{commander}} Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Osmani tells Pakistani GEO News {{that bin}} Laden and Mullah Mohammed Omar are both alive. He does not reveal anything about bin Laden's location, stating [...] "All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Osama Bin Laden {{is alive and}} well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shodhan also {{hinted at}} the same : [...] "All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no youngster could hope to play for long at that time {{because he had to}} ally himself to one camp or the other. One had to know how to survive. What did I know about the {{politics}} ? The captain Vijay Hazare was not a strong personality and the truth is, Vinoo Mankad was. He always had his way... I would have loved to play on. But then Hazare called quits and Mankad became captain. I made myself unavailable for the tour to Pakistan in 1954/55. It is unlikely that I would have been chosen".|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Nothing {{seems to}} make sense here. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{she was the most}} impenetrably stupid woman I have ever met in the whole course of my life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} you've {{got into this}} state, sir," [...] he said with the brusqueness of emotion. [...] "You're in a bad way. It's the old trouble; {{and you know what}} that means as well as I. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is,</b> I'm going to have a big fight with it. It shan't be my fault, there's my hand on that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{everything}} handsome about them," [...] {{he interrupted}} me by exclaiming; [...] "and {{you call yourself}} a Mackenzie of Megasky! What has become of family pride? Why, you yourselves have Gruagach of the Red Hand in the hall, and he, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>is</b> a very different sort of spectre from me. Pre-Christian, you know--one of the oldest ghosts in Ross-shire. But as to 'hard on a family,' why, noblesse oblige." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{your own}} sake," [...] he continued, [...] "there are certain facts in {{connection}} with this matter which I must withhold. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> this. There are people who have acquired a hold upon Lucille so great that she is forced to obey their bidding. Lady Carey is one, the Duchess of Dorset is another. They are no friends of mine, and apparently Lucille has been taken away from me by them." ...|$|R
60|$|THE LADY. I {{never read}} the Radical papers. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> what we women admire in you {{is not the}} politician, but the man of action, the heroic warrior, the beau sabreur.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not so {{sure that}} follows," [...] said the lawyer. [...] "All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the bills have been sent to me for {{collection}} and unless they are met I shall reluctantly be forced to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{scarcely}} {{to be expected}} that you should," [...] Mr. Philip Burr admitted. [...] "All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in cases like yours, I really prefer not to know with whom I have to deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'ONLY, Elfie! Why, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it <b>is</b> a fine {{thing to}} be {{on the staff of the}} PRESENT. Finer than being a novelist considerably.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A nurse's place!" [...] I exclaimed, {{a little}} surprised, {{surveying}} her dress of palest and softest Indian muslin; for {{she looked to}} me far {{too much of a}} butterfly for such serious work. [...] "Do you really mean it; or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> one of the ten thousand modern young ladies who are in quest of a Mission, without understanding that Missions are unpleasant? Nursing, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>is</b> not all crimped cap and becoming uniform." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gracious! And {{that must}} be the ghost the natives believe in," [...] {{answered}} Sam. [...] "I'm glad you explained it. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I <b>was</b> startled." ...|$|R
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. You {{can do as}} you please. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I don't {{believe your}} eyes if they cant see any {{difference}} between a live archbishop and two dead ones. [The apparatus rings, he holds the button down]. Yes? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, written you or something, I suppose!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Trust an Englishman for bungling a love affair. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{she left}} Dorset House in a hansom without the others, and said some thing about having supper with some friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since Bickley is so clever, {{surely he}} should know better than an {{illusion}} such as I. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I have learned that there is war between this country and that," [...] and he pointed to Great Britain and to Germany upon the map; [...] "also between others." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 14, {{the day of}} the {{scheduled}} vote on Thorne-Begland's appointment, Republican Governor Bob McDonnell stated that the candidate's sexuality should not be an issue: [...] "All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> what I've always said about judges, and that is that these ought to be merit-based selections solely based on a person's skill, ability, fairness, judicial temperament". Thorne-Begland also attempted to address concerns by pledging to [...] "neutrally apply the laws" [...] and avoid political advocacy.|$|R
6000|$|... “Then I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> It <b>was</b> a {{few minutes}} after eleven, and he took the path to the footbridge. When he came back his clothes were muddy.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> these <b>are</b> gay {{times in}} America," [...] triumphed the young girl. She now {{put her hand}} to her mouth and hid a yawn.|$|R
6000|$|... "News!" [...] exclaimed {{the crushed}} sceptic through his iands. [...] "Ay, news enough, Captain Johns. Who {{will be able}} to deny the awfulness, the genuineness? Another man would have dropped dead. You want to know what I had seen. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> since I've seen it my hair is turning white." ...|$|E
60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. I can't argue: I'm too old: {{my mind is}} made up and finished. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> old-fashioned or new-fashioned, if {{you sell}} yourself, you deal your soul a blow that all the books and {{pictures}} and concerts and scenery in the world won't heal [he gets up suddenly and makes for the pantry].|$|E
60|$|ZOZIM. Discourage me if I {{know what}} youre talking about! I wish Zoo would come: she understands these things. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the general opinion among the Colonizers {{is in favor}} of {{beginning}} {{in a country where the}} people are of a different color from us; so that we can make short work without any risk of mistakes.|$|E
6000|$|... "We were {{released}} this morning," [...] said Ben. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I <b>was</b> mighty glad of it. I haven't had a meal fit {{to eat in}} weeks." ...|$|R

2500|$|Presley's Sun {{recordings}} feature his vocals {{and rhythm}} guitar, Bill Black's percussive slapped bass, and Scotty Moore on an amplified guitar. Slap bass {{had been a}} staple of both Western Swing and Hillbilly Boogie since the 1940s. Commenting on his own guitar playing, Scotty Moore said, [...] "All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> I just stole from every guitar player I heard over the years. Put it in my data bank. An' when I played that's just what come out." ...|$|R
60|$|THE COUNT. Oh no. I havnt {{been allowed}} even to meet {{any of the}} company. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the hero is a Frenchman [Savoyard is rather scandalized]: I asked her not to have an English hero. That is all I know. [Ruefully] I havnt been {{consulted}} even about the costumes, though there, I think, I could have been some use.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are right. But we may never know. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Wetzel and Jack trailed Miller to the river, and then they both came back. I {{was the last to}} see Lewis that night before he left on Miller's trail. It isn't likely I shall forget what Lewis said and how he looked. Miller was a wicked man; yes, a traitor." ...|$|E
60|$|Of this closing {{group of}} sculptures, then, all I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the fifth is a quite {{magnificent}} piece of work, and recognizably, to my extreme conviction, Luca della Robbia's; that the last, Harmonia, is also fine work; that those attributed to Giotto are fine {{in a different}} way,--and the other three in reality the poorest pieces in the series, though done with much more advanced sculptural dexterity.|$|E
5000|$|The Times of 17th July 1911 {{reported}} as follows, [...] "The police swore that the accused {{in his speech}} referred to the decorations which had been put up {{in the streets of}} Dublin in honour of the Royal visit, and said, [...] "Do you know who <b>you</b> <b>are</b> honouring? Royalty who belong to the House of Brunswick. I do not know if you know the history of that House, but I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> honouring the offspring of one of the vilest scoundrels that ever entered our country."" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Maud Barrington softly. [...] "Now, at least, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I <b>am</b> glad <b>you</b> went away--but if you {{had asked}} me I would have gone with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> there <b>was</b> not, s'nore--if {{that will}} gladden your heart. A man was {{all ready to}} be hanged, when Captain Cuffe was pleased to order him taken down." ...|$|R
