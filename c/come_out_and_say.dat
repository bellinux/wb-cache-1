500|$|The song {{references}} drugs both metaphorically and literally, and innocently {{delivers a}} transgressive message {{through the use}} of simile: [...] "I'm going to do you like drugs tonight". Miguel said of the song's lyrics, [...] "I have this propensity to just <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> things. That's how I am in real life. If I wanna know something I just ask. Like, 'Hey, do you like drugs?' Because I do! Sometimes! ... MDMA… on occasion." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian observes [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "promises of narcotic [...] " [...] in the song's lyrics. Pitchfork Medias Carrie Battan said that [...] "Do You..." [...] is [...] "not so much about being in love as about a shared love of vices." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2006, Rowe was {{featured}} in an article admitting to the inaccuracy found in Loose Change, such as inaccurately stating a B-52 flew into the Empire State Building (it was actually a B-25 in the 1940s). [...] "We don't ever <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that everything we say is 100 percent. We know there are errors in the documentary, and we've actually left them in there so that people discredit us and do the research for themselves." [...] In 2007, media entrepreneur Mark Cuban was going to distribute Loose Change, and Charlie Sheen was going to narrate. However, this did not happen; Fox News political talk show host Bill O'Reilly interviewed Cuban on his radio show and said Sheen's career would be over if he narrated it.|$|E

60|$|Then he {{sent his}} heralds out to north and south and east and west to summon the people together, because {{he said he had}} {{something}} very important and special to say to them. And the people came in tens, and fifties, and hundreds, men, women, and children; and they stood waiting in front of the Palace steps till Gessler the Governor should <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> something very important and special to them.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the evening}} the Princess told {{this to the}} Crab, who said to her, 'Take this rod, go to the garden gate and knock with it, then a black man will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> to you, ''Why have you called me, {{and what do you}} require of me?''

6000|$|... "Dear Clara! I am {{sure she}} does not love me better than I do her. But suppose that Lady Desmond won't let us see her! and I know {{that it will be}} so. That grave old man with the bald head will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that 'the Lady Clara is not at home,' and then we shall have to leave without seeing her. But it does not matter with her as it might with others, for I know that her heart will be with us." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the smith}} <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> he, 'It's a shame for a strong, big fellow {{like you to}} be lazy, and so much work to be done. Are you any good with hammer and tongs? Come in and bear a hand, an I'll give you diet and lodging, and a few pence when you earn them.' 'Never say't twice,' says the prince. 'I want nothing but to be busy.' So he took the hammer, and pounded away at the red-hot bar that the smith was turning on the anvil to make into a set of horse-shoes.|$|R

60|$|Pretty soon {{he got to}} {{worrying}} and fretting {{right along}} {{day in and day}} out, and when I asked him what WAS he in such a state about, he said it 'most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away, and him getting older and older, and no wars breaking out and no way of making a name for himself that he could see. Now that is the way boys is always thinking, but he was the first one I ever heard <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, doctor, dear, {{the devil}} and the Kaiser--if so be that they are really two {{different}} people--are not refined. And you cannot refer {{to them in a}} refined way. So I abide by what I said, although you may notice that I am careful not to use such expressions when young Rilla is about. And I maintain that the papers have no right to say that the Kaiser has pneumonia and raise people's hopes, and then <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> he has nothing but a boil. A boil, indeed! I wish he was covered with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They abut, as you remember, {{upon the}} landing of the marble {{staircase}} of Schloss X----; {{the entrance to}} Prince Victor's suite of rooms being opposite the Princess's on the same landing. This space is large, filled with sofas and benches, and the gentlemen and officers who waited upon the Duke {{used to make a}} sort of antechamber of the landing-place, and pay their court to his Highness there, as he passed out, at eleven o'clock, to parade. At such a time, the heyducs within the Princess's suite of rooms used to turn out with their halberts and present to Prince Victor--the same ceremony being performed on his own side, when pages came out and announced the approach of his Highness. The pages used to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "The Prince, gentlemen!" [...] and the drums beat in the hall, and the gentlemen rose, who were waiting on the benches that ran along the balustrade.|$|E
5000|$|Hinting: Try to get {{others to}} comply by hinting around {{at what you}} want them to do. That is, try to gain their {{compliance}} by indicating indirectly what you want, hoping they will figure it <b>out</b> <b>and</b> comply even though you never <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> really <b>say</b> it. Example: [...] "I left the trash by the front door, so Dan would take it out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Abbey also {{introduces}} {{the only major}} gay character in any of his eight novels, Phillip Feathersmith. Abbey doesn't <b>come</b> right <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> he's gay, but he describes his [...] "fairy-flower" [...] hands, talks about what a pink little fellow he is, and Jonathan calls him [...] "Fairysmith" [...] in his own mind. Feathersmith shows an attraction to Jonathan that is not very subtle.|$|R
40|$|Jayne Cortez in Coagulations just <b>comes</b> right <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> all {{the things}} that need to be said, things that might only be thought about {{momentarily}} if at all. Not only does she say them, but Jayne Cortez speaks with such force and clarity that the reader is right there on the scene with her. And the scene is not pretty; there are no beautiful flowers growing in the country in the picture Cortez paints...|$|R

5000|$|Ironically, sacked manager Steve Claridge {{had spoken}} to BBC Sport on 13 April stating, [...] "I was treated {{absolutely}} disgracefully at Millwall, for people to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> after I'd gone and say, he had to go, we could have got relegated—well, they have done really well since I left, haven't they?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In his book, Psychic Blues: Confessions of a Conflicted Medium, Mark Edward {{describes}} himself as walking {{both sides of the}} line. “My magician friends — many of them skeptics — thought I was selling out to the psychics, and the psychics thought I was selling out to the skeptics.” Many skeptics, who are magicians and mediums, consider themselves not only uniquely qualified, but also obligated to teach the public that psychics are fake. They consider it a moral duty to inform their audience that they are performing tricks and not using supernatural powers. Edward used his expertise as a mentalist to expose the charlatans as frauds, but prefers not to use disclaimers, defending his work as a psychic as pure entertainment. “It’s as if he believes he can deceive people and enlighten them at the same time.” [...] Edward stated in his book that using a disclaimer is like ordering a dinner at a fancy French restaurant and, just when the waiter is about to serve the meal, the chef <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> it <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of a can. His critics would argue that the problem isn't that the appreciation for the meal was ruined. The problem is that the customer paid a premium price for canned food.|$|R
60|$|If {{this thing}} keeps on {{it will make}} me believe that I am what these kind chairmen say of me. In {{introducing}} me, Judge Ransom spoke of my modesty {{as if he was}} envious of me. I would like to have one man <b>come</b> <b>out</b> flat-footed <b>and</b> <b>say</b> something harsh <b>and</b> disparaging of me, even if it were true. I thought at one time, as the learned judge was speaking, that I had found that man; but he wound up, like all the others, by saying complimentary things.|$|R
5000|$|Gest paid ITV to be {{released}} from his contract in July and ITV came back saying they {{had no idea what to}} do with him. Gest was quick to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that he wanted to {{be released}}: [...] "My lawyers negotiated an early release so I could host The Friday Night Project on Channel 4", Gest told The Sun.|$|E
5000|$|When Nelson Mandela {{announced}} {{the cause of}} his son's death, he said: [...] "Let us give publicity to HIV/AIDS and not hide it, because {{the only way to make}} it appear like a normal illness like tuberculosis, like cancer, is always to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> somebody has died because of HIV/AIDS, and people will stop regarding it as something extraordinary." ...|$|E
5000|$|Barker later rewrote {{the ending}} of the sketch, citing the reason as dissatisfaction with the obscurity and {{coarseness}} of the bill-hooks reference. He revealed in the last episode of The Two Ronnies Sketchbook in 2005 that, instead of another male shop assistant coming out and replacing Corbett, a large lady would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Right then young man, what kind of knockers do you want?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't, eh? Well, {{what do you}} say to this? I <b>come</b> {{straight}} <b>out</b> <b>and</b> I <b>says</b> to her, 'Did you or did you not {{taste the}} whisky Cy had?' <b>and</b> she <b>says,</b> 'I think I did take one sip--Cy made me,' she said. She owned up to that much, so you can imagine----" ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{district}} {{which has been}} a favorite haunt for left-wingers for some considerable time, Navarro <b>comes</b> right <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> he's downright against all kinds of bureaucracy, Socialism or any other kind of ism[...] [...] [...] Although the Council job is supposedly nonpartisan, he's up against two old-line, left-wing Democrats, G. Vernon Bennett, the incumbent, and Assemblyman Vernon Kilpatrick, who's willing to ditch his State post for a city job if he can get it. Bennett, 16 years in the Council, is nearing 70 and during recent months was in trouble with the police. He appears to be on the way out.|$|R
5000|$|MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote {{positively}} {{about the}} episode, stating [...] "I'm {{just going to}} <b>come</b> right <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> it: 'Transference' would have been great if it hadn't positioned Fish Mooney {{to be a major}} player when Gotham returns for Season 3. It had everything — Edward Nygma hosting the worst game show ever, Firefly vs. Mr. Freeze, Selina being awesome, Bruce being awesome, LUCIUS M. F-ing FOX, Penguin home decorating tips and the Court of Owls. Oh, I mean the 'Secret Court.' Whatever. It's the Court of Owls, and the Court of Owls is awesome. [...] " ...|$|R
