It is widely applied in high pressure airless spray machine. <b>Reversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is the core}} component of pneumatic pump. According to different ways of distributing and reversing gas, pneumatic pump <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{can be divided into}} two major categories: pneumatic control type and mechanical type. We summarize the history of the development and the present situation of research and compare various <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the realization principle, design of structure, manufacturing, vibration noise and cost of production etc. Then we put forward the direction of its research and development, which provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent development of high quality and efficient pneumatic pump...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reverse</b> charge <b>mechanism</b> is {{considered}} to be a specific mechanism when applying the value added tax. The liability to declare and pay the output tax is transferred to the recipient of the fulfillment within the <b>reverse</b> charge <b>mechanism.</b> Since Apri 1 1, 2011 there has been extended the application of the <b>reverse</b> charge <b>mechanism</b> to the domestic (home) fulfillments and since this date the mechanism has been applied to the delivery of slag, waste and metal scrap, defined in the Annex 5 and to the trading with the greenhouse gas emissions allowances.

5000|$|The Ragonnet {{power reverse}}, {{patented}} in 1909, {{was a true}} feedback controlled servomechanism. The power reverse amplified small motions of reversing lever in the locomotive cab made with modest force into much larger and more forceful motions of the reach rod that controlled the engine cutoff and direction. [...] It was usually air powered, but could also be steam powered. [...] The term servomotor was explicitly used by the developers of some later power <b>reverse</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> [...] The use of feedback control in these later power <b>reverse</b> <b>mechanisms</b> eliminated {{the need for a}} second cylinder for a hydraulic locking mechanism, and it restored the simplicity of a single operating lever that both controlled the reversing linkage and indicated its position.|$|R
40|$|This final thesis {{deals with}} {{introduction}} of <b>reverse</b> charge <b>mechanism</b> of value added tax. The {{current system of}} value added tax has weaknesses, including carousel fraud, negative impact on cash flow of businesses and complicated rules to collect and manage the tax. <b>Reverse</b> charge <b>mechanism</b> is considered as a solution of existing weaknesses of current system. Although this regime is able to solve the mentioned weaknesses, it also has some disadvantages. Especially, it is {{a negative impact on}} cash flow of state budget which is concretely quantified in this final thesis. Other problems of introduction of <b>reverse</b> charge <b>mechanism</b> include concentration of the whole tax with the last tax payer, issues at retail sales where tax payers and non-payers exist and minor complications in the transition to the new system. For all the negatives this thesis is trying to find solutions to eliminate or reduce them.

The potential causes of TRALI can be explained by two distinct mechanism including the anti-leukocyte antibodies in donor plasma or in recipient plasma with the <b>reverse</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and biological response modifiers in susceptible individuals.

40|$|Disk plows {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tillage tools. Two way (reversible) disk plows can perform continues plowing. So they can save time and costs and hence improve overall efficiency. In this study, a “two-way” disk plow was designed based on a λ-formed straight-line, four-bar linkage (Daniel mechanism). This design contains disk and rear wheel <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> stabilization mechanism of the plow, a disk angle adjustment tool and transport condition for safe operation of the <b>mechanism.</b> Disk <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> was designed based on a geometrical analysis considering working condition of the disk plow. The suitable displacement of the plow’s frame was achieved by dimensional analysis of Daniel mechanism and a derived mathematical equation. The rear wheel mechanism was made by means of adding a slotted link to the previous four-bar linkage. The synthesized five-bar linkage was then analyzed for its kinematical and force conditions. For each analysis, related diagrams were plotted and discussed. This innovation has the advantages of low production cost and maintenance as well as easy operation, because of its design simplicity with minimum mechanical auxiliaries. The modeling and analysis was done by the aid of CATIA software...|$|R
