2500|$|Sămănătoruls {{views on}} aesthetics, Romanian {{literature}} and Romanian art were closely connected to its discourse about Romanian specificity, the peasant class and didacticism. Discussing the Sămănătorist stage of Iorga's career, Sandqvist notes: [...] "In Iorga's opinion literature {{and culture in}} general must be oriented toward the specific nature of the Romanian people and [...] bring forth a love for the Romanian village and its people. To him art has a specific ethical-ethnic function, a mission to stimulate and to express the Romanian farmer, {{in accordance with the}} notion of the need for the artist and the poet to unite in a 'holy' union with the woods, the rivers and the whole of nature in a constant uprising against a civilization that has alienated man from his natural, original existence." [...] Such pronouncements on the matter were reported with <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> by historians: Veiga writes that the peasant promoted by Sămănătorul was [...] "archaic and eternal, very 'decorative' and bucolic", while Sandqvist refers to both Sămănătorists and Poporanists as producing [...] "nationalistic anthems", [...] "unctuous songs of praise to the Romanian peasant and the Romanian village", as well as [...] "pathetic glorifying of the past". According to Paul Cernat, the Sămănătorist worldview favored, instead of both modernity and art for art's sake, [...] "an idyllic, rudimentary-populist, picturesque-ethnographic and sentimental moralism." [...] Other researchers have also described Sămănătorist writings as being primarily characterized by excessive patriarchal nostalgia.|$|E
6000|$|I {{listened with}} horribly <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> to that service I {{had had to}} read myself, once or twice, over childlike men who had died at sea. The words of hope and defiance, the winged words so inspiring in the free immensity of water and sky, seemed to fall wearily into the little grave. What {{was the use of}} asking Death where her sting was, before that small, dark hole in the ground? And then my {{thoughts}} escaped me altogether--away into matters of life--and no very high matters at that--ships, freights, business. In the instability of his emotions man resembles deplorably a monkey. I was disgusted with my thoughts--and I thought: Shall I {{be able to get a}} charter soon? Time's money. [...] .

They treated him {{with a sort of}} wonder on the [...] "don't touch" [...] system, like an object in an exhibition. The restoration, however, of, his self-respect proceeded with success. For all the semblance of having grown too big for Shelton's clothes, for all his vividly burnt face, and the quick but guarded play of cynicism on his lips--he did much credit to his patrons. He had subdued his terror of a razor, and looked well in a suit of Shelton's flannels. For, after all, he had only been eight years exiled from middle-class gentility, and he had been a waiter half that time. But Shelton wished him at the devil. Not for his manners' sake--he was never tired of watching how subtly the vagabond adapted his conduct to the conduct of his hosts, while keeping up his critical detachment--but because that <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> was a constant spur to his own vision, compelling him to analyse the life into which, he had been born and was about to marry. This process was disturbing; and to find out when it had commenced, he {{had to go back to}} his meeting with Ferrand on the journey up from Dover.|$|E

6000|$|John Bull's Other Island {{represents}} a realism somewhat more tinged with the later transcendentalism of its author. In one sense, of course, it is a satire on the conventional Englishman, who is never so silly or sentimental {{as when he}} sees silliness and sentiment in the Irishman. Broadbent, whose mind is all fog and his morals all gush, is firmly persuaded that he is bringing reason and order among the Irish, whereas in truth they are all smiling at his illusions with the <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> of so many devils. There have been many plays depicting the absurd Paddy in a ring of Anglo-Saxons; the first purpose of this play is to depict the absurd Anglo-Saxon in a ring of ironical Paddies. But it has a second and more subtle purpose, which is very finely contrived. It is suggested that {{when all is said}} and done there is in this preposterous Englishman a certain creative power which comes from his simplicity and optimism, from his profound resolution rather to live life than to criticise it. I know no finer dialogue of philosophical cross-purposes than that in which Broadbent boasts of his commonsense, and his subtler Irish friend mystifies him by telling him that he, Broadbent, has no common-sense, but only inspiration. The Irishman admits in Broadbent a certain unconscious spiritual force even in his very stupidity. Lord Rosebery coined the very clever phrase [...] "a practical mystic." [...] Shaw is here maintaining that all practical men are practical mystics. And he is really maintaining also that the most practical of all the practical mystics is the one who is a fool.|$|E

Therefore, he came up with the concept of “epic theatre”. This direction of theatre was inspired by Brecht’s Marxist political beliefs. It was something of a political platform for his ideologies. Epic theatre is the assimilation of education through entertainment and is the antithesis of Stanislavsky’s Realism and also Expressionism. Brecht believed that, unlike epic theatre, Expressionism and Realism were incapable of exposing human nature and so had no educational value. He conjectured that his form of theatre was capable of provoking a change in society. Brecht’s intention was to encourage the audience to ponder, with <b>critical</b> <b>detachment,</b> the moral dilemmas presented before them.|$|E
40|$|Earth based {{experiments}} {{on the science}} of detached crystal growth are being conducted on germanium and germanium-silicon alloys (2 at% Si average composition) {{in preparation for a}} series of experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The purpose of the microgravity experiments includes differentiating among proposed mechanisms contributing to detachment, and confirming or refining our understanding of the detachment mechanism. Because large contact angle are <b>critical</b> to <b>detachment,</b> sessile drop measurements were used to determine the contact angles as a function of temperature and composition for a large number of substrates made of potential ampoule materials. Growth experiments have used pyrolytic boron nitride (pBN) and fused silica ampoules with the majority of the detached results occurring predictably in the pBN. The contact angles were 173 deg (Ge) and 165 deg (GeSi) for pBN. For fused silica, the contact angle decreases from 150 deg to an equilibrium value of 117 deg (Ge) or from 129 deg to an equilibrium value of 100 deg (GeSi) over the duration of the experiment. The nature and extent of detachment is determined by using profilometry in conjunction with optical and electron microscopy. The stability of detachment has been analyzed, and an empirical model for the conditions necessary to achieve sufficient stability to maintain detached growth for extended periods has been developed. Results in this presentation will show that we have established the effects on detachment of ampoule material, pressure difference above and below the melt, and silicon concentration; samples that are nearly completely detached can be grown repeatedly in pBN...|$|R
40|$|Repellents evoke {{growth cone}} turning by {{eliciting}} asymmetric, localized loss of actin cytoskeleton together {{with changes in}} substratum attachment. We have demonstrated that semaphorin- 3 A (Sema 3 A) -induced growth cone detachment and collapse require eicosanoid-mediated activation of protein kinase C � (PKC�) and that the major PKC � target is the myristoylated, alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS). Here, we show that PKC activation is necessary for growth cone turning and that MARCKS, while at the membrane, colocalizes with � 3 -integrin in a peripheral adhesive zone of the growth cone. Phosphorylation of MARCKS causes its translocation from the membrane to the cytosol. Silencing MARCKS expression dramatically reduces growth cone spread, whereas overexpression of wild-type MARCKS inhibits growth cone collapse triggered by PKC activation. Expression of phosphorylation-deficient, mutant MARCKS greatly expands growth cone adhesion, and this is characterized by extensive colocalization of MARCKS and � 3 -integrin, resistance to eicosanoid-triggered detachment and collapse, and reversal of Sema 3 A-induced repulsion into attraction. We conclude that MARCKS is involved in regulating growth cone adhesion as follows: its nonphosphorylated form stabilizes integrin-mediated adhesions, and its phosphorylation-triggered release from adhesions causes localized growth cone <b>detachment</b> <b>critical</b> for turning and collapse...|$|R
40|$|Lupine protein {{concentrate}} is a promising ingredient {{that can be}} obtained by a combination of milling and air classification, generally called dry fractionation. This is a more sustainable route than conventional wet extraction and delivers a {{protein concentrate}} with native functional properties. <b>Critical</b> is the <b>detachment</b> of the protein bodies from other seed components during milling. Ideally, the protein bodies are released during milling, whereas the other components remain in larger particles (D 0. 5 > 40 µm) to facilitate effective air classification. Coarse milling (down to 100 µm) followed by air classification gave concentrates with protein contents between 54 and 59 g protein/ 100 g dry solids and yields up to 13 %. The application of flowability aids (fused silica particles) during air classification doubled the yield of the protein-rich fraction. The air classified protein concentrate could provide a 2. 3 times extended half-life of the foam compared to an intensively heated protein concentrate. In addition, the viscosity of the native concentrate was lower, while after (in vitro) digestion the amount of proteins smaller than 3 kDa was higher in native and mildly heated concentrates compared to intensively heated concentrate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We perform {{molecular}} dynamics simulations on the detach-ment of nanoparticles from a substrate. The <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> force, f*, is obtained {{as a function}} of the nanoparticle radius, Rp, shear modulus, G, surface energy, γp, and work of adhesion, W. The magnitude of the detachment force is shown to increase from πWRp to 2. 2 πWRp with increasing nanoparticle shear modulus and nanoparticle size. This variation of the detachment force is a manifestation of neck formation upon nanoparticle detachment. Using scaling analysis, we show that the magnitude of the detachment force is controlled by the balance of the nanoparticle elastic energy, neck surface energy, and energy of nanoparticle adhesion to a substrate. It is a function of the dimensionless parameter δ ∝ γp(GRp) − 1 / 3 W− 2 / 3, which is proportional to the ratio of the surface energy of a neck and the elastic energy of a deformed nanoparticle. In the case of small values of the parameter δ ≪ 1, the <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> force approaches a critical Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts force, f * ≈ 1. 5 πWRp, as is usually the case for strongly cross-linked, large nanoparticles.

The critical amplitude of particle detachment was determined at a fixed frequency (50 Hz). The detachment experiments were conducted using model quartz particles of various size and hydrophobicity. Results showed that particles (600 - 850 m) with high contact angle (90 degree) required high amplitudes for detachment from bubbles. In contrast, quartz particles with low contact angle (49 degree) exhibited the considerably lower <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> amplitude.

30|$|The two notions {{introduced}} {{above are}} both {{widely seen as}} desirable educational goals, and often interpreted as interdependent or even mutually indispensable attributes. Raya, Lamb and Vieira (2007) emphasizing “the conceptual link between autonomy and rationality” (p. 43) claim that “the competence to think critically is coextensive with the notions of autonomy and self-sufficiency”(p. 43). And in a well-known characterization, Little (1991) describes autonomy as a capacity “for <b>detachment,</b> <b>critical</b> reflection, decision-making, and independent action” (p. 4). According to scholars such as Little (1991), the notion of learner autonomy is a “particular kind of psychological relation to the process and content of…learning” Little (1991, p. 4). These two concepts namely as criticality and autonomy {{have a lot in}} common as Esch (2009) suggests, a choice between the two roads: “the road giving prominence to individual personal autonomy or the road giving prominence to autonomy as the capacity to exercise critical thinking about learning as a participant in a social milieu” (p. 33). While autonomy will likely continue to be an educational buzzword (Little, 1991), higher order thinking is clearly another very important one now (Stapleton, 2011). The rationale for such focus is that higher order thinking is the key to the development students are expected to make during/at the end of the educational program, i.e. to feel they are part of the academic community and take a critical position on issues that they read about which affect their own real-life contexts, or to be able to take critical positions on issues that impact on them.|$|R
40|$|Turbulence plays a <b>critical</b> role in <b>detachment</b> {{process of}} bubble from a solid surface. To {{investigate}} this effect, detachment process of a stationary air bubble from a nozzle in both quiescent and turbulent liquid field was studied. A stationary vertical (flat-ended) needle of ID 1. 24 [*]mm {{was used as}} a nozzle to generate a bubble which was anchored to the needle tip. Different sizes of bubbles were generated in quiescent liquid. Volume and contact angle for these bubbles were measured precisely using microscopic imaging technique and correlated. In the quiescent case experiments, a constant contact angle of 90 ° and bubble diameter of 3. 05 [*]±[*] 0. 004 [*]mm were obtained consistently. A simple force balance approach was proposed assuming bubble in equilibrium to determine this maximum bubble diameter during detachment. The detached bubble size calculated using this approach agreed fairly well with the experimental results. An oscillating grid device capable of operating at different frequencies was then applied to generate a homogeneous, near-isotropic turbulent velocity field around the anchored bubble. It was observed that for detachment of smaller bubbles, higher turbulence intensity was indeed necessary. The turbulent flow field was quantified using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique and resolved into flow structures (eddies) of different length scales using a Gaussian filter. It was concluded that smaller eddies perturbed the bubble interface whilst the larger eddies contributed to weakening of the capillary force causing the bubble detachment. Energy dissipation profile obtained from the PIV images indicated significant energy dissipation near the bubble compared to the bulk fluid which supported the fact that strong interactions between bubble and eddies were indeed responsible for bubble detachment...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} numerically the <b>critical</b> {{conditions for}} <b>detachment</b> of an isolated, wall-bound pendant emulsion droplet acted upon by surface tension and wall-normal buoyancy forces alone. To that end, {{we present a}} simple extension of a diffuse interface model for partially miscible binary mixtures that was previously employed for simulating several two-phase flow phenomena far and near the critical point ["Phase-Field Approach to Multiphase Flow Modeling," Milan J. Math. 79, 597 (2011) ] to allow for static contact angles other than 90 °. Initially, we show that a formulation of the Cahn boundary condition based on a linear interpolation of surface tensions between the wall and each phase at equilibrium can be readily implemented in our numerical procedures by introducing a contact line indicator function and changes to our numerical algorithm that include an iterative method of enforcing inhomogeneous boundary conditions within a semi-implicit temporal scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Subsequently, the classical formulation of the Cahn boundary condition as first proposed by Jacqmin ["Contact-line dynamics of a diffuse fluid interface," J. Fluid Mech. 402, 57 (2000) ], which accommodates a cubic (Hermite) interpolation of surface tensions between the wall and each phase at equilibrium, has also been incorporated into our numerical code. We show that the resulting phase-field models can be successfully employed for simulating three-phase contact line problems in stable emulsions with nearly immiscible components. We also show the first numerical determination of critical Bond numbers {{as a function of}} static contact angle by phase-field simulation. In addition, results of 3 D simulations are compared to critical Bond numbers from a static stability analysis based on a numerical integration of the Young-Laplace equation. We argue that the discrepancy between our numerically determined static contact angle dependence of the critical Bond number and its sharp-interface counterpart is mainly due to the inability of the sharp interface analysis to describe the necking regime of drop detachment, where a sharpening of concentration gradients in the necking region produces an effective increase in (dynamic) surface tension, ultimately leading to a reduced tendency to detachment or an increase in the critical Bond number...|$|R

40|$|Active {{detachment}} of cells from microbial biofilms {{is a critical}} yet poorly understood step in biofilm development. We discovered that {{detachment of}} cells from biofilms of Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 can be induced by arresting the medium flow in a hydrodynamic biofilm system. Induction of detachment was rapid, and substantial biofilm dispersal started as soon as 5 min after the stop of flow. We developed a confocal laser scanning microscopy-based assay to quantify detachment. The extent of biomass loss {{was found to be}} dependent on the time interval of flow stop and on the thickness of the biofilm. Up to 80 % of the biomass of 16 -h-old biofilms could be induced to detach. High-resolution microscopy studies revealed that detachment was associated with an overall loosening of the biofilm structure and a release of individual cells or small cell clusters. Swimming motility was not required for detachment. Although the loosening of cells from the biofilm structure was observed evenly throughout thin biofilms, the most pronounced detachment in thicker biofilms occurred in regions exposed to the flow of medium, suggesting a metabolic control of detachability. Deconvolution of the factors associated with the stop of medium flow revealed that a sudden decrease in oxygen tension is the predominant trigger for initiating detachment of individual cells. In contrast, carbon limitation did not trigger any substantial detachment, suggesting a physiological link between oxygen sensing or metabolism and detachment. In-frame deletions were introduced into genes encoding the known and putative global transcriptional regulators ArcA, CRP, and EtrA (FNR), which respond to changes in oxygen tension in S. oneidensis MR- 1. Biofilms of null mutants in arcA and crp were severely impacted in the stop-of-flow-induced detachment response, suggesting a role for these genes in regulation of detachment. In contrast, an ΔetrA mutant displayed a variable detachment phenotype. From this genetic evidence we conclude that detachment is a biologically controlled process and that a rapid change in oxygen concentration is a <b>critical</b> factor in <b>detachment</b> and, consequently, in dispersal of S. oneidensis cells from biofilms. Similar mechanisms might also operate in other bacteria...|$|R
40|$|See {{the program}} book, p. 120 [URL] {{learning}} means {{that students should}} have a ‘capacity for <b>detachment,</b> <b>critical</b> reflection, decision-making, and independent action’ (Little, 1991). It is a capacity taken for granted with PhD students applying for a scholarship in a global context. Moreover, in an academic environment, this capacity needs to be displayed in English. As an entry ticket to this world, candidates have to provide valid certificates proving their level of English. However, do these certificates also cover their autonomy (in English) in working, studying, networking at their host universities? In the process of project design and implementation, stakeholder expectations need to be regularly consulted. Since 2004, Flanders (Belgium) and Cuba have cooperated in capacity building projects for research in human and natural sciences, engineering and technology in higher education, granting joint PhDs to Cuban students ([URL] {{with the use of}} English as the lingua franca. This certification requirement has so far been an internal issue with many pitfalls and frustrations on both sides, as criteria were debatable and requirements of the Flemish host universities differing. In 2013, we started a transversal project at Universidad de Oriente (Santiago de Cuba) to find out how local tests may cross- fertilize with standardized international tests, and hopefully lead to the launch of an official language testing center by 2018, when the project ends. Recent political evolutions in Cuba have made this undertaking all the more adamant as the local situation now presses for more robust test validity and for assessment literacy from all stakeholders. As emphasized by different speakers at the recent Language Testing Literacy Symposium at Lancaster University (2016), this endeavor should include not only the testers and language instructors, but also the test users and university administrators. Following Morris and Baddache’s (2012) five-step approach to stakeholder engagement, this poster outlines the perspectives of different stakeholders at the Universidad de Oriente with respect to the assessment and certification of English language proficiency. Building on the stakeholder mapping exercise in Van Maele, Rodríguez González, Díaz Moreno, van Splunder and Baten (2015), in which we identified the most important stakeholder groups, we will now focus on the perspectives of the internal stakeholder groups, notably the language instructors, project leaders, PhD students, and university leadership on the Cuban side as well as the project leaders on the Flemish side.

40|$|A {{literature}} review of dental plaque biofilms formation, progression and detachment mechanisms {{is presented in}} this thesis. Various strategies that have been employed to reduce or eliminate dental biofilms are discussed. The focus of the thesis was on the mechanical properties and disruption of dental biofilms, especially from hard-to-access areas of the oral cavity, such as the interproximal (IP) sites between the teeth. Various methods to measure mechanical properties of dental biofilms were investigated, and physical and chemical strategies to disrupt these biofilms were employed. Streptococcus mutans, the bacterium responsible for initiation of dental plaque biofilms, was used in our studies. A uniaxial compressive test was utilized to characterize the mechanical behaviour of biofilms, while manipulating the chemical microenvironment. Initially, the mechanical properties of a dextran gel were characterized. The gel {{was used as an}} artificial dental plaque biofilm (Chapter 5). The elastic modulus of the gel was 17 kPa (± 12; n = 3), and the stress relaxation time was 25 seconds (± 18; n = 3), demonstrating a viscoelastic behaviour similar to that reported for real biofilms. After optimizing the technique with the gel, the mechanical properties of S. mutans biofilms were studied, the elastic modulus was 380 Pa (± 350; n = 30), and the stress relaxation time was 12 seconds (± 11; n = 10). The elastic modulus increased by increasing the sucrose percentage in the media, and decreased when the biofilms were treated with increasing concentrations of ethylene di-amine tetra acetic acid, EDTA. Treating the biofilms with different solutions of poly (ethylene glycol), PEG, resulted in behaviour similar to that previously observed for synthetic polymers. The flow field and local hydrodynamics of high velocity water microdrops impacting the interproximal (IP) space of typodont teeth, and their influence on the structure and detachment of both surrogate dental plaque and Streptococcus mutans biofilms, were studied experimentally and computationally. Water droplets of 115 ?L were produced by a prototype AirFloss (PT-AirFloss) device provided by Philips Oral Healthcare, bursting water at a velocity of 60 m/s into the IP space between the maxillary central incisors. High-speed imaging, was used to characterise the PT-AirFloss microburst of pressurized air and water micodrops, and demonstrated the removal mechanism of a dental plaque biofilm substitute and the S. mutans biofilms. Using various microscopy and image analysis techniques, quantitative measurements of the removal rate and the percentage removal of biofilms from different locations in the IP space were obtained. Microcomputed Tomography (?-CT) imaging was used to obtain 3 D images of the typodont and the IP spaces. The shear stress distribution generated by the drop impacting the tooth surface was calculated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations based on the finite element method (FEM). There was good agreement between experimentally measured biofilm removal and the pattern of predicted wall shear stress (?w) generated in the IP space by the microburst. High velocity water microdrops, with minimal fluid volume and time, effectively removed both the surrogate and the biofilm. The shear stress generated by the PT-AirFloss and its spatial distribution on the teeth surface {{played a key role in}} dictating the efficacy of biofilm removal. In addition, CFD models were used to predict optimal water drop or burst design with respect to more effective biofilm removal performance. Furthermore, the influence of fluid shear flow on the detachment of Streptococcus mutans biofilms inside microfluidic channels was studied using a commercially available flow-cell system. A <b>critical</b> biofilm <b>detachment</b> shear stress was estimated for the large biofilm-aggregates (CDSSagg). The CDSSagg value was used in the CFD model to predict the spatial distribution of biofilm aggregates detachment from the IP surface caused by the PT-AirFloss microburst. Next the effect of three biofilm matrix-degrading enzymes on the structure and detachment of Streptococcus mutans biofilms inside microtiter plates and on typodont teeth was studied experimentally. The enzymes used were: Bromelain (a protease), DNase, and RNase. The biofilms were treated with different enzymatic preparations, stained with Live/Dead and Crystal Violet, and the corresponding optical density (OD) and fluorescence intensity (FI) were measured by a microplate reader. The results detailed the degradation effect of each enzyme, separately and in combination. The three enzymes demonstrated different efficacies in degrading the biofilm in 6, 24 and 96 well-plates, as well as on the typodont teeth. Also, there was a large variability which could be explained by the heterogeneity of the biofilm. Using epifluorescence microscopy and image analysis, quantitative measurements of the percentage surface area coverage were obtained, and the preliminary results were consistent with the datafrom the plate reader. Furthermore, pre-coating the plates with the three enzymes did not inhibit biofilm from formation and accumulation. Lastly the use of a biocompatible copolymer of methylvinyl ether and maleic anhydride, with excellent mucosal adhesive properties and biocompatibility to improve enzymatic digestion by offering a prolonged contact of the enzymes with the teeth and oral tissues, was investigated. The rationale was to eliminate a major obstacle facing the efficacy of the enzymatic therapy which was the relatively short residence time of the enzymes at the site of administration. The adhesive copolymer could possibly enhance enzyme biofilm degradation. Combining the adhesive copolymer with the enzymes could potentially allow near total degradation of the laboratory-grown S. mutans biofilms...|$|R

Each of these methods, however, has its drawbacks. The present study aimed to design a simple and straightforward method to measure the adhesion strength of marine invertebrate larvae based on centrifugation. This centrifuge technique works in immersed conditions and applies forces acting at 45 ° to the substratum, therefore mimicking natural conditions. It was tested with three different substrata on two developmental stages of the sea star Asterina gibbosa: the brachiolaria larvae, which use temporary adhesion, and the metamorphic individuals which use permanent adhesion. Measurements were completed by SEM and TEM observations of the larval adhesive organs. The <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> force (force required to detach 50 % of the larvae) of brachiolaria larvae attached to glass (36 ± 9  μN) and rough PMMA (43 ± 16  μN) were equivalent and both significantly higher than the <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> force measured on smooth PMMA (11 ± 8  μN). Most metamorphic individuals, on the other hand, resisted to the highest centrifugation speed used, corresponding to a force of 2. 13  mN. For the hydrodynamics of larval settlement and metamorphosis, force is the ecologically relevant factor, and adhesion forces obtained by centrifugation are strikingly similar to forces measured for other marine invertebrate larvae with other methods. This indicates the usefulness of the centrifugation technique to compare adhesion of larvae between different species or development stages, or between different treatments. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe. This study seeks to penetrate that mystery by dissecting Perkins’s editorial practice and examining how he navigated the competing tensions between commercial success and aesthetic integrity in various circumstances. At play in the construction of his literary legacy are prevailing perceptions of authorship, complex interpersonal relationships, and the inherent battle between art and commerce. Focusing on his day-to-day activities, it is apparent that Perkins was guided by a unique editorial double vision—the propensity to appreciate the aesthetic experience while retaining the <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> necessary to appraise a literary work from a commercial standpoint—when solving the paradoxical dilemmas inherent in modern publishing...|$|E

Informed by Doreen Massey’s definition of space as ‘a simultaneity of stories so far’, the author’s approach involves extracting sounds from the contemporary soundscape and re-introducing them in the form of multi-layered compositions. This article conducts an analysis of the author’s soundwalking practice according to Max van Manen’s formulation of four essential categories of experience through which to consider our ‘lived world’: spatiality, temporality, corporeality, and relationality. Drawing upon theorists whose concerns include cinematic, mobile and environmental sound, such as Chion, Chambers and Schafer, the author proposes the soundwalk as as an expanded form of cinema, with the flexibility to provoke states of immersion was well as <b>critical</b> <b>detachment.</b> A case is made for the application of the medium within the artistic investigation into ecological and socio-political issues alongside aesthetic concerns...|$|E

40|$|The {{stiction}} of microstructures {{is still}} a challenging problem in spite of innovative advances in modern micromachining technology. In this paper, diamond-like carbon films were suggested as a solution for this problem. The microwave electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced CVD equipment {{has been applied to}} prepare the DLC films. Confocal Raman spectra confirmed the DLC characteristics of the prepared films. Water contact angle increased from 110 o on DLC-coated surfaces. The adhesion force of the DLC films was as low as 3. 8 nN measured by AFM, whereas the adhesion force of the oxide-coated surfaces was approximately 11. 2 nN. The polysilicon cantilever beam arrays have been used to determine the success of DLC coating for releasing microstructures. DLC films were prepared under the polysilicon cantilever beams with the sacrificial etching technology. The beam arrays were checked with scanning electron microscope. When the DLC films presented, the average longest detachment length was approximately 145 ȝm. While the DLC films didn’t present, the average <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> length was shorter than 80 ȝm. These results indicated the stiction of polysilicon cantilever beams was effectively restrained with DLC coatings. Key words: stiction, diamond-like carbon films, MEMS, cantilever beam 1...|$|E

In the regime of droplets formation, the interaction with the gas flow leads to an oscillating mechanisms that is fundamental to study the detachment from the GDL surface. In this work, a numerical model of a droplet growing on the GDL surface is developed to describe the interaction between droplet and gas flow. Therefore, a lumped force balance is enforced to determine the center of mass motion law. Oscillation frequencies during growth and at detachment are found {{as a function of}} droplet size. The model is also exploited to find the relationship between droplet <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> size and gas velocity. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data previously published by the authors as well as with other experimental results available in the literature. The matching between the numerical and experimental data is very good. The low computational burden and the conciseness of the proposed approach make the model suitable for applications such as control and optimization strategies development to enhance PEMFC performance.

40|$|One of {{the first}} {{readings}} we encountered in this summer’s seminar was by Josef Pieper, an article about "intellectuals " {{and their relationship to}} the Church. Now Pieper defines "intellectual " as he hears that word used in Europe; not everyone of intellectual talent or erudition counts as an "intellectual. " Pieper uses the term to denote a specific class of thinkers, who 1) are in some sense "outsiders " to the institution upon which they comment, 2) maintain an air of <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> and nonconformity to the institution, and 3) try to effect some sort of change in the institution. For Pieper, however, such people are not the best ones to try to effect change in the Church. "Critical detachment " might well disqualify one for the task if the issue is, for instance, the Incarnation or the sacraments. Such "detachment " may well mean that one misses the point about things which require unreserved participation to be properly understood. The Church is like this. The truly successful innovators in the Church, Pieper points out, are not the outsiders, but the saints, "human beings in whom the passionate critique of existing conditions was combined with a totally selfless integration into the institutional hierarchy of the Church. " 1 The issue before us, I think, is whether we as faculty members are called to be "intellectuals " (in Pieper’s sense of the term, as opposed to scholars) within our own community. It all depends, of course, on what kind of community a Catholic university is, or ought to be. II. In my ethics classes, my students read works by some of the great philosophical mind...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the British novel was shaped to a large and as yet unexplored extent by shame. While shame might appear the hallmark of Victorian repression, I examine how its revisionary potential works through nineteenth-century novelistic form, troubling limited constructions of gendered subjectivity, social roles, and modes of literary engagement. From the genre's inception, novelists and readers courted the shame-linked to the excessively emotional and feminine-that marked novelistic production and consumption. Rather than disavow or downplay such shame, however, nineteenth-century novelists often embraced and reimagined it. Elizabeth Bennet's "mortifying perusal" of Darcy's letter, Jane Eyre's humiliation before the classroom at Lowood, Becky Sharp's scandalous exposure when caught with Lord Steyne: in these scenes, innovations in novelistic form occur not in spite of shame, but through it. Reading such scenes of shame in works by Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, William Makepeace Thackeray, and George Du Maurier, I show how influential experiments in narrative technique engage shame {{as a model of}} selfconscious reflection, narration, and reading that refines the novel's form and cultural status by redefining the implications of close contact with feminized emotion. Such displays of shameful self-consciousness countered the widespread denigration of irrational feminine emotiveness that haunted the novelist and novel reader throughout the century, offering instead an analytic yet still emotionally charged form of investment in literary and social conventions. By placing these texts in dialogue with historical and current theories of emotion that highlight shame's capacity to forge identity and social attachments in ways that do not depend on strict identification with others or with social norms more broadly, I approach nineteenth-century novels as incisive theorizations of shame in their own right. In thus helping us to think beyond a stark binary of identification or <b>critical</b> <b>detachment,</b> novelistic shame enriches ongoing discussions of the stakes of emotional investments-in others, in social conventions, and in literature...|$|E
40|$|Only {{ten years}} since Derrida’s death, with <b>critical</b> <b>detachment,</b> is it {{possible}} {{to be in touch with}} him again, to start from the beginning of his philosophizing in company with Plato, and from this vantage point to re-read Dissemination? What really stands between Plato and Derrida? In the first page of Pharmacia Derrida writes: “We will take off here from the Phaedrus [...] . Only a blind or grossly insensitive reading, could indeed spread the rumour that Plato was simply condemning the writer’s activity”. 1 Hence the question: Is the nexus writing/pharmakon profitable for thinking of something ambivalent and irreducible, present and absent, something bearer of indefinitely deferred presence in the play of infinite real or imaginary substitutions? The main enterprise of this essay orbits about the problematic of writing, understood as τέχνη, but also as a key locus of relation Plato/ Derrida. Here technology - and thinking of its function and value- I would like to argue, regards the technical and non-technical, the practical and theoretical, seeing that thinking of their function remains always a “parasitical contamination”, seeing that writing is another speech, and, according this statement, we may regard Plato as he who paves the way for Derrida. In what follows, through textual analysis I will focus on some interesting unrolling, connected and disconnected threads by discussing the readings of different scholars and philosophers such as the disputed classicist E. A. Havelock, the historians of ancient philosophy G. Reale and C. H. Kahn. In particular I will explore, first, the nexus speech/writing, and argue that historically Plato was a bi-medial philosopher and writer, an aspect taken for granted, but not sufficiently attended by scholarship. In the second part of the essay I hold that the Derridean reading of ‘Plato’s Pharmacy’ discovers a special deconstruction at work within Plato’s dialogues. In the light of the manifold τέχνη, and of the hybrid Khora, at the end the apparent ambiguity in Plato’s stance and Derrida’s φάρμακον invites us to identify Plato as the Father of deconstruction...|$|E
40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEMFCs) {{are considered to}} be one of the most promising alternative power source for the automotive industry and stationary applications. However, proper water management in PEMFCs remains a challenge, hindering broader commercialization of this technology. Water as a by-product of this technology plays a complex role in the performance of a fuel cell. Too much water will flood the cell while too little water will dry the membrane. Both cases are not desired when operating fuel cells. Due to saturation and/or condensation, liquid water inevitably forms and the uniqueness is emergence of liquid water from the interconnected water pathways of gas diffusion layer (GDL) to gas flow channels. In flow channels, liquid water emerges in the form of droplets, growing to a critical size and becoming unstable. After detachment of unstable droplets, various gas-liquid flow patterns might occur alone or simultaneously along the channel depending on the operating conditions. In this work, based on a force balance analysis an analytical approach was developed to predict which flow pattern is likely to occur under different operating conditions relevant to the fuel cell. It is found that the critical droplet size depends on the superficial gas velocity, contact angle and contact angle hysteresis of growing droplets. Also, the flow pattern assignment is influenced by the contact angle and contact angle hysteresis of droplets showing that increasing contact angle hysteresis leads to the slug flow regime. The opaque nature of fuel cell components, including GDL materials, poses significant challenges to understand liquid transport in PEM fuel cells. In recent years, much attention has been placed on development of visualization techniques to detect liquid water and diagnose flooding problems in PEM fuel cells. In this study, an advanced synchrotron X-ray imaging technique available at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) was employed for the first time to visualize liquid water transport in a PEM fuel cell under different operating parameters of relevance to fuel cell operation. Due to high spatial and temporal resolution coupled with high energy photons of the X-ray beam, synchrotron radiation can obtain high-resolution images of liquid water behaviour inside the GDL and gas flow channels of fuel cells. Using the X-ray images, evolution of droplets including emergence, growth, and detachment under different superficial gas velocities, was visualized and a cyclic pattern was obtained. In addition, the evolution of the height and chord of growing droplets as well as their dynamic contact angles were analyzed quantitatively. The critical droplet sizes were also observed from X-ray images. Increasing superficial gas velocity results in a decrease in the <b>critical</b> <b>detachment</b> diameter of the droplets. Also, the critical droplet size at detachment was compared to a simplified analytical model and there was good agreement between theoretical predictions and the experimental data...|$|E
