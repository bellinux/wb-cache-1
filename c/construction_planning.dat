MWD chose the current site because of its geographic location, and began <b>construction</b> <b>planning</b> in 1993. Construction of the lake in 1995 with construction of the three dams. With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment construction, {{the construction of the}} dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a new standard for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California. Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E

While fixing them up difficulties and failures can't be avoided as the enclosed <b>construction</b> <b>plans</b> and installation instructions often cannot be understood but by experts. Industry has realized this problem and therefore offers - especially for complex objects - multimedia <b>construction</b> <b>plans,</b> e. g. in the form of video tapes, where the construction is illustrated in touch of reality. This easily understandable form of presentation can also be translated with the help of computer graphics and 3 D animation. Taking the example of a <b>construction</b> <b>plan</b> for seating furniture the paper on hand investigates how far these technologies can be used profitably for the presentation and illustration of those <b>construction</b> <b>plans</b> and instructions. The basis for the scenario to be investigated is a common, non-digital <b>construction</b> <b>plan</b> which illustrates the single construction steps exclusively graphically. The intention is to transfer the content of this <b>construction</b> <b>plan</b> to the greatest possible extent automatically into an interactive 3 D animation which is in touch with reality and afterwards put this at the consumer's disposal. Here the underlying concept intends to first of all digitalize the <b>construction</b> <b>plan.</b> Afterwards a software developed during this work makes use of the digital <b>construction</b> <b>plan</b> as well as methods of visual processors to identify the different construction parts. Doing this these parts are assigned to corresponding 3 D objects that have to be constructed separately. Additionally the software tries to determine from the <b>construction</b> <b>plan</b> the gradual <b>construction</b> of the object and to describe it by transforming the appropriate 3 D objects. Where - for different reasons - this cannot be realized the relevant construction parts are fit together manually and the affiliated transformations are generated by hand. To present the individual phases of the construction the different transformations are summarized chronologically in a scene graph. This one is afterwards visualized {{with the help of a}} separate software module...|$|R

25|$|Tyndall {{was born}} in Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Ireland. His father was a local police constable, descended from Gloucestershire emigrants who settled in {{southeast}} Ireland around 1670. Tyndall attended the local schools (Ballinabranna Primary School) in County Carlow until his late teens, and was probably an assistant teacher {{near the end of}} his time there. Subjects learned at school notably included technical drawing and mathematics with some applications of those subjects to land surveying. He was hired as a draftsman by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland in his late teens in 1839, and moved to work for the Ordnance Survey for Great Britain in 1842. In the decade of the 1840s, a railroad-building boom was in progress, and Tyndall's land surveying experience was valuable and in demand by the railway companies. Between 1844 and 1847, he was lucratively employed in railway <b>construction</b> <b>planning.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{leadership}} of the Public Works Authority was torn over the new agency's mission. PWA could initiate its own construction projects, distribute money to other federal agencies to fund their construction projects, or make loans to states and localities to fund their construction projects. But many in the Roosevelt administration felt PWA should not spend money, for fear of worsening the federal deficit, and so funds flowed slowly. Furthermore, {{the very nature of}} <b>construction</b> (<b>planning,</b> specifications, and blueprints) also held up the disbursement of money. Harold Ickes, too, was determined to ensure that graft and corruption did not tarnish the agency's reputation and lead to loss of political support in Congress, and so moved cautiously in spending the agency's money. Although the U.S. Supreme Court would rule Title I of NIRA unconstitutional, the severability clause in the Act enabled the PWA to survive. Among the projects it funded between 1935 and 1939 are: [...] the USS Yorktown; USS Enterprise; the 30th Street railroad station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Triborough Bridge; the port of Brownsville; Grand Coulee Dam; Boulder Dam; Fort Peck Dam; Bonneville Dam; and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with the mainland. The agency survived until 1943, when the Reorganization Act of 1939 consolidated most federal public works and work relief functions of the federal government into the new Federal Works Agency.|$|E
500|$|I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), {{which is}} based on the true story of Robert. E. Burns, {{is by far the most}} famous of the early 1930s chain gang films. In the first half of 1931, True Detective Mysteries {{magazine}} had published Burns' work over six issues, and it was released as a book in January 1932. Decorated veteran James Allen (Paul Muni) returns from World War I a changed man, and seeks an alternative to the tedious job that he left behind. He travels the country looking for construction work. His ultimate goal is to become involved in <b>construction</b> <b>planning.</b> Allen follows a hobo he met at a homeless shelter into a cafe, taking him up on his offer of a free meal. When the hobo attempts to rob the eatery, Allen is charged as an accessory, convicted of stealing a few dollars, and sentenced to ten years in a chain gang. The men are chained together and transported to a quarry to break rocks every day. Even when unchained from each other, shackles remain around their ankles at all times. Allen convinces a large black prisoner who has particularly good aim to hit the shackles on his ankles with a sledgehammer to bend them. He removes his feet from the bent shackles, and in a famous sequence, escapes through the woods while being chased by bloodhounds. On the outside he develops a new identity and becomes a respected developer in Chicago. He is blackmailed into marriage by a woman he does not love who finds out his secret. When he threatens to leave her for a young woman he has fallen in love with, she turns him in. His case becomes a cause célèbre, and he agrees to turn himself in under the agreement that he will serve 90 days and then be released. He is tricked however, and not freed at the agreed upon time. This forces him to escape again, and he seeks out the young woman, telling her that they cannot be together because he will always be hunted. The films end with her asking him how he survives, and his ominous reply from the darkness; [...] "I Steal".|$|E

500|$|The city's {{decision}} {{to conduct the}} archaeological survey in phases subsequently led to a lawsuit filed on February 1, 2011, by the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation on behalf of cultural practitioner Paulette Kaleikini. The suit, which named both {{the city and the}} State of Hawaii as defendants, contended [...] that state law requires the full length of the rail line to have an archaeological survey conducted before any construction takes place, and seeks to void the environmental impact statement and all construction permits issued for the project. Kaleikini's lawyers filed on February 18 a request for an injunction to stop work on the project until the case is resolved. [...] The suit was initially dismissed on March 23, 2011, after Circuit Court Judge Gary Chang ruled that state and federal laws allow the archaeological surveys to be conducted in phases. Kaleikini's lawyers subsequently appealed to the Hawaii Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the case on May 24, 2012. [...] The court ruled on August 24, 2012, that it agreed with plaintiff Kaleikini that the archaeological survey needed to be completed before construction could take place, and that the State Historic Preservation Division did not comply with state law when it approved the project. The case has now been remanded to Circuit Court. [...] On December 27, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii granted the plaintiffs' injunction, and ordered that all construction-related activities in segment 4 of the archaeological survey be halted until compliance with the Hawaii Supreme Court decision made earlier this year is met. [...] This ruling does not affect construction activities in the first three segments, nor does it affect <b>construction</b> <b>planning,</b> design, or engineering in segment 4, which is the final segment to be built. The Phase 4 area encompasses the downtown area and its immediate environs, including Chinatown, Mother Waldron Park, and Beretania Street. Judge Tashima, the only sitting judge on the case, ruled on condition of the injunction that the city is required to file periodic status updates on their compliance with the judgment. The injunction will then terminate 30 days after defendants file a notice of final compliance. City planners and rail representatives stated that archeological surveys will be completed early in 2013, and that this ruling would have no effect on construction in City Center. [...] Both sides are expected to appeal portions of the ruling that they do not agree with.|$|E
