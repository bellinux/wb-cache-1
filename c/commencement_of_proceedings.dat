5000|$|The {{government}} was replaced on 3 November by a cabinet of [...] "republican union" [...] {{presided over by}} Charles Dupuy, with Freycinet at the War Office and Lebret as keeper of the seals. The Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation, having the demand for a revision laid before it, held public hearings on October 27 and 28 to decide upon the admissibility of the demand. State attorney Manau and councilor Bard, the latter in a very remarkable report, both pronounced themselves in favor of revision. They adopted the two motives for the request presented by Madame Dreyfus: the admitted forgery by Colonel Henry, and {{the report of the}} handwriting experts of 1897, tending to show that the bordereau was not in Dreyfus's handwriting, as had been claimed in 1894, but was [...] "a tracing by Esterhazy." [...] The state attorney, an old republican, was in favor of immediately annulling the sentence of 1894 and suspending the punishment of Dreyfus; the councilor Bard, mindful of the resistance of the military as expressed in Zurlinden's letter, proposed that the Criminal Chamber simply declare the claim [...] "formally admissible" [...] and proceed to a further inquiry which would set people's minds at rest. It was this last expedient that commended itself to the Criminal Chamber (29 October); it was further decided (3 November) that instead of appointing a special commission, the court as a whole should hold this supplementary inquiry. They began at once and heard, in greatest secrecy, a long series of witnesses, including Esterhazy, who, under indictment for swindling his cousin Christian Esterhazy, obtained a safe-conduct to Paris. On 15 November the Criminal Chamber decided that Dreyfus be informed of the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> for the revision and returned to France to present his defense. This was the first news that the unhappy man had heard of the campaign begun in his behalf.|$|E

40|$|An {{appearance}} is the procedure {{used by the}} defendant to inform the plaintiff {{that he or she}} intends to defend the proceedings. The procedure prevents the plaintiff entering a default judgment or taking further steps without notice to the defendant. In Queensland, an {{appearance is}} known as a Notice of Intention to Defend. In the Australian Capital Territory, it is called a Notice of Intention to Respond. Appearances are of two types, though both types are not available in all jurisdictions. The most common type is an unconditional appearance, which acknowledges the court’s jurisdiction and waives any irregularity in service or <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The other form of appearance is a conditional appearance. Conditional appearances do not waive procedural irregularities, but preserve arguments based on lack of jurisdiction and other irregularities. In the event that an appearance is not entered, the defendant is at risk of a default judgment being entered. Appearances have been abolished in South Australia and in the Federal Court in favour of filing a Notice of Address for Service or alternatively in South Australia, a defence. In New South Wales a Submitting Appearance (r 6. 11) and in the Australian Capital Territory, Notice of Intention to Respond (r 106), may be used by a defendant to submit to the orders of the court save as to costs, and take no part in the proceedings...|$|E

40|$|EU public {{procurement}} legislation {{has been developed}} {{in order to promote}} principles of competition, equal treatment, mutual recognition, proportionality and transparency through the Public Sector Procurement Directive (2004 / 18 /EC) and the Utilities Directive (2004 / 17 /EC) which apply to supplies, works and services above the stipulated value thresholds procured by contracting authorities. For those economic operators who experience a breach of {{public procurement}} law a complaint can be made to the European Commission under the Article 258 procedure but this may be slow and ineffective. The Public Sector Remedies Directive and the Utilities Remedies Directive provide a new regime from December 2009 which includes inter alia a mandatory standstill period between award and contract signature in accordance with the Alcatel judgment, an obligation for Contracting Authorities (CAs) to provide feedback to tenderers and suspension of the contract award after the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The public procurement directives were developed from earlier legislation and incorporate further important principles established by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) relating to the integration of horizontal policies such as the achievement of social and environmental objectives into the public procurement process. Currently the process of modernising EU public procurement policy is underway {{in the form of a}} consultation process commencing with a green paper which seeks to invite views from all those who have a stake in public procurement with legislative proposals expected in 2012. The focus is upon the most effective ways of improving processes in order to achieve Europe 2020 objectives which set out to promote business innovation, a low-carbon economy and the participation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Before and since the implementation of the directives in national Public Contract Regulations (PCR) there has been a series of developments in EU and member state case law which have been instrumental in establishing legal principles to address the multitude of grievances put forward by unsuccessful tenderers participating in the public procurement process. Many of the claims are focused upon the lack of equality and transparency in the bidding process and a number of cases have dealt with the problems associated with selection and award criteria. This paper examines specific aspects of the selection process which have been a cause for concern including the time limits for notification of infringement of the PCR, the discretion exercised by Contracting Authorities (CAs) in this process and the impact of Uniplex and other cases upon these issues...|$|E
40|$|Imagine that Executive Order (E. O.) 13, 422 {{had been}} issued by President Al Gore, {{accompanied}} by the following press release: Regulation by executive branch and independent agencies {{of the federal government}} has become a defining feature of the American administrative state. Over the past four decades, the decisions of the federal courts interpreting the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the analytic and oversight requirements implemented by my predecessors, Presidents Reagan and Clinton, have made regulatory policy more transparent, participatory and rationalqualities that almost all would agree are the hallmarks of good governance in a democratic society. These achievements are to some degree jeopardized, however, by the increasing use of agency guidelines as substitutes for formal regulations. These guidelines are technically non-binding, but often operationally controlling for lower level officials and regulated parties. Moreover, this 2 ̆ 2 soft law 2 ̆ 2 is generally not subject to judicial review, the participatory and transparency requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, or the analytic requirements of existing executive orders and congressional statutes. Under the changed circumstances of extensive substitution of guidance documents for agency rules, E. O. 13, 422, along with a Bulletin on Good Guidance Practices issued today by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), seeks to maintain the gains in good governance that have emerged over the last forty years. Henceforth, guidance documents, if economically significant, will be subject to procedures similar to the notice and comment requirements for substantive regulations under the Administrative Procedure Act. Moreover, all significant guidance documents will be submitted to OMB, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and posted on agency websites. These postings will include an explanation of why the guidance was needed and how it carries out the agency 2 ̆ 7 s purposes. Guidance documents and their explanations will be subject to the OMB review and consultation requirements that currently apply to agency regulatory actions.
