50|$|Tunisia's {{climate is}} hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Csa) in the north, where winters are mild with moderate rainfall and summers are hot and dry. Temperatures in July and August can exceed 40 °C (104 °F) when the tropical <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> {{of the desert}} reaches the whole Tunisia. Winters are mild with temperatures rarely exceeding 20 °C (68 °F) (exception is the south-west of the country). The south {{of the country is}} desert. The terrain in the north is mountainous, which, moving south, gives way to a hot, dry central plain. As we go to the south, the climate naturally becomes hotter, drier and sunnier. The southern part has therefore a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with extremely hot summers, warm winters and very low annual rainfall amount. Daytime temperatures consistently turn around 45 °C (113 °F) during summers. However, the warmth of winters is only during daytime because nights can be cold in the desert. A series of salt lakes, known as chottzz or shatts, lie in an east-west line at the northern edge of the Sahara Desert, extending from the Gulf of Gabes into Algeria. The lowest point is Chott el Djerid, at - 17 m, and the highest is Jebel ech Chambi, at 1544 m. Annual average rainfall amount is lower than 500 mm (19.68 in) nearly everywhere in Tunisia. Tunisia is therefore a dry, semi-arid country. Areas with a pre-Saharan climate receive below 250 mm (9.84 in) and areas with a typical Saharan climate receive below 100 mm (3.94 in) of annual average precipitation.

In this study, we analyzed a 14 -year (1995 - 2008) measurement of three toxic elements (As, Cd and Cr) in PM 10 in Hong Kong, China. The pollution of these toxic {{elements in}} Hong Kong was not serious. The trend analysis showed that As and Cr in PM 10 increased at a statistically significant level (p≪ 0. 05) during the 14 -year period, while the Cd in PM 10 did not change significantly. Typical seasonal variations were observed for all three toxic elements, largely {{in relation to the}} Asian monsoon. Hourly 10 -day backward trajectories were computed and categorised into four groups. The <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> showed much higher concentrations of the three toxic elements than the marine <b>air</b> <b>masses.</b> The abundances of As and Cd in the PM 10 were much higher in the <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> than those in the marine <b>air</b> <b>masses,</b> while the abundances of Cr showed an opposite pattern.

They have higher values in other seasons and in the <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> that have passed over mainland Asia and the East Asian coast. CO shows the maximum monthly median of 457 – 552 ppbv in winter while ozone shows a maximum of 40 – 50 ppbv in autumn and a distinct peak of 41 – 43 ppbv in spring. The CO concentrations especially in the <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> (median of 277 to 428 ppbv) are very high when compared with measurements {{in most parts of the}} world. This suggests that the south China region is under the strong influence of pollutant transport from the Asian continent and East Asian coast.

In regions remote from urban emissions, agreement is typically quite good. In contrast, joint field measurements of nucleation precursors such as gas phase H 2 SO 4 and ultrafine particles suggest that classical bimolecular nucleation theory may not properly describe the tropospheric nucleation process. An alternative mechanism, possibly involving ammonia as a stabilizing agent for H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O molecular clusters is discussed. Finally, ultrafine particle measurements are shown to offer new opportunities for studying particle growth rates.

40|$|The first {{simultaneous}} {{measurements of}} ammonia and nitric acid in the troposphere {{have been made}} from an aircraft using a tungsten oxide denuder system. Vertical profiles of NH 3 and HNO 3 taken over coastal Virginia and Maryland in March and September, 1983, at altitudes from 150 m to 3000 m, show mixing ratios that decrease with altitude. Ammonia profiles show substantial seasonal variation, while nitric acid profiles do not. Using the measured profiles and a one-dimensional photochemical model, lifetimes due to heterogeneous loss of one day for HNO 3 and ten days for NH 3 are calculated. In contrast, NH 3 profiles up to 5300 m over the North Atlantic Ocean during August 1982 show mixing ratios that increase slightly with altitude. These data represent the first ammonia profiles measured over the ocean.

Oxygen- and hydrogen-isotope ratios of waters from the Abisko area {{suggest that in}} this region the evaporative flux is small and the isotopic composition of most lakes reflects that of the local precipitation. The hydrological setting {{of the region and}} sensitivity analysis of isotopic response to changing climatic parameters such as humidity, inflow and evaporation show that the downcore diatom d 18 Osi record is primarily controlled by changes in the summer isotopic composition of the lake water. The overall 3. 5 ‰ depletion in d 18 Osi since the early Holocene is interpreted as an increase in the influence of the Arctic polar <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> that carries depleted precipitation.

30|$|The {{rainy season}} in Yunnan usually starts from the mid-May and lasts {{until the end}} of October, and the dry season starts in early November and lasts until around 20 May. At the {{beginning}} of the dry season, although the precipitation declines substantially, there is sufficient water in plants and soil because of the accumulation of water during the rainy season and the low evaporation rate that results from low temperatures. Therefore there were few wildfire ignitions in November because the forest was reasonably humid. As the dry season continues, the plants and soil continue to lose water, and the forest dries out until wildfires break out in December and increase in number in January. By the following spring, most of Yunnan is under a dry and warm tropical <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> The steady air mass leads to warmer temperatures, more sunny days, and greater evaporation, which results in continuously accelerating water loss. The wildfire ignition risk increased significantly in February and peaked in March. After April, the rainfall intensity and frequency increase gradually in Yunnan as the wet season approaches. Hence, the wildfire ignition risk decreased significantly until June, when {{there were only a few}} wildfire ignitions in Yunnan. In July through September (the middle of the wet season), no wildfire ignitions were observed in Yunnan Province.|$|E

A thunderstorm system is defined to include all individual thunderstorms within the country associated with the same surface synoptic factor, e. g. a front proceeding across the country. The factors are the cold front, warm front, occluded front and stationary front (with thunderstorm development nearly along the frontal line); and warm air mass, cold or polar air mass, and the pre-cold-frontal squall line. In addition, a distinction is made between air masses from the western sector, directly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, and those from the eastern sector, having a more continental nature. Heavy- or moderate-thunderstorm systems occur mostly in the warm air mass and the cold front, and are also relatively frequent in the stationary front and the pre-cold-frontal squall line.

While <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to seasonal cycles in solar radiation (more in summer, less in winter), major factors affecting temperatures in Oregon include the moderating {{influence of the}} Pacific Ocean combined with variations in surface elevation, especially the Cascade Range. In general, temperatures on Earth drop by about 4 °F (2 °C) per each 1000 ft increase in elevation. Throughout the year, high elevations across the state tend to be cooler than low elevations. In addition, the Cascades, running north-south from border to border, generally retain relatively warm Pacific <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> {{on the western side}} of the state and relatively cool <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> on the eastern side. This prevailing pattern breaks down occasionally when dense cold air flows down the Columbia Gorge into the Willamette Valley and lowers temperatures more than usual from Portland to Eugene.|$|R
