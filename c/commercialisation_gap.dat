Our knowledge-based society is pressing universities to transform from monastic scholarly enclaves into producers of new technologies and incubators of start-up firms. However, converting scientists’ curiosity-driven discoveries into commercially viable innovations has proven so difficult that observers liken the journey to crossing a ‘Valley of Death’. We conceptualise the challenges of commercialising university inventions in terms of three gaps: the technology discovery gap, the <b>commercialisation</b> <b>gap,</b> and the venture launch gap. We chronicle the inception and evolution of a technology commercialisation programme at the University of Oregon, relating how the university confronted and dealt with the three gaps, and describing the intra-organisational partnerships developed to address them. We find that negotiating the gaps requires assimilation of a technology commercialisation mission into the traditional academic missions of education and scientific discovery. To do this, universities must confront fundamental contradictions between learning, discovery, and commercialisation.

40|$|This {{management}} {{project is}} divided into two parts that explore the social structures surrounding academic entrepreneurs and technology entrepreneurs in the East Midlands region of the United Kingdom. The first part researches the nature of the social structures surrounding the two entrepreneurial groups and the second part produces a business plan to exploit opportunities present within these social structures. Part A: Structural Holes Research The aim of the research was to use social capital theory as a framework to analyse the social structures surrounding academic entrepreneurs and technology entrepreneurs during early stage commercial activity, in order to provide an overall view {{of the nature of the}} social structures and identify the issues present within each inhibiting economic development. To achieve this information from the available published literature was compared to the findings from a series of interviews held with entrepreneurs and other members of the social structure. The outcome of the research was the production of two models of the social structures surrounding each type of entrepreneur as well as the identification of a number of issues that effect early stage commercial activity within the East Midlands region. The three most significant issues resulted as a pre-seed funding gap that inhibits the level of technology entrepreneurship, a research <b>commercialisation</b> <b>gap</b> that reduces the level of academic entrepreneurial activity, and an early stage management support availability gap that hinders access to early stage expertise, knowledge, and advice. Part B: Online Bridging Business Plan The aim of the business plan was to use the research in part A to develop a proposal for a specialist online network that utilises a combination of tools to overcome issues within the social structures to increase member interaction across the network. The business plan provided is a complete and rigorous document that includes a description of the business and the proposed service offering, an analysis of the market environment, detail of the business strategy and objectives, a proposition for investment, identification of key risks, and a complete set of financials for five years...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} {{of global climate change}} and the need to {{urgently}} transition from fossil fuels to a low carbon economy, bioenergy derived from plant biomass has the potential to provide a diverse range of renewable and sustainable solid and liquid fuels. Second generation (2 G) lignocellulosics are dedicated bioenergy crops; ideally cultivated on marginal lands with minimal agricultural inputs or competition with food production. The model tree poplar is a fast growing, genetically diverse and widespread hardwood and has great potential for commercial development as a feedstock for cellulosic biorefineries. At this time however, lignocellulosics such as poplar have not received the same research and breeding effort as many food crops. Chapter 2 of this work demonstrates that a substantial yield gap exists for 2 G bioenergy crops, which will hamper <b>commercialisation.</b> This yield <b>gap</b> may be closed through sustainable intensification and advanced, molecular breeding techniques offer the potential to increase the efficiency and timeliness of this improvement process. These advanced breeding techniques require an understanding of the genetic basis of traits of interest. To this end Chapters 3 and 4 are centred on a natural, wide population of Populus nigra Linnaeus (black poplar) genotypes, drawn from across the western European range of this species. This highly diverse population has been cultivated under short rotation coppice (SRC) in two field trials in the UK and Italy and phenotyped for important bioenergy traits related to biomass yield, wood quality, leaf development and drought tolerance. The population has also been genotyped; firstly using an Illumina 12 K BeadChip array and secondly with targeted, sequence capture genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of the annotated gene space. These single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been employed to analyse the population genetic structure of European P. nigra and in genome wide association genetics; identifying trait-marker associations and candidate genes for quantified phenotypes. These data will be valuable for the molecular breeding and commercialisation of bioenergy poplar...|$|R
