5|$|Mari Kiviniemi {{was elected}} {{the new leader}} of the <b>Centre</b> <b>Party</b> in its conference in Lahti on 12 June. The support for the <b>Centre</b> <b>Party</b> has been {{significantly}} higher in northern Finland than elsewhere: in the 2007 election the party received over 43% of the votes in both Oulu and Lapland electoral districts, compared with its nationwide support of 23.1%, while in 2003 the party's vote share in the two northernmost districts was even higher) As the top spots of the party leadership went to members from southern Finland, many of their supporters {{in the northern part}} of the country felt disenchanted; one local party chief even warned that many northern <b>Centre</b> <b>Party</b> supporters might switch sides to the True Finns.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Centre</b> <b>Party</b> {{has been}} the {{traditional}} party of rural voters, but according to polls, it had been losing support to the True Finns in its traditional stronghold regions.

The <b>Centre</b> <b>Party</b> has held the portfolio {{of the prime minister}} since 2003. According to opinion polls, Kiviniemi's personal support was higher than that of the party. She had also been campaigning as a staunch defender of Finland's participation in guarantees to the crisis-ridden EU countries.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, while {{a member}} of the <b>Centre</b> <b>Party,</b> Sven-Olle Olsson, a former farmer, was elected as Sjöbo's Municipal commissioner.The <b>Centre</b> <b>Party</b> in Sjöbo, led by Olsson, motioned before Sjöbo's {{municipal}} assembly in June 1987 for a referendum on the acceptance of foreign refugees in the municipality. The motion came after a proposal that fifteen refugees be accepted into the municipality, an idea Olsson disliked. It has been speculated that the reason behind the motion was not these fifteen refugees, a small number for the municipality, but, instead, Olsson's idea to create a protest against Sweden's positive stance on refugees. Despite heavy protests from most of the country, Sjöbo's municipal assembly decided in October 1987 to go through with the referendum in 1988. If the referendum passed, it would completely ban Sjöbo from accepting foreign refugees.|$|E

The {{position of the}} <b>Centre</b> <b>Party,</b> the third largest party in the Reichstag, was decisive. After Hitler verbally promised party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the <b>Centre</b> <b>Party</b> would support the Enabling Act.
