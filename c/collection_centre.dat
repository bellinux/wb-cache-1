25|$|Malacca had few {{domestic}} products {{with which to}} trade. It produced small amounts of tin and gold as well as dried fish, yet even the salt for preserving the fish had to be sourced from elsewhere in the region. Basic goods, including vegetables, cattle and fish, were supplied by Malacca's trading partners. Rice, mainly for local consumption, was imported. Much of the mercantile activity in Malacca, therefore, relied on the flow of goods {{from other parts of}} the region. Among Malacca's most crucial functions was its role as both a <b>collection</b> <b>centre</b> for cloves, nutmeg and mace from the Spice Islands and a redistribution centre for cotton textiles from ports in Gujarat, the Coromandel Coast, Malabar Coast and Bengal. Other goods traded in Malacca included porcelain, silk and iron from China and natural products of the Malay archipelago, such as camphor, sandalwood, spices, fish, fish roe and seaweed. From the coastal regions on both sides of Malacca Straits came forest products; rattan, resin, roots and wax, and some gold and tin. These goods were then shipped to ports west of Malacca especially Gujarat.|$|E
25|$|For many years, the tolls on the {{navigation}} were leased, {{and the value}} of the lease steadily increased, from £402 in the 1780s to £950 in 1828, and had reached £1,857 per year for the period from 1843 to 1845. For the following three years it was £3,020, but it then declined, as railways arrived in the area. Brigg railway station opened on 1 November 1848, and the line from there to Gainsborough Central followed on 2 April 1849. Tolls reduced, falling to £949 in 1850, and to £700 by the late 1850s. After thirty years, trade revived a little, with the tolls reaching £1,000 in the 1890s. It was further boosted by the development of the sugar beet industry in the 1930s, with tolls averaging £1,294 in the late 1930s. Bishopbridge, where there was a basin, two corn mills and warehousing, acted as a distribution and <b>collection</b> <b>centre</b> for the farms and villages of that part of Lincolnshire, but by the 1970s commercial traffic had ceased except between Ferriby and Brigg, where there were factories along the river bank. All commercial traffic had ceased by the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The first archival {{institution}} in north-western Bosnia was established on 20April 1953 as the Banja Luka City Archives. Previously, old documentary and archival materials were housed in museums and libraries. The Archives {{was founded by}} the People's Committee of Banja Luka; units of local government in Socialist Yugoslavia were then called people's committees. It was situated {{in the basement of}} the committee's headquarters (today used by the Banja Luka City Administration); it had two employees. Its jurisdiction was officially expanded on 30May 1956, when it became the Banja Luka District Archives, responsible also for the Prijedor District. In 1958, a room at the local community office in Nova Topola was enabled to store archival materials collected in the Gradiška District. In 1963, the district assemblies of Banja Luka and Bihać decided to establish the Archives of Bosanska Krajina, the jurisdiction of which included 23 municipalities of the region of Bosanska Krajina; its headquarters remained in Banja Luka. It was the largest regional archives in Yugoslavia's federal unit of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Soon after its establishment, the holdings of the Archives of Bosanska Krajina consisted of around 250 fonds and 9 collections from the Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, World War II, and post-war periods. Beside the archival <b>collection</b> <b>centre</b> in Nova Topla, such centres were also formed between 1963 and 1964 in Prijedor, Jajce, and Bihać. The Archives' storage facilities in Banja Luka were adversely affected by the destructive earthquake that struck the city on 27 October 1969. In 1973, the Archives was moved to the repaired Carska kuća building, where it is today. The archival collection centres in Bihać, Prijedor, and Jajce were abolished between 1981 and 1983.|$|E

500|$|Göring was {{appointed}} Reich Master of the Hunt in 1933 and Master of the German Forests in 1934. He instituted reforms to the forestry laws and acted to protect endangered species. Around {{this time he}} became interested in Schorfheide Forest, where he set aside [...] as a state park, which is still extant. There he built an elaborate hunting lodge, Carinhall, in memory of his first wife, Carin. By 1934, her body had been transported to the site {{and placed in a}} vault on the estate. The main lodge had a large art gallery where Göring displayed works that had been plundered from private collections and museums around Europe from 1939 onward. Göring worked closely with the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce), an organisation tasked with the looting of artwork and cultural material from Jewish collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. Headed by Alfred Rosenberg, the task force set up a <b>collection</b> <b>centre</b> and headquarters in Paris. Some 26,000 railroad cars full of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France alone. Göring repeatedly visited the Paris headquarters to review the incoming stolen goods and to select items to be sent on a special train to Carinhall and his other homes. The estimated value of his collection—numbering some 1,500 pieces—was $200 million.|$|E

2500|$|Stein {{appears to}} have its origins in the 9th century AD. From the 11th century Stein {{developed}} as a Customs <b>Collection</b> <b>centre</b> on the Danube under the Babenbergs. In 1305 it was granted a joint charter with Krems – which is immediately to the E – and in 1463 a bridge across the Danube was built joining it with Mautern. Stein is a long settlement stretching from the river Alaun on the E to the Danube bridge on the W. Merian’s print of 1679 shows an almost rectangular walled settlement, but with a circular extension to the N {{to take in the}} Frauenburg, which was the area of the original settlement. Merian shows numerous round towers set into the wall and fragments of two of these may survive {{in the area of the}} Rathaus Platz. [...] The walls had been extended when the Danube bridge was built and Merian shows two gate-towers on the road leading out to the Wachau in the W-one of the gates, the Wachau Tor survives. There was a bridgehead tower, the Mauterner Tor, set in the wall extension, which was demolished in the 19th century. Stretches of wall remain on the N and west and there are a number of square towers, A further gate-tower, the Kremser Tor survives in the E.|$|E

30|$|Most of the marketed milk was bulked at the group-owned {{secondary}} <b>collection</b> <b>centres</b> run by Anolei women’s {{group and}} Tawakal group. The Anolei women group handled up to 2500  l per day while Tawakal handled 500  l per day. On arrival at these <b>collection</b> <b>centres,</b> the milk was tested for alcohol stability and bulked in a chill tank at 4  °C. Milk that failed {{the test was}} not bulked but cooled in its container in a separate cooler. The milk would then be sold as suusa, kulel or orawa-kandi (types of fermented milk, suusa being sweet-sour, orawa-kandi being bitter-sour and kulel tastes between suusa and orawa-kandi). The milk bulked in the chill tank would be emptied again in plastic receptacles the following day at 5 : 00 am and loaded on buses for transport at ambient temperature to Nairobi, a journey of about seven hours. In Nairobi’s Eastleigh estate, milk traders receive the milk for sale to home consumers, hotels and restaurants within Nairobi. Occasionally, some milk is transported to other towns such as Nakuru. Secondary milk <b>collection</b> <b>centres</b> run by individuals handle between 20 and 100  l per day. Other local operators cool the milk and sell it to traders within Isiolo, hotels, restaurants and home consumers.|$|R
