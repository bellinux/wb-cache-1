An important newfeature of the structure is that in both step 2 and step 3 there is a continuum of alternatives.

Critical pathologies identified include process friction, inadequate information technology, contract complexity, personnel skill level, contract financial issues, management concern, perceptions, timeliness, problematic steps, existing backlogs, inadequate manpower, and poor quality records/documentation. Recommendations included taking the appropriate steps to make contract closeout a command priority throughout the Department of the Navy, developing specialized contract closeout training, taking an immediate look at the four most problematic steps of the contract closeout process and implement immediate measures to alleviate the problems that have historically plagued them, and centralizing the contract closeout function in as many commands as practical.

The argument that the annuitization should be mandated to prevent adverse selection is rejected on the basis of Chilean evidence.
