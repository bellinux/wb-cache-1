40|$|Purpose – The video-sharing website YouTube {{encourages}} {{interaction between}} its users via {{the provision of}} a user <b>comments</b> <b>facility.</b> This was originally envisaged {{as a way for}} viewers to provide information about and reactions to videos, but is employed for other communicative purposes including sharing ideas, paying tributes, social networking, and question answering. This study seeks to examine and categorise the types of comments created by YouTube users to highlight the various ways in which this interactive feature has been employed as a means of communication and self-expression. Design/methodology/approach – By conducting a content analysis of 66, 637 user comments on YouTube videos the authors created a classification schema which may be used to categorise the types of comments users leave. Findings – The schema reveals ten broad categories, and 58 subcategories which reflect the wide-ranging use of the YouTube <b>comments</b> <b>facility.</b> Research limitations/implications – As YouTube continues to evolve, new types of comments that do not appear in the scheme outlined will appear. However, this schema will provide an initial structure upon which other investigations can build when analysing the ongoing use of the YouTube comments feature as a communication device. Practical implications – This scheme may be used for researchers in a variety of disciplines who are interested in using user-generated content. The scheme will aid in the description and mining of this content and provides a way of structuring this content into categories representing user intent. Social implications – This study highlights the variety of purposes to which the user <b>commenting</b> <b>facility</b> of YouTube is employed. These include purposes such as reminiscence, grieving, giving advice and communication. Originality/value – This is the first detailed, content-based analysis of the types of comments created by YouTube users. The classification scheme facilitates the analysis of these comments for a variety of purposes, including marketing, communication studies and studies of information seeking...|$|R

In doing so, they allow the linear thinker to experience challenge in reading, for which equivalencies can be sought in {{the challenges of}} social pragmatics for autistics. Within this experience of challenge the authors suggest the possibility of new empathic encounters with autistic and neurodiverse minds for a neurotypical readership.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design, development, and evaluation of information visualization tools for supporting exploratory browsing. Information retrieval (IR) systems currently do not support browsing well. Responding to user queries, IR systems typically compute relevance scores of documents and then present the document surrogates to users in order of relevance. Other systems such as email clients and discussion forums simply arrange messages in reverse chronological order. Using these systems, people cannot gain an overview of a collection easily, nor do they receive adequate support for finding potentially useful items in the collection. This thesis explores the feasibility of using social interaction history to improve exploratory browsing. Social interaction history refers to traces of interaction among users in an information space, such as discussions that happen in the blogosphere or online newspapers through the <b>commenting</b> <b>facility.</b> The basic hypothesis of this work is that social interaction history can serve as a good indicator of the potential value of information items. Therefore, visualization of social interaction history would offer navigational cues for finding potentially valuable information items in a collection. To test this basic hypothesis, I conducted three studies. First, I ran statistical analysis of a social media data set. The results showed that there were positive relationships between traces of social interaction and the degree of interestingness of web articles. Second, I conducted a feasibility study to collect initial feedback about the potential of social interaction history to support information exploration. Comments from the participants were in line with the research hypothesis. Finally, I conducted a summative evaluation to measure how well visualization of social interaction history can improve exploratory browsing. The results showed that visualization of social interaction history was able to help users find interesting articles, to reduce wasted effort, and to increase user satisfaction with the visualization tool...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{introduction}} of unrestricted visiting hours {{has led to}} the encouragement of parents to stay with and participate in the care of their hospitalised child. In order to stay with the hospitalised child, parents have to be away from home or work, which in turn impacts on their personal and family life. However, no published study on parents’ experiences of childcare participation during paediatric hospitalisation has been found for a Chinese population. Objectives This study explored Chinese parents’ experiences of their participation in taking care of their hospitalised child. Design A qualitative exploratory design was adopted to capture parents’ experiences of participation. Settings The study was conducted in four paediatric wards of a regional acute general hospital in the New Territories, a major geographical region of Hong Kong. Participants Nineteen parents (16 mothers and three fathers) who had a child hospitalised for more than 48 h and identified themselves as staying comparatively longer with the child than their counterpart were recruited. Methods Data were collection by tape-recorded semi-structured interview. Results Four major categories that illustrated parents’ experiences of participation in childcare were identified: reasons for staying with the child, rescheduling of family's routine, expectations of nurses, and <b>comments</b> on <b>facility</b> provisions. The findings highlight parents’ desire for participation in caring for their hospitalised child, their unexpressed needs for communication and concern about the non-monetary costs of participation. Conclusions Most parents viewed accompanying their hospitalised child as an unconditional aspect of being a parent and had a strong desire for participation. Parents’ need for communication and emotional support during their participation of childcare in paediatric unit are universal. As Chinese parents are passive in seeking help, nurses should take the initiative in assessing their needs and offering them support accordingly...|$|R

This essay places {{the theme of the}} Bank of England's industrial intervention within the broader discussions about Treasury history and Britain's post-war reconstruction, and refines the argument that the original involvement of the Bank of England with industry merely represented an extension of its pre-war operations of branch banking and its duties as a central bank.

40|$|This study {{critically}} {{examines the}} role of visitor use information in park management planning. Few park planning documents utilise visitor use information. This is thought to result from two problems.

These have resulted in data which are unreliable and at times have no direct implication for management planning. The second problem arises {{from the lack of}} understanding of the role visitor use information may play in the planning process.
