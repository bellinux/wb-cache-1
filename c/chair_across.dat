25|$|The disaffected Benga {{attempted}} to find relief by exploiting his employers' presentation {{of him as}} a 'savage'. He tried to slip past the guards as a large crowd was leaving the premises; when asked on one occasion to seat a wealthy donor's wife, he pretended to misunderstand, instead hurling the <b>chair</b> <b>across</b> the room, just missing the woman's head. Meanwhile, Verner was struggling financially and had made little progress in his negotiations with the museum. He soon found another home for Benga.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} in the county jailhouse. Angelo is now Prisoner 22177. He suffers in captivity, his hands manacled {{together}} with leather cuffs linked by a thong. Rita comes to see him, and they rekindle their affection for each other. Rita tells Angelo what she saw: that it was Luca who murdered Dino (while maintaining her sister Lana's innocence, as she did not witness Lana striking Dino), and that he had been framed. Angelo is furious and flings a <b>chair</b> <b>across</b> the visiting room. As Rita leaves, other prisoners make catcalls at her. The warden, Dexter, leads Angelo away from the visiting room. However, instead of returning Angelo to his cell, he strips off Angelo's shirt. It is obvious that he intends to rape Angelo. The look on Angelo's face suggests {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened. However, on this occasion, Angelo overcomes Dexter and slams his head into a wall, knocking him out cold. Angelo drags him into an empty cell, and takes his handgun. Snatching the warden's uniform shirt and cap from a hook on the wall, he escapes from the jail.|$|E
2500|$|Knight was one {{of college}} basketball's most {{successful}} and innovative coaches, having perfected and popularized the motion offense. He has also been praised for running clean programs (none of his teams was ever sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations) and graduating most of his players. However, Knight has also attracted controversy; he famously threw a <b>chair</b> <b>across</b> the court during a game, was once arrested for assault, and regularly displayed a combative nature during encounters {{with members of the}} press. Knight remains [...] "the object of near fanatical devotion" [...] from many of his former players and Indiana fans.|$|E

50|$|On 3 May, {{in a bid}} {{to address}} its {{problems}} and dispel media rumours about the well-being of its national chairperson, the IFP announced that KaMagwaza-Msibi would host several post-election rallies in addition to the many public meetings she is already <b>chairing</b> <b>across</b> Natal to thank all those who voted IFP. As of 3 May, her itinerary had covered Zululand, Amajuba and eThekwini.|$|R
60|$|On New Year's day, after dinner, he {{fell asleep}} in a big <b>chair,</b> <b>across</b> the hall from the drawing-room. And when he awoke the drawing-room was full of people making New Year's calls. If there was {{anything}} Blair hated it was to thump on his crutch past curious, cold-eyed persons. So he remained where he was, hoping not to be seen. But unfortunately for him, he had exceedingly keen ears and exceedingly sensitive feelings.|$|E

[...] "I made a decent living teaching, I was free to come and go, my money was my own. Now I'm fled right down to a churn or a dishpan, I never have a cent of my own. He's growlin' round half the time, and there's no chance of his ever being different." ...|$|E
60|$|If any one had {{dared to}} follow that <b>chair</b> <b>across</b> the wide passage and into the wainscoted parlour, {{he would have been}} startled by the sight of a fire blazing in the grate, whence, ere the {{servants}} retired, even the very embers had been removed, and in the chair, the marvellous movement of which had so frightened all the inmates of the hall, he would have seen a beautiful woman seated, with an infant at her breast.|$|E

5000|$|Knight {{has donated}} tens of {{millions}} of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed <b>chairs</b> <b>across</b> the campus. In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex. This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.|$|R

60|$|The {{next moment}} St. Genis had walked rapidly {{out of the}} room. Bobby left off writing, threw down his pen, and resting his elbow upon the table and {{his head in his}} hand, he {{remained}} silent and motionless while St. Genis' quick and firm footsteps echoed first along the corridor, then down the creaking stairs and finally on the floor below. After which there came the sound of the opening and shutting of a door, the dragging of a <b>chair</b> <b>across</b> a wooden floor, and nothing more.|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] said he,--and as {{he spoke}} he drew his <b>chair</b> <b>across</b> the rug, so as to bring it very near to that on which Mrs. Prime was sitting--"our destinies in this world, yours and mine, are in many things alike. We are both alone. We both of us have our hands full of work, and of work which in many respects is the same. We are devoted to the same cause: is it not so?" [...] Mrs. Prime, who {{had been told that}} she was to listen and not to speak, did not at first make any answer. But she was pressed by a {{repetition}} of the question. [...] "Is it not so, Mrs. Prime?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the {{solitude}} which so ruthless a judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken no breakfast. And, {{with a strange}} pang, I now reflected that, long as I had been shut up here, no message {{had been sent to}} ask how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me. [...] "Friends always forget those whom fortune forsakes," [...] I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon recover myself. I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me. I looked up--I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a <b>chair</b> <b>across</b> my chamber threshold.|$|E
5|$|The jailer said that, after {{struggling}} for two hours, he escaped {{and raised the}} alarm at Moon's restaurant {{across the road from}} the jail. Sheriff Dunnegan sent out a search party to no avail. According to the Ledger, a fence post suspended on two <b>chairs</b> <b>across</b> a window was found in the jury room just after the lynching, near the cell where Laura had been held. It was thought that the men had intended to hang Laura out of the window, but were deterred by an electric light burning nearby.|$|R
50|$|Determined to {{do right}} by Carrie, Sue asks Tommy for help with a plan she's devised. Similarly, Chris, blaming Carrie for her humiliation, {{interrupts}} a make-out session with Billy to get his help in her plot for revenge ("Do Me A Favor"). Alone in the library, Carrie reads about telekinesis from a book. Concentrating intensely, she succeeds in moving <b>chairs</b> <b>across</b> the room without touching them, startling herself with this newfound power. In retrospect, the exploding light bulb in the shower and Billy's tumble from his skateboard start to make sense.|$|R
50|$|As a child, Tom {{began to}} echo the sounds around him, repeating {{accurately}} the crow of a rooster or {{the singing of}} a bird. If he was left alone in the cabin, Tom was known to begin beating on pots and pans or dragging <b>chairs</b> <b>across</b> the floor {{in an attempt to}} make any kind of noise. By the age of four, Tom was able to repeat conversations up to ten minutes in length but was barely able to adequately communicate his own needs, resorting to grunts and gestures.|$|R
60|$|It is {{a common}} thing to call such men wrecks; if the {{comparison}} be used here it is the specific one of a derelict come to grief through fire. Even yet some flickering combustion illuminated the drifting hulk. His face and hands had been recently washed--a rite insisted upon by Phillips as a memorial to the slaughtered conventions. In the candle-light he stood, a flaw in the decorous fittings of the apartment. His face was a sickly white, covered almost to the eyes with a stubble {{the shade of a}} red Irish setter's coat. Phillips's comb had failed to control the pale brown hair, long matted and conformed to the contour of a constantly worn hat. His eyes were full of a hopeless, tricky defiance like that seen in a cur's that is cornered by his tormentors. His shabby coat was buttoned high, but a quarter inch of redeeming collar showed above it. His manner was singularly free from embarrassment when Chalmers rose from his <b>chair</b> <b>across</b> the round dining table.|$|E
6000|$|It {{certainly}} was hard upon Lady Tringle. She frowned {{and was going}} to walk on without any acknowledgment, when Lucy timidly went through a form of introduction. [...] "Aunt Emmeline, this is Mr. Hamel. Uncle Tom met him somewhere in the grounds and has asked him to come to luncheon." [...] Then Lady Tringle curtseyed and made a bow. The curtsey and the bow together were sufficient to have crushed the heart of any young man who had not been comforted and exalted by such words as Isadore had heard from Lucy's lips not five minutes since. [...] "And love you," [...] she had said. After that Lady Tringle might curtsey and bow as she would, and he could still live uncrushed. After the curtsey and the bow Lady Tringle passed on. Lucy fell into the rank behind Gertrude; and then Hamel afterwards took his place behind the Honourable Septimus. [...] "If you will sit there, Mr. Hamel," [...] said Lady Tringle, pointing to a <b>chair,</b> <b>across</b> the table, obliquely, at the greatest possible distance from that occupied by Lucy. There he was stationed between Mr. Traffick and Sir Thomas. But now, in his present frame of mind, his position at the table made very little difference to him.|$|E
