5|$|Although {{originally}} anti-Zionist, Stern's views <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s, and by 1942 he {{was strongly}} supported Jewish nationalism. When an Oakland {{branch of the}} anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism formed in 1944, Stern opposed its creation, even though many members, including its president, were leading members of Temple Sinai. By 1948, however, the congregation had also become supportive of Zionism.|$|E

With Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and (in the latter 2 games) Cream, she frees animals from inside Eggman's robots {{to keep him}} from building an empire. Although in Sonic Advance Amy's attacking power was restricted by her inability to spin while jumping (unlike those of the other characters), this was <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter two games.|$|E

5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Stapleton Road passed to Regional Railways. All trains along the Severn Beach Line ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This was <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1990s, with a more frequent service to Avonmouth but very few on to Severn Beach and no Sunday services. Services at Stapleton Road were boosted due to the proximity of Eastville Stadium, but this use ended in 1986 when Bristol Rovers F.C. moved to Twerton Park in Bath.|$|E
5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final version to the Newborn being sucked through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{mechanism}} is proposed whereby a proton gradient along a membrane-spanning α-helix is coupled to small <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> torsional angles around the α-helix peptide bonds. Small concerted <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> torsional angles are coupled to a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unit twist of <b>the</b> α-helix; a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unit twist is coupled to a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crossing angle between neighbouring α-helices; and a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crossing angle is coupled to a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{size and shape}} of an assembly of α-helices. Following this logical linkage in one direction shows how a proton gradient could induce a pumping motion in an assembly of α-helices; following it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other direction shows how motion in an assembly of α-helices could pump protons...|$|R

5|$|Jarrow, {{situated}} on the River Tyne in County Durham, northern England, entered British history in the 8th century, {{as the home of}} Bede, the early Christian monk and scholar. After Bede, little <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remote rural community for a thousand years, although his monastery was dissolved under Henry VIII in the 16th century. The discovery of coal in the 17th century led to major changes. Mining on an industrial scale began in the early 1800s, resulting in the population of Jarrow more than doubling between 1801 and 1821 to around 3,500, largely from the influx of mineworkers.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{fortunes}} <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new year. He {{dispatched a}} two-seater on 26 January {{and another on}} 2 February 1917. On 5 February he attacked a Albatros C.III returning from a photo-reconnaissance mission. Diving {{out of the sun}} to blind the gunner, he shot it down over the frontline where it was shelled by British artillery. Ten days later he engaged an Albatros escorted by a LFG Roland C.II. After a brief dogfight and pursuit, the Albatros escaped but he destroyed the Roland which crashed near Monchy. Twenty-four hours later McCudden was awarded the Military Cross for his fifth victory. His award was gazetted on 12 March.|$|E

As neighborhood demographics <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 20th century, and Brooklyn's Jewish population became more Orthodox, the East Midwood Jewish Center absorbed three other Conservative Brooklyn congregations.|$|E

The host wing at Loring was the 42d Bombardment Wing for all but {{a small portion of}} its early existence. Loring was primarily home to active duty units, although this <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, when the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 101st Fighter Squadron sent a detachment to Loring. As the base was the closest in the U.S. to Europe, it also functioned as an important stopover point.|$|E
5|$|The British forces {{occupied}} Flensburg on 5 May 1945; initially, nothing <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{daily routine}} at the Mürwik Naval Academy. Returning drunk {{in the night}} of 13/14 May 1945, Lüth {{failed to respond to}} the sentry's challenge and {{was shot in the head}} by 18-year-old seaman Mathias Gottlob, a German guard. The officer in charge immediately reported the incident, contacting Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz. Dönitz's adjutant, who had accepted the call, initially thought that it was a bad joke. He then called Lüth's brother, Joachim, as the two siblings had been staying together. It was he who informed Lüth's wife and their four children that Lüth had died.|$|E
5|$|The Hardy Boys {{have gone}} through many {{permutations}} over the years.

While Albany experienced a decline in its population due to urban sprawl and suburbanization, many of its historic neighborhoods were saved from destruction through the policies of Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd, the longest-serving mayor of any city in the United States. In the early 21st century, Albany has experienced growth in the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion of}} kingship in Europe {{ultimately}} originates in systems of tribal kingship in prehistoric Europe. The Minoan (c. 3200 – c. 1400 BCE) and Mycenaean civilisation (c. 1600 – c. 1100 BCE) provide the earliest examples of monarchies in protohistoric Greece. Thanks to the decipherment of the Linear B script in 1952, much knowledge has been acquired about {{society in the}} Mycenaean realms, where the kings functioned as leaders of palace economies. The role of kings <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following Greek Dark Ages (c. 1100 – c. 750 BCE) to big gentleman farmers with military power.|$|E
