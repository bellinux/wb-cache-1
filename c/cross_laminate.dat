40|$|In {{the past}} years, timber {{has become a}} {{cutting-edge}} product, {{but it has not}} achieved the limits of its evolution. The belief that timber can be used solely for the construction of holiday houses, garden sheds, and other functional facilities is proving to be obsolete. Nowadays, both public and private timber constructions can compete with the most challenging building structures. What enhanced the development of timber was the invention of <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> timber; a construction element that allows for highly complicated and demanding architectural and constructional building designs. This graduation thesis presents a design of a <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> timber panel construction in a seismic area. First, the thesis highlights the advantages of timber constructions in terms of sustainable development. It goes on to describe <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> wooden panels, which have more uniform and better mechanical properties than one-way laminated timber elements. For the structural design of <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> timber panels, the HOBS (‘Homogenised, Orthotropic plane stress Blass reduced cross Section’) method was used, as proposed by Blass and Fellmoser. The design of the load-bearing construction elements made of <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> timber was based on an architecture student’s blueprints of a student residence halls. The modelling of the construction was conducted by the Sofistik software, which is used for basic limit states and seismic state. The crucial load-bearing elements and connectional joints were designed for the ultimate limit state. Service limit state check was performed by controls for deflection of timber panels and the displacement of flooring during seismic activity. A simplified calculation, adhering to the standard SIST EN 1995 - 1 - 2 and based on a reduced crosssection method, was used to verify the construction's compliance with the fire safety regulations. The thesis ends with a description of preservational methods for timber construction...|$|R

40|$|Densification of {{wood in the}} {{transverse}} direction increases the density. One {{of the reasons for}} densifying wood is to produce high quality timber from timbers of low quality. However, densified wood shows an undesired behaviour, i. e. a tendency to return to its initial dimensions when it is subjected to heat and humidity, i. e. shape memory. There are several methods to overcome the problem of shape memory. This study uses a three-layered cross-laminated wood panel where one of the layers is of densified wood and the other two are of normal wood together these will mechanically restrain the shape memory of the densified layer. The study includes three stages: * Densification of clear wood in the radial direction * Manufacture of a three-layered <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> composite product with densified wood as a service layer * Testing of the shape stability when the composite was subjected to variations relative humidity (40 - 85 % RH at 20 °) The result of this study reveals the significance of service to bottom layer thickness ratio on the shape stability of the <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> composite. Consequently, the performance and the shape stability of the <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> composite were significant when the service to bottom layer thickness ratio increases. Therefore, it appears feasible to disclose the appreciable degree of shape stability, hardness and wear resistance of the product. Accordingly, <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> composite can be considered as one of the promising mechanical methods for improving moisture movement of densified wood product.

40|$|Different angle {{brackets}} for anchoring solid wooden panels were tested {{to learn about}} their response and basic mechanical properties on the acting load in two perpendicular directions. Namely, previous tests showed two distinct cases of panel deformation. In one case the panel mainly rotates around its compressed corner.

The two tests were named »up-lift test« and »slip test«.

The screws are used to secure the shear connection with double-sided nail plates with respect to possible separation forces between the glulam and the CLT. An additional test with a screw glued connection was made for comparison as the upper bound case in terms of composite action. The results show the beams with double-sided nail plates (with or without screws) achieved a very high level of composite action and an overall satisfactory behaviour. Almost full composite action was achieved for the screw-glued composite beam. A detailed design example of the beam element according to the Eurocode 5 and Finnish National Annex is presented.

40|$|Abstract]: <b>Cross</b> <b>Laminated</b> Timber (CLT) is {{made from}} {{dimensional}} lumber, laminated in layers with the grain in each layer placed orthogonal to the layer before it. The resultant product is not dissimilar to thick plywood. CLT {{is made from}} timber, which is an environmentally attractive option {{in comparison to the}} reinforced concrete or steel structures which dominate the multistorey building market sector. Timber is {{one of the very few}} sustainable carbon neutral building materials available. New technology such as advanced Building Information Modeling (BIM) software and high accuracy CNC machinery are giving CLT the advantage over traditional on-site construction methods. Prefabrication is the key to CLT’s improved construction time-frames, far greater quality control, than on-site construction can deliver. There are no CLT manufacturers currently producing in Australia. Hyne and Son Pty Ltd. is a leading Australian manufacturer and distributor of engineered, structural and decorative softwood products to the building industry. This project forms part of an initial investigation into <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> timber wall panels, manufactured from non-structural low grade pine. Initially, the investigations will be directed solely at the low-rise multistorey residential market sector, which Hyne already services with other products. The steps required to firstly select a suitable CLT panel using Finite Element Analysis through to fabrication of a sample CLT panel, experimental design and testing of structural properties, and finally comparing results with accepted formula from the Australian standards for the design of plywood. Considerations such as fire, and deflection under load are also made. Results from initial investigations show that, even though fabricated from low grade structural timber, CLT has enormous axial capacity. Conclusions are drawn as to the application of certain parts of AS 1720 Timber Structures to <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> timber design...|$|R
