40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{synthesise}} iron oxide crystallites with different crystallite sizes supported on y-A 120 3 using the reverse micelle technique. It was hypothesised that changing the crystallite size of the synthesised iron oxide crystallites could lead to the control of the external nanotube diameter. The effect of temperature on the external diameter and productivity was also investigated. It was found through titration and AAS that the iron loading was lower than the expected 15 wt. -%. Furthermore, it was observed that the loading was not consistent through different catalyst samples.

We systematically experiment and analyze the be-havior of GPU global memory in the case of direct device assignment. We find that the GPU global memory is zeroed only in some config-urations.

As a consequence, an adversary can recover data of a previously executed GPGPU applica-tion in a variety of situations.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Microbial Survey of Ajinomoto Althea Environmental Isolates Ajinomoto Althea Gabriel Rodriguez April 2013 Cal State University San Marcos Professional Master???s Degree Program Aseptically {{manufacturing}} {{pharmaceutical grade}} sterile drug products requires that final drug products are sterile {{and free of}} contamination. In order to ensure the facilities in which the drug products are manufactured are clean themselves, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities must have a sound cleaning and monitoring system. This is laid out in detail by the US Pharmacopeia USP and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the code of federal regulations 21 CFR 211. 113 which cover proper current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regarding control of microbial growth and contamination. Monitoring or specifically environmental monitoring not just routinely, but also during aseptic processing can give important information over time showing that a facility has proper <b>cleaning</b> procedures <b>implemented</b> for aseptic processing. Whenever microbial contaminants are found above Althea???s set action limits theses organisms are sent out for identification, trended, and then investigated in an action report. Trending is done to ensure the facility is still under microbial control and that no in process or drug products {{are affected by the}} isolates found. In order to determine the risk an organism poses to a final drug product a microbial survey is first performed to better assess what kind of environmental isolates are expected to be found at Ajinomoto Althea. While the FDA does not specify objectionable organisms for sterile drug products, Althea recognizes that there are specific organisms that should be tested for as outlined in the U. S. Pharmacopeia USP Acceptance Criteria for Non- Sterile Drug Products. The FDA is headed toward a risk based approach in regulating cGMP facilities. Thus a formal risk analysis on microbial contamination may be required in the near future. Before generating a risk analysis a microbial survey of all the known identified microorganisms isolated within Ajinomoto Althea cleanrooms was done showing that Althea???s microbial isolates are ???normal??? human flora and environmental isolates found in cleanrooms.

The {{aim of the}} article is to outline the process of identification and management of transmission of acute hepatitis B in a renal inpatient ward. Methods. The case was identified through routine reporting to public health specialists, and epi-demiological, virological and environmental assessment was undertaken to investigate the source of infection. An audit of HBV vaccination in patients with chronic kidney disease was undertaken. Results. Investigations identified inpatient admission to a renal ward as the only risk factor and confirmed a source patient with clear epidemiological, virological and environmental links to the case. Multiple failures in infection control leading to a contaminated environment and blood glucose testing equipment, failure to isolate a non-compliant, high-risk patient and incomplete vaccination for patients with chronic kidney disease {{may have contributed to}} the transmission. Conclusions. Patient-to-patient transmission {{of hepatitis}} B was shown to have occurred in a renal ward in the UK, due to multiple failures in infection control. A number of policy changes led to im-provements in infection control, including reducing multi-function use of wards, developing policies for non-compliant patients, improving <b>cleaning</b> policies and <b>implementing</b> competency assess-ment for glucometer use and decontamination.

We used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explore {{the intentions}} of North-Western Ethiopian dairy farmers towards implementing non-specified mastitis control measures (nsMCMs) and towards implementing 4 specific MCMs. Face to face interviews were held with 134 dairy farmers to study associations between their intentions and any of three factors (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control) that, according to the TPB, determine intentions. The majority of the farmers (93 %) had a positive intention to implement nsMCMs, whereas a smaller majority of farmers had the intention to implement the specific MCMs to improve udder cleaning (87 %), to improve stall hygiene (78 %), to improve feeding of cows (76 %), and to perform foremilk stripping (74 %). Farmers had a more positive attitude, but lower subjective norm and lower perceived behavioural control towards implementing nsMCMs compared with implementing most specific MCMs, although the subjective norms for stall hygiene and perceived behavioural control for improving feeding of cows were also low. Attitude was positively associated with intentions to implement nsMCMs, to improve cleaning of the udders, to improve stall hygiene and to implement foremilk stripping. Both the intention to improve udder <b>cleaning</b> and to <b>implement</b> foremilk stripping, were positively associated to subjective norms towards these MCMs. Our data can help tailor intervention programs aiming to increase the intention of Ethiopian dairy farmers to implement MCMs and thus to improve udder health in this country.

40|$|Current global water {{scarcity}} and the spectre {{of a future}} critical shortage are driving the need for novel and energy saving water technology approaches. Desalination of seawater and the reuse of treated wastewater effluent, which have historically been viewed as undesirable water sources, are increasingly being explored as sources for reducing water consumption. Although the dominant technologies for taking these water sources to potable quality, energy consumption still makes them unsustainable for widespread application. Membrane distillation (MD) is an innovative water purification method that has shown promise as a technology that can address several of these issues. MD is a membrane process that produces very high quality product water. However, similarly to other thermal desalting processes, MD utilizes heat as the dominant source of energy rather than pressure, and can potentially be used to produce water at higher recoveries (and therefore less waste) than is feasible with existing approaches. Another important advantage of MD is that the water separation occurs at modest temperatures (This work is represents an attempt to provide insight into several of these issues. The overarching approach taken throughout this project is the parallel evaluation of ceramic membranes alongside commonly used polymeric (PTFE) membranes. The combined factors of MD being a relatively nascent technology and the fundamental separation mechanism point toward initial real-world applications of MD {{for the treatment of}} high concentration water that may necessitate membranes exposure to harsher thermal and chemical environments. The robust and inert nature of ceramics make them ideal candidates for such application, although their hydrophilic surface do allow for direct implementation in MD. The first phase of this work details the evaluation of several candidate surface treatments for modifying ceramic membranes and shows that aluminum oxide ceramic membranes can be successfully modified with perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane to possess the necessary hydrophobicity for MD application. The effectiveness of the surface treatment in modifying the membrane surface chemistry was assessed using a multitude of analytical approaches, which showed that the modified ceramic surface attained high hydrophobicity and thus are suitable for application of the membranes in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The next phase of research details the development and verification of a model for DCMD performance. The relative membrane performance was compared, with the polymeric membrane consistently outperforming the modified ceramics, which was attributed to a combination of superior thermal and physical membrane characteristics. Beyond attempting to evaluate the performance differences, this model allows the consideration of various operational scenarios, focusing on membrane flux and energy performance as various membrane and operational parameters change to determine conditions that maximize MD performance as well as provide insight critical to develop MD-specific membranes. Finally, membrane performance was evaluated during the treatment water containing various organic foulants as well for the treatment of municipal wastewater. The results showed that the level of fouling was highly dependent on foulant type, with alginate identified as a component that produces severe fouling under all conditions evaluated, and wastewater fouling being relatively minimal.

In Chapter 1, {{the global}} energy system {{was investigated in}} terms of world primary energy demand evolution and fossil fuels sustained domination. In order to further sustain fossil fuels as the primary energy sources, CO 2 capture and storage technologies (CCS) should be introduced as quick as possible, so as to restrict their impact on green house gas effect and climate change. The main means that will enhance the implementation of CCS technologies were also presented. Such measures include the operation of a CO 2 Emissions Trading Scheme, {{and a set of}} EU initiatives as: the establishment of the Zero Emissions Technology Platform ZEP, the funding of large scale CCS pilot units, the new CO 2 reduction commitments for 2020 and the preparation for these achievements by launching a new regulatory framework with the new climate-energy legislative package. The long term target for a ‘hydrogen and fuel cells economy’ was also presented through the materialized and projected targets of the EU Hydrogen and Fuel cells technology platform. In Chapter 1 the thesis concluded that both CCS and Fuel Cells technologies are important for the sustenance of fossil fuels with restricted CO 2 emissions and also for a feasible technological roadmap towards a hydrogen economy. The main characteristics of the CCS and Fuel Cells technologies were presented in Chapter 2. The chapter mainly focuses on the promising Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) technology and its specific operational characteristics that enable their involvement in CO 2 capture applications. Chapter 3 reviews the available options for proper high temperature cleaning of a syngas produced by coal gasification in order to be utilised in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells. The combination of coal with SOFCs requires an extensive cleaning of the pollutants generated in the gasification phase. Gas <b>cleaning</b> should be <b>implemented</b> in high temperature in order to avoid sensible heat losses that reduce system’s efficiency. The most suited materials for hot gas cleaning were derived through the literature review and through chemical equilibrium calculations, and a general hot gas cleaning scheme was proposed. In Chapter 4, an integrated coal based and carbon free power cycle was designed and optimized. The proposed cycle includes: a) coal hydrogasification in high pressure, b) reforming of the produced methane with simultaneous CO 2 capture in two reactors that operate in different pressure levels, c) extensive gas cleaning, d) efficient power generation in Solid Oxides Fuel Cells and e) appropriate handling of the captured CO 2 in order to be delivered liquefied at high pressure (100 bar). All system components as well as the overall cycle were simulated in detail in AspenPlusTM. The main technical difficulties were identified through the cycle’s investigation and respective solutions were proposed. For the realization of the required recycling of the hydrogen rich stream from the carbonation/reforming reactor to the hydrogasification reactor, the use of a steam ejector was proposed. In the ejector, high pressure steam induces the gas stream and raises its pressure in suitable levels for a feasible recycling. The required steam pressure was calculated through the detailed steam ejector simulation. The use of high temperature sodium heat pipes was proposed for the high temperature heat transfer from an SOFC fluidised bed post combustor to the calcination fluidised bed. The sodium properties and the heat transfer rate were calculated for the specific fluidised reactors conditions, through detailed modelling of the sodium heat pipes. The effect of solid materials (CaO/CaCO 3) on carbonation/reforming and hydrogasification reactors, as well as the overall cycle was also examined. Critical conclusions on the required CaO quantities and the extend of refreshing the solid materials were derived by optimizing the specific reactor and the overall cycle. An extensive gas cleaning scheme was proposed following up the conclusions of chapter 3. Detailed results for the overall cycle optimized performance were also presented, mainly focused on the cycle’s thermal efficiency and the CO 2 capture efficiency. In Chapter 5, a tri-generation (electricity, hydrogen and heat) natural gas based and carbon free cycle was designed and evaluated with exergetic criteria. Such a cycle is ideal for decentralized applications. The cycle mainly consists of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cells (SOECs), CO 2 and H 2 handling equipment and lots of peripherals (heat exchangers, compressors etc). ...|$|R
