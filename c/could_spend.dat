5|$|Although Vainio {{himself did}} not consume alcohol, he was {{tolerant}} about others' alcohol use and <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> {{time with his}} friends even if they drank, keeping alcohol in his house in case his friends came over. He also began discussing the topic of drinking in his lyrics. Getting rid of his alcohol problem did not solve Vainio's domestic problems; he and Taina ended up divorcing.|$|E
5|$|More than 500 Birmingham {{players have}} {{appeared}} in such matches but failed to reach the 25-match milestone. In the early days, the scarcity of nationally organised competitive football meant players <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> many years with the club while making few such outings. Brothers Fred, Tommy and Arthur James, who was the club captain from 1878 to 1885, were founder members of Small Heath Alliance but made only 24 appearances between them.|$|E

5|$|After {{his playing}} career, McBride retired to Florissant, Missouri, where he briefly owned a liquor store. He was enjoying {{the time he}} <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> with his family, but the New York Mets called him with a {{coaching}} opportunity. In 1985, the organization hired McBride as an outfield and baserunning coach for their minor league system. He stayed with the organization for seven years. In the 1990s, McBride was a minor league hitting coach for the Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama have {{explained that the}} objective in mind when designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> {{most of their time}} focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous title.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in motor traffic in the early 20th century, the capacity of the original tunnel was soon perceived as inadequate. In 1930, John Mills, MP for Dartford, remarked that HGVs delivering from Essex to Kent could not practically use any crossing of the Thames downstream of the tunnel. The LCC obtained an act to construct a new tunnel in 1938, but work did not start due to the outbreak of World War II. Construction eventually started in 1958 with preliminary work on the northern approach road. By this time, traffic had become progressively worse. In 1960, Richard Marsh, MP for Greenwich complained that vehicles <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> 30 to 45 minutes stuck in tunnel traffic.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, they {{returned}} to Black Lodge studios to record their first new material in five years, recording twelve tracks intended to be released as three EPs {{over the course of}} a year. The band's reunion tour took place in Europe, followed by the US between mid-August and early October. On April 13, 2010 the band released the first EP Simple Science on Flyover Records. Despite their reformation, obligations to other projects limited the amount of time the band <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> together. On their 2010 tour, fun. bassist Nate Harold filled in for Rob Pope, who was already committed to touring with Spoon. In 2011 while James Dewees was on a world tour with My Chemical Romance, New Amsterdams regular Dustin Kinsey filled in on keyboards.|$|E
5|$|The couple put {{extra effort}} into {{avoiding}} {{the issues that}} had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green {{tried to focus on}} cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours so that he <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot over {{eighteen}} days in April 2005. It was filmed {{on location in}} Echo Park inside Glatzer and Westmoreland's house and in three houses on their block that their neighbors allowed them to use for little or no money. Many of Glatzer and Westmoreland's Echo Park neighbors also stood in as extras. Due to California's child labor laws, they could only film with the underage cast members for six hours a day, so cinematographer Eric Steelberg used a hand-held camera with few accessories to maximize the time they <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> filming. Steelberg filmed the project in high-definition video format, which was converted to film during post-production. The film's soundtrack included reggaeton songs as well as music composed by Westmoreland's brother as a favor since the filmmakers could afford little else. Robin Katz finished editing the film in August 2005.|$|E

5|$|The two {{versions}} of Ernoul's chronicle tell different stories about John's ascent to the throne of Jerusalem. According to one version, the leading lords of Jerusalem sent envoys to France in 1208 asking Philip II to select a French nobleman as a husband for their queen Maria. Taking {{advantage of the opportunity}} to rid himself of John, Philip II suggested him. In the other version an unnamed knight encouraged the Jerusalemite lords to select John, who accepted their offer with Philip's consent. John visited Pope Innocent III in Rome. The pope donated 40,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land, stipulating that John <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> the money only with the consent of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and the grand masters of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E
5|$|By {{early summer}} 1871, Morris began {{to search for}} a house outside London where his {{children}} <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> time away from the city's pollution. He settled on Kelmscott Manor in the village of Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, obtaining a joint tenancy on the building with Rossetti in June. Morris adored the building, which was constructed circa 1570, and would spend much time in the local countryside. Conversely, Rossetti would be unhappy at Kelmscott, and eventually suffered a mental breakdown. Morris divided his time between London and Kelmscott, however when Rossetti was there he would not spend more than three days at a time at the latter. He was also fed up with his family home in Queen Square, deciding to obtain a new house in London. Although retaining a personal bedroom and study at Queen Square, he relocated his family to Horrington House in Turnham Green Road, West London, in January 1873. This allowed him to be far closer to the home of Burne-Jones, with the duo meeting on almost every Sunday morning for the rest of Morris' life.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, BOT {{superintendent}} Philip E. Pheifer {{put forth}} a proposal for Second Avenue Subway services, which would branch extensively off to B Division. The subway was originally to be opened by 1951, but by 1945, plans for the Second Avenue Subway were again revised. Another plan was put forth in 1947 by Colonel Sidney H. Bingham, a city planner and former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) engineer. O'Dwyer and Gross believed that construction of a Second Avenue subway line would be vital to both increasing capacity on existing lines and allowing new branch lines to be built. Bingham's proposal involved more branch lines and track connections than did Phiefer's, and similar to the 1960s and 1990s phased proposals, was {{to be built in}} sections. However, by the next year, New York City was short $145 million that was needed for a $800 million program for rehabilitation and proposed capital improvements. The City petitioned the New York State Legislature to exceed its $655 million debt ceiling so that the city <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> $500 million on subway construction, but this request was denied.|$|E
50|$|About 3.8 {{million people}} in the United Kingdom have {{diabetes}} mellitus, but the charity Diabetes U.K. have made predictions that could become high as 6.2 million by 2035/2036. The NHS spent a daily average of £2.2m (€2.6m; $3.7m) in 2013 on prescriptions for managing diabetes in primary care, and about 10% of the primary care prescribing budget is spent on treating diabetes. Diabetes U.K. have also predicted that the National Health Service <b>could</b> be <b>spending</b> as much as 16.9 billion pounds on diabetes mellitus by 2035, a figure that means the NHS <b>could</b> be <b>spending</b> as much as 17% of its budget on diabetes treatment by 2035.|$|R

5|$|On 21 July 452 {{was moved}} to Kenley on a plateau near Kenley Common just south of London in East Surrey. There it joined 602 (City of Glasgow) and 485 (New Zealand) Squadron. These fighter units were to form {{the nucleus of the}} new Kenley Wing. From here, they were to fly many {{intensive}} operations over the summer period. The squadrons were bolstered by experienced Non-commissioned officers but were relatively inexperienced units. One of them, 602, was commanded by the seasoned Squadron Leader Al Deere. While there Finucane developed a friendship with the Australian pilot Keith Truscott, who joined 452 in May 1941. The two frequented Oddeninos restaurant on Regent Street, a favourite among pilots in blacked-out London. Lew Stone the dance band leader played there. One evening he met Jean Woolford who was to become his fiancé. Whatever time Finucane <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> on leave was spent in Kew Gardens or Richmond Park with her.|$|E
5|$|The Regent of Madiun, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika, {{participated in}} funding the {{construction}} of Taman Sari. Prawirasentika also beseeched the Sultan to be relieved of Madiun's tax obligation. He offered other alternative ways of payment. The Sultan accepted his proposal. In 1758, the Sultan commanded the Regent to supervise the making of bricks and various complements, which {{would be used to}} build a beautiful garden. The sultan wanted a place where he <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> some time to relax after many years of wars that he had just experienced. Raden Tumenggung Mangundipura, under supervision of Raden Arya Natakusuma (who later became Sri Pakualam II), was responsible for the construction. The building was started in 1684 Javanese year (1758 AD). After finding out how large the complex was, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika realized that the cost would have been greater than the taxes. He resigned from the project and was replaced by Prince Natakusuma who continued the project to completion.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E

5|$|By 2011, {{several of}} the {{strippers}} JC's Girls members had spoken with in San Diego had begun attending a Bible study hosted by the organization and the chapter had helped one stripper leave the sex industry and gain unrelated employment. In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to Adultcon at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and offered them prayer. That July, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> {{more time with her}} family, handing the leadership of the organization to Scher and Brown. In June 2012, Scher gave up her co-leadership of the organization to focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown. By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend a Bible study for four months, read Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry. Brown left JC's Girls in April 2014 and Laura Bonde took over leadership of the organization.|$|E
