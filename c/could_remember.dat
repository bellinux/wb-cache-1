5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959. He has stated that his passion for Scouting {{is one of the}} things that got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, to the point that at times all he <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> was the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b> Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E

50|$|A hard test crash, April of 1970, {{at the old}} Texas World Speedway Texas {{left him}} disoriented.

5|$|The {{relationship}} was often tense between the City and the Crown. The City of London {{had been a}} stronghold of republicanism during the Civil War (1642–1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still {{had the potential to}} be a threat to Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the early 1660s. The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> how Charles I's grab for absolute power had led to that national trauma.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Purdue, he met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics. According to the couple, {{there was no}} real courtship, and neither <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> the exact circumstances of their engagement, except that it occurred while Armstrong was working at the NACA's Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois. When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base, he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. After one semester, they moved into a house in Antelope Valley. Janet never finished her degree, a fact she regretted later in life.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Inns of Chancery {{was used as}} {{accommodation}} and offices by solicitors, the other branch of the English legal profession. During {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries the purpose of the Inns changed. After the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, the practice of teaching barristers in the Inns ceased, and as a result the Inns of Chancery became a dedicated association for solicitors instead, offering offices and accommodation. The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers and Law Society of England and Wales in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated the Inns of Chancery to little more than eccentric dining clubs, and they were gradually dissolved and sold. In 1897 a popular book reported that nobody <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> the purpose of the buildings and that an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins. The last Inn to be sold was Clement's Inn, which was sold in 1903, and demolished in 1934.|$|E

5|$|Vulović {{was in a}} coma for {{ten days}} after the crash. She {{sustained}} severe brain damage, having fractured her skull and then hemorrhaged. In addition, she suffered two broken legs and three broken vertebrae, one of which was crushed completely. Her pelvis was fractured and several ribs broken. Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed below the waist. She had total amnesia from the hour preceding her fall until one month afterwards. Vulović's parents told her that she first learned of the crash about two weeks after it occurred. She fainted upon being shown a newspaper headline by her doctor and had to be tranquilized. The last thing that Vulović <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> from before the crash was greeting passengers as they boarded. The next thing she remembered was seeing her parents in her hospital room about one month later.|$|E
5|$|With only 30 minutes {{remaining}} {{before the}} ship is destroyed, Kirk considers transporting the entire crew to Caliban so they can survive. Scotty discovers Sulu's original transporter pattern, from when the warbird was destroyed. He theorizes that he could re-integrate it into the older version, resetting his memories so that he <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> the Romulan information and allowing him to pilot the Enterprise to safety but causing him to forget his 30 years on Caliban. Alana reassures him that she'll remind him of the man he became, but McCoy and Spock agree that leaving the rift will cause the death of Alana. Sulu draws his sword and is prepared to fight to save his daughter, but she talks him down. He strides onto the transporter pad and demands they reintegrate his pattern. As he is merged once again, Alana quotes The Tempest. The younger version of Sulu is taken to the bridge and pilots the Enterprise from the anomaly with seconds to spare, with Alana ceasing to exist as he does so. Back on the Excelsior, Captain Sulu meets with the shuttle passengers in his ready room; his daughter Demora (Mimi Chong) and is introduced to his baby granddaughter, Alana.|$|E

25|$|Heraclides Ponticus {{reports the}} story that Pythagoras claimed that he had lived four {{previous}} lives that he <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> in detail. One of his past lives, as reported by Aulus Gellius, was as a beautiful courtesan. According to Xenophanes, Pythagoras heard the cry of his dead friend in the bark of a dog.|$|E
25|$|September: Unidentified. All that Nilsen <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> {{about his}} fifth victim {{was that he}} was an Irish {{labourer}} with rough hands, who wore an old suit and jacket, and whose age he estimated to be between 27 and 30 years old. He had met this victim in the Cricklewood Arms in late 1980. Nilsen later claimed to have fabricated this victim.|$|E

25|$|On 15 October 1862, the Hartley Institute {{was opened}} by the Prime Minister Lord Palmerston {{in a major}} civic {{occasion}} which exceeded in splendor anything that anyone in the town <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b> After initial years of financial struggle, the Hartley Institute became the Hartley College in 1883. This move was followed by increasing numbers of students, teaching staff, {{an expansion of the}} facilities and registered lodgings for students.|$|E
25|$|Corpus Christi {{had already}} passed {{the point at}} which {{citizens}} could know one another at least by sight and the number of those who <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> early struggles was diminishing. The first Association continued its work into the twentieth century, gradually tapering off as the original members died. Merriman himself oversaw the cemetery for about ten years until shortly before he died in 1941. Both he and his wife Ellen repose there.|$|E
25|$|On March 2, 2012, Odom was {{assigned}} to the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. He had missed the prior three games due to personal reasons. His stint with the Legends was canceled on March 3, 2012 and he returned to the Mavs' active roster. On March 24, Odom did not play in a 104–87 loss to the San Antonio Spurs, the first time he <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> not playing due to a coach's decision.|$|E
60|$|Yet, {{though he}} so slept, still Sir Tristram's wits in no wise {{recovered}} themselves; {{for when he}} awoke from that slumber he still <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> who he was or whence he came, neither <b>could</b> he <b>remember</b> the faces of any {{of those who were}} around about him. But, though he was thus mad, he was still gentle and kind in his madness and courteous and civil to all those who came nigh him.|$|R

25|$|Sleep also {{influences}} language development. To test this, researchers taught infants a faux {{language and}} observed their {{recollection of the}} rules for that language. Infants who slept within four hours of learning the language <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> the language rules better, while infants who stayed awake longer did not recall those rules as well. There is also a relationship between infants' vocabulary and sleeping: infants who sleep longer at night at 12 months have better vocabularies at 26 months.|$|E
25|$|From {{the moment}} of their abduction, the victims lost all rights. Deprived of all {{communication}} with the outside world, held in unknown places, subjected to barbaric tortures, kept ignorant of their immediate or ultimate fate, they risked being either thrown into a river or the sea, weighted down with blocks of cement, or burned to ashes. They were not mere objects, however, and still possessed all the human attributes: they could feel pain, <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> a mother, child or spouse, could feel infinite shame at being raped in public...|$|E
25|$|The {{explanation}} {{given for}} the success of administrating Tetris as opposed to other interventions is that Tetris draws heavily on visuospatial processing power. Because the brain only has a limited supply of resources to process information, playing Tetris hinders the ability of the brain to focus on other visual information, such as traumatic images. However, the details of the event can still be thought of and rehearsed verbally, as Tetris should not interfere with verbal processes of the brain. This explains why participants <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> the details of the footage they watched but why they still experienced fewer flashbacks.|$|E
