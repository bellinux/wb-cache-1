40|$|The {{progress}} {{of the world economy}} in the last decades brought the deletion of the small and medium sized enterprises {{and the rise of the}} bigger ones in order to satisfy the consumers as much as possible. These businesses face another giant problem which is to hold enough capital, that means the merchant who has to buy big quantities of many types of goods would need an enourmous capital and the problem of the producer is having to sell his products to as many as possible retailers. The solution of these problems appear to be sending on <b>consignement</b> or collection on sale - so no- body would have capital insufficiency pressure. The next problem on behalf of the producer is to watch the sale of the goods for inventory control and also for cash inflow expectation. The last solution here becomes the Self-Billing in English or Autofacturation in French or Selbstfakturierung in German which means the buyer issues bill of the goods sold himself on behalf of the producer and send one copy to the producer. this application is not valid in turkey yet but we believe it will take its place among rules and legislations soon. </div...|$|E
