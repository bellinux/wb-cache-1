25|$|In October Wellington {{returned}} to Kona as defending champion and retained her title, setting a new Hawaii marathon course record of 2:57:44. Despite losing around 10minutes {{because of a}} flat tyre – a delay {{which would have been}} greater if fellow competitor Rebekah Keat had not given her a spare <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> – she finished some 15minutes ahead of second-placed Yvonne van Vlerken.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, DuGas (later {{bought by}} ANSUL) {{came out with}} a cartridge-operated dry {{chemical}} extinguisher, which used sodium bicarbonate specially treated with chemicals to render it free-flowing and moisture-resistant. It consisted of a copper cylinder with an internal CO2cartridge. The operator turned a wheel valve on top to puncture the cartridge and squeezed a lever on the valve {{at the end of the}} hose to discharge the chemical. This was the first agent available for large-scale three-dimensional liquid and pressurized gas fires, and was but remained largely a specialty type until the 1950s, when small dry chemical units were marketed for home use. ABC dry chemical came over from Europe in the 1950s, with Super-K being invented in the early 60s and Purple-K being developed by the US Navy in the late 1960s. Manually applied dry agents such as graphite for class D (metal) fires had existed since WWII, but it wasn't until 1949 that Ansul introduced a pressurized extinguisher using an external <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> to discharge the agent. Met-L-X (sodium chloride) was the first extinguisher developed in the US, with graphite, copper, and several other types being developed later.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} add {{stability}} {{to the initial}} puncture of the <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> Tippmann designed the trigger of the TPX pistol out of cast zinc (with a nickel-plated finish). After insertion of a 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> one pull of this trigger will puncture it allowing for the CO2 to enter the gun {{to be used to}} propel the paintballs.|$|E
50|$|A {{noteworthy}} free upgrade for the TPX CO2 puncturing {{system can}} be found on Tippmann's web page. This upgrade is sent to TPX owners having trouble puncturing <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges</b> with the first pull of the trigger. This kit includes an adjustable set screw to allow for different lengths of 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges</b> to be used with the marker, as well as a new puncture pin.|$|R
50|$|Objects {{can be built}} {{using one}} piece of {{material}} to produce parts without seams. Without seams, a part can withstand higher internal or external pressure exerted on it. For example: scuba tanks and <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ariakon {{came out}} with an {{upgraded}} model, the Overlord RX, in early 2007 featuring cheaper, lighter magazines, a threaded barrel, and cutouts {{in the side of}} the CO2 chamber to reduce problems with the <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges</b> jamming.|$|R
50|$|On the road, {{the easiest}} {{approach}} to a flat tire, should a spare inner tube be available, is to replace the tube. The wheel is removed, the tire levered from the rim and inspected for causes of damage, and the inner tube replaced and wheel inflated. Re-inflation {{can be carried out}} by the use of a frame mounted pump or a <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> inflator. The <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> is generally a single use item only while the pump can be used to inflate many flat tires. The inner tube may then be repaired at a later date.|$|E
50|$|Directly {{underneath}} the 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> chamber on the TPX {{there is a}} picatinny rail. Rails similar to this are found on numerous paintball markers, and are designed in order to attach accessories such as tactical lights or laser pointers.|$|E
50|$|The {{device that}} {{surrounds}} a <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> in a seltzer bottle {{is also a}} wingnut. Twisting the wingnut completes a seal around the cartridge neck; twisting a bit more causes a pin to pierce the cartridge and let the gas into the bottle.|$|E
50|$|Ariakon overlords {{are capable}} of {{shooting}} between 240 and 350 ft/s, reaching ranges of up to 150 ft and are also capable of a bottom line feed if one {{does not wish to}} use 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Eraser and Chaser both operate using 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>{{cartridges}}</b> as {{the power}} source. The cartridges are loaded into the gas cylinder and screwed into the grip, keeping the weight in the pistol more balanced, and reducing {{the size of the}} front end of the marker. Each cartridge is capable of firing 60-80 shots (depending on the temperature).|$|R
50|$|These airguns were {{manufactured}} from 1970 to 1978. They {{are single}} shot pistols, requiring manual reloading after each shot. Velocity is adjustable and some early models allow for trigger travel adjustment. The {{value of these}} guns has held remarkably well, with pristine models (with original box, S&W pellets and S&W <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges)</b> selling for multiples of the original price. Seal kits are still widely available so they remain serviceable shooters even today.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the first}} year of its production, the Tippmann has {{received}} numerous complaints about the CO2 puncturing system not working correctly. Many TPX operators have had issues making the first pull of the TPX trigger puncture the inserted 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1881 Two Scottish engineers,Messrs Read and Campbell, who {{had been}} bridge {{building}} in Argentina formed a company, Aerators Ltd., to make carbon dioxide and gas cylinders. They formed the company Read and Campbell Ltd. in 1881 and registered a design in Great Britain {{in the same year}} to cover [...] "the arrangement for piercing capsules" [...] to expel water, carbon tetrachloride etc. by means of a <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The patent was granted in 1909. The extinguisher worked on the principle of a pressurised <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> being pierced, the pressure inside thus released expanding into the extinguisher body and expelling the contents under pressure. Other types of extinguishers worked by mixing sulphuric acid with a solution of bicarbonate and water - the soda-acid extinguisher.|$|E
50|$|The Blackbird {{boasts a}} 400-round-plus capacity, {{as well as}} an {{improved}} three-cartridge 12-gram CO2 system, or a single 88-gram large <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge.</b> It shares many parts with the original Drozd and retains the same basic body configuration, as well as the original Drozd's stock firing modes.|$|E
2500|$|F1 in Schools is an {{international}} STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) competition for school children (aged 1116), in which groups of 3–6 students have to design and manufacture a miniature [...] "car" [...] out of the official F1 Model Block using CAD/CAM design tools. [...] The cars are powered by <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges</b> and are attached to a track by a nylon wire. They are timed {{from the moment they}} are launched to when they pass the finish line by a computer.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, dive shop owners, Joe Schuch and Jack Schammel, {{developed}} {{a more comfortable}} buoyancy compensator vest that featured a smaller buoyancy ring behind the diver's head, and a midriff section with sufficient volume to lift the diver's {{head out of the}} water in the event that one or both of its <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges</b> were activated for emergency ascent. In 1969, the original Control Buoyancy Jacket or [...] "CBJ" [...] was manufactured by Waverly Air Products of Chemung, NY and sold in dive shops throughout the east coast of the United States. By 1970, a push-button inflator using air from the diver's SCUBA tank augmented the manual inflation hose.|$|R
5000|$|Minderbinder's {{enterprise}} becomes {{known as}} [...] "M & M Enterprises", {{with the two}} M's standing for his initials and the [...] "&" [...] added to dispel any idea that the enterprise is a one-man operation. Minderbinder travels across the world, especially around the Mediterranean, trying {{to buy and sell}} goods at a profit, primarily through black market channels. Everyone has a [...] "share", a fact which Minderbinder uses to defend his actions, stating that what is good for the company is good for all. For example, he secretly replaces the <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges</b> in the emergency life vests with printed notes to the effect that what is good for M & M is good for the country.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1881 by two Scottish engineers, Messrs Read and Campbell, who had been bridge {{building}} in Argentina formed a company, Aerators Ltd., to make carbon dioxide and gas cylinders.

50|$|Read and Campbell, {{the oldest}} company of those which came {{together}} to form Chubb Fire Security Limited. Their invention of the <b>CO2</b> <b>Cartridge</b> to expel {{the contents of a}} fire extinguisher is still today the most common method in use. Read and Campbell are mainly remembered for their 'Waterloo' and 'Petrolex' brand extinguishers.|$|E
50|$|To use {{a remote}} air source a remote line adapter must be installed. This feature {{requires}} that an empty 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{be in place}} before a remote hose {{can be used with}} the TPX paintball pistol. Attachment of the remote air source depends on the remote line being used and is compatible with standard lines.|$|E
2500|$|Paintball marker: {{also known}} as a [...] "paintball gun", this is the primary piece of equipment, used to mark the {{opposing}} player with paintballs. The paintball gun must have a loader or [...] "hopper" [...] or magazines attached to feed paint into the marker, and will be either spring-fed, gravity-fed (where balls drop into the loading chamber), or electronically force-fed. Modern markers require a compressed-air tank or CO2 tank. In contrast, very early bolt-action paintball markers used disposable silver capsules (12-gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridges)</b> normally seen in pellet guns. In the mid to late 1980s, marker mechanics improved to include constant air pressure and semi-automatic operation. Further improvements included increased rates of fire; carbon dioxide (CO2) tanks from 3.5 [...] to 40 ounces, and compressed-air or nitrogen tanks in a variety of sizes and pressure capacities up to 5000 PSI. The use of unstable CO2 causes damage to the low-pressure pneumatic components inside electronic markers, therefore the more stable compressed air is preferred by owners of such markers.|$|R
50|$|To {{insert a}} 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> into the marker turn the quarter turn cap {{counter-clockwise}}, then pull out, and then counter-clockwise again. Insert the cartridge narrow side first, then return the cap {{to its original}} position with two turns clockwise. The cartridge will not puncture until the trigger is pulled. This first pull however, will not fire the marker.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{simulation}} grenade {{which is not}} intended to cause harm, the Thunder-B grenade does not use any explosives. Instead, the grenade simply makes a loud [...] "bang" [...] sound, through the use of compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to burst a plastic shell. The core, which is reusable, is the component with the safety pin which is pulled out to start the timer. The user installs one standard 12 g disposable <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> inside the core, and then screws the core into a disposable plastic shell designed for the grenade. Then, when the user wishes to use the grenade, they pull out the safety pin and throw it. The mechanical parts in the core will puncture the <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> and begin releasing pressurized CO2 gas inside the shell. In approximately 3 to 5 seconds, the pressure will be sufficient to cause the plastic shell to burst, releasing the pressure and producing the loud [...] "bang" [...] sound.|$|E
50|$|While {{the marker}} is {{designed}} to use 12 gram CO2 cartridges as its propellant, a remote line adapter can be installed in order to hook the TPX up to an external air source. Use of a remote line with the TPX increases the amount of air supply the marker has at one time by allowing larger sources of air {{to be used with}} the marker. Installation of this modification requires internal parts to be replaced in order to allow the air flow from the 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> to change and be redirected. This modification also requires a small piece {{in the back of the}} marker to be taken out. In order for this upgrade to function properly a used or empty 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> must be in place in the chamber underneath the barrel. Most remote lines are compatible with the TPX remote line adapter modification, and connection of the line depends on the model of remote hose being used.|$|E

50|$|The Dacor Seachute BC4 had unique {{upper and}} lower bladders. The upper bladder was around the neck and could be {{inflated}} by the <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{for use as a}} surface life jacket. The lower bladder was over the diver's stomach area, and was inflated by LP gas from the regulator, for buoyancy control underwater. This arrangement provided better buoyancy distribution for trim control while diving than most other front inflation systems.|$|E
50|$|For basic {{maintenance}} and repairs cyclists can carry a pump (or a <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge),</b> a puncture repair kit, a spare inner tube, and tire levers {{and a set of}} allen keys. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special shoes, gloves, and shorts. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes and high-visibility clothing is advisable to reduce the risk from motor vehicle users.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2010, Dorian had {{a terrifying}} wipeout at Mavericks in a two-wave {{hold-down}} that almost killed him. The incident motivated Shane to design surfing's first [...] "safety suit" [...] to be inflated with a <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> in a wetsuit vest during a potentially deadly hold-down. He {{helped develop the}} final product {{that is capable of}} instantly [...] "torpedoing" [...] a trapped-underwater surfer back to the surface when inflated. He said the invention was inspired by a near-drowning he had at the Northern California premiere big wave spot not long after his first session there.|$|E
50|$|The TPX/TiPX is a {{magazine}} fed paintball pistol made by Tippmann. New to the paintball pistol market, Tippmann released the TPX in 2009. This paintball marker uses an air {{system that allows}} for 12 gram CO2 cartridges to be placed underneath the barrel. This was meant to eliminate bulk {{in the grip of}} the marker caused by placing the <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> in the magazines. In 2011,Tippmann changed the name of the pistol to the TiPX to market all the improved parts at that time, as well as differentiate it from the TPX baseball line by Louisville Slugger.|$|E
5000|$|Gun f/x {{has also}} {{developed}} Improvised Explosive Device and Mine Training Simulators [...] The IED and mine simulators {{have been used}} to train troops in the deployment, detection, and disarming of mines and IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The IED and mine simulators utilize a 12 gram <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> and frangible burst cup. The devices are used with an inert talc powder that gives off a smoke effect. Both designs give a concussive report in the 100 decibel range, which simulates the sound made by real IEDs and mines. Both models can be configured for remote command detonation.|$|E
50|$|With {{the growth}} in {{motoring}} {{and the use of}} petrol engines there was a call for an extinguisher especially designed for fighting petrol fires. In 1911 Read and Campbell took out patent rights in Argentina on their 'Petrolex' extinguisher. This was acarbon tetrachloride extinguisher operated by a <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The Royal Automobile Club conducted tests on the 'Petrolex' which passed with flying colours. 'Waterloo' extinguishers-water filled, were installed in many Royal residences and public buildings including 'Windsor Castle and all the Royal Palaces of England',the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the General Post Office. Royal cars were fitted with 'Petrolex' extinguishers.|$|E
5000|$|Powered by a 12g {{disposable}} <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> or re-fillable internal air system, {{it features}} a blowback design and 9 shot capacity magazine using [...]43 caliber paintballs or rubberballs. The trigger is double-action (DA/SA). First versions {{did not have a}} conventional on/off safety. Current versions now have a manual trigger-lock safety. The marker is cocked by working the slide and there is also a functional de-cocker. It differs from the RAP4/5 system as it does not use (and therefore) eject shell casings. Muzzle velocity is adjustable between 200 ft/s and 300 ft/s. For [...]43 cal paintball - 0.029 oz it is about 3.4371 J (at 300 ft/s).|$|E
5000|$|... 1911 With {{the growth}} in {{motoring}} {{and the use of}} petrol engines there was a call for an extinguisher especially designed for fighting petrol fires. Read and Campbell took out patent rights in Argentina on their 'Petrolex' extinguisher. This was a carbon tetrachloride extinguisher operated by a <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The Royal Automobile Club (RAC) conducted tests on the 'Petrolex' which passed with flying colours. 'Waterloo' extinguishers-water filled,were installed in many Royal residences and public buildings including 'Windsor Castle and all the Royal Palaces of England', The British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the General Post Office (GPO). Royal cars were fitted with 'Petrolex' extinguishers.|$|E
50|$|The Tippmann TPX {{features}} an area underneath its barrel for the operator to place 12 gram CO2 cartridges that provide velocity for paintballs {{to be shot}} out of the pistol. In this chamber the <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> is held in place by a quarter turn cap that twists clockwise into place. Tippmann claims that the TPX punctures this cartridge when the user pulls the trigger of the marker for the first time, although there have been troubles reported with this feature. The purpose of this design is to remove the cartridge from the paintball magazines. Removing the air cartridge from the magazine is meant to eliminate bulk from the pistol grip allowing it to be easier to hold.|$|E
50|$|The usual {{inflation}} system {{is from a}} low-pressure hose from the primary breathing gas supply, but a dedicated direct feed pony bottle was common on early buoyancy compensators, and remains an option for some models. Most BCs allow oral inflation both underwater and on the surface. This could theoretically reduce gas consumption, but is generally not considered worth the effort and slightly increased hazard of taking the DV out of the mouth underwater, and possibly having to purge it before breathing again. Oral inflation is, however, an effective alternative inflation method {{in case of a}} failure of the pressurized {{inflation system}}. Emergency inflation by expendable <b>CO2</b> <b>cartridge</b> is provided on some BCs.|$|E
