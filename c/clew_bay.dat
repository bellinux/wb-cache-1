5|$|Dunmanus Bay, Kenmare estuary and Dingle Bay are all inlets {{between the}} peninsulas of County Kerry. North {{of these is}} the Shannon Estuary. Between north County Clare and County Galway is Galway Bay. <b>Clew</b> <b>Bay</b> is located on the coast of County Mayo, south of Achill Island, while Broadhaven Bay, Blacksod Bay and Sruth Fada Conn bays are {{situated}} in northwest Connacht, in North Mayo. Killala Bay is on the northeast coast of Mayo. Donegal Bay is a major inlet between County Donegal and County Sligo.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{processes}} of nitrification in three coastal bays, specifically, aerobic ammonia oxidation which is the rate limiting step of nitrification and is mediated by ammonia oxidising bacteria and/or archaea (AOB/AOA). Rusheen, <b>Clew</b> and Kinvarra <b>bay</b> are located on the Atlantic coast of Ireland. The aim of this project is to combine in situ field data with experimental approaches, addressing temporal and spatial changes in ammonia oxidiser (AO) activity, abundance and diversity across environmental gradients in coastal bay ecosystems, in order to elucidate the key AO and environmental drivers within dynamic intertidal sediment ecosystems. Using this approach we report {{for the first time}} transcriptionally active AOB and AOA were present within Rusheen bay intertidal sediments, bringing us a step closer to confirming actively nitrifying co-occurring AOB and AOA in intertidal sediments. In chapter three we observe the huge diversity that can be found in coastal sediments. We show that using 16 S rRNA transcripts enables us to identify low abundant or rare OTUs that were not picked up by sequencing DNA alone. Finally in chapter four through the use of experimental sediment microcosm incubations combined with SIP, we were able to demonstrate the growth and activity of Nitrosoarchaeum like AOAs in a low salinity habitat originating from intertidal coastal sediment. In addition throughout all three chapters we saw the impact environmental conditions such as nutrient concentrations, salinity, pH and temperature have on driving the distribution of communities within intertidal sediments...|$|R
25|$|In 1894, the Westport - Newport railway {{line was}} {{extended}} to Achill Sound. The train station is now a hostel. The train provided a great service to Achill, but it also fulfilled an ancient prophecy. Brian Rua O' Cearbhain had prophesied that 'carts on iron wheels' would carry bodies into Achill on their first and last journey. In 1894, the first train on the Achill railway carried the bodies of victims of the <b>Clew</b> <b>Bay</b> Drowning. This tragedy occurred when a boat overturned in <b>Clew</b> <b>Bay,</b> drowning thirty-two young people. They had been {{going to meet the}} steamer which would take them to Scotland for potato picking.|$|E

25|$|Westport {{originates}} {{and gets}} its name, in Irish, from a 16th-century castle--Cathair na Mart (meaning: The Stone Fort of the Beeves or The City of The Fairs)--and surrounding settlement, {{belonging to the}} powerful local seafaring Ó Máille Clan, who controlled the <b>Clew</b> <b>Bay</b> area, then known as Umaill.|$|E

25|$|Kildamhnait on the {{south-east}} {{coast of}} Achill {{is named after}} St. Damhnait, or Dymphna, who founded a church there in the 16th century.

25|$|The {{hereditary}} chieftains of Umhall {{were the}} O'Malleys, {{recorded in the}} area in 814 AD when they successfully repelled an onslaught by the Vikings in <b>Clew</b> <b>Bay.</b> The Anglo-Norman invasion of Connacht in 1235 AD saw the territory of Umhall taken over by the Butlers and later by the de Burgos. The Butler Lordship of Burrishoole continued into the late 14th century when Thomas le Botiller was recorded as being in possession of Akkyll & Owyll.|$|E
25|$|Eoghan Dubhdara Ó Máille, {{her father}} {{and his family were}} based in <b>Clew</b> <b>Bay,</b> County Mayo. He was lord of the Ó Máille dynasty and ruler of Umall, descended from Maille mac Conall. The Uí Mháille (O'Malleys) were one of the {{seafaring}} families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of Murrisk in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the Mac Uilliam Íochtair branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo (the Bourkes (De Burca) were originally Anglo-Norman but by her lifetime completely Gaelicised. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a Ní Mháille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a half-brother called Dónal na Píopa, the son of her father.|$|E

60|$|But look again, and {{you will}} see that along the west coast of Ireland, except in a very few places, like Galway Bay, the blue {{limestone}} does not come down to the sea; the shore is coloured purple and brown, and those colours mark the ancient rocks and high mountains of Mayo and Galway and Kerry, which stand as barriers to keep the raging surf of the Atlantic from bursting inland and beating away, as it surely would in course of time, the low flat limestone plain of the middle of Ireland. But the same coral-reefs once stretched out far to the westward into the Atlantic Ocean; and you may see the proof upon that map. For in the western bays, in <b>Clew</b> <b>Bay</b> with its hundred islands, and Galway Bay with its Isles of Arran, and beautiful Kenmare, and beautiful Bantry, you see little blue spots, which are low limestone islands, standing in the sea, overhung by mountains far aloft. You have often heard those islands in Kenmare Bay talked of, and how some whom you know go to fish round them by night for turbot and conger; and when you hear them spoken of again, you must recollect that they are the last fragments of a great fringing coral-reef, which will in a few thousand years follow the fate of the rest, and be eaten up by the waves, while the mountains of hard rock stand round them still unchanged.|$|E
