50|$|As {{illustrated}} by the title <b>complexes,</b> <b>tetrahedral</b> and square planar isomers coexist in solutions of various four-coordinated nickel(II) complexes. Weak field ligands, as judged by the spectrochemical series, favor tetrahedral geometry and strong field ligands favor the square planar isomer. Both weak field (Cl−) and strong field (PPh3) ligands comprise NiCl2(PPh3)2, hence this compound is borderline between the two geometries. Steric effects also affect the equilibrium; larger ligands favoring the less crowded tetrahedral geometry.|$|R

A consequence of the much smaller size of ΔT results in (almost) all <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>complexes</b> being high spin and therefore {{the change in the}} ground state term seen on the X-axis for octahedral d4-d7 diagrams is not required for interpreting spectra of <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>complexes.</b>|$|R

In addition to the topological Néel phase, we recover various chiral noncoplanar magnetic orders previously identified within a strong coupling approach. We compute the band structure of these ordered phases, showing that the triple-Q <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>phase</b> harbors topological Chern bands with large Chern numbers.

This difference stems from {{the influence of the}} low-coordinated systems are considered here, whereas the initial Harrison values are given to match <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>phases</b> [67]. Another general observation can be made for the tight-binding parameters of the σ-type interactions (the hs,p,σand hp,p,σones), which present much closer values over the considered interatomic distance range than in the case of Harrison’s data.|$|R

The problem is considered in its most generality, that is, the <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>complex</b> can be concave and have holes inside it which can themselves be concave. This algorithm {{can be used to}} efficiently perform ray-tracing of 3 -D objects. The main idea in the algorithm comes from the observation that there are few number of boundary vertices than there are internal vertices in a arbitrary <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>complex.</b> Thus, by suitably initializing our possible set of next vertices that can be visited, we get an efficient algorithm to implement the sweep.

We show how the perfect arrangement of disclination lines at 0 K for the crystalline structures, evolves through the melting point. In particular, as the temperature is increased, the results permit to identify the first defect and to show that the initial network of disclination lines survives until the solid-liquid first order transition has indeed taken place.

40|$|A short {{overview}} {{is given}} on existing phase {{relations in the}} four related ternary diagrams, setting the frame for a quaternary phase diagram. On the basis of published data the three-dimensional phase region of NASICON materials is constructed and phase relations to ternary and binary systems {{as well as to}} single oxides are presented. To date, the NASICON region can be described as a compressed tetrahedron within the <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>phase</b> diagram. However, the three-dimensional presentation clearly elucidates that few reported compositions exist outside this compressed tetrahedron indicating that the phase region of NASICON materials may be larger than the solid solutions known so far. The three-dimensional representation also better elucidates the regions connecting the edges of the NASICON tetrahedron with ternary and binary compounds as well as single oxides, i. e. ZrO 2 and ZrSiO 4, Na 3 PO 4, sodium silicates and sodium zirconium silicates and gives a better understanding of phase formations during the processing of the ceramics.
