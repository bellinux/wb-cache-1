5|$|After {{the murder}} of Archbishop Thomas Becket at the cathedral in 1170, Canterbury {{became one of the}} most notable towns in Europe, as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> his shrine. This pilgrimage {{provided}} the framework for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century collection of stories, The Canterbury Tales. Canterbury Castle was captured by the French Prince Louis during his 1215 invasion of England, before the death of John caused his English supporters to desert his cause and support the young Henry III.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, he was {{transferred}} to Fort Myer in Virginia. While stationed there, Matthews {{and some of his}} troops were escorts for King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth when they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House. He earned acclaim for his horse shows, which helped sell war bonds during World War II and he tended to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's personal horses. He also played on the polo team while stationed in the state.|$|E
5|$|Many {{friends and}} acquaintances <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the Houstons at Woodland, {{including}} members of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe who had allied with Houston during the Texas Revolution; he in return had assisted them in their being granted a reservation in east Texas. Throughout {{the last years of}} his presidency, Houston had made numerous efforts for the Republic to find common ground with the various tribes, asserting their right to own land. Many tribes had come to respect him as their friend.|$|E

5|$|Specht {{would not}} allow women on the group base, {{considering}} them an unnecessary diversion. According to Knoke, one time Specht's wife <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> him on the II./JG 11 base but {{was held at the}} guard room on Specht's orders and refused to receive calls from the guard. Instead he asked Knoke to pass a message to her to 'put herself on ice', saying that he would only have time for her after the war. Specht however did not survive, dying five months before the war in Europe came to an end.|$|E
5|$|After falling {{pregnant}} by Brett Macklin (Gerry Sont), Ruth Stewart (Justine Clarke) {{gave birth}} to Martha. However, she decided to give Martha up for adoption to a family called the MacKenzies. Martha grew up on her new family's farm. Her adoptive parents died, leaving Martha with the farm and her adoptive brothers. Martha then {{went in search of}} her biological parents. Brett did not want to know her, but she managed to form a relationship with Ruth and went to live with her in New York. Her grandfather, Alf, and her great aunt, Morag (Cornelia Frances), <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> and Martha chose to return to Australia to live with her relatives.|$|E
5|$|Jim Carrey was {{considered}} for the part of Jack Sparrow. However, the production schedule for The Curse of the Black Pearl conflicted with Bruce Almighty. Others {{considered for the}} role include Michael Keaton and Christopher Walken. Although Cook had been a strong proponent of adapting Disney's rides into films, the box office failure of The Country Bears (2002) made Michael Eisner attempt to shut down production of Pirates of the Caribbean. However, Verbinski told his concept artists to keep working on the picture, and when Eisner <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit,</b> the executive was astonished by what had been created.|$|E

5|$|Kami, Perempuan premiered in 1943 in Jakarta. It {{received}} multiple {{performances that}} year, some in Jakarta, some {{in other parts}} of Java. In 1950 Pane included Kami, Perempuan in his book Djinak-Djinak Merpati dengan Tjerita2 Sandiwara Lain, a collection of his stage plays. For this publication Pane removed a scene in which two neighbours <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the family, which included further conversation. Pane considered this scene to be anti-climactic, whereas without it the play's title became more appropriate. Another, smaller, change to the play was the removal of the names of Japan's enemies during World War II.|$|E
5|$|It was not Burr, but the Romantic {{poet and}} writer Percy Bysshe Shelley {{who had the}} {{greatest}} impact on Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's Political Justice, Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the daughter of one of his heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, his new wife, and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused. When Shelley finally <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the Godwins, all three girls were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing radical politics; for example, Shelley liked to act as if class were irrelevant, but she argued that it was significant in daily affairs.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki {{wrote the}} script after he decided the film {{would be based}} on the 10-year-old {{daughter}} of his friend, associate producer Seiji Okuda, who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> his house each summer. At the time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects, but they were rejected. With a budget of US$19 million, production of Spirited Away began in 2000. During production, Miyazaki realized the film would be over three hours long and decided to cut out several parts of the story. Pixar director John Lasseter, a fan of Miyazaki, was approached by Walt Disney Pictures to supervise an English-language translation for the film's North American release. Lasseter hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer of the adaptation. Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{entertaining}} {{old friends}} who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> {{her in her}} home, Cameron also met with younger occultists, such as the Thelemite William Breeze and the industrial musician Genesis P-Orridge. Cameron aided Breeze in co-editing a collection of Parsons' occult and libertarian writings, which were published as Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword in 1989. Cameron was acquainted with the experimental film-maker Chick Strand and appeared in the latter's 1979 project Loose Ends, during which she narrated {{the story of an}} exorcism. In 1989, an exhibition of her work titled The Pearl of Reprisal was held at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. It included a selection of her paintings and a screening of Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome and The Wormwood Star, while Cameron attended to provide a candle-lit reading of her poetry. In the mid-1990s, Cameron was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent radiotherapy treatment, which she supplemented with alternative medicines. The tumor was cancerous and metastasized to her lungs. She {{died at the age of}} 73 in the VA Medical Center on July 24, 1995, and underwent the Thelemic last rites, carried out by a high priestess of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Her body was cremated and its ashes were scattered in the Mojave Desert. A memorial event was held at Venice's Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in August.|$|E
5|$|The {{persecution}} in Africa {{also encouraged}} {{the development of}} Donatism, a schismatic movement that forbade any compromise with Roman government or traditor bishops (those who had handed scriptures over to secular authorities). One of the key moments in the break with the mainline Church occurred in Carthage in 304. The Christians from Abitinae {{had been brought to}} the city and imprisoned. Friends and relatives of the prisoners <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit,</b> but encountered resistance from a local mob. The group was harassed, beaten, and whipped; the food they had brought for their imprisoned friends was scattered on the ground. The mob had been sent by Mensurius, the bishop of the city, and Caecilian, his deacon, for reasons that remain obscure. In 311, Caecilian was elected bishop of Carthage. His opponents charged that his traditio made him unworthy of the office, and declared itself for another candidate, Majorinus. Many others in Africa, including the Abitinians, also supported Majorinus against Caecilian. Majorinus's successor Donatus would give the dissident movement its name. By the time Constantine took over the province, the African church was deeply divided. The Donatists would not be reconciled to the Catholic Church until after 411.|$|E
5|$|In May 1851 Metternich {{left for}} his Johannisberg estate, {{which he had}} last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian {{representative}} Otto von Bismarck. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue. Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present {{for the first time}} in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it), and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, Karl Ferdinand von Buol but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich's advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, some of it was usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War, though Buol did not. In the meantime Metternich's health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard's step-sister's daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit,</b> as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich's advice, particularly about Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came to ask him about what should be done in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.|$|E

5|$|In late 1558, Calvin {{became ill}} with a fever. Since {{he was afraid}} that he might die before {{completing}} the final revision of the Institutes, he forced himself to work. The final edition was greatly expanded to the extent that Calvin referred to it as a new work. The expansion from the 21 chapters of the previous edition to 80 was due to the extended treatment of existing material rather than the addition of new topics. Shortly after he recovered, he strained his voice while preaching, which brought on a violent fit of coughing. He burst a blood-vessel in his lungs, and his health steadily declined. He preached his final sermon in St. Pierre on 6February 1564. On 25April, he made his will, in which he left small sums to his family and to the collège. A few days later, the ministers of the church <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> him, and he bade his final farewell, which was recorded in Discours d'adieu aux ministres. He recounted his life in Geneva, sometimes recalling bitterly some of the hardships he had suffered. Calvin died on 27May 1564 aged 54. At first his body lay in state, but since so many people came to see it, the reformers were afraid that they would be accused of fostering a new saint's cult. On the following day, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois. The exact location of the grave is unknown; a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvin's.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the Buddhist {{doctrine}} of rebirth, the previous existences of Koṇḍañña are described in Buddhist texts. They repeatedly show a theme of Koṇḍañña having displayed religious inclinations in previous rebirths, many of which involve experiences with previous rebirths of the Buddha and his other leading disciplines. This is a common theme among the leading disciples, {{all of whom had}} many encounters with the future Gautama Buddha in previous lives, and is consistent with the Buddhist concepts of cause and effect and karma. In Pali language Theravada literature, Koṇḍañña is said to have begun striving for enlightenment in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, the 13th Buddha. The son of a wealthy householder at Hamsavati, Koṇḍañña saw the monk who was the first disciple of Padmuttara Buddha. Koṇḍañña's previous rebirth bestowed on the Buddha and the sangha and wished that he was to be the first disciple of a future Buddha. Padumuttara is said to have prophesied the fulfilment of this in the era of Gautama Buddha, 1000 aeons into the future. After the passing of Padmuttara Buddha, Koṇḍañña constructed a jewelled chamber inside the cetiya in which the relics were stored and also made an offering of jewel festoons. The Apadana offers a variant on this reincarnation. It states that Koṇḍañña {{was the first person to}} offer a meal to Padumuttara and became a deva in the Tusita world. It further says and that during the time of Vipassī Buddha, Koṇḍañña was a householder named Mahakala who offered the Buddha the first fruits of his field in their nine stages of production. The Mahavastu gives another account explaining the origin of Koṇḍañña's vow to attain arahanthood in his final rebirth. This account asserts that he was a potter at Rajagaha in a previous existence. A Paccekabuddha who was suffering from biliousness sought shelter in the potter's hut and was cured. In time, several more Paccekabuddhas <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the hut to inquire about their colleagues health status. The potter asked which of them had realised the dharma first, to which the patient answered in the affirmative. Thereupon the potter made his vow.|$|E
