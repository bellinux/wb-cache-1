40|$|Allometric {{analysis}} of the total body clearance (ClB), steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) and elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 ) was performed for cephalexin, cefepime, <b>cefquinone</b> and ceftriaxone based on literature data in mammalian species. Values of ClB and Vss show allometric dependence on body weight, while values of t 1 / 2  could not be predicted correctly after scaling toward body weight. The equations based on the calculations {{which could be used}} for estimation of the respective pharmacoki-netic parameters are as follows: Cephalexin: ClB= 0. 20 W 1. 05; Vss= 0. 32 W 0. 98; Cefepime: t 1 / 2 β = 1. 03 W 0. 16; ClB= 0. 35 W 0. 68; Vss= 0. 133 W 0. 99; Ceftriaxone: t 1 / 2 β= 0. 83 W 0. 13; ClB= 0. 76 W 0. 73; Vss= 0. 82 W 0. 79; Cefqui-nome: ClB= 0. 22 W 0. 875; Vss= 0. 298 W 0. 975...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Respiratory {{disease in}} calves is an actual problem, {{a major cause}} of {{economic}} losses due to mortality, growth delay and improper development. These conditions are frequent in calves due to the weaning stress, transport and environmental changes. Aims: The aim of this study was the isolation of bacteria from 30 calves with respiratory disorders and their antibiotic susceptibility testing. Materials and methods: Samples were collected from calves with respiratory disorders (nasal discharge) aged 6 to 9 weeks in 2 series, using sterile swabs. Samples were initially inoculated on blood agar and MacConkey agar following the characteristics of the colonies and microscopic examination that enabled the identification of bacterial species. Isolated strains were used to flood Mueller-Hinton agar to carry out sensitivity testing. The antibiotics tested were represented by: Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, Gentamicin, Florfenicol, Enrofloxacin, Marbofloxacin, Penicillin G, <b>Cefquinone,</b> Tulathromycin, Ceftiofur, Tylosin and Cephalotin. Results: Genus Streptococcus have been identified in 23 samples, followed by Staphylococcus identified in 14 samples, and Bacillus spp., in 10 nasal swabs; The most common bacteria associations were represented by Streptococcus-Staphylococcus, Streptococcus-Staphylococcus-Bacillus, and Streptococcus-E. coli. The most efficient antibiotic was Cefquinome (Cobactan), followed by Penicillin G and Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (Amoxiclav); the least effective antibiotics were Florfenicol and Tulathromycin. Conclusions: The study carried out on nasal discharge samples collected from calves with respiratory disorders and their antimicrobial profile testing led to the following conclusions: 1) Low susceptibility to Florfenicol is caused by previous treatments when this molecule was excessively used and without prior sensitivity testing. 2) Cefquinome may represent an emergency therapeutic antibiotic for respiratory infections in calves, but the administration should always be preceded by susceptibility testing of the isolates...|$|E
