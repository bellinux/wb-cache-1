2500|$|In {{plants and}} microbes, {{changes in the}} lipid {{composition}} of cell membranes {{have been linked to}} cold tolerance. The enhanced resistance to <b>cold</b> <b>treatment</b> appears to be caused by an increased amount of fatty acid desaturases produced under cold stress transforming saturated into unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane. This effect can be reproduced artificially in genetically engineered plants. The changes in membrane lipid composition lead to a higher membrane fluidity, thus keeping the membrane from [...] "freezing" [...] at low temperatures. This [...] "lipid hypothesis of cold tolerance" [...] is less well supported in animals. In fruit flies, cold acclimation does not coincide with a reduced amount of saturated fatty acids, and recent genetic studies on a nematode indicate that the mechanisms involved in cold adaptation in animals may be different from those in plants and microbes.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there are}} few {{scientific}} studies on the subject, the practice of butterfly gardening and creating [...] "Monarch Waystations" [...] is commonly thought to increase the populations of butterflies. [...] Efforts to increase monarch populations by establishing butterfly gardens and waystations require {{particular attention to the}} butterfly's food preferences and population cycles, as well to the conditions needed to propagate milkweed. For example, in the Washington, D.C. area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States, monarchs prefer to reproduce on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), especially when its foliage is soft and fresh. As monarch reproduction in that area peaks in late summer when milkweed foliage is old and tough, A. syriaca needs to be cut back at least by half in June to assure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak. In addition, milkweed seed may need a period of <b>cold</b> <b>treatment</b> before it will germinate.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{concerns}} on preparing suitable {{titanium alloy}} substrate that might induce better characteristic of titanium oxide layer on the substrate. Different degrees of <b>cold</b> rolling <b>treatments</b> were applied on Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy before thermal-electrochemical anodizing processes. The later processes {{were performed to}} produce titanium oxide layer which combines thermal process by heat treatment and followed with electrochemical anodizing process. After thermal heat treatment process, it was observed more homogeneous titanium oxide layer for the samples given <b>cold</b> rolling <b>treatment</b> as compared with sample without the treatment. This condition is believed due to the finer substrate surface after <b>cold</b> rolling <b>treatment</b> as observed from surface roughness measurement. Similar situation was observed after anodizing process that irregular oxidized layer was observed for sample without <b>cold</b> rolling <b>treatment,</b> whereas more homogenous layer was observed for sample with <b>cold</b> rolling <b>treatment.</b> Except for sample without <b>cold</b> rolling <b>treatment,</b> anodizing treatment tends to create finer oxidized layer.

This {{study examined the}} influence of a short cold period during different growth stages on the vegetative and reproductive development of soybean under two changing (increasing and decreasing) daylength conditions. In the increasing daylength experiment, Hutcheson (MG V, determinate cultivar) soybean seedlings that emerged on 10 April in day-lit growth chambers (39 °N lat.) were exposed to 8 ℃ for 48 h at VC, V 2, V 6, or V 9 stage. In the decreasing daylength experiment, 2 ̆ 7 Hutcheson 2 ̆ 7 seedlings that emerged on 15 July were exposed to 8 ℃ for 48 h at VE, VC, V 6, or V 11 stage. The magnitudes of the changes in daylength were the same for the two experiments, but the direction of the change was opposite. All plants were kept at a 14 h thermoperiod of 28 / 23 ℃ except during <b>cold</b> <b>treatments.</b> The <b>cold</b> <b>treatments</b> in decreasing daylength conditions delayed R 1 and R 2 stages by 2 to 3 d. The <b>cold</b> <b>treatments</b> imposed at VC, V 2, and V 9 stages in increasing daylength conditions, however, delayed the R 1 stage by 11, 7, and 5 d, respectively. The <b>cold</b> <b>treatments</b> delayed V stages, while final height and biomass in the coldtreated plants reached the same or exceeded that of the control plants due to prolonged duration of vegetative growth. Our results indicate that delays in developmental stages were greater when cold temperatures occurred during earlier vegetative stages than during later stages and in increasing than in decreasing daylengths.

Methods: Eight genotypes of wild almond were subjected to two different <b>cold</b> <b>treatments.</b> The enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant responses and the levels of some reactive oxygen species in leaves were measured.

During four consecutive years, three field (1991 / 92, 1992 / 93 and 1993 / 94) and one growth chamber (1994 / 95) trials were layer out with three digging dates (middle of October, beginning and middle of November) and three <b>cold</b> storage <b>treatments</b> at 2 #+-# 1 deg C (0, 2 and 4 weeks). vegetative and flowering responses to digging dates and <b>cold</b> storage <b>treatments</b> varied between years and cultivars. The highest productivity of both cultivars was obtained with the 3 "r"d digging date with no <b>cold</b> storage <b>treatment.</b> However, in 199394, when the plants had received a greater number of chilling hours in the nursery, chilling had an inhibitory effect on flower production of "Chandler" dug on the latest date, resulting in reduced fruit yield and increased vegetative vigor. "Douglas" had a relatively high chilling requirement compared to "Chandler" and did not respond to early chilling. Increased field chilling promoted higher leaf and stolen numbers and greater leaf area in both cultivars, and also higher crown number in "Chandler" and petiole length in "Douglas". Additional <b>cold</b> storage <b>treatments</b> stimulated vegetative development and decreased flower and inflorescence number. However, in 199192, when the plants received less number of chilling hours in the nursery, <b>cold</b> storage <b>treatment</b> in early digging dates increased plant productivity.
