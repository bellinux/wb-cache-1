40|$|Background: In {{addition}} {{to the effectiveness of}} hospital care models for terminal patients, policy makers and health care payers are concerned about their costs. This study aims to measure the hospital costs of treating terminal patients in Belgium from the health care payer perspective. Also, this study compares the costs of palliative and usual <b>care</b> <b>in</b> different types of hospital wards. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study compared costs of palliative care with usual <b>care</b> <b>in</b> acute hospital wards and with <b>care</b> <b>in</b> palliative <b>care</b> units. The study enrolled terminal patients from a representative sample of hospitals. Health care costs included fixed hospital costs and charges relating to medical fees, pharmacy and other charges. Data sources consisted of hospital accountancy data and invoice data. Results: Six hospitals participated in the study, generating a total of 146 patients. The findings showed that palliative <b>care</b> <b>in</b> a palliative <b>care</b> unit was more expensive than palliative <b>care</b> <b>in</b> an acute ward due to higher staffing levels <b>in</b> palliative <b>care</b> units. Palliative <b>care</b> <b>in</b> an acute ward is cheaper than usual <b>care</b> <b>in</b> an acute ward. Conclusions: This study suggests that palliative <b>care</b> models <b>in</b> acute wards need to be supported because such care models appear to be less expensive than usual care and because such care models are likely to better reflect the needs of terminal patients. This finding emphasizes the importance of the timely recognition of the need for palliative <b>care</b> <b>in</b> terminal patients treated in acute wards...|$|R

Historical developments <b>in</b> pastoral <b>care</b> are well-documented. However, pastoral <b>care</b> <b>in</b> Africa has a short and unsystematically documented history. Scholarly discussions on pastoral care concerning the continent tend to be considered under African theological frameworks. Notwithstanding the already existing weaknesses in African theological discussion, pastoral <b>care</b> <b>in</b> Africa has remained fragmented with diverse and seemingly knee-jerk approaches in guiding individuals who provide pastoral <b>care.</b> <b>In</b> view of this, this article firstly aims to provide a broad overview and initiate a discussion on the current challenges <b>in</b> pastoral <b>care</b> <b>in</b> Africa.
