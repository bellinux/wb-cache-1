40|$|The <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> family <b>allowances</b> (abono de família) in 1942 was an {{innovative}} policy decision in Portugal, that {{became one of}} the few countries with this kind of social protection by the mid of 20 th century. In Europe this kind of social benefit has been created few years before in Belgium (1930), France (1932), Spain (1938) and The Netherlands (1939). After this creation, this family allowance became integrated in the social security system (previdência social) created in 1935, supported by the Estatuto de Trabalho Nacional (an important ideological piece of the political regime) and following a bismarckian orientation. Looking at the international context, this policy decision was well integrated in the of the process <b>of</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> welfare states in Europe, where Portugal was still in a late progress. This is therefore a source of motivation for this research. If we compare to Portugal, this kind of benefit was introduced later in the most progressive social security systems in Europe (Denmark in 1950; Germany in 1954). The innovative character of this policy decision then contrasts the late development of social security in Portugal. On the other hand, the public defence of this policy measure was made claiming it for a wage complement (what is in accordance to the corporative doctrine of family wage), instead <b>of</b> a social <b>allowance</b> as it was implemented in other European countries. This paper intends to analyse the historical origins <b>of</b> this family <b>allowance</b> in Portugal and to understand the innovative character <b>of</b> its <b>creation</b> in light <b>of</b> the doctrinal orientation of the regime and of the social progress evident in the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the welfare states in Europe, in a preliminary country comparative basis.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aims {{to provide}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} account receivables creating a group of accounting relations together with the liabilities. The thesis discusses the account receivables only {{from the point of}} view of the accountancy and the law, not the taxes. The basic terminology followed by the characterisation of the account receivables is defined in the theoretical part. It also includes the possibilities of the account receivables emergence and dissolution as well as the collection method. Account receivables valuation is described with regard to two steps: account receivables valuation at the date of the case and at the balance sheet day, which is directly linked to the account receivables inventory including allowances for bad debts and the write-offs. In the final part of the theory, the various means of the account receivables securitization are presented. In the practical part of the thesis, the accounting entities are divided with respect to four categories (micro, small, central and large accounting entities) and in the context of the audit duties. As far as the selection of the entities is concerned, they have been chosen from the construction sector.
