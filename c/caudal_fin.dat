5|$|The <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> is homocercal, {{meaning the}} upper and lower lobes are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, the base of the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin,</b> {{distinguishing}} this group from those in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin,</b> such as most fish from the Paleozoic (541 to 252 million years ago). The neural arches are elongated to form uroneurals which provide support for this upper lobe. In addition, the hypurals, bones that form a flattened plate at the posterior end of the vertebral column, are enlarged providing further support for the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are short}} and angular, while the pelvic fins {{are long and}} relatively large. The dorsal fins are small, with the first dorsal fin origin lying behind the pelvic fin origins. There is no anal fin. The caudal peduncle is robust and lacks notches at the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> origins. The asymmetrical <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|The fins are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the dorsal fins, pelvic fins, and lower <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe. The pectoral fins are narrow and pointed. The first dorsal fin is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin. The dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> origin. The asymmetrical <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey or bronze above, often with small white spots on the sides, and pale below. The dorsal fins are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second dorsal as the remainder of fin is mostly dark.|$|E
50|$|The {{body color}} is pale brown, blotched or mottled with darker brown. The ventral and anal fins are dark, the dorsal and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins</b> are lighter. Juveniles {{show a light}} streak {{on each side of}} the snout, and cross-bars on the dorsal, anal, and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins.</b>|$|R

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{positioned}} well {{back on the}} body, closer to the pelvic than the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are large, about half to three-quarters {{as high as the}} first dorsal fin. The broad, triangular pectoral fins originate at or slightly before the level of the fifth gill slit. There is no ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The lower lobe of the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> is half the length of the upper, which has a strong notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, usually with 7 horizontal ridges, giving the skin a smooth feel. The coloration is grayish to brownish above and white below, with a pattern of scattered small, dark spots unique to each individual. The tips of the first dorsal fin and upper <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe, and sometimes also the second dorsal fin and lower <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe, are bright white.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are long}} and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; there are both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) at the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> base, and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.|$|E
5|$|All of the fins, {{particularly}} the narrow pectoral fins, are falcate (sickle-shaped) to some degree. The medium-sized first dorsal fin originates {{just behind the}} pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first, {{and there is no}} midline ridge running between them. The pelvic fins are broad and slightly larger than the anal fin. The anal fin has a strong notch in the trailing margin and is positioned slightly behind the second dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the upper origin of the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin.</b> The asymmetrical <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> has a well-developed lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The prominent lateral line curves downward below the second dorsal fin. The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles; each bears five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey to bronze above, darkening at the tips of the second dorsal fin and upper <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe (though this may be indistinct in larger sharks), and pale below. The underside is off-white, and the first dorsal fin has a pale trailing margin.|$|E

5000|$|Angel sharks have unique tails among sharks. Their <b>caudal</b> <b>fins</b> are reverse heterocercal, {{with the}} lower lobe larger than the upper.|$|R
50|$|Shark fins used in {{the soup}} are the {{cartilaginous}} dorsal, pectoral and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins.</b> Fins are sometimes harvested by {{a process known as}} shark finning. The person harvesting the fins often leaves the shark to die in the ocean after having cut the fins off. Overfishing poses a major threat to the world's shark populations.|$|R
5|$|Most of the fins {{are fairly}} narrow; in adults the {{pectoral}} fins are broad and roughly triangular. The moderately tall first dorsal fin is placed about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins, and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near the apex. The second dorsal fin is about three-quarters {{as high as the}} first and larger than the anal fin. The <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> has a well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe; in young sharks the lower <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe is much less distinct. This species is gray above, with darker saddles and scattered black spots that fade with age; the underside is off-white.|$|E
5|$|The body is deepest {{in front}} of the two tall and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is about a third larger than the second and {{originates}} over the pelvic fin origins. The second dorsal fin is located midway between the first dorsal and the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin.</b> The broad and triangular pectoral fins have a deep indentation where their leading margins meet the head. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, and the anal fin is absent. The tail is much longer than the body and ends in a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin; the lower <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe is more than half the length of the upper.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is positioned just behind the pectoral fin bases. The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> origin. The asymmetrical <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
50|$|The {{base body}} color is olive-grey on the back, marbled with brown, and {{white on the}} underside. The dorsal and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins</b> have round brown spots.|$|R
50|$|The {{body color}} is brown, with large, darker round spots. Smaller spots {{appear on the}} ventral, anal, and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins.</b> Large spots appear on the dorsal fin.|$|R
50|$|Growing to {{a maximum}} length of about 28 cm TL, it is yellow with dark spots and {{irregular}} crossbars. Its dorsal and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins</b> may occasionally also be spotted.|$|R
5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins originate {{below the}} third or fourth gill slits, and are no longer than the front margin of the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is about twice as long as the second dorsal fin and preceded by long ridges. The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second dorsal fin originates over the last third of the anal fin base. The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The leading edge of the first dorsal fin and the trailing edge of the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> may be dark, and the trailing edges of the pectoral fins may be light.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is large and}} triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave {{trailing}} margin; it originates roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin {{is less than a}} third as high as the first, and originates ahead of the anal fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow and pointed at the tips. The anal fin has a sharply notched trailing margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> origin. The <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near its tip.|$|E
5|$|The long, falcate (sickle-shaped) {{pectoral}} fins taper to narrowly pointed tips. The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} positioned slightly closer to the pectoral fins than the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins are almost {{as large as the}} first dorsal fin and bear long, thin claspers in males. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny, with the former positioned ahead of the latter. There are crescent-shaped notches on the caudal peduncle at the upper and lower origins of the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin.</b> The upper <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe is enormously elongated as is characteristic of threshers, measuring about as long {{as the rest of the}} shark; the thin, gently curving lobe is held at a steep upward angle and has a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
50|$|This species {{differs from}} the five other species in the genus in having at least 53 anal rays, 81 to 86 dorsal fin spines, and more rounded, deeper <b>caudal</b> <b>fins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The genus name Noturus, meaning [...] "back tail", {{refers to}} the fusion of the adipose and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins.</b> The {{specific}} epithet flavus meaning [...] "yellow", {{refers to the}} color distinction.|$|R
50|$|The stripetail darter {{males are}} golden orange and as adults can {{grow up to}} 2.8 in long. It also has black bands present on the <b>caudal</b> <b>fins</b> and soft dorsal fins.|$|R
5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin.</b> The <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins {{are roughly}} equal {{in size and}} placed far back on the body: the first {{originates}} behind {{the midpoint of the}} pelvic fin bases and the second behind the midpoint of the anal fin base. The pectoral fins are large, while the pelvic fins are small and low, with angular margins. The anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin; its base measures 13–18% of the total length and greatly exceeds the distance between the pelvic and anal fins, or between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed, {{with the end of the}} anal fin very close to the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin.</b> The <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> comprises around a quarter of the total length; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is very thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles, resembling saw teeth, along the upper edge of the <b>caudal</b> <b>fin.</b> The body is grayish-brown above, with 15–18 dark, rounded saddles, blotches, and/or spots that run onto the tail; each marking is highlighted by a paler border. The underside is white, as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins. The inside of the mouth is black.|$|E
5|$|The large {{pectoral}} fins measure around one-fifth {{as long as}} the body, {{and have}} a falcate (sickle-like) shape tapering to a point. The first dorsal fin is of moderate size and somewhat falcate, with a pointed apex and a strongly concave rear margin; its origin lies over the pectoral fin free rear tips. The second dorsal fin is much smaller and is positioned about opposite the anal fin. A low dorsal ridge is present between the dorsal fins. The <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> is large and high, with a well-developed lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped and closely set, each bearing five horizontal ridges leading to teeth on the posterior margin. This species is bronzy to bluish gray above and white below, which extends onto the flanks as a faint lighter stripe. The fins, particularly the underside of the pectoral fins and the lower <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe) darken towards the tips; this is more obvious in juveniles.|$|E
50|$|European perch are greenish {{with red}} pelvic, anal and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins.</b> They have {{five to eight}} dark {{vertical}} bars on their sides. When the perch grow larger, a hump grows between its head and dorsal fin.|$|R
40|$|Two {{new species}} of the hypostomine genus Baryancistrus are {{described}} from the rio Xingu drainage. Baryancistrus xanthellus is distinguished from all other Baryancistrus species {{by the presence of}} yellow spots along the entire body and conspicuous yellow marks on distal tip of dorsal and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins.</b> Baryancistrus chrysolomus is distinguished from its congeners by its uniform dark body coloration and presence of yellow bands on dorsal and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins.</b> Despite the lack of formal description, these species are very popular in the international aquarium trade. We expect that these formal descriptions might contribute to the improvement of Brazilian regulations in the international trade of ornamental loricariids...|$|R
50|$|Tor sinensis {{grows to}} 46.5 cm in {{standard}} length. Juveniles are silvery, but adults and subadults have a deep, dark midlateral stripe. The body is darkish above and brownish beneath. Pectoral, pelvic, and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins</b> are deep red.|$|R
5|$|In the South Atlantic Bight, {{both sexes}} mature at a fork length (from snout tip to <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> fork) of around , {{corresponding}} to ages of 4.3 years {{for males and}} 4.5 years for females. In the Gulf of Mexico, both sexes mature at a fork length of around , corresponding to ages of 5.4 years for males and 6.6 years for females. The maximum lifespan has been calculated as 19 years in South Atlantic Bight and 16.5 years in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Once {{placed in}} the family Triakidae, the whitetip reef shark is now {{recognized}} by most authors as belonging to the family Carcharhinidae {{on the basis of}} morphological characters, such as a full nictitating membrane, well-developed precaudal pit, strong lower <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lobe, and scroll-like intestinal valves. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest the whitetip reef shark is grouped with the lemon sharks (Negaprion) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and <b>caudal</b> <b>fin</b> lower lobe.|$|E
50|$|Adults of {{this species}} can grow up to a maximum size of up to 4 cm. They are white with a yellow blotch that extends from the eye to the {{pectoral}} fin. Its dorsal and <b>caudal</b> <b>fins</b> are yellow.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have the}} same {{coloration}} as adults, and can be quite large before undergoing metamorphosis. They have long, thick external gills, almond eyes, and tall <b>caudal</b> <b>fins.</b> Neoteny may occur in some individuals, but neotenic populations are not known.|$|R
50|$|These {{fish have}} short dorsal <b>fins.</b> The <b>caudal</b> <b>fins</b> are deeply forked. The eyes are large. Their bodies are scaleless, though rough, bony plates {{are located on}} the tops of their heads. These fish have four pairs of barbels.|$|R
