The researchers used the Statistical Product and Service Solution (SPSS), Windows version 12. 0. as a tool to calculate the data. Results have shown that quality of friendship based on face to face <b>communication</b> (<b>mean</b> score = 171, 5165) has higher score than quality offriendship based on mediated <b>communication</b> (<b>mean</b> score = 160, 0989), t = 7, 055, p = 0, 000 (p < 0, 010) ...|$|R
