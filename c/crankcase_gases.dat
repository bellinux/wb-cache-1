25|$|In 1989 Land Rover had {{launched}} the Discovery its Range Rover-based family 4×4 that quickly became Europe's top-selling 4×4. One {{of the key}} reasons for its success was its ground-breaking turbodiesel engine. The 200Tdi {{was one of the}} first mass-produced small-capacity (i.e., not a lorry engine) direct-injection diesels, with the attendant improvements in power and efficiency that system brings. Developed under the codename Gemini, the 200Tdi was planned from the start to be used on all Land Rover's products. For production reasons, it had to be machined on the existing machinery, so used the same block and crankshaft as the existing 2.5-litre diesel engines. It also used many ancillary parts used on the older engines. However, it was a true break with the past. An aluminium alloy cylinder head reduced weight and noise, a new Bosch injection system gave improved running characteristics and better starting performance. An intercooler boosted power and efficiency further. Lessons learnt from the Diesel Turbo were included, such as the fitment of an inertial separator in the breather system to remove oil before <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases</b> were returned to the air intake. Initially turbocharged and naturally aspirated diesel versions and a carburettor-fed petrol version were to be produced. The direct-injection system meant that only machining of the injector sockets was needed to allow the fitment of spark plugs. However, the performance and economy of the turbodiesel version was such that the other variants were not produced. The 200Tdi was launched in the Discovery in 1989. It was then fitted to the utility Land Rover (renamed the Defender) in late 1990. For this application the engine was slightly de-tuned and, whilst in the Discovery the 200Tdi used all-new components, packaging restraints in the Defender meant that the 200Tdi in this role shared many exterior parts (such as the timing belt system and case) with the Diesel Turbo. Most obviously the turbocharger was retained in the Diesel Turbo's high mounting position on top of the manifolds in the Defender, rather than being tucked under the manifolds in the original Discovery version. In 1992 the engine was fitted to the Range Rover. Although the older petrol and naturally aspirated diesel units were theoretically still available, the 200Tdi had better performance and economy than any of them, and so dominated the sales figures. It is still highly regarded by Land Rover enthusiasts and has established itself as a powerful and long-lived unit that with proper maintenance can exceed 300,000 miles of use. The engine's commonality with the older models makes it a popular choice for installation in older Land Rovers. This is done both in original form or with the turbo removed (when the engine becomes known to enthusiasts as a 200Di) in order to keep the power/torque output within the limits of a Series Land Rover's gearbox and for greater ease of conversion. The turbocharged version may also be installed with or without the intercooler.|$|E

50|$|Uniquely among flat engines a boxer twin {{suffers from}} {{differences}} in crankcase pressures as the pistons alternately compress {{and expand the}} <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases.</b> This issue is usually addressed {{by means of a}} crankcase breather, as in the BMW R90S. This crankcase pumping effect is also found on singles and 360° parallel twins. Crankcase pressure differentials have scope for providing a form of supercharging, but while such an innovation has yet to be used on a production engine, it has been used to aid lubrication.|$|E
50|$|In {{automotive}} parlance, windage {{refers to}} parasitic {{drag on the}} crankshaft due to sump oil splashing on the cranktrain during rough driving, and/or dissipating energy in turbulence from the cranktrain moving the <b>crankcase</b> <b>gas</b> and oil mist at high RPM. Windage may also inhibit the migration of oil into the sump {{and back to the}} oil pump, creating lubrication problems. Some manufacturers and aftermarket vendors have developed special scrapers to remove excess oil from the counterweights and windage screens to create a barrier between the crankshaft and oil sump.|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} is {{presented}} statistical analysis {{of the effect of}} compression-ignition engine working time on the phenomenon of exhaust gas maximum pressure increase in crankcase and cylinder liner, pistons and rings wear. Characteristics of the crankcase maximum pressure variations were made for the start-up speed and for selected rotational speeds of the 359 compression-ignition engine crankshaft as well as micrometric measurements of the cylinder liner and pistons and rings wear. The engine was operated under normal traction conditions while pressure analyses and cylinder liner micrometric measurements were made, respectively, after an operational run of 204864 km. <b>Crankcase</b> exhaust <b>gas</b> maximum pressure measurements were made both with air vent open and closed for a cold (lubricating oil temperature of 285 K) and a warm engine (333 K). Basing on the analysis of obtained examination results, it was showed that <b>crankcase</b> exhaust <b>gas</b> maximum pressure measurement (also during the start-up) may be used for determination of engine run and life. Average and maximum wear and tear of cylinder liners, maximum wear and tear of pistons in the perpendicular plane to the piston pin axis, dependency of maximum crankcase pressure in the function of operational mileage of a 359 engine for lubricating oil temperature of 333 K, dependency of maximum crankcase pressure in the function of operational mileage for lubricating oil temperature of 285 K are presented...|$|R
5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no manifold vacuum, a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by manifold vacuum, restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, manifold vacuum is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high manifold vacuum, the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less manifold vacuum, the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little manifold vacuum is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of <b>crankcase</b> <b>gas</b> is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the crankcase breather, flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|R
50|$|Intake {{manifold}} vacuum {{is applied to}} the crankcase via the PCV valve, drawing fresh air into the crankcase via the breather. The airflow through the crankcase and engine interior sweeps away combustion byproduct gases, including a large amount of water vapour which includes dissolved chemical combustion byproducts. This mixture of air and <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases</b> then exits, often via another simple baffle, screen, or mesh to exclude oil droplets, through the PCV valve and into the intake manifold. On some PCV systems, this oil baffling takes place in a discrete replaceable part called the 'oil separator'.|$|E
50|$|The road draft tube, though simple, has shortcomings: it {{does not}} {{function}} when the vehicle is moving too slowly to create a draft, so postal and other slow-moving delivery vehicles tended to suffer rapid buildup of engine sludge due to poor crankcase ventilation. And non-road vehicles such as boats never generated a draft on the tube, no matter how fast they were going. The draft tube discharged the <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases,</b> composed largely of unburnt hydrocarbons, directly into the air. This created pollution as well as objectionable odors. Moreover, the draft tube could become clogged with snow or ice, in which case crankcase pressure would build and cause oil leaks and gasket failure.|$|E
50|$|Not all petrol engines have PCV valves. Dragsters {{sometimes}} use a scavenger {{system and}} venturi tube in the exhaust {{to draw out}} combustion gases and maintain {{a small amount of}} vacuum in the crankcase to prevent oil leaks on to the race track. Small two stroke engines use the crankcase to partially compress incoming air; all <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases</b> are thus burned in the regular flow of air and fuel through the engine. Many small four-stroke engines such as lawn mower engines and small gasoline generators, simply use a draft tube connected to the intake, between the air filter and carburetor, to route all blow by back into the intake mixture. The higher operating temperature of these small engines prevents large amounts of water vapor and light hydrocarbons from condensing in the engine oil.|$|E
50|$|The V12's new {{management}} system {{was designed by}} Nippon Denso. The top aluminium cover in the engine's valley was redesigned to house two packs of three coils each, with each coil having two high-tension terminals {{for a total of}} twelve. These coilpacks were driven by two Denso ignition modules, which are very similar to Ford EDIS-6 units. The crankshaft in the V12 was switched from a forging to a chill casting. A visibly significant chromed pipe connecting {{the left and the right}} banks of the V12 in the XJ40 platform (intended to vent and route the <b>crankcase</b> blow-by <b>gas</b> to the intake plenum) was changed with the introduction of the X300 to an almost invisible design at the top center of the engine underneath a plastic cover that also hides fuel rails and coilpacks.|$|R

Crankcase emissions are a complex mixture of combustion products and aerosol generated from lubrication oil. The crankcase emissions contribute substantially to the total particulate matter (PM) emitted from an engine. Environment legislation demands that either the combustion and crankcase emissions are combined to give a total measurement, or the <b>crankcase</b> <b>gases</b> are re-circulated back into the engine. There is a lack of understanding regarding the physical processes that generate crankcase aerosols, with a paucity of information on the size/mass concentrations of particles present in the crankcase. In this study the particulate matter crankcase emissions were measured from a fired and motored 4 cylinder compression ignition engine at a range of speeds and crankcase locations. A sequence of sampling equipment was used to characterise the emissions in the size range 5 nm - 19 μm; Cambustion DMS 500 fast particulate spectrometer, TSI Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), TSI™ Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) and, TSI™ Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS). The combination of the two test engines and range of sampling equipment provided new information on the generation and behavior of aerodynamic particulate matter within an engine crankcase. Data is presented for the effect of controlled parameter changes on number distributions over the measured particle size range. A complex lognormal bimodal size distribution of sub micron accumulation mode particles was present in the crankcase of both engines at a low idle speed of 900 rpm. At 1400 rpm this complex distribution was not present. Increasing the engine load, on the fired engine, initially reduced the particle number concentration with a final significant increase in particle number concentration at 75 % load. At 900 rpm 50 % load there was a single strong peak at 32 nm in the rocker cover however sampling from the push rod gallery and sump showed a strongly bimodal distribution with peaks at 32 nm and 133 nm. All other sampling data, from the fired engine, was consistent at each sampling location. The SMPS results, 15 - 665 nm, on the motored engine showed location dependency, with the highest number concentration of particles present in the push rod gallery...|$|E
