5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not very well known, and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and <b>charter</b> <b>hire</b> by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E
25|$|With {{the right}} {{connections}} at the Shipping Board, ships could be bought cheaply, which {{caused a lot}} of fraud. This system was too complicated for the oil companies however, so when World War II started, independents owned 39 percent of the world tanker fleet. This was especially because oil companies needed capital to invest in the growing oil market. By not buying the ships, but chartering, the bond rating of the oil companies was not affected, because the <b>charter</b> <b>hire</b> was not recognized as debt in that time. In 1934 H.T. Schierwater founded the International Tanker Owners’ Association — later International Association of Independent Tanker Owners or INTERTANKO — to protect the interests of these companies in a strongly fluctuating market.|$|E
50|$|Buses {{are often}} used for advertising, {{political}} campaigning, , public relations, or promotional purposes. These may {{take the form of}} temporary <b>charter</b> <b>hire</b> of service buses, or the temporary or permanent conversion and operation of buses, usually of second-hand buses. Extreme examples include converting the bus with displays and decorations or awnings and fittings. Interiors may be fitted out for exhibition or information purposes with special equipment and/or audio visual devices.|$|E

50|$|Charter bus {{operators}} may {{be completely}} independent businesses, or <b>charter</b> <b>hire</b> {{may be a}} subsidiary business of a public transport operator that might maintain a separate fleet or use surplus buses, coaches, and dual-purpose coach-seated buses. Many private taxicab companies also operate larger minibus vehicles to cater for group fares. Companies, private groups, and social clubs may hire buses or coaches as a cost-effective method of transporting a group to an event or site, such as a group meeting, racing event, or organised recreational activity such as a summer camp. Schools often hire charter bus services on regular basis for transportation of children to and from their homes. Chartered buses are also used by education institutes for transport to conventions, exhibitions, and field trips. Entertainment or event companies may also hire temporary shuttles buses for transport at events such as festivals or conferences. Party buses are used by companies {{in a similar manner}} to limousine hire, for luxury private transport to social events or as a touring experience. Sleeper buses are used by bands or other organisations that tour between entertainment venues and require mobile rest and recreation facilities. Some couples hire preserved buses for their wedding transport, instead of the traditional car. Buses are often hired for parades or processions. Victory parades are often held for triumphant sports teams, who often tour their home town or city in an open-top bus. Sports teams may also contract out their transport to a team bus, for travel to away games, to a competition or to a final event. These buses are often specially decorated in a livery matching the team colours. Private companies often contract out private shuttle bus services, for transport of their customers or patrons, such as hotels, amusement parks, university campuses, or private airport transfer services. This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from parking lots. High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for executive or VIP transport. Charter buses may also be used in tourism and for promotion (See Tourism and Promotion sections).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes new {{equations}} {{to calculate}} shipping costs and slot distribution when {{working in a}} shipping alliance environment. The fixed costs and capacity are shared by a predetermined ration of contributed containerships for the jointly-operated service route. The exchange rate of slot-exchange pattern depends on the relative ration of both round-voyage sailing days. Each contributing shipping company needs to estimate and account for the voyage fixed costs of each component serviced route in the agreement. This paper also simulates the effects that bunker cost and vessel hire changes have on shipping costs. The examination indicated the fixed costs are US$ 424 per TEU in 2010, with 63. 1 % attributable to bunker costs and 24. 04 % to containership costs. The validation shows the peak of <b>charter</b> <b>hire</b> in 2006, the fixed costs were estimated US$ 637 per TEU, with 63. 92 % attributable to containership costs and 27. 53 % attributable to bunker costs. (for ship of a capacity of 1, 100 TEUs and 28 round trip days). The results proof the proposed equations can represent cost and are helpful for container carriers to maintain market competition...|$|E
50|$|The freight market {{consists}} of shipowners, charterers and brokers. They use {{four types of}} contractual arrangements: the voyage charter, the contract of affreightment, the time charter and the bareboat charter. Shipowners contract to carry cargo for an agreed price per tonne while the <b>charter</b> market <b>hires</b> out ships for a certain period. A charter is legally agreed upon in a charter-party in which {{the terms of the}} deal are clearly set out.|$|R

5000|$|In June 2015, Good Will-Hinckley, a {{charitable}} organization for at-risk youths that runs two <b>charter</b> schools, <b>hired</b> Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves {{to be their}} next president. LePage, however, threatened to withhold $500,000 of state funding for the school if they hired Eves, due to his voting record against charter schools in Maine. LePage's choice to do so was labeled as [...] "blackmail" [...] as well as [...] "political interference". The incident was subject to a federal investigation but no charges were issued. Some Democrats in the Legislature launched an effort to impeach LePage over this and other matters on January 14, 2016, but the effort was indefinitely postponed, effectively killing it, on a 96-52 vote.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 Benton, {{while still}} {{serving in the}} Senate, was {{selected}} as director of environmental services for Clark County. His appointment was controversial as it bypassed standard civil service hiring procedures and Benton had no previous experience in environmental services. Editorials in The Columbian, The Olympian, and The Seattle Times questioned Benton's qualifications and the county was sued for unfair hiring practices by the department's interim director, who claimed she had been denied the opportunity {{to apply for the}} position. By November of that year Benton, himself, threatened a suit. His attorney contacted Ed Barnes - a Clark County union activist who had declared Benton unqualified for the job during public comment periods at county commission meetings - claiming defamation, though some legal experts questioned whether Benton, as a public figure, could file such a suit. In the midst of the conflagration, county commissioner David Madore - who had voted for Benton's appointment - declared the hiring was an [...] "accident." [...] The following year, {{partly as a result of}} the controversy that engulfed Benton's appointment, Clark County convened a council of freeholders to rewrite the county's charter. Benton's position at Clark County was eliminated when the Department of Environmental Services was dissolved in July 2016. The move to dissolve the department was, ironically, met with criticism and cries of politics at its worst by alt-right Councilor David Madore. After the implementation of the County <b>Charter,</b> <b>hiring</b> and firing decisions for department heads was shifted to the executive County Manager. Benton filed a tort claim, a state requirement before filing suit against the county, in October 2016 [...] seeking 2 million dollars from Clark County for wrongful termination.|$|R
50|$|To charter a sailboat, {{one must}} usually {{be able to}} {{demonstrate}} boat handling skills especially in operating the boat under power, docking, and anchoring. Typical sizes for bareboats come {{in the range of}} 30 ft to usually about 60 ft at the upper end. Most charter operators require a sailing resume listing sailing experience, boats that one has sailed and operated, and navigation and racing experience. If the charter operator is not satisfied that one has the appropriate experience, they will often require that the <b>chartering</b> party <b>hire</b> a captain from the charter company to sail with them for a few days.In most traditional charter destinations such as Greece or Croatia the chartering company would ask for a license of skipper in order to charter bareboat yachts.|$|R
25|$|Leisure {{boats are}} aimed mainly at the tourist market; {{as they do}} not usually provide rush hour services, they are not {{normally}} suitable for commuting. Some boat companies run regular scheduled services, others may run twice daily, only on certain days of the week, or only during certain months of the year. Boats may also be <b>chartered</b> for private <b>hire.</b> Destinations are often tourist attractions such as the Tate Galleries or Hampton Court Palace.|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} {{published}} {{a guide for}} each of the two types of contract between merchant and shipowner: Time Charters and Voyage Charters. In a Voyage <b>Charter,</b> the charterer <b>hires</b> the vessel for a single voyage, while the vessel’s owner provides the master, crew, bunkers and supplies. In a Time Charter, the vessel is hired for a specific amount of time. The vessel’s owner still manages the vessel but the charterer directs the vessel’s operation, and may sub-charter the vessel.|$|R
5000|$|In 1891, John Askew Smith, {{previously}} of Reidsville, North Carolina, {{moved with}} his wife Fannie and brother-in-law, John A. Pinchback, to Gaston County. Smith purchased 1700 acre and wanted to establish a town {{to the east of}} Whetstone Mountain. By 1893, Smith and other residents petitioned the North Carolina legislature to incorporate the town. On March 6, 1893, Bessemer City was officially <b>chartered.</b> Smith <b>hired</b> W.R. Richardson, an engineer from Guilford County, to lay out the town. In 1896 Smith built the first luxurious home in the area he named [...] "Long View" [...] where he lived {{with his wife}} for nearly 20 years.

50|$|Due {{to various}} {{economic}} constraints, canoe diving has recently gained popularity along the Gold Coast of Florida where many dive sites {{are less than}} three kilometers from shore. It is appealing to many individuals because it is relatively inexpensive and adventurous. Traditionally, a charter service is used to access offshore dive sites which can be very costly. While some may enjoy the luxury and safety of a <b>hired</b> <b>charter</b> boat, captain, and crew, others seek the challenge and thrill of navigating a canoe loaded with cumbersome scuba equipment on the open ocean.|$|R
50|$|A voyage <b>charter</b> is the <b>hiring</b> of {{a vessel}} and crew for a voyage between a load port and a {{discharge}} port. The charterer pays the vessel owner on a per-ton or lump-sum basis. The owner pays the port costs (excluding stevedoring), fuel costs and crew costs. The {{payment for the}} use of the vessel is known as freight. A voyage charter specifies a period, known as laytime, for loading and unloading the cargo. If laytime is exceeded, the charterer must pay demurrage. If laytime is saved, the charter party may require the shipowner to pay despatch to the charterer.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2009, Tasair was speculated to be {{involved}} in <b>charter</b> flights <b>hired</b> by a PR firm for Japan's 'Institute of Cetacean Research' whaling company to spy on anti-whaling vessels, an action later condemned by the Australian Government and deemed illegal under a 2008 Australian Court order preventing any assistance to whaling operations. Tasair has declined to comment on whether its planes or staff were involved in the flights. Managing director George Ashwood says that kind of information is commercial in confidence. The incident caused the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) to start a national investigation into companies conducting flights over water. Tasair incurred hefty legal bills dealing with the CASA probe and another by the Environmental Defender's Office that included demands that documents be surrendered. CASA boss John McCormick told the Senate committee Tasair's air operator's certificate covered domestic operations in Australia and it was technically in breach of regulations if it travelled beyond 12 nautical miles but admitted there was confusion within the industry and resulted in no action taken against the air charter operator ...|$|R

Cloning entire humans, however, is prohibited by what are known as [...] "Sixth Day" [...] laws. Billionaire Michael Drucker, owner of cloning corporation Replacement Technologies, <b>hires</b> <b>charter</b> pilot Adam Gibson and partner Hank Morgan for a ski trip. Due to Drucker's prominence, the two must first undergo blood and eye tests to verify their aptitude. On the day of Drucker's arrival, Adam finds that his family dog Oliver has died, and Hank offers to fly Drucker instead to allow Adam time to have the pet cloned.

5000|$|A limited {{liability}} partnership (LLP) is a partnership in which some or all partners (depending on the jurisdiction) have limited liabilities. It therefore exhibits elements of partnerships and corporations. In an LLP, each partner is not responsible or liable for another partner's misconduct or negligence. This is an important difference from the traditional unlimited partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 (for the UK), in which each partner has joint and several liability. In an LLP, some partners have a form of {{limited liability}} {{similar to that of}} the shareholders of a corporation. In some countries, an LLP must also have at least one person known as a [...] "general partner" [...] who has unlimited liability of the company. Unlike corporate shareholders, the partners have the right to manage the business directly. In contrast, corporate shareholders have to elect a board of directors under the laws of various state charters. The board organizes itself (also under the laws of the various state <b>charters)</b> and <b>hires</b> corporate officers who then have as [...] "corporate" [...] individuals the legal responsibility to manage the corporation in the corporation's best interest. A LLP also contains a different level of tax liability from that of a corporation.|$|R
