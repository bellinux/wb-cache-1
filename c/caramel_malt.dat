40|$|Abstract Pilsner malt, one of {{the main}} {{ingredients}} for the production of beer, is made in a three-step production process which involves subsequent steeping, germination and kilning. Compared to pilsner malt, dark specialty malts are produced at higher temperatures. Depending on the applied drying procedure, dark specialty malts canbe further divided in colour, caramel and roasted malts. In that respect, colour malts are produced in a kiln at higher temperatures compared to pilsner malt, whereas caramel and roasted malts are manufactured in a roasting drum. The elevated temperatures applied during kilning and roasting intensify the non-enzymatic browning reactions, resulting in the formation of colour, flavour and antioxidant components. As the extent of these reactions is influenced by the reaction conditions, the presence and concentration of the previously mentioned compounds in dark specialtymalts depend on the applied processing parameters. When used for the production of beers, these malts can {{have a significant impact on}} the characteristics of the end product. In this research, the main objectives were to identify and characterise flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and to elucidate the influence of the applied processing parameters on the development of flavour, colour and antioxidant power in caramel malts. Moreover, the evolution of dark specialtymalt flavour components during wort boiling and the influence of these malts on the flavour stability of beer was studied. First, headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography and massspectrometry was used to characterise the volatile fraction of aqueous extracts and dry ground samples of different colour, caramel and roastedmalts. Following this procedure, more than 100 compounds could be identified including oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulphur containing heterocyclic components. Since caramel-like furanones and pyranones could only be extracted out of a dry matrix, an extraction technique was optimised to determine these components in dry ground malts. These results revealed that the malt type, and as a consequence the production process, had an important influence on the presence of components. In that respect, caramel-like flavour components such as maltol and furaneol proved to be present in the highest concentrations in caramel malts, whereas greatest amountsof the roasted-like pyrazines were found in roasted malts. In addition,no clear relationship between the malt colour and the concentration of flavour components could be established. Besides flavour components, malt characteristics such as moisture content, extract content and pH also mainly depended on the type of dark specialty malt. The influence of the time and temperature of the roasting process on the development of malt characteristics was studied during the production of <b>caramel</b> <b>malt.</b> This process comprises an initial saccharification step and a subsequent caramelisation step. During the first phase, the optimal formationof the reducing sugars, glucose and maltose, and free amino acids was closely related to the optimal temperatures of activity of the involved enzymes. As expected, it became clear that the time and temperature of the latter phase had an important influence on the evolution of several malt characteristics such as the moisture content, extract, pH, colour andreducing power. The development of important flavour components was highly influenced by the roasting temperature and the moisture content of the malt kernels. Moreover, the obtained results indicated that flavour development was not linked to the colour formation. The use of darkspecialty malts in the grist proved to have a significant impact on thecolour and the presence of flavour components in the sweet wort. Boiling, however, resulted in an increase of the wort colour and the TBA value, which depended on the used dark specialty malt type. Although a part of the flavour components present in the sweet wort evaporated during boiling, pyrazines proved to be present in a considerable amount in the boiled wort. Branched- 2 -alkenals, however, evaporated almost completely outof the wort, whereas β-damascenone accumulated. If unaltered during fermentation, these components can possibly contribute to the global beer flavour. In a last chapter, the influence of dark specialty malts on the beer flavour stability was studied. On the one hand, these results indicated no significant difference in global appreciation betweenboth fresh beers. On the other hand, a cocoa, caramel flavour was ascribed to the fresh <b>caramel</b> <b>malt</b> beer, whereas marzipan, bread-like flavours characterised the colour malt beer. After thermally forced ageing, caramel and fruity flavours decreased, whereas cardboard and ribes notes increased. The analytical results showed that the concentration of severalknown staling markers increased during ageing. However, few of these components were likely to contribute to the global flavour due to their high flavour thresholds. In conclusion, this work provides new insights in the presence of flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and the development of these compounds together with some important malt characteristics during the production process of caramel malts. Finally, a light was shed on the behaviour of dark specialty malts during the brewing process and their influence on the flavour stability of beer.
