40|$|Abstract—An {{efficient}} {{method is}} presented to model the tran-sient characteristics of distributed resistor-capacitor of ULSI multilevel interconnections on complex topography, in which the reformulation of the boundary-element method (BEM) and the Padè-via-Lanczos (PVL) algorithm associated with multilayer Green’s function can avoid the redundant works on both volume mesh and transient analysis associated with the finite-difference method. An adaptive multilayer Green’s function is adopted to investigate several cases that have revealed interesting physical mechanisms in charge transfer between conductors on multilayer topography. To improve the timing analysis efficiency of the finite-difference method, the dominant poles are obtained by introducing the PVL algorithm for model-order reduction.

The mesh is refined recursively at the <b>corners</b> (<b>contact</b> points).

For small droplets, this dependence is well approximated by a theoretical estimates obtained using multiscale expansion and matching technique in lubrication approximation, where the corner element size is used as a microscale parameter. For larger droplets, the shape is also dependent on grid refinement.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of machine components under loading {{is an integral}} part of railway engineering design. It results in a mechanical contact and associated stress distribution, which may be an initiation point for failure modes such as fatigue, fretting or wear. In this study the reflection of ultrasound is used to investigate how real engineering components contact. It is a non-intrusive technique preserving the mechanics of the contact. The concept is simple; an acoustic wave bounces back from an incomplete interface. The higher the contact load, the more conformal will be the contact and hence more of the wave will be transmitted. A spring model is used to determine maps of contact stiffness from contact ultrasonic reflection data. A calibration procedure is then used to determine the pressure. The technique has been used to study two railway engineering applications. The first was a wheel/rail contact. Measurements were taken using specimens cut from sections of wheel and rail.

Considering the limitations of previous designs, a new true triaxial loading device that provides mixed boundary conditions for a true triaxial apparatus (TTA) is introduced. This loading device consists of four sliding rigid plates and two flexible loading faces. The setup of the loading device together with the whole true triaxial system is described. Frictions between sliding plates and the soil membrane surfaces in the new loading device are examined. A three-dimensional finite element (FE) modelling study is carried out on the stress and strain distribution of a soil specimen subjected to loading from two different loading devices. It is found that stresses and strains of a soil specimen subjected to loading from the new sliding plates are far more uniform than those subjected to loading from nonsliding plates with preset gaps.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this work}} is to improve {{understanding}} of wheel/rail lubricating mechanisms and propose an approach {{for use in the}} future to evaluate new lubricants suitable for the wheel flange/rail gauge <b>corner</b> <b>contact.</b> This work is carried out in the framework of the European research program "Urban Track" (project no FP 6 - 31312). Previous works on wheel-rail contacts have highlighted the presence of a natural third body composed of detached particles from both the wheel and the rail. In the case of the active (i. e. where wheel-rail contact occurs) rail gauge corner and the wheel flange contact, this third body is quickly mixed with the active flange lubricant, resulting in a mixture that can be considered as the "real" lubricant of the contact. Tribological tests are performed on a reduced scale simulator in view to investigating the formation of such a mixture and its range of action. Its rheology "in situ" is studied as is the detachment of particles (from rail and wheel specimens). The test conditions reproduced were close to those found in wheel-rail contacts, i. e. high shearing and pressure conditions. The migration and transport of the lubricant by the wheel specimen are highlighted during these tests and a "pasty liquid" is quickly formed. It is assumed that this "liquid" is composed of detached particles mixed with the initial lubricant leading to the formation of a mixture whose flows allow the initialization of a smooth surface. The latter facilitates the actions of oil additives, leading to a low friction coefficient. This sequence may produce an "optimized" mixture formed in situ. This is coherent with analyses performed on site. Hence it is necessary to reconstitute a specific surface of the rail gauge corner, i. e. the right third body for lubrication...|$|E
40|$|Wheel/rail {{contact is}} {{critical}} to the successful operation of a railway network. Contact occurs at the wheel tread/rail head and wheel flange/rail gauge <b>corner.</b> <b>Contact</b> conditions are more severe in the latter, which occurs mainly at curves. The contact is small and supports large loads; therefore, high contact stresses are generated. These, combined with the slip in the contact, are primarily responsible for driving the processes that lead to wheel and rail damage, whether by deformation, wear or a fatigue process. Multi-body dynamics software is useful for predicting the wheel/rail contact characteristics; however, {{there is a shortage of}} experimental tools available. In this study, the feasibility of an approach based on an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel is investigated. The sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse which is designed to impinge on the wheel flange. If there is no contact the pulse is fully reflected back at the flange and picked up by the same sensor. If flange contact takes place, a proportion of the pulse amplitude will be transmitted into the rail. The signal reflected back to the sensor is therefore reduced. The amount by which this signal reduces indicates how much flange contact has occurred. This work had two aspects. First, a standard ultrasonic ray-tracing software package was used to establish what it is possible to measure with sensors mounted in the wheel and to determine the best location and orientation. The second aspect was an experimental study to determine whether such measurements are feasible. Test specimens were cut from sections of wheel and rail, and a 2 [*]MHz ultrasonic contact transducer was bonded onto the wheel in a position best suited to detect the flange contact. The specimens were pressed together in a bi-axial loading frame to generate differing degrees of rail head and flange contact. The reflected signal was monitored as the normal and lateral loads were varied. It proved possible not only to detect the onset of flanging, but also to record a signal that varied monotonically with both normal and lateral applied load. A map of reflected ultrasound against the applied loading is presented. The technology, while not currently suitable for full field implementation could be very useful in laboratory studies on, for example, a full-scale wheel/rail rig...|$|E
40|$|In {{the ideal}} case, noise {{measurements}} with four contacts minimize {{the contribution of}} the contact interface. There is a need to characterize conductance noise and noise correction factors for the different geometries provided with four contacts, as already is the case for resistivity measurements with van der Pauw structures. Here, we calculate the noise correction factors for two geometries with a pair of sensors and a pair of current driver electrodes placed in a square array. The first geometry investigated is a very large film compared to the distance L between four circular electrodes, which are placed in a square array far away from the borders of the film. The second is a square-shaped conductive film with side length L and provided with four quarter-circle <b>corner</b> <b>contacts</b> with radius l. The effect of the conductance noise in the film can be observed between current free sensors in a four-point measurement or between current carrying drivers in a two-point measurement. Our analytical expressions are based on approximations to solve the integrals (J·) 2 dA and |J| 4 dA for the voltage noise measured across a pair of sensors, SVQ, and across the drivers, SVD, respectively. The first and second integrands represent the squared dot product of the current density and adjoint current density and the modulus of the current density to the fourth power, respectively. The current density J in the samples is due to the current I passing through the driver contacts. The calculated expressions are applicable to samples with thickness tl 0. 1 L. Hence, the disturbances in the neighborhood of the sensors on J and of the drivers on are ignored. Noise correction factors for two- and four-point measurements are calculated for sensors on an equipotential (transversal noise) with the driver contacts on the diagonal of a square and for sensors next to each other {{on one side of the}} square with the drivers next to each other on the other side of the square (longitudinal noise). In all cases the noise between the sensors is smaller and less sensitive to the contact size 2 l/L than the noise between the drivers. The ratio SVQ/SVD becomes smaller with smaller contact radius l. Smaller sensors give a better suppression of interface noise at the contacts. But overly low 2 l/L values result in overly high resistance between the sensors and too strong a contribution of thermal noise at the sensors. Therefore, equations are derived to calculate the current level needed to observe 1 /f conductance fluctuations on top of the thermal noise. The results from the calculated analytical expressions show good agreement with experimental results obtained from the noise in carbon sheet resistance and numerical results. Transversal noise measurements on a square sample with <b>corner</b> <b>contacts</b> are recommended to characterize the 1 /f noise of the layer. This is due to the increased current densities in the sample compared to the open structure, which result in easier detection of the 1 /f on top of the thermal noise. © 2007 American Institute of Physic...|$|R

30|$|Manufacturing errors include {{short-term}} and long-term components. The short-term components mainly refer to profile deviation, helix deviation, {{as well as}} pitch deviation and tooth surface modification. Conry and Seireg [1] proposed an evaluation method of load distribution and optimal modifications for cylindrical gears based on flexibility analysis method and elastic contact theory. Kubo and Kiyono [2] investigated the effects {{of different kinds of}} tooth form errors on vibration of spur and helical gear system, and found that convex tooth form error leads to minimum vibration, but concave and waving tooth form error result in relatively stronger vibration. Later, Kubo et al. [3] investigated the relationship between tooth contact pattern and transmission error of gears having errors, and developed the fast calculation method through observing the actual tooth contact pattern. Umezawa et al. [4, 5] developed a torsional dynamic model of spur gear system and analyzed the effects of pressure angle error, normal pitch error, and waved form error on vibration of gear system. It is found that the influences of gear errors on system vibration are significant. Vedmar and Andersson [6] developed a dynamic contact model to investigate the dynamic contact characteristics and vibration of spur and helical gears. Mattar and Velex [7, 8] presented an analytical model for calculating mesh stiffness of cylindrical gear using length of contact line, and developed a dynamic contact model to investigate the effects of shape deviations on quasi-static and dynamic behaviors of narrow-faced helical gears. Matsumura et al. [9] developed a torsional dynamic model of helical gear system, and studied the gear errors on system vibration under lighter loading condition. The results showed that the partial contact loss due to gear errors in light loading condition has significant effect on system vibration. Munro et al. [10] presented an approximate formula of transmission error considering <b>corner</b> <b>contact</b> due to manufacturing and assembly errors. Ogawa et al. [11] performed the theoretical and experimental investigations about the dynamic behaviors of a spur gear pair having helix deviation. The results showed that helix deviation will result in decreased mesh stiffness and lead to lower resonance speed. Wei et al. [12] employed the finite element method to analyze the effects of five types of flank deviation on load distribution of helical gears, and found the superposition property of the influences of individual flank deviation on load distribution. Fernández-del-Rincón et al. [13, 14] used a global finite element model and a partial finite element model to develop the TVMS calculation model of spur gears based on flexibility analysis method, and investigated the effects of tooth profile deviation and support flexibility on the dynamic behaviors of spur gear system. Wang et al. [15] employed the thin slice theory and potential energy method to develop the TVMS and contact stress calculation method for helical gears having tooth profile errors. Li [16] developed a finite element method programs to investigate the influences of manufacturing errors, gear misalignment, as well as assembly errors and gear modifications on TVMS of a spur gear pair.

40|$|Wear of {{railroad}} rolling stock and rails costs {{millions of dollars}} annually in all rail systems throughout the world. The rail industry has attempted to address flange wear using rail curve lubricants and presently {{use a variety of}} lubricants and lubricant applicators. The choice of lubricant and applicator is currently based on considerations that do not address the wear problem directly. This research quantified rail curve lubricant performance through laboratory simulation. The effects of lubricants in the wheel/rail contact were investigated. Rail curve lubricant performance was measured with a laboratory rail/wheel simulator for the purpose of optimising the choice of lubricant. New methods for measurement of rail curve lubricant performance have been presented. These performance measurements are total absorbed energy, the energy absorbed in the lubricant film instead of being utilised for wear processes; total distance slid, the sliding distance or accumulated strain achieved prior to development of a set tractive force limit; half life of lubricant, the time taken for a lubricant to lose half of its sliding performance; and apparent viscosity, a measure of the lubricity presented with respect to accumulated strain. The rail/wheel simulator used in this research consists of two dissimilar wheels (disks) rotating in contact with one another simulating a conformal gauge <b>corner</b> <b>contact.</b> The first wheel, a simulated rail, is driven by an electric motor which then drives the second wheel, a simulated railroad wheel, through the contact. Hydraulic braking on the railroad wheel is used to simulate the rolling/sliding conditions. The variables of the simulated contact that are controlled with this equipment are normal force, input wheel speed, slip ratio between samples, sample geometries and material properties, and lubricant types. Rail curve lubricants were laboratory tested to define their properties using the ASTM and other appropriate standards. The performance differences measured using ASTM standards based tests were susceptible to repeatability problems and did not represent the contact as accurately as the rail/wheel simulator. This laboratory simulator was used to gather data in lubricated and unlubricated conditions for the purpose of providing lubricant performance measurements. These measurements were presented and the tested lubricants were ranked conclusively using three industrially relevant performance criteria. Total sliding distance and total absorbed energy measurements of the rail curve lubricants displayed clear differences in lubricant performance for both of these criteria. Total sliding distance is equivalent to the number of axles in the field situation, while total absorbed energy is the energy unavailable for wear processes of rails and wheels. Lubricants designed using these measurements will increase lubricant performance with respect to these performance criteria which in turn will reduce wear to both rails and wheels. Measurement of the apparent viscosity of rail curve lubricants, using the rail/wheel simulator, displayed changes in rheological characteristics with respect to accumulated strain. Apparent viscosity {{is a measure of the}} shear stress transmitted from the wheels to the rails. Designing a rail curve lubricant after analysing measurements taken from the rail/wheel simulator will assist in identifying lubricant properties to reduce the wear producing shear stresses generated in a rail wheel contact. Decay of lubricant performance was measured for three different rail curve lubricants under simulated conditions. The research found appreciable and quantifiable differences between lubricants. Industrial application of the findings will improve positioning of lubrication systems, improve choice of lubricants and predict effective lubrication distance from the lubricant application point. Using the new methods of lubricant performance measurement developed in this thesis, the objective of this research, to quantify rail curve lubricant performance through laboratory simulation, has been achieved...|$|E

They were broken because of the cracking of PZT at the stress concentrations area. For arch Bridge, the maximum tensile stress increases with thickness of metal cap but decrease with modulus, and maximum shear stress decreases first and increases later with increasing thickness and modulus of metal cap. In laboratory test, its cracking area is shifted from edge to inner <b>corner</b> of <b>contact</b> area between cap and PZT disk with increasing thickness of metal cap. The electric potential generated by arch Bridge decreased with increasing thickness and modulus of metal cap. Under the load of 0. 7 MPa, the electric potential is about 286 V for an arch Bridge transducer with 0. 4 mm thickness of stainless steel cap, and its storage electric energy is 0. 6 mJ. The designed arch Bridge transducer is suggested as the optimum one for harvesting energy from asphalt pavement...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{methodology for}} dynamic description of rigid multibody systems with translational clearance joints is presented and {{discussed in this}} work. Over the last years, extensive {{work has been done}} to study the dynamic effect of the revolute joints with clearance in multibody systems, in contrast with the little work devoted to model translational joints with clearance. In a joint with translation clearance there are many possible ways to set the physical configuration between the slider and guide, namely: (1) no contact between the two elements, (2) one corner of the slider in contact with the guide surface, (3) two adjacent slider <b>corners</b> in <b>contact</b> with the guide surface, (4) two opposite slider <b>corners</b> in <b>contact</b> with the guide surfaces. The conditions for switching from one case to another depend on the system dynamics configuration. The proposed methodology takes into account these four different situations. The existence of a clearance in a translational joint removes two kinematic constraints from a planar system and introduces two extra degrees of freedom in the system. Thus, a translational clearance joint does not constrain any degree of freedom of the mechanical system but it imposes some restrictions on the slider motion inside the guide limits. When the slider reaches the guide surfaces an impact occurs and the dynamic response of the joint is controlled by contact-impact forces. These forces are evaluated here with continuous contact force law together with a dissipative friction force model. The contact-impact forces are introduced into the system’s equations of motion as external generalized forces. The proposed methodology is applied to a planar multibody mechanical system with a translational clearance joint in order to demonstrate its features.
