50|$|A longstanding {{argument}} {{exists between}} proponents {{of these two}} technologies.

An array of evacuated tubes on a roof has open space between the <b>collector</b> <b>tubes,</b> and vacuum between the two concentric glass <b>tubes</b> of each <b>collector.</b> <b>Collector</b> <b>tubes</b> cover only a fraction of a unit area of a roof. If evacuated tubes are compared with flat-plate collectors on the basis of area of roof occupied, a different conclusion might be reached than if the areas of absorber were compared. In addition, the ISO 9806 standard is ambiguous in describing {{the way in which the}} efficiency of solar thermal collectors should be measured, since these could be measured either in terms of gross area or in terms of absorber area. Unfortunately, power output is not given for thermal collectors as it is for PV panels. This makes it difficult for purchasers and engineers to make informed decisions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{eco-friendly}} and non-polluting {{solar energy}} {{can be used}} for direct conversion into electricity by photovoltaic conversion and into thermal energy by using Flat Plate Collectors (FPC) or Evacuated <b>Tube</b> <b>Collectors</b> (ETC). Evacuated <b>Tube</b> <b>Collectors</b> are more efficient compared to Flat Plate Collectors as the former eliminates the convective heat losses. This paper discusses design calculations involved in the development of an Energy Efficient Solar Thermal System for generating steam at atmospheric pressure. This finds applications such as Steam cooking, laundry etc. It includes calculation of collector area and number of evacuated tubes required. It also reports comparison of its performance with the conventionally used steam boilers in terms of fuel usage and carbon emissions. With less heat loss through the vacuum air layer in the evacuated tubes, these systems are more efficient at lower ambient air temperatures. Compared to flat plate <b>collectors,</b> evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors</b> are less expensive. Require a smaller roof area than comparable flat plate collectors. Maintaining vacuum is difficult in case of evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collector.</b> For low temperature applications, flat plate collectors are more efficient compared to evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors.</b> But, for the purpose of high temperature applications like steam generation, evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors</b> are best suited because of its minimum heat loss as shown in Figure. 1...|$|R

The experiments were conducted to obtain the heat gain Qs produced by six all-glass evacuated tube solar water heaters with the similar specifications but manufactured by different producers. Each heater consisted of 20 all-glass evacuated solar <b>collector</b> <b>tubes</b> and one tube from each heater was selected randomly to measure its Y, H, and ULT. The experimental results show that both H and ULT have effects on Qs, with Qs decreasing when H or ULT increases, but H has more significant effects on Qs than ULT does. However, Y does not have significant effects on Qs. It is apparent that one effective way to increase the heat gain of an evacuated tube solar water heater is to reduce H and ULT of individual all-glass evacuated solar <b>collector</b> <b>tubes.</b> An error analysis was conducted which clearly shows that the errors caused by the uncertainties associated with the measured Qs, Y, H, and ULT have negligible effects on these results...|$|R

They are inappropriate for high temperature applications such as process steam production. Evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors</b> have a lower absorber plate area to gross area ratio (typically 60-80% of gross area) compared to flat plates. Based on absorber plate area, most evacuated tube systems are more efficient per square meter than equivalent flat plate systems. This makes them suitable where roof space is limiting, for example where the number of occupants of a building {{is higher than the}} number of square metres of suitable and available roof space. In general, per installed square metre, evacuated tubes deliver marginally more energy when the ambient temperature is low (e.g. during winter) or when the sky is overcast. However even in areas without much sunshine and solar heat, some low cost flat plate collectors can be more cost efficient than evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors.</b> Although several European companies manufacture evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors,</b> the evacuated <b>tube</b> market is dominated by manufacturers in the East. Several Chinese companies have track records of 15-30 years. There is no unambiguous evidence that the two designs differ in long term reliability.

The modularity of evacuated tubes can be advantageous in terms of extensibility and maintenance, for example if the vacuum in one tube diminishes.|$|R
