5|$|A Geschwaderstab was {{essentially}} a Headquarters Unit (Stabschwarm) for the entire wing. There were headquarters units also at gruppe level. Initially when JG 1 was re-formed in Jever, it was constituted as a Regional Fighter Command (Jagdfliegerführer 2) on 30 November 1939 with an intention to <b>co-ordinate</b> with navy (Kriegsmarine) flak and signals units. This autonomous command defending the coastline was placed under Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher. Geschwaderstab JG 1 (Stab. JG 1) was also alternatively called JG Nord or JG Schumacher and was equipped with Bf 109 'D' and 'E' variants.|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{superseded}} Rowell {{in command}} of New Guinea Force on 23 September. MacArthur visited Blamey in Port Moresby on 4 October 1942 and the two agreed to establish a Combined Operations Service Command (COSC) to <b>co-ordinate</b> logistical activities. To command it, MacArthur appointed Brigadier General Dwight Johns, the deputy commander of USASOS in SWPA, an expert on airbase construction. He was given an Australian deputy, Brigadier Victor Secombe, who had directed the rehabilitation of the port of Tobruk in 1941. All Australian and American logistical units were placed under COSC, which also controlled a fleet of small craft and luggers.|$|E

5|$|Following the Transport Act 1968, in 1969 the SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive (an {{authority}} to <b>co-ordinate</b> and operate public transport in the region) was set up, covering an area {{smaller than the}} proposed Selnec, and different again to the eventual Greater Manchester. Compared with the Redcliffe-Maud area, it excluded Macclesfield, Warrington, and Knutsford but included Glossop and Saddleworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It excluded Wigan, which was in both the Redcliffe-Maud area and in the eventual Greater Manchester (but had not {{been part of the}} 1958 act's review area).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of Belisarius in mid-540, Bessas remained in Italy. Justinian did not appoint an overall commander to replace Belisarius, {{and as a result}} the various Byzantine generals left in Italy failed to <b>co-ordinate</b> their actions. Instead of subduing the last remnants of the Ostrogoths in northern Italy, they retreated to the safety of various fortified cities, allowing the Goths to gather around a new leader, Ildibad. Ildibad marched on Treviso and routed a Byzantine force under Vitalius, whereupon Bessas advanced with his troops to Piacenza. In late 541, after Totila had become king of the Goths, Bessas and the other Byzantine commanders assembled in Ravenna to <b>co-ordinate</b> their efforts, but the imperial troops were repulsed from Verona and defeated at Faventia by Totila's Goths. The Goths then invaded Tuscany and threatened Florence, held by the general Justin. Bessas, along with John and Cyprian, marched to Justin's aid. The Goths retreated before the Byzantine reinforcements, but as the latter pursued, the Goths fell upon them and drove them to flight. After this new defeat the Byzantine commanders dispersed again to various cities and abandoned each other to his fate. Bessas withdrew with his forces to Spoleto.|$|E

An approach was therefore made to Charles Thomas from Monsanto. Thomas agreed to <b>co-ordinate</b> the Chemistry efforts of the different Manhattan Project laboratories, but he did not wish to move to New Mexico.

5|$|The Mareth Line {{constituted}} {{one of two}} fronts in the Tunisia Campaign, {{the second}} being to the north-west, where the British First Army and American II Corps, firmly established in formerly Vichy-held Morocco and Algeria following Operation Torch in November 1942, were gradually pushing the Axis forces under Hans-Jürgen von Arnim back towards Tunis. After von Arnim won a decisive victory over the Americans at the Battle of Sidi Bou Zid in mid-February 1943, destroying over 100 US tanks, the Eighteenth Army Group was formed under the British General Harold Alexander to <b>co-ordinate</b> {{the actions of the}} Allied forces on both Tunisian fronts.|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands, youth-care organisations and {{community}} sports clubs are collaborating to increase socially vulnerable youths' participation in sport. This {{is rooted in}} the idea that sports clubs are settings for youth development. As not much is known about <b>co-ordinated</b> action involving professional care organisations {{and community}} sports clubs, this study aims to generate insight into facilitators of and barriers to successful <b>co-ordinated</b> action between these two organisations. A cross-sectional study was conducted using in-depth semi-structured qualitative interview data. In total, 23 interviews were held at five locations where <b>co-ordinated</b> action between youth-care and sports takes place. Interviewees were youth-care workers, representatives from community sports clubs, and Care Sport Connectors who were assigned to encourage and manage the <b>co-ordinated</b> action. Using inductive coding procedures, this study shows that existing and good relationships, a boundary spanner, care workers' attitudes, knowledge and competences of the participants, organisational policies and ambitions, and some elements external to the <b>co-ordinated</b> action were reported to be facilitators or barriers. In addition, the participants reported that the different facilitators and barriers influenced the success of the <b>co-ordinated</b> action at different stages of the <b>co-ordinated</b> action. Future research is recommended to further explore the role of boundary spanners in <b>co-ordinated</b> action involving social care organisations and community sports clubs, and to identify what external elements (e. g. events, processes, national policies) are turning points in the formation, implementation and continuation of such <b>co-ordinated</b> action...|$|R

5|$|In September 867, the Byzantine emperor Michael III {{was killed}} and succeeded by Basil I the Macedonian. The new emperor was more {{energetic}} than his predecessor, and the relative peace on his eastern frontier allowed him to soon turn his full attention to the west: in 868–869 admiral Niketas Ooryphas was sent to relieve an Arab siege of Ragusa and re-establish imperial authority in Dalmatia, after which he sailed to Italy in an abortive attempt to conclude a alliance through marriage and <b>co-ordinate</b> a joint siege of Bari with the western emperor, Louis II. Another fleet was dispatched to Sicily in spring 868, but the Byzantines were heavily defeated by Khafaja in battle, after which the Muslims freely raided the environs of Syracuse.

40|$|Cartesian <b>co-ordinates,</b> {{traditionally}} {{used for}} radiotherapy margins, calculated at 6 points, may not adequately represent changes in inter-observer contour variation {{as necessary to}} define a delineation margin. As a first step, this study compared the standard deviation (SD) in contour delineation using Polar and Cartesian <b>co-ordinates</b> for whole breast. Whole breast Clinical Target Volumes (CTV) were delineated by eight observers for 9 patients. The SD of contour position was determined for Polar <b>co-ordinates</b> at 1 degree increments for 5 slices and averaged across all patients. The mean centre of mass (COM) {{was used as the}} origin for the right breast, for the left the COM was shifted 1 cm superiorly to avoid clipping. The SD was determined for Cartesian <b>co-ordinates</b> for medial-lateral and anterior-posterior positions. At slice Z= 0 cm considering Polar <b>co-ordinates,</b> the SD peaked medially reaching 3. 55 cm at 15 degrees for the right breast, and 1. 44 cm at 171 degrees for the left. The SD of the remaining slices maintained a similar distribution, with variation in the peak occurring within 10 degrees of the Z= 0 cm positions. by comparison, for Cartesian <b>co-ordinates</b> at slice Z= 0 cm, the largest SD in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions was 0. 54 / 0. 57 cm and 1. 03 / 0. 67 cm respectively for right/left breasts. The SD for inter-observer variation for whole breast varies with anatomical position. The maximum SD determined with Polar <b>co-ordinates</b> was greater than with Cartesian <b>co-ordinates.</b> A delineation margin may thus need to vary with angle over the entire structure and Cartesian <b>co-ordinates</b> {{may not be the best}} approach for margin determination for whole breast...|$|R
