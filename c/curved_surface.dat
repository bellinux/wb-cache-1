5|$|For surfaces, the {{generalization}} from {{the geometry of}} a plane –a flat surface– {{to that of a}} general <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> had been described in the early 19th century by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This description had in turn been generalized to higher-dimensional spaces in a mathematical formalism introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s. With the help of Riemannian geometry, Einstein formulated a geometric description of gravity in which Minkowski's spacetime is replaced by distorted, curved spacetime, just as curved surfaces are a generalization of ordinary plane surfaces. Embedding Diagrams are used to illustrate curved spacetime in educational contexts.|$|E

40|$|There {{does not}} usually exist a closed general NURBs {{representation}} of the offset <b>curve</b> (or <b>surface)</b> to a NURBs <b>curve</b> (<b>surface).</b> In a related paper [7] a method was developed to determine a sequence of approximations to the offset <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> of a given <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> with the properties that the global error of each approximation from the true offset can be bounded and the sequence converges to the true offset. In this paper we {{take the next step}} and develop a method using the analysis of the offset error function that perturbs the <b>curve</b> or <b>surface</b> control points of a specified NURBs approximation to an offset of a NURBs <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> so a better approximation to the offset results. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{based on}} the idea of profit and loss modification, we present the {{iterative}} non-uniform B-spline <b>curve</b> and <b>surface</b> to settle a key problem in computer aided geometric design and reverse engineering, that is, constructing the <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> fitting (interpolating) a given ordered point set without solving a linear system. We start with a piece of initial non-uniform B-spline <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> which takes the given point set as its control point set. Then by adjusting its control points gradually with iterative formula, we can get a group of non-uniform B-spline <b>curves</b> (<b>surfaces)</b> with gradually higher precision. In this paper, using modern matrix theory, we strictly prove that the limit <b>curve</b> (<b>surface)</b> of the iteration interpolates the given point set. The non-uniform B-spline <b>curves</b> (<b>surfaces)</b> generated with the iteration have many advantages, such as satisfying the NURBS standard, having explicit expression, gaining locality, and convexity preserving, etc...|$|R

25|$|While the {{measures}} of the internal angles in planar triangles always sum to 180°, a hyperbolic triangle has measures of angles that sum to less than 180°, and a spherical triangle has measures of angles that sum to more than 180°. A hyperbolic triangle {{can be obtained by}} drawing on a negatively <b>curved</b> <b>surface,</b> such as a saddle surface, and a spherical triangle can be obtained by drawing on a positively <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> such as a sphere. Thus, if one draws a giant triangle {{on the surface of the}} Earth, one will find that the sum of {{the measures}} of its angles is greater than 180°; in fact it will be between 180° and 540°. In particular it is possible to draw a triangle on a sphere such that the measure of each of its internal angles is equal to 90°, adding up to a total of 270°.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the Coriolis force on {{ballistic}} trajectories {{should not be confused}} with the curvature of the paths of missiles, satellites, and similar objects when the paths are plotted on two-dimensional (flat) maps, such as the Mercator projection. The projections of the three-dimensional <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> of the Earth to a two-dimensional surface (the map) necessarily results in distorted features. The apparent curvature of the path is a consequence of the sphericity of the Earth and would occur even in a non-rotating frame.|$|E
25|$|On a {{complete}} <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> any two points can {{be joined by}} a geodesic. This is a special case of the Hopf-Rinow theorem, which also applies in higher dimensions. The completeness assumption is automatically fulfilled for a surface which is embedded as a closed subset of Euclidean space. However, it is no longer fulfilled if, for example, we remove an isolated point from a surface. For example, the complement of the origin in the Euclidean plane {{is an example of a}} non-complete surface; in this example two points which are diametrically opposite across the origin cannot {{be joined by a}} geodesic without leaving the punctured plane).|$|E

Shape deformation is expressed by simple formulas without complex calculation because of skeletal implicit surfaces employed to represent smooth free-form surfaces.

25|$|Cartographers use a {{projection}} {{to project the}} <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> of the earth onto a flat surface. This generates a grid that {{is used as a}} base for national topographic mapping. The projection introduces a distortion so that grid north differs from true north; magnetic north is a natural feature that differs from both. As an example: at 52° 35' N 1° 10' E (approx 7km west of Norwich, England) true north is 2° 33' west of grid north, and magnetic north is about 7° west of grid north. Magnetic north varies continually and in this example (1986) was reducing by about ½° in four years. Orienteering maps are printed using magnetic north and this requires an adjustment to be made to the base map.|$|E
25|$|As first {{explained}} by Maximilian Schuler in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital {{period of a}} hypothetical satellite orbiting just above {{the surface of the}} earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called Schuler tuning, is used in inertial guidance systems in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the control system that keeps the inertial platform containing the gyroscopes stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|A {{parabolic}} antenna is an antenna {{that uses a}} parabolic reflector, a <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a {{parabolic antenna}} {{is that it has}} high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-in this paper, we {{consider}} uncaiibrated reconstruction of <b>curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> from apparent contours. Since apparent contours are not fixed features (viewpoint independent), we cannot directly apply the recent resuits of the uncaiibrated reconstruction from fixed features. We show that, nonetheless, <b>curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be reconstructed {{up to an}} affine ambiguity from their apparent contours viewed from uncaiibrated cameras with unknown linear translations. Furthermore, we show that, even if the reconstruction is nonmetric (non-Euclidean), we can stili extract useful information for many computer vision applications just from the apparent contours. We first show that if the camera motion is linear translation (but arbitrary direction and magnitude), the epipolar geometry can be recovered from the apparent contours without using any optimization process. The extracted epipolar geometry is next used for reconstructing <b>Curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> from the deformations of the apparent contours viewed from uncaiibrated cameras. The resuit is applied to distinguishing <b>curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> from fixed features in images. it is ais 0 shown that the time-to-contact to the <b>curved</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be computed from simple measurements of the apparent contours, Index Terms-Curved surfaces, affine reconstruction, uncaiibrated reconstruction, apparent contours, epipolar geometry, time-tocontact. ...|$|R
25|$|A typical {{connector}} {{is installed}} by preparing the fiber end and inserting {{it into the}} rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a strain relief is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, {{depending on the type of}} fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The <b>curved</b> <b>surface</b> may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.|$|E

It {{is a novel}} generalization of Bézier <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces.</b> Firstly, a class of polynomial basis functions with n adjustable shape parameters is present. It is a natural extension to classical Bernstein basis functions. The corresponding Bézier <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces,</b> the so-called Quasi-Bézier (i. e., Q-Bézier, for short) <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces,</b> are also constructed and their properties studied. It {{has been shown that}} the main advantage compared to the ordinary Bézier <b>curves</b> and <b>surfaces</b> is that after inputting a set of control points and values of newly introduced n shape parameters, the desired <b>curve</b> or <b>surface</b> can be flexibly chosen from a set of <b>curves</b> or <b>surfaces</b> which differ either locally or globally by suitably modifying the values of the shape parameters, when the control polygon is maintained. The Q-Bézier <b>curve</b> and <b>surface</b> inherit the most properties of Bézier <b>curve</b> and <b>surface</b> and can be more approximated to the control polygon. It is visible that the properties of end-points on Q-Bézier <b>curve</b> and <b>surface</b> can be locally controlled by these shape parameters. Some examples are given by figures...|$|R
