5|$|The {{combined}} SDU {{and ground}} station bias was <b>calculated</b> from 17 signals exchanged between the ground {{station and the}} aircraft during a 30-minute period before take-off, when the aircraft's location was known (at Kuala Lumpur International Airport). To establish the accuracy of their calculations, the bias value was {{used to calculate the}} distance from the aircraft to the satellite during the time it was on the ground at KLIA, with errors of <1 km-8.85 km (<1 mi-5.5 mi). The distance from the satellite to the aircraft was also <b>calculated</b> while the aircraft was in-flight and at a known location shortly after take-off, showing similar accuracy. The distance between the satellite and aircraft could thus be <b>calculated</b> for signals exchanged between 02:25–08:19, after Flight 370 disappeared from radar. However, this could only produce a ring on Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the <b>calculated</b> value, adjusted to account for the aircraft flying at 10,000 m (33,000 ft). The ring could also be reduced to an arc by taking into consideration the maximum range of the aircraft if it flew at its maximum speed.|$|E
