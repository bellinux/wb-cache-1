40|$|Intentions {{are often}} thought {{to play an}} {{indispensible}} <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>linking</b> the vast complex of an agent's desires, beliefs, emotions, perceptions, etc. to intentional behavior. States of distal intending establish tendencies to act in certain ways while proximal intendings serve to trigger behavior. Both owe their efficacy, in part, to their contents [...] to intentions in the technical sense. My extending my right arm to hail a taxi can be explained, in part, by my standing intention to extend my right arm when I desire an approaching taxi's service, or, by my proximal intending to hail that taxi thinking that extending my arm within the visual range of the driver {{is a way to}} secure the desired end. i One who intends to do something intends one's own prospective action. But 'action ' is multiply ambiguous, and even if we speak of a tokening of an action-type we ackowledge that what is intended is not just any prospective event involving oneself. My conception of hailing a taxi may include my thought of a taxi stopping nearby in response to my arm motion, but neither the taxi's stopping in response to my arm motion nor the arm motion itself is all that I intend; these events could occur without my doing anything at all, for example, if my arm just happens to go up thereby causing a passing taxi to stop. To capture what more is involved my intentio...|$|E
40|$|Hyaluronic acid {{is widely}} used in the {{treatment}} of osteoarthritis and exerts significant chondroprotective effects. The exact mechanisms of its chondroprotective action are not yet fully elucidated. Human articular chondrocytes actively produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species capable of causing cellular dysfunction and death. A growing body of evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA damage play a <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> disorders <b>linked</b> to excessive generation of oxygen free radicals. We hypothesized that the chondroprotective effects of hyaluronic acid on oxidatively stressed chondrocytes are due to preservation of mitochondrial function and amelioration of mitochondria-driven apoptosis. When primary human chondrocyte cultures were exposed to reactive oxygen or nitrogen species generators, mitochondrial DNA damage along with mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondria-driven apoptosis accumulated as a consequence. In addition, cytokine-treated primary human chondrocytes showed increased levels of mitochondrial DNA damage. Pretreatment of chondrocytes with hyaluronic acid caused a decrease of mitochondrial DNA damage, enhanced mitochondrial DNA repair capacity and cell viability, preservation of ATP levels, and amelioration of apoptosis. The results of these studies demonstrate that enhanced chondrocyte survival and improved mitochondrial function under conditions of oxidative injury are probably important therapeutic mechanisms for the actions of hyaluronic acid in osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesOsteoarthritis (OA) is {{characterized}} by the failure of chondrocytes to respond to injury and perform the cartilage remodeling process. Human articular chondrocytes actively produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) capable of causing cellular dysfunction and death. A growing body of evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage play a <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> disorders <b>linked</b> to excessive generation of oxygen free radicals. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether mtDNA damage was present in OA chondrocytes, and whether mtDNA repair capacity is compromised in OA chondrocytes following oxidative stress, leading to chondrocyte death. MethodsHuman articular cartilage was isolated from knee joints of cadavers available through the Anatomical Gifts Program at the University of South Alabama (normal donors) or OA patients undergoing total knee replacement surgeries (OA patients). Total DNA was isolated from either chondrocytes released following collagenase digestion, or from first passage chondrocytes grown in culture and exposed to ROS or RNS. mtDNA integrity and repair capacity were analyzed by quantitative Southern blot analysis, using a mtDNA-specific radioactive probe. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. ResultsmtDNA damage was found in chondrocytes from OA patients compared to normal donors. It was accompanied with reduced mtDNA repair capacity, cell viability, and increased apoptosis in OA chondrocytes following exposure to ROS and RNS. ConclusionsThese results indicate that mtDNA damage and poor mtDNA repair capacity for removing damage caused by oxidative stress may contribute to the pathogenesis of OA...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{damage is}} a {{well-established}} driver of aging. Evidence of oxidative stress exists in aged and degenerated discs, {{but it is}} unclear how it affects disc metabolism. In this study, we first determined whether oxidative stress negatively impacts disc matrix metabolism using disc organotypic and cell cultures. Mouse disc organotypic culture grown at atmospheric oxygen (20 % O(2)) exhibited perturbed disc matrix homeostasis, including reduced proteoglycan synthesis and enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinases, compared to discs grown at low oxygen levels (5 % O(2)). Human disc cells grown at 20 % O(2) showed increased levels of mitochondrial-derived superoxide anions and perturbed matrix homeostasis. Treatment of disc cells with the mitochondria-targeted reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger XJB- 5 - 131 blunted the adverse effects caused by 20 % O(2). Importantly, we demonstrated that treatment of accelerated aging Ercc 1 (-/Δ) mice, previously established to be a useful in vivo model to study age-related intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), also resulted in improved disc total glycosaminoglycan content and proteoglycan synthesis. This demonstrates that mitochondrial-derived ROS contributes to age-associated IDD in Ercc 1 (-/Δ) mice. Collectively, these data provide strong experimental evidence that mitochondrial-derived ROS play a <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> driving changes <b>linked</b> to aging-related IDD and a potentially important role for radical scavengers in preventing IDD...|$|R
40|$|The Arcuate Fasciculus/Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (AF/SLF) is the white-matter bundle {{that connects}} {{posterior}} superior temporal and inferior frontal cortex. Its <b>causal</b> functional <b>role</b> <b>in</b> sentence processing and verbal working memory is currently under debate. While impairments of sentence processing and verbal working memory often co-occur in patients suffering from AF/SLF damage, {{it is unclear}} whether these impairments result from shared white-matter damage to the verbal-working-memory network. The present study sought to specify the behavioral consequences of focal AF/SLF damage for sentence processing and verbal working memory, which were assessed in a single patient suffering from a cleft-like lesion spanning the deep left superior temporal gyrus, sparing most surrounding gray matter. While tractography suggests that the ventral fronto-temporal white-matter bundle is intact in this patient, the AF/SLF was not visible to tractography. In line with the hypothesis that the AF/SLF is causally involved in sentence processing, the patient's performance was selectively impaired on sentences that jointly involve both complex word orders and long word-storage intervals. However, the patient was unimpaired on sentences that only involved long word-storage intervals without involving complex word orders. On the contrary, the patient performed generally worse than a control group across standard verbal-working-memory tests. We conclude that the AF/SLF not only plays a <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> sentence processing, <b>linking</b> regions of the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus to the temporo-parietal region, but moreover plays a crucial <b>role</b> <b>in</b> verbal working memory, linking regions of the left ventral inferior frontal gyrus to the left temporo-parietal region. Together, the specific sentence-processing impairment and the more general verbal-working-memory impairment may imply that the AF/SLF subserves both sentence processing and verbal working memory, possibly pointing to the AF and SLF respectively supporting each...|$|R

40|$|Neurons in {{putative}} decision-making structures can reflect both sensory {{and decision}} signals, making their <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> decisions unclear. Here, we tested whether rat posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is causal for processing visual sensory signals or instead for accumulating evidence for decision alternatives. We optogenetically disrupted PPC activity during decision-making and compared effects on decisions guided by auditory vs. visual evidence. Deficits were largely restricted to visual decisions. To further test for visual dominance in PPC, we evaluated electrophysiological responses following individual sensory events and observed much larger response modulation following visual stimuli than auditory stimuli. Finally, we measured trial-to-trial spike count variability during stimulus presentation and decision formation. Variability sharply decreased, suggesting {{the network is}} stabilized by inputs, unlike what would be expected if sensory signals were locally accumulated. Our findings argue that PPC plays a <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> processing visual signals that are accumulated elsewhere. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDefining the neural circuits that support decision-making bridges a gap between our understanding of simple sensorimotor reflexes and our understanding of truly complex behavior. However, identifying brain areas which play a <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> decision-making has proved challenging. We tested the <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> of a candidate component of decision circuits, the rat posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Our interpretation of the data benefitted from our use of animals trained to make decisions guided by either visual or auditory evidence. Our results argue that PPC plays a <b>causal</b> <b>role</b> specifically <b>in</b> visual decision-making, and that PPC may support sensory aspects of the decision, such as interpreting the visual signals so that evidence for a decision can be accumulated elsewhere...|$|R
