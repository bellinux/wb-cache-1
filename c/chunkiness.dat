25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or <b>chunkiness</b> that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E
2500|$|Stereophile's writer Ariel Bitran related {{his opinion}} about the sound: [...] "The {{earphones}} propelled the beat with confidence, discipline, punctuation, and control, accenting the <b>chunkiness</b> of the groove without being edgy." [...] In his opinion the treble was chunky, resulting in a very non-fatiguing experience. Cymbals were somewhat grainy, while the midrange was ultra-clean. He could carefully discern instruments and follow them. Bass extended deep and he could hear normally inaudible or subdued whole-note bass synths in the chorus as warm and full-bodied for their entire duration. However, some highly compressed recordings such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers sounded [...] "boxed".|$|E

50|$|Mashed {{potatoes}} can be reconstituted from potato flour, but {{the process}} is made more difficult by lumping; a key characteristic of instant mashed potatoes {{is that it is}} in the form of flakes or granules, eliminating the <b>chunkiness.</b> Analogous to instant mashed potatoes are instant poi made from taro and instant fufu made from yams or yam substitutes including cereals. Poha, an instant rice mush, is also much in the same spirit, as more broadly are other instant porridges, formed from flakes, granules, or pearls to avoid lumping. Brands include Smash and Idahoan Foods.|$|E

5000|$|While {{reviewing}} the album, Jason Lipshut of Billboard Magazine {{wrote that the}} song is [...] "as good of a lead-off track as any: bombastic, sneering but defiantly listenable, 'Rock n Roll' reveals its best details -- the <b>chunkiness</b> of the guitar solo, the line 'I ain't never gonna cover up that tattoo' -- in repeated listens." [...] Elliot Robinson of So So Gay picked it as a [...] "standout track", calling it [...] "brilliant". [...] Direct Lyrics gave a positive review, stating the song [...] "rocks" [...] {{and should have been}} picked as the album's lead single, praising the song's [...] "epic production, cheeky lyrics" [...] and [...] "catchy melody", favorably comparing to her 2002 single [...] "Sk8er Boi", however noted the song's potential lack of radio appeal. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the song 2 and a half out of 5 stars. Sciarretto called the song [...] "overly enunciated" [...] and [...] "standard issue Avril", however praised the guitar solo which provided a [...] "tougher timbre". Sciarretto concluded her review by stating Lavigne's fans would [...] "love" [...] the song, however that [...] "it likely wouldn't bring her any new fans.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new hybridized {{discontinuous}} Galerkin(HDG) method with weak stabilization for the Poisson equation. The weak stabilization proposed here {{enables us to}} use piecewise polynomials of degree k on elements and piecewise polynomials of degree k − 1 on edges for approximations, unlike the standard HDG methods. We provide the error estimates in the energy and L 2 norms under the <b>chunkiness</b> condition. In the case of k = 1, it is shown that our method {{is closely related to}} the Crouzeix-Raviart nonconforming finite element method. Several numerical results are presented to verify the validity of our method...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a hybridized {{discontinuous}} Galerkin(HDG) method with reduced stabilization for the Poisson equation. The reduce stabilization proposed here {{enables us to}} use piecewise polynomials of degree $k$ and $k- 1 $ for the approximations of element and inter-element unknowns, respectively, unlike the standard HDG methods. We provide the error estimates in the energy and $L^ 2 $ norms under the <b>chunkiness</b> condition. In the case of $k= 1 $, it can be shown that the proposed method {{is closely related to}} the Crouzeix-Raviart nonconforming finite element method.
