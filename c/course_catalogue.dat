40|$|Abstract. Today, many {{universities}} are opting for modular degree programmes. Such modular courses provide greater flexibility for students, {{allowing them to}} learn about subjects previously inacces-sible to them. Such a system is naturally complex. Modules may fea-ture pre and co-requisites and may run over differently periods of times (and have different credit values). General university require-ments {{will need to be}} met by students to continue their studies. Students themselves may further complex the process by explic-itly wanting to take or avoid modules. They may require a general overview to see what options are available to them, such as the dif-ferent routes to a particular degree. The University of Glasgow cur-rently has no automated process to help with this. To find answers students may need to visit several different faculties to investigate possible module selections. Students may have to spend large periods of time with their adviser manually working through the university <b>course</b> <b>catalogue</b> finding what modules are and are not available to them. This paper describes our initial efforts in applying constraint programming to this problem. ...|$|E

By understanding the differences, the core functionalities of each, and the benefits of combining or keeping applications separate, designer can guide managers toward the best solution for issues at the virtual universities...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of student opinion on course selection. Twenty-nine undergraduate psychology students read a course description similar to those offered by a university <b>course</b> <b>catalogue,</b> then read either one of two student opinions or no student opinion. After reading this information, participants completed a questionnaire that evaluated their thoughts on the course. First, it was predicted that if participants read a student opinion in addition to a course description, they would make significantly different decisions regarding the course. Second, it was predicted that these participants would also perceive the information as more helpful in arriving at their decisions. Contrary to both of these hypotheses, {{the presence or absence of}} a student opinion resulted in no significant effect on the participants ' likelihood to take or recommend the course, or the extent to which they reported finding the information helpful in making these decisions.

40|$|Most of the {{scholarly}} work on Terrorism Studies focuses on terrorism research (knowledge production). By contrast, relatively {{little attention has}} been paid to teaching about terrorism (knowledge dissemination) at universities. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic analysis of contemporary terrorism courses at 106 top-ranked U. S. based universities and colleges. The study uses 1) key word searches of <b>course</b> <b>catalogues</b> for the academic year 2010 - 2011 to identify terrorism courses; 2) descriptive statistics to document the field and disciplinary distributions of these courses 2) stepwise regression to assess the relative contributions of institutional characteristics to the frequency of these courses; 3) text analysis to extract dominant topics and a qualitative review of a sample of syllabi. The results indicate that a) most of the these academic institutions offer terrorism courses but courses only secondarily on terrorism outnumber those explicitly or primarily on terrorism by 3 : 1; b) the institutional presence of a highly cited terrorism scholar, a security studies program and terrorism research center are significantly associated with more terrorism courses c) courses explicitly on terrorism tend to emphasize non-state terrorism and prescriptively focus on counterterrorism while those only secondarily on terrorism have a broader focus. The results have implications for the development of Terrorism Studies as an academic discipline.   </p...|$|R

30|$|In an {{educational}} setting, {{there are a}} number of stakeholders with legitimate rights to a person’s data, driven by the fact that the student has an obligation to go to school or has registered for a course, and in practice entered a contractual relation with an (business) organisation. It is not clear cut what the legal grounds for access to data are; let us say for an administrator, a teacher, or a third party. Data about a student starts to build up from the moment the student does a web search in the <b>course</b> <b>catalogue,</b> right up to the clicks made browsing through learning resources, passing tests, and getting an exam. An educational institution is a business organisation with student records, which are not under the full control of the students. Nobody will contest that right of the institution to store and analyse data about who is registered for what course, and who ends up with what exam results. But what about the results of micro tests? There are no clear boundaries between data generated that are solely the student’s prerogative to manage, and data that the institution, the teacher, has a right to process (Zeide 2017). These are issues that are subject to negotiations between parties that will base their positions on both legal, moral and pedagogical grounds.|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} of suffering both provokes and resists narration. It {{is at the}} hearl {{of many of the}} world's great stories (the Odyssey, the Book of Job, the Gospels, the Divine Comedy, Paradise Lost) and yet absent, in a fundamental way, from every story. Because intense suffering takes language away, retrospective narration can seem futile, even falsifying. Moreover, it often raises more questions than it answers. (Who or what is responsible for suffering? Is it merited? What ends it? How can it be made commensurable with the rest of ones's life? What is its meaning? How does one cope with it?) In spite of all this, sufferers continue to tug at the shirls/eeves of passersby, and passersby continue to stop, listen and fall into the sufferers's story. Why?" My opening paragraph is a description of a course that I discovered in the Bard College <b>Course</b> <b>Catalogue</b> for the fall semester 2001 - the year of the falling towers. I was immediately intrigued by the description, having myself experienced great loss, and suffering from it again despite a long passage of time and coping.

Our purpose was to examine these specific features and how to work with these in the best way, and also see how {{to get the most out}} of the event communication to the young at event and fairs. Special features we have looked at are the student ambassadors ands their impact, the meaning of a give-away and also if there are any essential factors to get in contact with the young at fairs and events, and if new technology had an important role to play in the area. Our research has been inductive, and therefore, we have created our own theory and reflected it to the larger topic of event communication and its theories. Our research method has been triangular, both quantitative and qualitative; interviews with those who work with student recruitment, and surveys to young people in upper secondary school. Our study showed the importance of student ambassadors and their specific task to be nice, friendly and outgoing. In comparison, the give-away isn't as important. It mainly has a remembering function and can also make interaction easier. We also found that different events are needed to fill different requirements, meanings and purposes. Information is also important; both to create awareness about the events and fairs, but also information at the event and fairs. This information should first and foremost be through a <b>course</b> <b>catalogue,</b> but also information about the school and the life as a student is important.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade many data {{integration}} systems characterized by a classical wrapper/mediator architecture based on a Global Virtual Schema (Global Virtual View - GVV) have been proposed. The data sources store data, while the GVV provides a reconciled, integrated, and virtual view of the underlying sources. Each proposed system contribute {{to the state of}} the art advancement by focusing on different aspects to provide an answer to one or more challenges of the data integration problem, ranging from system-level heterogeneities, to structural syntax level heterogeneities at the semantic level. The approaches are still in part manual, requiring a great amount of customization for data reconciliation and for writing specific non reusable programming code. The specialization of mediator systems make a comparisons among the various systems difficult. Therefore, the last Lowell Report [1] has provided the guideline for the definition of a public benchmark for data integration problems. The proposal is called THALIA (Test Harness for the Assessment of Legacy information Integration Approaches) [2], and it provides researchers with a collection of downloadable data sources representing University <b>course</b> <b>catalogues,</b> a set of twelve benchmark queries, as well as a scoring function for ranking the performance of an integration system. In this paper we show how the MOMIS mediator system we developed [3, 4] can deal with all the twelve queries of the THALIA benchmark by simply extending and combining the declarative translation functions available in MOMIS and without any overhead of new code. This is a remarkable result, in fact, as far as we know, no system has provided a complete answer to the benchmark...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study extends {{coverage}} of the accounting literature to means of measuring, recording and reporting university-student learning. The means in question comprise credit, credit points, levels of learning, level descriptors, learning outcomes, and related characteristics of <b>course</b> <b>catalogues,</b> qualification frameworks, credit transfer systems and student records, transcripts and diploma supplements. Despite the infant precursors of these calculative practices, processes, records and so on having been labelled curricular accounting (see Theodossin, E. (1986), The Modular Market, Further Education Staff College, London), accounting researchers have overlooked these means as a variant of accounting, notwithstanding that how accounting figures variously in New Higher Education {{has been the subject}} of widespread accounting research studies. Design/Methodology/Approach – The subject is addressed both in a technical way and in the broader context of accounting in organisations and society. The former University of New Zealand and its affiliate in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the successor of that affiliate, Te Whare Wananga o Waitaha /the University of Canterbury, are used as a case study for archival study and participant-observation. The credit point system in place at the University of Canterbury in 2010 and antecedent arrangements back to 1873 are analysed genealogically, using ideas of representational schemes, path-dependent changes and negotiated orders among parties who have been associated with the case institution. In the present paper, particular attention is paid to how and why curricular accounting and antecedent means of specifying, recording and controlling learning are connected with enlargement of the institution, including the learning (and teaching) provided. Findings – The retrospective analysis illuminates how and why growth in students, staff, qualifications, courses, subjects and so on shaped and formed curricular accounting, and came to be enabled and further fuelled by curricular accounting; and suggests that similar applies across tertiary education in many countries...|$|R
