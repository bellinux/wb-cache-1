40|$|Olive growers need {{relevant}} information about economic justifications of their {{investments in the}} construction <b>of</b> new <b>olive</b> <b>groves,</b> and about economic effects <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> growing. In that context, {{the purpose of the}} research is the analysis of an investment in <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> establishment and <b>of</b> the economic indicators <b>of</b> production <b>of</b> <b>olives</b> in full growth. The purpose is to establish the economic justification of investments in the <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> establishment, and to establish the economic effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> growing. In the course of work, the method of simulation modeling was applied. For the purpose of the research, a deterministic simulation model was constructed, consisting of a sub-model <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> establishment, and a sub-model <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> growing. Total investment value of 1 hectare <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> establishment amounts to 65, 500 kn. Profit evaluation indicates that investment of 1 hectare <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> establishment is economically justifiable. An <b>olive</b> <b>grove,</b> 1 hectare large, in one year of full yield, makes a profit in the amount of 34, 751 kn, and the olive grower has to evaluate if the economic results satisfy his expectations for the work he put in...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} explores how people {{perceive}} the conservation <b>of</b> an <b>olive</b> agro-ecosystem within a natural reserve, in Andalusia (southern Spain). Using the contingent and the inferred valuation methods, {{we performed a}} field survey to identify the socio-economic factors that affect willingness to pay for conservation <b>of</b> the <b>olive</b> <b>groves,</b> and to specify the priority people give to ecosystem services. Results showed that respondents who gave a high score to cultural and regulating ecosystem services {{were more likely to}} pay for a conservation plan. This would indicate that factors linked to the historic presence and ecological functionality <b>of</b> the <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> prevail over their economic aspect in respondentsâ willingness to pay. Willingness to pay is found to be positively correlated to appreciation of ecosystem services. The contingent method revealed that mean willingness to pay ranges from 31 to 43 â¬/year/respondent, whereas the inferred method pointed to a slightly higher range of willingness to pay, from 37 â¬ to 44 â¬/ year/respondent. Different alternative policies (for example, payment for ecosystem services) should be considered according to the outcome of our study within a sustainable management plan to attenuate the trends of intensification or abandonment <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> and to ensure rural development in the region...|$|R

In spring 2015 and 2016 we determined the abundance of the beneficial insect groups in 15 <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> by identification <b>of</b> insects captured on 4 yellow sticky traps in each <b>olive</b> <b>grove.</b> Indices <b>of</b> landscape structure were calculated in circular areas with radii ranging from 250 to 1500 m around the 15 <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> selected.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in Magnesia Prefecture, central Greece, during the period May-June 2007. It aimed at the comparison between conventional and certified organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> with regard to olive and olive oil production, diversity of plants (herbaceous and woody) and diversity and abundance of avifauna. Correlations between variables within herbaceous plants (linear regression) and woody plants (Principal Component Analysis), and the role of integration time <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> to the organic system were investigated. Also, finding easily measurable parameters indicating high bird diversity levels within organic and conventional management systems was a main target of the study. According to our findings, neither edible olive yield nor olive oil yield showed significant differences between conventional and certified organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> There is an increasing trend for alpha and beta diversity of herbaceous plant species, woody plant beta diversity, density and cover of woody plants, and density of breeding birds in certified organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> (10 years) in comparison with conventional ones. The effect of time since the adoption of organic procedures is very important and produces benefits for the biodiversity. In the total <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> 15 insectivorous, six granivorous and three insectivorous/granivorous birds species were recorded. Nine bird species distinguished by Ward's hierarchical clustering were identified as typical (indicator value, IndVal> 50 %) of specific farming systems.

Here, we studied the blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, a common frugivorous bird species, in an olive-dominated agroecosystem of southern Spain to assess the effects of the abandonment <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> and undergrowth structure on habitat selection in this species. By means of radiotelemetry, we determined habitat selection of blackcaps during both the breeding (N = 30) and the nonbreeding (N = 27) seasons of 2011 and 2012. We found that outside the breeding season, <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> were widely used by blackcaps, which invariably preferred abandoned <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> over intensively managed ones.

Generally, woody habitats without undergrowth or with herbaceous undergrowth were avoided. During the breeding season, the species selected mainly riverine habitats and poplar plantations, favoring habitats with well-developed undergrowth. Our results suggest that the blackcap could benefit from maintaining patches <b>of</b> abandoned <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> freely left to natural succession within intensive <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> In such a landscape, ecological services (i. e., seed dispersal provided by frugivorous birds) and functioning could also improve as a consequence of these measures...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{traditional}} farming {{based on}} achieving high yields using high inputs, shifts gradu-ally towards maximum possible crop yield using minimal inputs in an optimized way or to-wards organic farming. This is usually accomplishing by low yield {{of high quality}} products without using conventional agrochemicals (i. e. fertilizers, pesticides). In general, this last ap-proach leads to lower energy consumption per unit area of land, therefore lower cost and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, in a global perspective it has the risk of significant total production reduction. Hence, {{it is vital to}} consider energy efficiency im-provement, namely the decrease of primary energy consumption for the production of a unit of agricultural product (expressed in weight or volume units), within the farm boundaries. Im-provement of energy efficiency is a key parameter affecting positively the overall efficiency of crop farming systems in terms of energy and GHG emissions. In the present paper, two show cases <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> in Greece (âSterea Elladaâ region) and Portugal (âAlentejoâ re-gion) were compared to illustrate the effect on energy efficiency and GHG emissions when moving from conventional to organic <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> cultivations in these different locations. The analysis was based on two simple framework models using information provided by farmers and literature data regarding the inputs and outputs <b>of</b> each <b>olive</b> <b>grove.</b> The models were adjusted according to the olivesâ variety, the agricultural practices followed and the location of the production system. Considering the specific energy consumption per unit of product, in the case <b>of</b> the Greek <b>olive</b> <b>grove,</b> organic farming reduces energy consumption by 13. 9 %, while the final yield is reduced by 30 %. GHG emissions are reduced by 58 %.
