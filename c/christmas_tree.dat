In the 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in American homes.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Halifax sent a <b>Christmas</b> <b>tree</b> to the City of Boston in {{thanks and}} remembrance {{for the help}} that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee {{provided}} immediately after the disaster.

The gift was later {{taken over by the}} Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism. The tree is Boston's official <b>Christmas</b> <b>tree</b> and is lit on Boston Common throughout the holiday season. In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree.|$|E
