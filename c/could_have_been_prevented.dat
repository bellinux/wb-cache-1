5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E

The train continued north; transit police were notified of the situation at Fordham Road. By the time paramedics were able to reach McNalley he had died from cardiac arrest. Transit police officers claimed that their calls to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority command center urging the train to be stopped were ignored.

25|$|The USSR {{experienced}} a major famine from 1946 to 1947. As many as 1.5 million people died from malnutrition or disease as a result. The conditions {{were caused by}} drought, the effects of which were exacerbated by the devastation caused byWorld War II. British economist Michael Ellman argues that it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> if the government had not mismanaged its grain reserves. The famine cost an estimated 1 to 1.5million lives as well as secondary population losses due to reduced fertility. In the post-war period there were often food shortages in Soviet cities. While agricultural production stagnated, Stalin focused {{on a series of}} major infrastructure projects, including the construction of hydroelectric plants, canals, and railway lines running to the polar north. Much of this was constructed by prison labour.|$|E
25|$|On June 5, 2013, {{one of the}} {{unmanned}} K-MAX helicopters {{crashed in}} Afghanistan while resupplying Marines. No injuries occurred and the crash was investigated. Pilot error was ruled out, as the aircraft was flying autonomously to a predetermined point. The crash happened during {{the final stages of}} cargo delivery. Operational flights of the remaining unmanned K-MAX were suspended following the crash, with the Navy saying it could resume flying by late August. Swing load was seen as the prime cause. The investigation determined that the crash was not caused by mechanical problems, but by unexpected tailwinds. As the helicopter was making the delivery, it experienced tailwinds instead of headwinds, causing it to begin oscillating. Operators employed a weathervane effect to try and regain control, but its 2,000 lb load began to swing, which exacerbated the effect and caused it to contact the ground. The crash report determined that it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented</b> if pilots intervened earlier and mission planners received updated weather reports; diverging conditions and insufficient programming meant it could not recover on its own and required human intervention.|$|E

25|$|The Air India Flight 182 bombing, which {{originated}} in Montreal, happened during Mulroney's first term. This {{was the largest}} terrorist act before September 11, 2001, {{with the majority of}} the 329 victims being Canadian citizens. Mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, which sparked an uproar in Canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences. Gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to Mulroney, given that the majority of victims were Canadian or lived in Canada. Many Indo-Canadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt Mulroney did not consider them to be true Canadian citizens as they were not of European descent. Furthermore, there were several warnings from the Indian government to the Mulroney government about terrorist threats towards Air India flights. Questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prevented.</b> The Governor General-in-Council in 2006 appointed the former Supreme Court Justice John Major to conduct a commission of inquiry.
