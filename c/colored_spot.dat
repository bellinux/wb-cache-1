5|$|She {{observed}} {{the effects of}} the transposition of Ac and Ds by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described {{the relationship between the two}} loci through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that Ac controls the transposition of the Ds from chromosome9, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The transposition of Ds in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the <b>colored</b> <b>spot</b> on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.|$|E

50|$|The {{modernization}} of grappa distillation is relatively recent, probably in 1979 in Northern Italy. Initially it {{was carried out}} by direct flame but soon the advantages of a bain-marie or steam distillation to obtain a better product became obvious. Modern refinements included the distillation of pomace under vacuum, the use of varietal grapes and aging in casks of various types of wood to improve the flavor of the liquor. Oak is the most used, but some high-end grappas are aged successively in casks of acacia, ash and cherrywood, an innovation introduced by the Marzadro Distillery.In Sardinia, Grappa is colloquially known as (iron wire)as most of the distillation was homemade and illegal to avoid customs and excise taxes.The illegally made liquor was bottled, sealed and then buried in orchards fields and pastures, awaiting commercialization. A bit of iron wire was tied around the bottleneck, barely protruding the soil. after some time the wire would rust and disappear completely save for a faintly brown red color stain to the topsoil on the spot where the bottle was buried. While the peasant distiller could easily recognize the <b>colored</b> <b>spot,</b> the urban-bred Guardia di Finanza officers were generally unable to tell the difference.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Studies were {{conducted}} to verify the existence of IAA in wheat seedlings and {{to determine the effect}} of (2 -chloroethyl) -trimethyl-ammonium chloride (CCC) on the IAA content of club wheat, Triticum aestivum compactum, variety Omar. The shoots of CCC-treated and untreated wheat plants were extracted with ethanol, the plant extract purified, separated by paper chromatography, and subjected to bioassay and color test. A refinement was made in the procedure for purifying plant extracts. Most of the pigments and lipid substances were removed from the alcoholic extract by partitioning with n-hexane. The acidic auxin fraction was further purified using column chromatography with basic alumina, WoeIm alumina, serving as the stationary phase. Direct bioassay of sections of chromatograms by the Avena elongation test revealed a growth promoting region on chromatograms developed in several solvent systems at a R[subscript f] comparable to the R[subscript f] of IAA. A <b>colored</b> <b>spot</b> having the developmental characteristics of IAA appeared on paper chromatograms at the same relative R[subscript f] zone upon spraying with a chromogenic reagent, p-dimethyl-aminocinnamaldehyde (DMAC). These tests provide substantial evidence that IAA is the principal acidic auxin in wheat foliage. Semi-quantitative tests using DMAC indicate that good recovery of IAA is possible using the purification procedure described. A positive color test was obtained on paper chromatograms with the equivalent of 0. 05 micrograms of IAA carried through the procedure. A distinct <b>colored</b> <b>spot</b> was also obtained frorn the extract of a 20 -gram sample of fresh wheat leaves. On the basis of the color test and the growth activity in the Avena elongation test, the concentration of IAA in the shoots of wheat seedlings was estimated at 1. 5 - 3. 0 X 10 ⁻³ micrograms per gram fresh weight. A comparison of the growth-promoting activities of wheat extracts in the Avena elongation tests showed that the IAA leveI of untreated wheat was greater than in CCC-treated wheat...|$|E

Rf values are 0.67 (BAW) and 0.07 (15 % AcOH) which were {{in the range of}} aglycones. 1 H-NMR spectra (400 MHZ, DMSO-d 6) showed different sets of resonances; two meta-coupled aromatic protons at A-ring were appeared at δH 6.19 (1 H, d, J[*]=[*] 2.1  Hz, H- 6) and 6.41  ppm (1 H, d, J[*]=[*] 2.1  Hz, H- 8).

The most downfield protonappeared at δH 12.5  ppm (1 H, s, 5 -OH).

40|$|A {{flat panel}} color display is {{provided}} in which white collimated light incident on a light coupling means having a metal layer and a liquid crystal layer formed on a surface of the coupling means produces a <b>colored</b> <b>spot</b> of light at the interface of the metal layer and liquid crystal layer through the excitation of surface plasmons. The present invention utilizes the color selective scattering of incident white light by surface plasmons and includes a coupling device, such as a high index glass prism, with a metal film layer and a liquid crystal layer formed on the coupling device. Surface plasmon waves can be generated at a negative dielectric (metal layer) -positive dielectric (liquid crystal layer) interface when the dispersion relationship is satisfied. The incident white light includes photons which have frequencies approximately equal to the plasmon resonance, and such photons are strongly scattered. Photons having a frequency other than the plasmon resonance will be totally reflected. The dispersion relationship of the metal-liquid crystal interface depends on the dielectric constant of the metal, which is not typically variable, and the dielectric constant of the liquid crystal, which is variable. An external voltage control/modulator {{may be used to}} vary the dielectric constant of the liquid crystal, thereby controlling the plasmon resonance condition and the frequencies (color) of the scattered photons...|$|E
