40|$|Graphene {{growth on}} metal {{substrates}} (Cu, Ni etc.) by catalyzed {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) is a highly suitable method for large scale production [1, 2]. However, graphene based electronic devices full realization requires a clean and reproducible graphene transfer on non-conducting substrates, which is still a challenge. The conventional wet <b>chemical</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> [3] involves polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) spin coated on monolayer graphene on Cu foil, followed by Cu wet etching, wet transfer, drying and PMMA removal. Here we present an improved conventional wet <b>chemical</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> to obtain a high quality graphene, with significantly reduced defect density and polymer residues and free of metallic contaminants. The various modified steps in the conventional wet <b>chemical</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> and their significance will be discussed. Graphene was grown by CVD on Cu foils at 1050 °C, under 10 torr Ar:H 2 :CH 4 atmosphere. The as-grown and transferred graphene samples were characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Further, the transport properties were studied by Hall effect measurements. The large area, high quality and residue free monolayer graphene on insulator will serve for next generation graphene based applications. [1] Li X. et. al., Science 324, 2009, 1312 - 1314.

40|$|This thesis investigates new {{alternative}} {{materials for}} flexible transparent electrodes: monolayer graphene and micron-scale metal mesh structures. Growth of graphene on copper foils by {{chemical vapour deposition}} (CVD) was investigated by commissioning and developing a CVD system in Tyndall. Initial growth runs resulted in poor graphene coverage. Several routes for growth improvement were examined: an acid pre-treatment, substrate geometry and growth pressure. Following this improvement, a continuous growth run was carried out displaying high monolayer graphene coverage. Graphene was transferred to Si/SiO 2 (90 nm thermal oxide) and glass substrates using a wet <b>chemical</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process.</b> This process {{involves the use of}} a polymer which acts as a support mechanism. However, polymer residue can have drastic effects on the electrical performance of CVD graphene films. Therefore an alternative method for polymer removal with the use of heated acetone (~ 60 oC) was investigated. Micron-scale platinum mesh structures were fabricated on rigid glass substrates using a range of metal deposition techniques; metal evaporation and lift-off; ALD and dry etching and sputter deposition and dry etching. Square, hexagonal, circular and a new asymmetric pentagonal tiling were utilised as metal meshes. Their performance were investigated along with the metal deposition technique. Evaporation and lift-off provided the most consistent technique in relation to transparency, haze and sheet resistance. Finally, asymmetric pentagonal platinum meshes were fabricated on flexible transparent substrates using metal evaporation and lift-off. All designs were bent around a radius of curvature (in air) of ~ 3. 8 mm up to 1, 000 bending cycles for both tension and compression and suggested good performance in comparison to literature. All three designs were used as transparent heaters via Joule heating. All heaters demonstrated good thermal characteristics such as low response times and high thermal resistances. Finally, a pentagonal metal mesh was used to de-ice a glass substrate...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} yields and product {{composition}} {{obtained from the}} stepwise pyrolysis of pine wood in a fluidized bed reactor. The first step temperature was varied between 260 °C and 360 °C. After the first step, the solid residue was cooled to ambient temperature and pyrolyzed again at 530 °C. If the first step temperature was below 290 °C, the cumulated yields (the sum of steps 1 and 2) were identical to yields of the single-step experiment at 530 °C. This indicates that the <b>chemical</b> and <b>transfer</b> <b>processes</b> taking place below 290 °C do not lead to chemical and structural changes that affect {{the outcome of the}} processes occurring in the temperature range from 290 °C to 530 °C. When the first step temperature was higher than 310 °C the cumulated yields of char, water, light organic compounds, and furans were higher, whereas the cumulated yields of volatiles (gases plus organic liquids) were lower than those obtained if the pyrolysis was conducted in a single step at 530 °C. To explain these observations, a mechanism is proposed in which the main emphasis lies on the competition between routes that lead to char formation and routes that release compounds from the biomass particle. Single compounds and lumped groups could not be concentrated with the stepwise approach. A separation into lighter and heavier oils turned out to be possible...|$|R

The system {{consists of three}} layers (the char layer, the uncharred layer, and an optical insulation layer) with concentrated heat sinks at the back surface and between {{the second and third}} layers. The equations are solved numerically by using a modified implicit finite difference scheme to obtain solutions for the thickness of the charred and uncharred layers, surface recession and pyrolysis rates, solid temperatures, porosity profiles, and profiles of pyrolysis-gas temperature, pressure, composition, and flow rate.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are: (1) to numerically examine the multiscale effects of physical and <b>chemical</b> mass <b>transfer</b> <b>processes</b> on watershed scale, variably saturated subsurface contaminant transport, and (2) to conduct numerical simulations on watershed scale reactive solute transport and evaluate their implications to uncertainty characterization and cost benefit analysis. Concurrent physical and chemical nonequilibrium caused by inter aggregate gradients of pressure head and solute concentration and intra-aggregate geochemical and microbiological processes, respectively, may arise at various scales and flowpaths. To this date, experimental investigations of these complex processes at watershed scale remain a challenge and numerical studies are often needed for guidance of water resources management and decision making. This research integrates the knowledge bases developed during previous experimental and numerical investigations at a proposed waste disposal site at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to study the concurrent effects of physical and chemical nonequilibrium. Comparison of numerical results with field data indicates that: (1) multiregion, preferential flow and solute transport exist under partially saturated condition and can be confirmed theoretically, and that (2) mass transfer between pore regions is an important process influencing contaminant movement in the subsurface. Simulations of watershed scale, multi species reactive solute transport suggest that dominance of geochemistry and hydrodynamics may occur simultaneously at different locales and influence the movement of one species relative to another. Execution times on the simulations of the reactive solute transport model also indicate that the model is ready to assist the selection of important parameters for site characterization...|$|R

40|$|Two {{competing}} {{directions in}} elementary chemical or transport steps are analyzed {{from the viewpoint}} of their contribution to the overall rates. Systems with nonlinear transport phenomena and chemical reactions are described by the equations of nonlinear kinetics of the Marcelin-Kohnstamm&ndash;de Donder type that contain terms exponential with respect to the Planck potentials and temperature reciprocal. Simultaneously these equations are analytical expressions characterizing the transport of the substance or energy through the energy barrier. They constitute potential representations of a generalized law of mass action that includes the effect of transfer phenomena and external fields. Important are the physical consequences of these kinetics near and far from equilibrium. In these developments nonlinear symmetries and generalized affinity are important.

A spatial and temporal analysis of the stresses within the particle showed that the radial stress is caused primarily by the pressure of generated volatiles.

Close to the surface, it changes its sign. In the particle cross-section, the radial stress prevails close to the particle center, whilst the tangential stress is dominant in the surface region.

The using of the convection-diffusion type of models for quantitative analysis of the processes in column apparatuses is not possible because the velocity function in the convection-diffusion equation is unknown. The problem can be avoided if the average values of the velocity and concentration over the cross-sectional area of the column are used.

As they exhibit a variety of size- and shape dependent physical and chemical properties, a very good control of the reaction conditions {{is the key to}} obtain particles with desired characteristics. Conventional approaches for nanoparticles synthesis are based on wet chemical synthesis in stirred tank. But this kind of system generally yields particles with rather broad size distributions because of the low mixing efficiency and wide residence time distributions. Miniaturization of synthesis systems offers many advantages, including cost saving from reduced consumption of reagents and safer operation since the process consumes much reduced hazardous <b>chemical.</b> Further, <b>transfer</b> <b>processes,</b> mixing of reactants as well as residence time are fast in miniaturized systems, which is favorable for the generation of nanosized particles with a narrow size distribution. The present work aims at the production of hydroxyapatite (HAp) Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2 nanocrystals at physiological conditions of temperature and pH, with controlled size distribution and high biocompatibility, making them suitable for application in bone replacement. For this, precipitation of HAp was investigated in meso- and micro-scale systems. Part of the work consists in a comparative study between HAp precipitation in batch in a 1 L stirred tank and in a novel oscillatory flow meso reactor (meso-OFR) of about 4. 5 mL, developed at CEB. The experiments were performed under the same conditions of temperature (T= 37 ºC), initial Ca/P molar ratio and power density (31. 5 W/m 3). Both systems yielded HAp nanoparticles at a pH close to 7 for an initial Ca/P = 1. 33, HAp particles being produced faster in the meso-OFR, namely due to a higher mixing efficiency. Precipitation of HAp was also studied in continuous in two ultrasonic microreactors, a tubular microreactor of 600 L and a Teflon stack microreactor with an integrated piezoelectric element of 1000 L.

40|$|In this work, new spectroscopic {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to measure electric dipole moments of highly excited rovibrational states of small polyatomic molecules in the gas phase. These techniques make use of lasers arid of microwave synthesizers. They enable one to measure the change on a molecular system caused by applying an external electric field, which is called Stark effect and from this, extract the dipole moment. The first technique, called microwave Stark spectroscopy, makes use of microwave-optical double resonance combined to either laser induced fluorescence or vibrational predissociation detection. The second approach, called Stark induced quantum beat spectroscopy, relies on the time evolution of a coherently prepared molecular wavepacket in an electric field, using either electronic photodissociation or laser induced fluorescence for detection. These {{techniques have}} been applied to H 2 C 0, HOCl, HDO, and H 20 for whom the electric dipole moment have been measured for several highly excited rovibrational states of the ground electronic state. Using these experimental measurements, the dependence of the dipole moment vector, both in orientation and in magnitude, on the vibrational excitation is discussed. Moreover the experimental data are used to test ab initio calculations potential energy and dipole moment surfaces and to establish critical benchmarks for future improvements.
