50|$|In 1986, slit rolling was {{introduced}} to Hadeed's Rolling Mills, increasing the daily production record by more than 21%. In 1987, a scrap car shredder plant was commissioned. With a capacity of 50 tonnes per hour, it shreds cars into pieces small enough to be charged into the electric arc furnaces. In 1988, Hadeed introduced a new technology (Bar Quenching) to its rolling mills in Jubail for the manufacture of <b>concrete</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> This process involves high pressure surface quenching followed by self-tempering. As the bar emerges from the last rolling stand, the surface temperature is rapidly reduced by high pressure water jets. This action causes change in the microstructure of the steel, making it harder and stronger. Subsequently the heat retained in the core dissipates out and heats the surface to around 620 °C causing another change in the microstructure, which improves the ductility and toughness of the bar. This process can meet increasing demands from structural engineers for higher yield strength combined with good ductility and weldability in reinforcing steel to reduce construction costs.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} years, many {{research}} {{efforts have been}} carried out on the bond strength between normal strength <b>concrete</b> (NSC) and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> spliced in tension zones in beams. Many codes gave a minimum splice length for tension and compression reinforcement as a factor of the bar diameter depending on many parameters such as concrete strength, steel yield stress, shape of bar end, shape of bar surface and also bar location. Also, codes gave another restriction about the percentage of total reinforcement to be spliced at the same time. Comparatively limited attention has been directed toward the bond between high strength <b>concrete</b> (HSC) and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> spliced in tension zones in beams. HSC has high modulus of elasticity, high density and long-term durability. This research presents an experimental study on the bond between high strength <b>concrete</b> (HSC) and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> spliced in tension zones in beams. It reports the influence of several parameters on bond in splices. The parameters covered are casting position, splice length as a factor of bar diameter, bar diameter and reinforcement ratio. The research involved tests on sixteen simply-supported beams of 1800 mm span, 200 mm width and 400 mm thickness made of HSC.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of designing steel-free <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures offers an interesting approach to overcome deterioration {{problems associated with}} the corrosion of steel reinforcement. This research project investigates steel-free precast prestressed concrete bridge deck systems, with the objectives of increasing the service life of new bridge decks and understanding their structural behaviour. The project was initiated after a major repair of the bridge deck systems on the Jacques-Cartier Bridge in Montreal, which was carried out during summer 2001 - 02. The final solution for the replacement of the bridge deck was the use of precast prestressed concrete decks with conventional steel tendons and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> The bridge decks were rebuilt because the existing steel tendons and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> were severely damaged over the years by corrosion. Full-scale concrete bridge panel prototypes reinforced with carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) prestressing tendons and glass fibre-reinforced polymers (GFRPs) as stirrups and slab reinforcement were constructed and tested up to failure. The results of these prototypes were compared to those of normal steel reinforced and steel prestressed concrete panel specimens. Each prototype was loaded under three different configurations until cracks first appeared to study the service state. It was then loaded at mid-span until failure to study the ultimate state. The behaviour of the panels was characterized by the mid-span and third point deflections and also by the strains obtained from the gauges fixed on the tendons, <b>concrete,</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> and stirrups. Based on the testing of four full-scale panels, the thesis presents comparisons on the serviceability, ultimate strength, and failure modes.

25|$|Hydro{{demolition}} is {{not used}} as much for demolition {{as it is for}} surface restoration and protection projects. When concrete has deteriorated or the reinforcing steel has begun to corrode, it is necessary to remove any unsound <b>concrete</b> and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> (rebar) in order to replace it with new concrete and maintain the integrity of the structure. This process has also been used to remove sound concrete that is not compromised in any way. This may be done to install a preventive cathodic protection system, or to remove concrete in structures in which vibration is a concern. Unlike jackhammers, hydrodemolition does not produce vibrations throughout a structure and therefore does not introduce micro fractures.|$|R

50|$|Fusion bonded epoxy coating, {{also known}} as fusion-bond epoxy powder coating and {{commonly}} referred to as FBE coating, is an epoxy-based powder coating that is widely used to protect steel pipe used in pipeline construction, <b>concrete</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> (rebar) and {{on a wide variety of}} piping connections, valves etc. from corrosion. FBE coatings are thermoset polymer coatings. They come under the category of protective coatings in paints and coating nomenclature. The name fusion-bond epoxy is due to resin cross-linking and the application method, which is different from a conventional paint. The resin and hardener components in the dry powder FBE stock remain unreacted at normal storage conditions. At typical coating application temperatures, usually in the range of 180 to 250 C, the contents of the powder melt and transform to a liquid form. The liquid FBE film wets and flows onto the steel surface on which it is applied, and soon becomes a solid coating by chemical cross-linking, assisted by heat. This process is known as “fusion bonding”. The chemical cross-linking reaction taking place in this case is irreversible. Once the curing takes place, the coating cannot be returned to its original form by any means. Application of further heating will not “melt” the coating and thus it is known as a “thermoset” coating. The world's leading FBE manufacturers are Valspar, SolEpoxy (former Henkel/Dexter), KCC Corporation, Jotun Powder Coatings, Sherwin-Williams, 3M, Axalta Coating Systems, Akzo Nobel, BASF, Manifa Paints and Powder Coatings and Rohm & Haas.|$|R
