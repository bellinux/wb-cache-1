5|$|A white dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Sun, while its volume is <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity {{comes from the}} emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion {{takes place in a}} white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910.

40|$|A {{series of}} 4 -(methylsulfonyl) aniline {{derivatives}} were synthesized {{in order to}} obtain new compounds as a potential anti-inflammatory agents with expected selectivity against COX- 2 enzyme. In vivo acute anti-inflammatory activity of the final compounds 11 – 14 was evaluated in rat using an egg-white induced edema model of inflammation in a dose equivalent to 3 mg/Kg of diclofenac sodium. All tested compounds produced significant reduction of paw edema with respect to the effect of propylene glycol 50 % v/v (control group). Moreover, the activity of compounds 11 and 14 was significantly higher than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> diclofenac sodium (at 3 mg/Kg) in the 120 – 300 minute time interval, while compound 12 expressed a <b>comparable</b> effect <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> diclofenac sodium in the 60 – 240 minute time interval time, and compound 13 showed a <b>comparable</b> effect <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> diclofenac sodium at all experimental times. The result of this study indicates <b>that</b> the incorporation <b>of</b> the 4 -(methylsulfonyl) aniline pharamacophore into naproxen, indomethacine, diclofenac and mefanamic acid maintained their anti-inflammatory activity and may increase selectivity towards the COX- 2 enzyme which will be confirmed in the future by assessing COX- 2 : COX- 1 inhibitory ratios using a whole blood assay...|$|R
