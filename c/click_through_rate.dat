40|$|Recency ranking {{refers to}} the ranking of web results by {{accounting}} for both relevance and freshness. This is particularly important for “recency sensitive ” queries such as breaking news queries. In this study, we propose a set of novel click features to improve machine learned recency ranking. Rather than computing simple aggregate <b>click</b> <b>through</b> <b>rates,</b> we derive these features using the temporal <b>click</b> <b>through</b> data and query reformulation chains. One of the features that we use is click buzz that captures the spiking interest of a url for a query. We also propose time weighted <b>click</b> <b>through</b> <b>rates</b> which treat recent observations as being exponentially more important. The promotion of fresh content is typically determined by the query intent which can change dynamically over time. Quite often users query reformulations convey clues about the query’s intent. Hence we enrich our click features by following query reformulations which typically benefit the first query {{in the chain of}} reformulations. Our experiments show these novel features can improve the NDCG 5 of a major online search engine’s ranking for “recency sensitive ” queries by up to 1. 57 %. This is {{one of the very few}} studies that exploits temporal <b>click</b> <b>through</b> data and query reformulations for recency ranking...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In this dissertation, I model {{generalized}} second price (GSP) auction for keyword {{search to}} analyze the optimal bidding strategies of the participating advertisers. The results also apply to a more general setting where multiple goods are being auctioned off. The study in chapter 3 examines the bidding strategies of the advertisers in a complete information static GSP auction. The results show that unlike in standard second price auction, truthful bidding is never a dominant strategy in general second price auction. In chapter 4, I have developed a model of static incomplete information GSP auction. I characterize all possible pure strategy Bayes [...] Nash equilibrium {{of the game and}} show that the consideration of the <b>click</b> <b>through</b> <b>rates</b> ratio {{plays a key role in}} determining the equilibrium bidding strategies for the advertisers. Specifically, I find that when the <b>click</b> <b>through</b> <b>rates</b> ratio exceeds a critical value, there will be no pure strategy Bayes-Nash equilibrium. The analysis also reveals that in a game of static incomplete information no asymmetric bidding equilibrium would prevail. The study in chapter 5 analyzes a model of incomplete information dynamic GSP auction. I find that in a dynamic game, the existence of both separating strategy equilibrium and pooling strategy equilibrium would depend upon critical values of <b>click</b> <b>through</b> <b>rates</b> ratio. I also prove that the advertisers with high valuation for a keyword will either reveal their identities at the very beginning or at the very end of this dynamic game. The results also show that when search engines do not publish the bidding history (i. e. there is 'minimum disclosure of information'), the advertisers will never try to mimic each other or in other words, there will be no pooling strategy equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Computational Advertising is the {{currently}} emerging multidimensional statistical modeling sub-discipline in digital advertising industry. Web pages visited per user {{every day is}} considerably increasing, resulting in an enormous access to display advertisements (ads). The {{rate at which the}} ad is clicked by users is termed as the <b>Click</b> <b>Through</b> <b>Rate</b> (CTR) of an advertisement. This metric facilitates the measurement of the effectiveness of an advertisement. The placement of ads in appropriate location leads to the rise in the CTR value that influences the growth of customer access to advertisement resulting in increased profit rate for the ad exchange, publishers and advertisers. Thus it is imperative to predict the CTR metric in order to formulate an efficient ad placement strategy. This paper proposes a predictive model that generates the <b>click</b> <b>through</b> <b>rate</b> based on different dimensions of ad placement for display advertisements using statistical machine learning regression techniques such as multivariate linear regression (LR), poisson regression (PR) and support vector regression(SVR). The experiment result reports that SVR based click model outperforms in predicting CTR through hyperparameter optimization.

For example, YouTube provides video search, related video recommendation and front page highlight. The understanding of how these features drive video views is useful for creating a strategy to drive video popularity. In this paper, we perform a measurement study on data sets crawled from YouTube and find that the related video recommendation, which recommends the videos {{that are related to}} the video a user is watching, {{is one of the most}} important view sources of videos. Despite the fact that the YouTube video search is the number one source of views in aggregation, the related video recommendation is the main source of views for the majority of the videos on YouTube. Furthermore, our results reveal that there is a strong correlation between the view count of a video and the average view count of its top referrer videos. This implies that a video has a higher chance to become popular when it is placed on the related video recommendation lists of popular videos. We also find that the <b>click</b> <b>through</b> <b>rate</b> from a video to its related videos is high and the position of a video in a related video list plays a critical role in the <b>click</b> <b>through</b> <b>rate.</b> Finally, our evaluation of the impact of the related video recommendation system on the diversity of video views indicates that the current recommendation system helps to increase the diversity of video views in aggregation...|$|E
