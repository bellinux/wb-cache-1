50|$|The {{earliest}} decorated biscuit tin {{was commissioned}} in 1868 by Huntley & Palmers from the London firm of De La Rue to a design by Owen Jones. Early methods of printing included the transfer process (essentially {{the method used}} to decorate porcelain and pottery since about 1750) and the direct lithographic process, which involved laying an inked stone directly on to a sheet of tin. Its disadvantage was that correct <b>colour</b> <b>registration</b> was difficult. The breakthrough in decorative tin plate production was {{the invention of the}} offset lithographic process. It consists of bringing a sheet of rubber into contact with the decorated stone, and then setting-off the impression so obtained upon the metal surface. The advantages over previous methods of printing were that any number of colours could be used, correctly positioned, and applied to an uneven surface if necessary. Thus the elaborately embossed, colourful designs that were such a feature of the late Victorian biscuit tin industry became technically possible.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{paper cups}} were printed using rubber blocks mounted on cylinders, with a {{different}} cylinder for each <b>colour.</b> <b>Registration</b> across different colours was very difficult, but later flexography plates became available and {{with the use of}} mounting systems it became easier to register across the colours, allowing for more complex designs. Printing flexographic has become ideal for long runs and manufacturers generally use this method when producing over a million cups. Machines such as Comexi are used for this, which have been adapted to take the extra large reels that are required by paper cup manufacturers. Ink technology has also changed and where solvent-based inks were being used, water-based inks are instead being utilised. One of the side effects of solvent-based inks is that hot drink cups in particular can smell of solvent, whereas water-based inks have eliminated this problem.Other methods of printing have been used for short runs such as offset printing, which can vary from anything from 10,000 to 100,000 cups. Offset printing inks have also been developed and although in the past these were solvent based, the latest soya-based inks have reduced the danger of cups smelling. The latest development is Direct-printing, which allows printing on very small quantities, typically from 1,000 cups, and is used by companies including The Paper Cup Company offering small quantities in short lead times. Rotogravure can also be used, but this is extremely expensive and is normally only utilised for items requiring extremely high quality printing like ice cream containers.|$|E

40|$|Photogrammetry and Laser Scanning fusion is {{becoming}} increasingly common. This paper outlines the evaluation and semi-automated registration of single colour image to laser scanning point cloud data using canonical transformation and Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) registration methods. Laser scanning acquires 3 D data points and intensity values but is unable to directly obtain photorealistic colour in most cases. There are instances where digital images are taken of the object of interest with the intention to merge the 3 D data and image to reconstruct a photorealistic digital representation. Currently limited methods exist for the registration of multisensory platforms; a common method seen requires specially designed camera mounting. Another possibility is to transfer colour information from 2 D images to the 3 D points using photogrammetric methods. This method {{was inspired by the}} SCI method (Forkuo and King, 2005); the registration process utilises synthetic imagery calculated from laser scanning point clouds and matched with a camera image for <b>colour</b> <b>registration.</b> Evaluation is necessary as it provides a metric indication of accuracy and precision. The proposed research intends to aid in heritage and city modelling, to further feature detection methods, to provide cost effectiveness in industrial applications and to potentially improve model visualisation times...|$|E
40|$|This licentiate thesis {{examines}} {{and discusses}} colour images, especially colour schemes, {{as a tool}} and method {{in the study of}} colour in the garden. The hypothesis is that the colour image is a tool to interpret, analyse, compose and record. Images can be descriptive or figurative and abstract or non-figurative in nature. The study is based on the teaching of colour theory and plant composition as developed and applied in the training program ”Gardening and Garden Design” in the Department of Conservation/Dacapo at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The overriding research question is: How can colour images of various kinds, especially the colour schematic diagram, be devised and used in the study of colour in gardens, flower beds and the landscape? The question is investigated through studies of different aspects: individual plants, nature habitats, gardens, literature, and the design of plant composition. The result is a model with different types of colour images that have various functions. The features include: intentions and thoughts, colour composition, <b>colour</b> <b>registration,</b> colour interpretation, and colour scheme. The borders between the different image types are not distinct. It is not possible to isolate a single feature in an image, as the creation of the image always includes an interpretation. färgill...|$|E

The 747-400ER included the option of one or two additional 3240 gal body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by Marshall Aerospace, these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks featured a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the Boeing 777-200LR and Boeing P-8A Poseidon. Other changes to the 747-400ER include relocation of oxygen system components and the potable water system tanks and pumps since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Il-78 have the fuselage pod mounted on a short horizontal pylon, but the Il-78M has the fuselage pod suspended from an identical pylon to the wing pods, attached to a short stub wing. This modification was served to isolate the pod from turbulence generated by the fuselage, with {{the added benefit of}} commonality with the wing pod/pylon combination. Some Il-78s were produced with Aeroflot <b>colours</b> and civilian <b>registrations,</b> but production Il-78Ms received military markings, <b>registration</b> and <b>colour</b> scheme.|$|R

50|$|While colour {{printing}} in Japan {{dates to the}} 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink. Colour was sometimes added by hand, using a red lead ink in tan-e prints, or later in a pink safflower ink in beni-e prints. Colour printing arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour. Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours. The mid-1760s brought full-colour nishiki-e prints made from ten or more woodblocks. To keep the blocks for each <b>colour</b> aligned correctly <b>registration</b> marks called kentō were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.|$|R

5000|$|Dismissed {{from his}} {{teaching}} position, he takes refuge on his lesbian daughter Lucy's {{farm in the}} Eastern Cape. For a time, his daughter's influence and natural rhythms of the farm promise to harmonise his discordant life; for example, in attending farmers markets where Lucy sells her wares, and in working with Petrus, a polygamously-married black African whose farm borders Lucy's and who nominally works for Lucy as a [...] "dog-man" [...] (Lucy boards dogs). But {{the balance of power}} in the country is shifting. Shortly after becoming comfortable with rural life, he is forced to come to terms with the aftermath of an attack on the farm. Three men, who claim to need Lucy's phone to call for aid for a sick sister, force their way into the farmhouse. The men are armed with firearms, rape Lucy, and attempt to kill David by setting him on fire. In addition to these actions, they also shoot a collection of caged dogs which Lucy is boarding, in an action which David later muses was done since black people in South Africa are taught to fear dogs as symbols of white power and oppression. The men drive off in David's car: it is never recovered and they are never caught, although police once contact David to come pick up [...] "his" [...] car, which is in fact evidently not his car (different <b>colour</b> and <b>registration</b> number). Newspapers spell Lurie's name inaccurately ("Lourie"), meaning nothing will tie his persona of disgraced academic to the attack.|$|R
50|$|The Yorkshire Terrier is a tan {{dog with}} a blue saddle. Particolours exist, {{although}} they are not correct for the breed standard. The particolour coat is white with black/blue and tan. The white {{is caused by the}} recessive Piebald-gene. It is very rare to get a particolour, and if one is found, it tends to be very expensive. Some Yorkshire Terriers are solid golden, they only produce pheomelanin, others are liver or chocolate, a brown colour; they only produce brown eumelanin but are unable to produce black eumelanin. The breed is defined by its colour, and such non-standard colours may indicate health problems or cross-breeding with other breeds of other <b>colours.</b> The AKC <b>registration</b> form for Yorkshire Terriers allows for four choices: blue and tan, blue and gold, black and tan, black and gold. Colour alone will not affect whether or not a dog is a good companion and pet. Even though off-coloured Yorkshire Terriers are advertised at premium prices, being of an unusual or atypical colour is neither new, desirable, nor exotic.|$|R
40|$|The UK’s Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Act 1883, {{introduced}} {{provision for}} trade marks in colours. However, notwithstanding this statutory provision, {{there was an}} ongoing conservative approach to the approval of colour trade marks. In 1887, the Chancery Division considered an application for the <b>registration</b> of the <b>colours</b> blue, white and red {{in the form of}} a Tricolor, on a label for a well-known brand of French coffee. 1 In handing down his judgement, Kay J remarked:“ [...] . you cannot register a mark of which the only distinction is the use of a colour, because, practically under the terms of the act, that would give you a monopoly of all the colours of the rainbow". 2 The application was refused, but on the grounds that the trade mark lacked distinctiveness independently of the colour, and that the colour should, in essence, be deemed an accident. This paper examines the recent judicial decisions on the <b>registration</b> of <b>colour</b> trade marks in respect of two longstanding and contentious cases, namely BP Amoco plc (BP) in respect of the colour green and Cadbury Schweppes (Cadbury) in respect of the colour purple. With both possibly well nigh at the end of their respective litigation rainbows – with nary an oil strike or purple patch in sight, they have been the catalyst for the establishment of new parameters for the distinctiveness requirements of <b>colour</b> trade mark <b>registration...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 26, 233 calving records from three {{commercial}} ranches: Mogwooni, Galana and O'ljorai; located in high altitude, humid and low altitude, coastal, and medium altitude rangelands of Kenya, {{were available for}} the study over periods between 10 and 30 years. The traits studied were: age at first calving and calving interval. Ranch, year and month of calving, parity, sex previous parous status, coat <b>colour,</b> cow <b>registration</b> class effects were fitted and adjusted for as fixed effects depending on the trait. The mixed models included the same fixed effects plus animal and permanent environment as random effects. Variance components and genetic parameter estimates were obtained from univariate analyses within ranch, using the Derivative Free Restricted Maximum Likelihood (DFREML) program of Meyer (1991). Phenotypic and genetic trends were obtained using DFREML's mixed animal model 1 to estimate the phenotypic, genetic and environmental components which were then averaged and weighted for each animal records within year of entry for each trait within ranch. The respective component values were plotted {{over the years to}} give the yearly trends. Age at first calving phenotypically and environmentally deteriorated by 2. 0 (+ or -) 2. 6 and 5. 7 (+ or -) 2. 0 days/year in Mogwooni, while the genetic component improved at a rate of - 0. 35 days/year over the study period. Phenotypic changes in CI were - 0. 14 (+ or -) 0. 08, 3. 98 (+ or -) 1. 44 and 1. 41 (+ or -) 0. 90 days/year for Mogwooni, Galana and O'ljorai herds respectively, while the corresponding genetic changes were: - 0. 14 (+ or-) 1 and - 0. 02 (+ or -) 0. 05 days/year for Mogwooni and O'ljorai respectively, were desirable, while Galana cows registered a significant genetic deterioration (3. 3 (+ or -) days/year) in CI over the same period. From the results, it can be concluded that: Little advantage were taken of the existing opportunities (improved environmental trends and substantial additive genetic variability among animals) and therefore insignificant genetic gains were achieved for traits, mainly due to use of inadequate selection criteria as well as inept animal evaluation methods. Use of more directly measurable reproductive traits such as scrotal circumference, coupled with the use of Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) procedures for animal evaluation would enhance genetic improvements in overall performance of Kenya Boran cows under rangelands conditions and are therefore recommended...|$|R
40|$|The colours {{of early}} non-fiction films – {{although}} variously elusive in their photographic registration – {{were designed to}} be viewed sensuously. 1 Colour, although complicated by the technical limits of photographic technologies, was a topic {{of concern for the}} scientific study of Antarctic wildlife, the landscape, and the chromatic effects of meteorological phenomena during the Heroic Age of Polar Exploration (1897 – 1922). The last decades of the nineteenth century saw the Royal Geographical Society invest in the lantern slide lecture as an educational model able to entice and entertain public interest: in popular exhibition, sensationalism and geography were already linked. 2 Natural phenomena such as a flower opening or the uncertain movement of a storm at sea could offer an enchanting spectacle and as Gunning suggests, even in films with little narrative to discern, ‘colour seems to function as an attraction, a very direct visual stimulus. It’s something to look at, something to surprise you, to amaze you’. 3 An analysis of the exhibition and performance of the photographic and cinematographic materials produced by Herbert G Ponting on Captain R F Scott’s fated British Antarctic Expedition 1910 – 13 and in reference to Frank Hurley’s work on Earnest Shackleton’s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition 1914 – 16 indicates that although <b>colour</b> eluded direct <b>registration</b> by any single medium (photography, film, sketches, watercolours, journals, meteorological notes), its recurrence in narratives and representations of the Antarctic for public exhibition is significant.
