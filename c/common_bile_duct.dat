5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> or the frank extrusion of pus from the <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>duct.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>duct)</b> are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E

5|$|On February 12, 2006, {{shortly after}} the {{beginning}} of the General Assembly's legislative session, Fletcher was hospitalized with abdominal pain. Doctors at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington found a gallstone in his <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> and also diagnosed him with an inflamed pancreas and gallbladder disease. After surgery to remove the gallbladder, Fletcher developed a blood infection that slowed his recovery, but was discharged from the hospital on March 1. Days later, he returned to St. Joseph's with a blood clot which had to be dissolved, resulting in another five-day stay in the hospital. Fletcher staffers insisted that his absence did not {{have a negative impact on}} his ability to get legislation passed during the session. A right-to-work law and a repeal of the state's prevailing wage law – both advocated by Fletcher – failed early in the session, but both had been considered unlikely to pass before the session started. Among the bills that did pass the session were a mandatory seat belt law, a law requiring children under 16 years old to wear a helmet when operating an all-terrain vehicle, and legislation allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted on Capitol grounds in a historical context.|$|E
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONAcute acalculous {{cholecystitis}} can {{be complicated}} by extrinsic compression of the <b>common</b> hepatic/common <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> by the enlarged and inflamed gallbladder followed by jaundice. Its mechanism {{is very similar}} to that of Mirizzi syndrome, when the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> is compressed from outside due to a stone impacted in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct. This complication of acalculous cholecystitis is rare, with very little number of published cases. PRESENTATION OF A CASEWe present a patient with compression of the common hepatic duct by an inflamed and enlarged gallbladder in the absence of stones as confirmed by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Acute cholecystitis and jaundice resolved after conservative treatment, and the changes were shown by a follow-up MRCP five months later. DISCUSSIONWe were able to find only three similar cases reported in the literature. In these cases, compression of the <b>common</b> hepatic/common <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> by the inflamed gallbladder was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and intraoperatively. Terminology to describe this condition has not been agreed upon. We consider it as a special kind of Mirizzi syndrome.

25|$|Most {{vertebrates}} have gallbladders, but {{the form}} and arrangement of the bile ducts may vary considerably.

25|$|Treatment {{is usually}} with laparoscopic {{gallbladder}} removal, within 24 hours if possible. Taking {{pictures of the}} bile ducts during the surgery is recommended.

25|$|When food {{containing}} fat {{enters the}} digestive tract, it stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) from I {{cells of the}} duodenum and jejunum. In response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>duct,</b> eventually draining into the duodenum. The bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption. Bile consists primarily of water and bile salts, and also acts {{as a means of}} eliminating bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin metabolism, from the body.|$|E

40|$|Mirizzi {{syndrome}} is a rarely observed complication of gallstone disease, causing major biliary problems, if not diagnosed previously. It {{was described in}} 1948 by P. L.

Impaction, acute obstruction and wall ischemia are causative for inflammation and abscess formation.

500|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is {{the most}} common approach in unblocking the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a fiberoptic tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of Vater and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making a cut in the sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the common bile duct; alternatively or additionally, the <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> orifice can be dilated with a balloon. Stones may be removed either by direct suction or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical lithotriptor in order to crush the stone prior to removal. Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. This technique uses acoustic shock waves administered outside the body to break down the stones. [...] An alternative technique to remove very large obstructing stones is electrohydraulic lithotripsy, where a small endoscope known as a cholangioscope is inserted by ERCP to directly visualize the stone.

Lobar cholestasis undetected by liver tests but seen on magnetic resonance imaging as a difference between ligated and unligated lobes, occurred in 15 out of 20 rats subjected to selective biliary obstruction within 48 hr after ligation, and recovered later on as a result of the development of <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> collaterals. Five rats failed to show local cholestasis as a result of the existence of interlobar accessory bile channels. All 18 total biliary obstruction-treated rats were cholestatic soon after ligation, as confirmed by high serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels and as documented by poor liver enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging. Cholestasis recovered within 4 wk with normalization of liver enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging as a result of the formation of <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> collaterals (as demonstrated by microcholangiographic and histological study). <b>Bile</b> <b>duct</b> collateral formation is responsible for the recovery from obstructive cholestasis in rats.

40|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>duct</b> {{injuries}} and subsequent leaks can occur following laparoscopic and open cholecystectomies and also during other hepatobiliary surgeries. Various patient related and technical factors are {{implicated in the}} causation of biliary injuries. Over a period of twenty five years managing such patients of biliary injuries our team has found a practical approach to assess the cause of biliary injuries based on the symptoms, clinical examination and imaging. Bismuth classification is helpful {{in most of the}} cases. Immediate referral to a centre experienced in the management of <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> injury and timely intervention is associated with improved outcomes. Resuscitation, correcting dyselectrolytemia, aspiration of undrained biloma and antibiotics take the priority in the management. The goal is to restore the bile conduit, and to prevent short and longterm complications such as biliary fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, biliary stricture, recurrent cholangitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Endoscopic therapy by reducing the transpapillary pressure gradient helps in reducing the leak. Endoscopic therapy with biliary sphincterotomy alone or with additional placement of a biliary stent/ nasobiliary drainage is advocated. In our tertiary care referral unit, we found endoscopic interventions are useful in situations where there is leak with associated CBD calculus or a foreign body, peripheral <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> injury, cystic duct stump leak and partial <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> injury with leak/ narrowing of the lumen. Endotherapy is not useful in case of complete transection (total cut off) and complete stricture involving common hepatic or <b>common</b> <b>bile</b> <b>ducts.</b> In conclusion, endoscopic treatment can be considered a highly effective therapy and should be the first-line therapy in such patients.
