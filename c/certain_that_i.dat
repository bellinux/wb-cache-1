A year later he followed Zaremba to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Tchaikovsky would not give up his Ministry post [...] "until I am quite <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am destined to be a musician rather than a civil servant." [...] From 1862 to 1865 he studied harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Zaremba, while Rubinstein taught him instrumentation and composition. In 1863 he abandoned his civil service career and studied music full-time, graduating in December 1865.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{abolition}} of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: [...] "I never, in my life, felt more <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." [...] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.|$|E

In 2017, Corman said, [...] "I actually sued the video game manufacturer who flat-out stole the idea. We {{settled out of court}} and they gave me some money. I retain the right to remake it, but the way it was actually written in the contract is a little bit cloudy. My lawyers are actually studying that contract to make <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a clear title to remake my picture, and I will remake Grand Theft Auto." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{shooting}} {{a movie in}} Arizona, Stewart {{received a phone call}} from Dr. Keagy, his veterinarian, who informed him that Beau was terminally ill, and that Gloria sought his permission to perform euthanasia. Stewart declined to give a reply over the phone, and told Keagy to [...] "keep him alive and I'll be there." [...] Stewart requested several days' leave, which allowed him to spend some time with Beau before granting the doctor permission to euthanize the sick dog. Following the procedure, Stewart sat in his car for ten minutes to clear his eyes of tears. Stewart later remembered:After [...] died there were a lot of nights when I was <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could feel him get into bed beside me and I would reach out and pat his head. The feeling was so real that I wrote a poem about it and how much it hurt to realize that he wasn’t going to be there any more.|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao often praised Xun You and said, [...] "Gongda is {{intelligent}} but appears foolish; he is courageous but appears cowardly; he is resilient but appears weak. He neither flaunts {{his talents}} nor brags about his achievements. You {{can be as}} intelligent as him, but you can't pretend to be foolish {{as well as he}} does. Even Master Yan and Dou Wu cannot be compared to him." [...] When Cao Pi was still Cao Cao's heir apparent, his father told him, [...] "Xun Gongda is a role model for people. You should treat him courteously and respectfully." [...] When Xun You was ill, Cao Pi visited him and knelt down beside his bed; such was Cao Pi's level of respect for Xun You. Zhong Yao also once said, [...] "Every time I plan something, I'll carefully think through it again and again until I'm <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't make any more changes. However, after consulting Gongda, he always has new insights to offer." [...] Xun You created 12 strategies for Zhong Yao. Zhong Yao died before he managed to finish writing a book about the 12 strategies, hence some of them were lost. The historian Pei Songzhi thought it was a huge pity that Xun You's strategies were lost because Zhong Yao {{died at the age of}} 79 – some 16 years after Xun You's death – so he probably should have had ample time to finish writing the book.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} Popes did issue papal bulls condemning [...] "unjust" [...] {{enslavement}} ("just" [...] enslavement was still accepted), and mistreatment of Native Americans by Spanish and Portuguese colonials; however, these were largely ignored. [...] Nonetheless, Catholic missionaries {{such as the}} Jesuits, who also owned slaves, worked to alleviate the suffering of Native American slaves in the New World. Debate about the morality of slavery continued throughout this period, with some books critical of slavery being placed on the Index of Forbidden Books by the Holy Office between 1573-1826. [...] Capuchin missionaries were excommunicated for calling for the emancipation of black slaves in the Americas. On 22 December 1741, Benedict XIV promulgated the papal bull [...] "Immensa Pastorum Principis" [...] against the enslavement of the indigenous peoples of the Americas and other countries. In spite of a stronger condemnation of unjust types of slavery by Pope Gregory XVI in his bull In supremo apostolatus issued in 1839, some American bishops continued to support slave-holding interests until the abolition of slavery. [...] In 1866 The Holy Office of Pope Pius IX affirmed that, subject to conditions, it was not against divine law for a slave to be sold, bought or exchanged. [...] In 1995 Pope John Paul II repeated the condemnation of [...] "infamies", including slavery, issued by the Second Vatican Council: [...] "Thirty years later, taking up {{the words of the}} Council and with the same forcefulness I repeat that condemnation {{in the name of the}} whole Church, <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am interpreting the genuine sentiment of every upright conscience..” ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Father John Francis Maxwell in 1975 {{published}} “Slavery and the Catholic Church: The {{history of}} Catholic teaching concerning the moral {{legitimacy of the}} institution of slavery”, [...] a book that {{was the product of}} seven years research. It recorded the instances where slavery was sanctioned by Councils and Popes and also censures and prohibitions that have been recorded throughout the history of the Church. He explains that what appears to the layman, not familiar with the intricacies of [...] Church teaching and law, to be contradictory teaching, often involving the same Pope, is actually only a reflection of the common and longstanding concept of [...] permissible “just slavery”, and “unjust slavery” which was subject to condemnation. [...] He shows by numerous examples from Council and Papal documents that “just slavery” was always an acceptable part of Catholic teaching right up {{until the end of the}} 19th century when the first steps were taken to place all forms of slavery under the ban. Since “just” slavery had been allowed by previous Councils and Popes he saw the declaration of slavery as an unconditional “infamy” in the Second Vatican Council pastoral constitution [...] “Gaudium et spes” as [...] a correction to what had been previously allowed, but not promulgated as infallible teaching. [...] Pope John Paul II in his encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (1995),when repeating the list of infamies that included slavery, [...] prefaced the passage in “Gaudium es spes” [...] with “ [...].Thirty years later, taking up the words of the Council and with the same forcefulness I repeat that condemnation in the name of the whole Church, <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am interpreting the genuine sentiment of every upright conscience..” ...|$|E
