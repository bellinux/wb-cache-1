Tests are performed on membrane samples bonded on four common structural materials, namely aluminium, steel, concrete, and fiberglass, to obtain the peel {{resistance of}} adhesives. Results show that adhesive B has the highest strength for aluminium, steel, and fiberglass substrates, and that adhesive C has the highest strength for the concrete substrate. The performance is also evaluated versus adhesive cost, a critical variable in SHM applications. Here, adhesive C performed best for all substrates. Lastly, membrane residuals resulting from the peel tests are compared. Tests show that Adhesive B resulted in the highest residual percentage for aluminium, while adhesive C performed better for all other substrates. However, membrane residuals for adhesive C do not show a positive correlation with the peel resistance...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{elastomers}} are materials {{capable of}} undergoing large deformation upon load application and recovering upon load removal. From car tires to building vibration isolator systems, elastomers {{are the most}} versatile of engineering materials. The inclusion of particulate fillers into elastomers enhances their mechanical properties (modulus, tensile strength, toughness, tear resistance, etc) thereby extending their applicability to more demanding functions. The automotive, healthcare, <b>construction,</b> <b>adhesives</b> and consumer products {{are some of the}} many industries that produce finished goods containing elastomeric parts. ^ Despite the various concepts on reinforcement in filled elastomers, a complete understanding of their linear viscoelastic properties and the nonlinear mechanical properties, including stress softening (Mullins), strain dependent dynamic modulus (Payne) and others remains elusive. Furthermore, studies on filled elastomers have failed to produce a unifying perspective on the relationship between the microstructural composition and the observed macroscopic response to deformation. To further the current understanding of the underlying physics of elastomer reinforcement, a comprehensive study on the effect of composition was undertaken. ^ A major challenge in the application of the Time-Temperature Superposition (TTS) principle for filled elastomers rests on the difficulty of conducting experiments in their linear regime, which could be at strains even lower than 10 - 3. In this work, the linear viscoelastic behavior of filled elastomers was studied via the successful application of TTS at extremely small strains using the double sandwich shear geometry. Well-defined master curves were constructed for a series of carbon black filled SBR and Polybutadiene elastomers. In addition, an investigation of the effects of filler volume fraction and structure on the full linear viscoelastic response was carried out. A critical analysis of the superposed data showed correlation of linear viscoelastic properties to measurable filler parameters specifically the effective volume fraction, 2 ̆ 6 phiv;eff, in which allowed for the first time collapsing on a single master curve the viscoelastic storage and loss moduli for all filled elastomers studied. ^ Nonlinear mechanical behavior was investigated on fumed silica filled Poly(dimethylsiloxane) rubber. For the first time, necking was observed for a lightly cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer filled with 30 phr (parts per hundred rubber) or more of high surface area (≥ 300 m 2 /g) fumed silica. A series of linear and nonlinear mechanical properties of the necked material were studied including (i) linear and nonlinear dynamic shear analysis including the Payne effect, (ii) uniaxial tension experiments including the Mullins effect, (iii) tensile strength, and (iv) tear resistance via the 2 ̆ 7 trouser 2 ̆ 7 test. The ultimate properties of the necked material were superior to its un-necked counterpart and both the Mullins and Payne effects were present in the necked material. The dynamic modulus exhibited anisotropy with respect to the direction of the necking deformation, where the anisotropy was not found in fumed silica filled PDMS elastomers that did not neck although the materials were pre-stretched to similar strains. Based upon these experimental observations, it was been postulated that necking occurs due to the breakage of delicate highly branched aggregates at the points of local stress concentrations. The preferential breakage of the most mechanically distressed aggregates will result in a more regular filler-matrix network, giving rise to higher ultimate properties of the necked material. This finding challenges the aggregate breakage postulate as a primary mechanism for the Mullins effect. ...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of biomass}} for {{industrial}} products is not new. Plants {{have long been}} used for clothes, shelter, paper, <b>construction,</b> <b>adhesives,</b> tools, and medicine. With the exploitation on fossil fuel usage in the early 20 th century and development of petroleum based refinery, the use of biomass for industrial application declined. Since the late 1960 s, the petroleum-based products have widely replaced the use of biomass-based products. However, depletion of fossil fuels, rising oil prices, and growing environmental awareness, push the attention and policy towards a transition from fossil into bio-based products. Bio-based products can also be obtained from protein. The amine group (-NH 2) in protein shows attractive functionality for nitrogen-containing chemicals production. In petroleum based conversion of crude oil into chemicals, co-reagents such as ammonia have to be used, and various process steps are involved. With the amine in protein, various co-reagent introducing process steps can be by-passed. Biomass refinery for protein might not only be necessary for supplying feedstock for the chemical industry, before all, {{it is important to}} meet the world protein demand for food and feed. Chapter 1 illustrates the protein shortage in 2030 that we will encounter with the current uses of protein in the diet of both humans and animals. The worldwide protein production may provide this demand only if we consider the biomass refinery for protein and use the protein product in an effective and efficient way according the specific need of food, feed, and chemical industry.   For this purpose, development in protein extraction technology from various types of biomass is essential. The thesis entitled “Biomass and its potential for protein and amino acids; valorizing agricultural by-products” describes possibilities for using agricultural by-products as protein and or amino acid resources. An overview on alkaline plant protein extraction was first presented, in Chapter 2, including the potential of addition of different types of enzymes. Protein extraction from common resources such as soybean meal and other oilseed meals were reviewed. Also new protein resources, like microalgae, were discussed on the applicability of alkali based methods for protein extraction. Most of the experimental studies opted for less than 100 min and 50 - 60 °C as extraction time and temperature, respectively. A typical biomass to solvent ratio of 1 : 10 was selected in some studies. Alkaline pH was selected over acidic pH, because it is far away from the isoelectric point (IEP). Most proteins have the lowest solubility at their IEP, which commonly occurs at pH 4 - 5. Adding proteases during protein extraction increased protein yield. Two types of extraction methods were experimentally researched in this study; alkaline and combined alkaline and enzymatic. In Chapter 3, alkaline protein extraction method was used to extract protein from 16 types of biomass, mostly agricultural by-products. Aiming to maximise protein extraction yields, a three step extraction was performed at elevated temperatures; 25, 60, and 120 °C. Protein yield was correlated to biomass chemical composition through Partial Least Square (PLS) regression. The results showed that protein extractability depended crucially on the type of biomass used. Protein from cereals and legumes were highly extracted, compared to other biomass. High protein extractability coincides with the biological function of protein as a storage protein, as opposed to functional protein. Protein extraction was furthermore correlated to the composition of the biomass. Especially cellulose and oil hamper extractability of protein, whereas lignin has no significant influence, suggesting that alkaline treatment removed lignin sufficiently. In Chapter 4, the effect of proteolysis during protein extraction was studied. Based on their working pHs, both alkaline and acidic proteases tested. Oilseed meals from soybean, rapeseed, and microalgae were considered as protein resource. Proteases that worked at acidic pH assisted protein extraction; but, still, more proteins were extracted using proteases that work at alkaline pH. This finding is in line with the literatures study from Chapter 2 mentioning that more proteins can be extracted at alkaline pH. Protex 40 XL, Protex P, and Protex 5 L that work at alkaline pH assisted protein extraction, particularly for rapeseed and microalgae meals. To a lesser extent, these proteases also improved protein extraction yield of soybean meal and untreated microalgae. Having shown that proteolysis aids in protein extraction, proteases were also used to solubilise wheat gluten at alkaline pH. Solubilising wheat gluten is one of the bottle necks for wheat gluten application. In this thesis, wheat gluten was used to represent wheat dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). From our perspective, more biomass by-products, such as wheat DDGS derived from ethanol production, will be available, also due to the target to replace 10 % fossil fuel with bio-based fuel in 2050. With high glutamic acid content, wheat gluten provides possibilities to serve as an amino acid resource. Glutamic acid, which currently is microbial produced, has potential as feedstock for bulk chemicals production. Large amounts of cheaper glutamic acid can be made available by enabling its production from biomass by-products, such as wheat DDGS. Several methods for producing glutamic acid from wheat gluten were developed and the results were presented in Chapter 5. We found that a combination of enzymatic and mild acid hydrolysis opens up new possibilities for the industrial production of glutamic acid from biomass. Finally, in Chapter 6, general knowledge obtained from this study is discussed and a perspective on biomass valorization for protein and/or amino acids is presented. It was concluded that biomass, and particularly agricultural residues, are potential resources for protein and/or amino acids. An outlook on protein and/or amino acids production from by-products was also provided in this chapter. For this, economic calculations were provided that focussed on the processing cost. Based on these calculations, overnight alkaline treatment at room temperature was most economical to extract protein from most types of biomass. Residual biomass following protein extraction can be used as animal feed or for energy usage to get to a more integrated biorefinery, thereby reducing protein production cost.    ...|$|E

As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} to reduce seismic damage to partition walls and other finishes in light-frame residential buildings, twenty full-scale gypsum-sheathed walls, built with wood and cold-formed steel framing members, were tested. The experiments investigated the effects of enhanced, inexpensive construction procedures with the objective to increase the racking strength and stiffness of partition-type shear walls, lessening seismic deformations. The stiffness, strength, and damage progression of the specimens with varying wall length, openings, orthogonal wall returns, tie-down and anchoring configurations, and interior and exterior sheathings are reported in this thesis. Iterative tests of specific interior wall geometries determined the optimal construction techniques required to reduce deformations and improve life-cycle performance. The main improvement to these specimens over typical construction {{was the use of}} <b>construction</b> <b>adhesive</b> and mechanical fasteners to attach the sheathing to the framing.

50|$|The Wall - During the {{demolition}} challenge, {{two of the}} bedroom's walls were also taken down. In its place {{on one of them}} will be a faux log finish. To do this, foam must be applied onto the wall before the faux wall pieces (roughly-hewn lumber) are attached. Then, parging must be used to fill the gaps between the wall pieces. Neither Eric nor Brian P had managed to buy the washers needed to attach the foam to the wall (Brian P also lacked screws); they make do with <b>construction</b> <b>adhesive</b> instead.

The shouting match between Brian M and Andrew gets so intense Eric (working within earshot) forces them both to shut up; telling them that they were being a distraction. Eric, though, passes this challenge despite the distraction. Angie fails due to having assembled her log pieces vertically (leaving nothing to support the parging, upon that realization she opts to use spray foam insulation instead), as does Johnnie. The Brians both fail due to having large gaps in their log pieces (Brian M also getting the cement-based parging all over his wood), so much so that parging will never cover the foam adequately.|$|R
