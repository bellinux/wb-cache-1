40|$|The China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) {{is a new}} tokamak device whose magnet system {{includes}} toroidal field, central solenoid (CS) and poloidal field coils. The {{main goal}} {{is to build a}} fusion engineering tokamak reactor with about 1 GW fusion power and self-sufficiency by blanket. In order to reach this high performance, the magnet field target is 15 T. However, the huge electromagnetic load caused by high field and current is a threat for conductor degradation under cycling. The conductor with a short-twist-pitch (STP) design has large stiffness, which enables a significant performance improvement in view of load and thermal cycling. But the conductor with STP design has a remarkable disadvantage: it can easily cause severe strand indentation during cabling. The indentation can reduce the strand performance, especially under high load cycling. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a new design is proposed. The main characteristic of this new design is an updated layout in the triplet. The triplet is made of two Nb 3 Sn strands and one soft <b>copper</b> <b>strand.</b> The twist pitch of the two Nb 3 Sn strands is large and cabled first. The <b>copper</b> <b>strand</b> is then wound around the two superconducting strands (CWS) with a shorter twist pitch. The following cable stages layout and twist pitches are similar to the ITER CS conductor with STP design. One short conductor sample with a similar scale to the ITER CS was manufactured and tested with the Twente Cable Press to investigate the mechanical properties, AC loss and internal inspection by destructive examination. The results are compared to the STP conductor (ITER CS and CFETR CSMC) tests. The results show that the new conductor design has similar stiffness, but much lower strand indentation than the STP design. The new design shows potential for application in future fusion reactors...|$|E
40|$|International audienceElectrical contact {{crimping}} is {{a process}} commonly used in aeronautical and aero spatial applications. One require-ment to perform a resistant assembly is to master crimping parameters. Numerical simulation is then an efficient tool to limit tedious experimental test campaigns. Nevertheless, the numerical model accuracy depends on input data determina-tion, such as material behaviour law parameters. This paper deals with study done to determine material behaviour law parameters of component involved on electri-cal crimping process. The two samples, a strand and an electrical contact, have both small dimensions and specific shapes. For that reason, normalised tensile or compression tests could not be perform. Indeed, inverse analysis is a powerful tool to determine the behaviour laws parameters. The goal is to precisely model the sample mechanical solicitation. A series of computations is launched with various rheological parameters. By comparing experimental and simulated results, {{the goal is to}} minimize a cost function. Thus, the first step of the study has been to determine experimental tests to perform in order to gather the force/displacement experimental data. The copper strands have been studied in compression, with a micro indentation de-vice. A 60 N force sensor has been used to acquire force data, whereas an inductive displacement sensor has been used for displacement acquisition data. The 60 N force sensor is too weak to crush completely a copper contact. For that sample, we decided to use an instrumented crimping plier. A series of crimping tests has been performed on empty barrel, and the equivalent simulation has been done. With the best <b>copper</b> <b>strand</b> material parameters set, relative errors between experimental and simulated <b>copper</b> <b>strand</b> data finally amount to 6. 9 % (lower than the 8 % experimental data scattering). On the other side, with the best cop-per contact material parameters set, the cost function amounts to 4 % (lower than the 7 % experimental data scattering). This study allows to determine material parameters sets which are use to simulate efficiently the crimping process...|$|E

40|$|The strain {{state of}} the superconducting Nb 3 Sn strands in {{multi-stage}} twisted ITER Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICCs) strongly determines the transport properties. For an accurate prediction of the performance and a proper understanding of the underlying phenomena, {{a detailed analysis of}} the stress and strain distribution along all individual strands is imperative. Also during the cabling process, the axial stress of the individual strands must be well controlled to avoid kinks, in particular when mixing different strands, e. g., Nb 3 Sn and <b>copper</b> <b>strands.</b> A mechanical model for a superconducting cable (CORD) was developed, which can predict the strain and stress states of all single strands including interstrand contact force and the associated deformation.

These improvements will derive from research and development carried out at government laboratories, universities, and industry. An R&D program carried out under the DOE Office of Fusion Energy Sciences, Enabling Technology Program for Magnets could address the needs raised in this white paper. The program should focus on developing superconductors with high critical current density at high magnetic field with low to moderate ac losses, including both LTS and HTS conductors, superconductors with both high and low stabilizer fraction, superconducting cables with high <b>copper</b> <b>strand</b> fractions, advanced conductor and structure manufacturing techniques, insulation systems that are radiation-resistant with low gas evolution and suitable for vacuum-pressure impregnation (VPI) of coils, and novel quench detectors {{and other types of}} advanced magnet system monitoring instrumentation. Component material or processing improvements that can allow a reduction in magnet fabrication complexity or improved schedule through advanced manufacturing techniques can also significantly reduce cost. These focus areas will apply to both low and high temperature superconductors so that the conductor type and magnet design for a particular future device application will be selected based on a logical evaluation of the physics, engineering, geometrical, and economic requirements of the application...|$|E

50|$|Coaxial cable conducts {{electrical}} signal using an inner conductor (usually a solid <b>copper,</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> or copper plated steel wire) {{surrounded by an}} insulating layer and all enclosed by a shield, typically one to four layers of woven metallic braid and metallic tape. The cable is protected by an outer insulating jacket. Normally, the shield is kept at ground potential and a signal carrying voltage {{is applied to the}} center conductor. The advantage of coaxial design is that electric and magnetic fields are restricted to the dielectric with little leakage outside the shield. Conversely, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are largely kept from interfering with signals inside the cable. Larger diameter cables and cables with multiple shields have less leakage. This property makes coaxial cable a good choice for carrying weak signals that cannot tolerate interference from the environment or for stronger {{electrical signal}}s that must not be allowed to radiate or couple into adjacent structures or circuits.|$|R

40|$|Flexible superconducting cables with {{currents}} up to 6 kA {{will be used}} {{to power}} magnets individually in the insertion regions of the LHC. In case of a quench, the currents in these circuits will decay very fast (with time constants of about 200 ms) such that relatively small copper cross sections are sufficient for these busbars. Quench propagation experiments on a prototype cable and corresponding simulations led to a detailed understanding of the quench behavior of these busbars and to recommendations for the design and application of the cable. Simulations of the quench process in a multi-strand conductor led to a detailed understanding of the way current crosses from superconducting to pure <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> and how this affects the quench propagation velocity. At nominal current (6 kA), the quench propagation velocities are high (10 m/s) and the hot spot temperature increases rapidly.

A description of the models is given, together with a parametric analysis of different boundary conditions and cable discretizations. The analysis shows that, in nominal working conditions, no thermal instability should take place.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of AS-Interface installations utilize the AS-Interface flat cable, defined {{as part of the}} AS-Interface specifications. A relatively small number of industries (e.g. valve control in process automation) use a round cable, mostly because it is easier to pull through conduit. While the shape of the cable does not matter (any other cable can be used) the electrical characteristics of the selected cable matters greatly. To prevent problems due to improper cable, most professionals suggest the AS-Interface flat cable. This cable is designed to make use of a cable piercing technology. When an AS-Interface module is installed on the network, piercing needles penetrate the cable jacket and displace the internal <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> without cutting them. This allows AS-Interface modules to be installed anywhere on the network without cutting and preparing (i.e. removing cable jacket, stripping insulation and possibly applying a ferule) the cable first. The result is a faster installation without the chance of inadvertent shorts between the leads.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is a {{promising}} material for fabricating wire compacting dies {{due to its}} advantages of light weight and even high wear resistance over the tungsten carbide, which currently is the most popular material used to produce compacting dies. In present study, a layer of CVD diamond film is deposited on the interior-hole surface of compacting dies using the hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method, following by a surface polish process, aiming at further elongating the lifetime of compacting dies and improving the surface quality of produced wires. The characterization of both as-deposited and polished CVD diamond films is employed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface profiler, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. Furthermore, the performance of as-fabricated CVD diamond coated compacting dies is examined in the real production process. The results exhibit that the as-deposited CVD diamond films are homogeneous and their surface finish is significantly smoothened after the surface polish process. As compared with the conventional compacting dies, the working lifetime of the diamond coated SiC compacting dies can be increased by a factor of above 15 {{and in the course of}} processing, <b>copper</b> <b>stranded</b> wires with high surface quality and uniform sectional area can be obtained...|$|R
50|$|Skin {{effect in}} audio cables is the {{tendency}} for high frequency signals to travel more on the surface than {{in the center of}} the conductor, as if the conductor were a hollow metal pipe. This tendency, caused by self-inductance, makes the cable more resistant at higher frequencies, diminishing its ability to transmit high frequencies with as much power as low frequencies. As cable conductors increase in diameter they have less overall resistance but increased skin effect. The choice of metals in the conductor makes a difference, too: silver has a greater skin effect than copper; aluminum has less effect. Skin effect is a significant problem at radio frequencies or over long distances such as miles and kilometers worth of high-tension electrical transmission lines, but not at audio frequencies carried over short distances measured in feet and meters. Speaker cables are normally made with stranded conductors but bare metal strands in contact with each other do not mitigate skin effect; the bundle of strands acts as one conductor at audio frequencies. Litz wire - individually insulated strands held in a particular pattern - is a type of high-end speaker wire intended to reduce skin effect. Another solution that has been tried is to plate the <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> with silver which has less resistance.|$|R

The thermal model was also used to generate single and linear array data for the lunar environment (the primary difference between the test and lunar data was due to lunar gravity). The model was also used to optimize the linear spacing of the reflux tubes in an array. The optimal spacing of the tubes was recommended to be about 5 tube diameters based on maximizing the heat transfer per unit mass.

40|$|Besides the {{temperature}} and magnetic field, the strain and stress state of the superconducting Nb 3 Sn wires in multi-stage twisted cable-in-conduit conductors (CICCs), as applied in ITER or high field magnets, strongly influence their transport properties.
