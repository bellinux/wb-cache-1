We compare cacti density, richness, diversity and evenness in twelve 50 × 50 m plots: six plots in secondary dry forest and six plots in older conserved dry forest at Sierra de Huautla, Central Mexico. Cacti were identifi ed, the life-form of each species was recorded and size was measured to assign individuals into four life-stage classes. Nine cacti species were registered across both forest types. In this dry forest, richness, diversity and evenness of cacti community increased in sites under chronic disturbance, whereas density was not signi-fi cantly affected. Size structure at community {{level in the}} <b>conserved</b> <b>forest</b> showed an increase of individuals with size, whereas in the secondary forest, size structure showed an uneven distribution of individuals, as in populations that regenerate by pulses. In the secondary forest, there was a lower proportion of adults {{and they were in}} average, smaller than those in the <b>conserved</b> <b>forest.</b> Chronic disturbance may eventually change cacti community structure, affecting animals that depend on large arboreal cacti for food, perches and/or refuge; therefore, maintenance of biodiversity will be at stake.

Although many theories have been proposed to explain their richness we currently know little about their relative importance. This diversity is threatened by anthropogenic disturbances such as fragmentation and forest degradation. In this study we compared epiphytic plant diversity patterns in lowland and subandean forests. More epiphytic diversity was found in subandean (PNN Cueva de los Guácharos) compared to lowland forest (Palmarí Reserve). In addition a higher abundance of epiphytes was found in <b>conserved</b> <b>forest.</b> Tree host diversity was higher in lowland forests than in subandean forests, so we can reject the possibility that differences between the patterns of epiphytic diversity are caused by regional effects of plant diversity.

30|$|If a {{reasonable}} baseline exists, there is increased financial {{pressure on the}} rainforest country to comply with and take the necessary measures for limiting the forest, {{for a lack of}} enforcement tends to manifest itself in lower public revenues. The government itself directly becomes the injured party. The same applies to cases in which <b>conserved</b> <b>forest</b> stocks are destroyed later on and the criterion of permanency is thereby breached. In the decentralised system, however, the private investors are not capable of exerting pressure on policy execution. Fulfilling the carry-forward rule also tends to {{have a positive effect on}} compliance: if an infringement of the baseline could occur within a current period, the respective emission excesses would lower the revenues, which could be achieved later, thus creating an incentive to put more effort into complying with the baseline. Such a macro penalty rule would not be applicable within the system of the decentralised US model. There, the political concept assumes a priori that actual emissions would regularly fall below the baseline.|$|E
40|$|A {{species of}} aphelenchoidid {{nematode}} was isolated from a subterranean termite, Cylindrotermes macrognathus, during {{a survey of}} termite-associated nematodes in a <b>conserved</b> <b>forest</b> in La Selva, Costa Rica. The nematode was morphologically intermediate between the families Aphelenchidae and Aphelenchoididae, i. e., the nematode had a true bursa supported by bursal limb-like genital papillae but lacked a clear pharyngeal isthmus. The molecular phylogenetic status of the new nematode among tylenchid, cephalobid, panagrolaimid, aphelenchid and aphelenchoidid genera was analysed based on ca 1. 2 kb of SSU ribosomal DNA sequence and the inferred position was basal to the family Aphelenchoididae. It was clearly {{not part of the}} clade containing the genus Aphelenchus (=Aphelenchidae). This nematode is described herein as Pseudaphelenchus yukiae n. gen., n. sp., and the family definition of Aphelenchoididae is emended to include the unique morphological characters of this new genus. The molecular phylogenetic analysis supported the paraphyly of the three Aphelenchoidinae genera Aphelenchoides, Laimaphelenchus and Schistonchus and the monophyly of Ektaphelenchinae, Seinura (Seinurinae) and Noctuidonema (Acugutturinae).

40|$|AbstractChamaedorea alternans is a palm {{species that}} has {{suffered}} from selective extraction, and habitat loss. We collected 11 populations from fragmented and <b>conserved</b> <b>forest.</b> We assess genetic variation of C. alternans, genetic exchange, differentiation, bottlenecks, effective population size and signals of natural selection. Genetic diversity was higher in conserved than in fragmented forest but not significant. Fragmentation did not {{play a significant role}} in genetic diversity, possibly due to the populations heterogeneity. C. alternans has been subject to a pronounced isolation of trees as a product of logging, thus raising inbreeding. Bayesian clustering show a trend towards an increased structuring over the course of generations but also, indicates that populations have recently gone through a bottleneck. The bottleneck following deforestation was not severe enough to lower the effective size, this could lead to high standing genetic diversity, providing a buffer against genetic erosion. We observed directional and balancing selection in C. alternans. Maintenance of variability and increased differentiation signify that their populations have been subject to a differential selective pressure at the ecological and the landscape level, combined effect could lead to disturb pollination and dispersion processes, modifying in the long term the effective population size...|$|E
40|$|Protected Areas (PAs) are a {{critical}} tool for maintaining habitat integrity and species diversity, and now cover more than 12. 7 % of the planet's land surface area. However, {{there is considerable}} debate {{on the extent to}} which PAs deliver conservation outcomes in terms of habitat and species protection. A systematic review approach is applied to investigate the evidence from peer reviewed and grey literature on the effectiveness of PAs focusing on two outcomes: (a) habitat cover and (b) species populations. We only include studies that causally link conservation inputs to outcomes against appropriate counterfactuals. From 2599 publications we found 76 studies from 51 papers that evaluated impacts on habitat cover, and 42 studies from 35 papers on species populations. Three conclusions emerged: first, there is good evidence that PAs have <b>conserved</b> <b>forest</b> habitat; second, evidence remains inconclusive that PAs have been effective at maintaining species populations, although more positive than negative results are reported in the literature; third, causal connections between management inputs and conservation outcomes in PAs are rarely evaluated in the literature. Overall, available evidence suggests that PAs deliver positive outcomes, but there remains a limited evidence base, and weak understanding of the conditions under which PAs succeed or fail to deliver conservation outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Conservation organisations {{are faced}} with the {{complexities}} between protecting forests, developing local livelihoods and strengthening institutions. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the strategies employed by organisations to implement conservation and development, and to assess how project progress is improved by project operations. This paper analyses 42 projects working in 15 <b>conserved</b> <b>forest</b> sites in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. We use multivariate techniques on a large set of variables to explore patterns between sites, project activities and management. The major threats to biodiversity in the Lower Mekong are hunting and logging. Primary site-level conservation projects focus significantly on law enforcement, but also use developmental and institutional building tools to reduce pressure on conserved areas and improve both conservation and development outcomes. Although achieving the combined goals of conservation and development is necessary in most situations, trade-offs, however, these two goals are common and integrated approaches can sometimes compromise both conservation and development outcomes. Many organisations collaborate with government and non-government organisations and use participatory and consultative approaches with local people to achieve their objectives. We conclude that while integrating conservation and development is often necessary, trade-offs must be acknowledged because they influence project outcomes. Partnerships and consultation with multiple interest groups can greatly improve the effectiveness of project implementation...|$|E

40|$|Didelphis albiventris Lund, 1840 {{is one of}} {{the least}} known Brazilian {{marsupials}} with respect to its feeding habits. Since the white-eared opossum is omnivorous, it occupies several niches and may be found in urban areas as well as in forest fragments. Current analysis aimed at determining and comparing the diet of D. albiventris in two periurban areas of the municipality of Viamão, a <b>conserved</b> <b>forest</b> remnant and a degraded area resulting from agricultural activities. Captures of D. albiventris were carried out for a period of 30 months by a sampling effort of 504 trap-nights. Forty fecal samples were collected from 45 captures corresponding to 18 specimens.   Diet was determined by fecal analysis. Fruit was the most representative item, at an occurrence of 77. 5 %, comprising six species of plants, followed by invertebrates (62. 5 %) and vertebrates (37. 5 %). Didelphis albiventris displayed a frugivorous-omnivorous habit, with no difference between the sexes with respect to composition and frequency of the items consumed. Since there was a greater diversity of food items and fruits in the more conserved area, seasonal variations in the diet could be detected. Generalist species, such as D. albiventris, may have {{an important role in the}} recovery of degraded areas through the dispersal of seeds of species of initial successional stages. ...|$|E
40|$|Forests of the Dahomey Gap are {{considered}} as refugia for many species. They {{play a crucial}} role in providing ecosystem services in an area devoid of forests. However, the impact of the way they are managed on the biodiversity they host has barely been investigated. Wild yams existing in these forests {{play a crucial role}} in maintaining the genetic diversity of cultivated yams. Indeed, studies of farmer practices have shown that, by way of ennoblement, wild yams collected and selected in the forests and old fallow areas are integrated into the cultivated pool. However, the genetic structure of wild yams is poorly understood. Using nine microsatellite loci, we investigated the population genetics of Dioscorea praehensilis in five forests in Benin, involving different management strategies and bioclimatic areas. Populations of D. praehensilis were strongly differentiated, consistent with an ancient separation of the forests. While the D. praehensilis population in a holly forest was undergoing mutation and drift equilibrium, the population collected from the most <b>conserved</b> <b>forest</b> was in a bottleneck. Moreover, in two forests with different management strategies, accessions from other forests were found, resulting from the displacement of yams following farmer migrations. No isolation by distance was detected, but a differentiation was found between populations of the Sudano-Guinean climate and the Guineo-Congolian climate. Our findings suggest differentiation due to forest isolations under past climatic conditions and more recent tuber flow through anthropogenic impacts. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|This {{creative}} project proposes India’s first Geopark in Hyderabad, {{with the}} aim of protecting the city’s Archaean-era geologic heritage. The landscape intervention will contribute to Hyderabadis’ increased physical and emotional engagement with the city’s Genius Loci. The intent is to inspire environmental stewardship through a greater literacy of Hyderabad’s granitic landscape and unique rock-ecosystem. These goals are aligned with the UNESCO-supported Global Network of National Geoparks’ emphasis on Conservation, Sustainable Development and Community Involvement. To achieve these goals, the work on this project consisted of researching geology, geomorphology and ecosystems of Hyderabad, urban spatial growth trends impacting loss of the city’s rocky landscape, and the city’s cultural integration with the natural environment. Design frameworks are provided by investigations of notable landscape architecture precedents, conserved natural heritage in various countries and unique granitic landscapes worldwide. The site was selected through a rigorous process informed by three criteria: recommendations of a non-profit organization, the Society to Save Rocks; Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority’s 2031 Master Plan for Greater Hyderabad; and a critical analysis of the urgent urban threat to select boulder sites in Hyderabad. The originally selected 400 -hectare Venkateshwaragutta site was expanded to 600 hectares to encompass natural systems in the vicinity that include a stream corridor, natural lake, and municipally <b>conserved</b> <b>forest</b> areas. The challenge in designing this Geopark was to successfully integrate the site’s existing dichotomous land uses – a religious temple and a master-balancing reservoir located on its tallest hill. The proposed solution achieves this project’s goals through an interpretive center communicating best practices in geology-ecosystem conservation, a spiritual complex with a temple flower garden, and recreational trails. The Geopark promotes scientific scholarship and conservation of Hyderabad’s distinctive rock landscape and habitat. Department of Landscape ArchitectureThesis (M. L. A. ...|$|E
