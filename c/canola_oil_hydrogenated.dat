40|$|Due to {{increased}} consumption of canola oil and hydrogenated oil containing palm and palm olein, and their possible effects on serum lipoproteins, {{the present study}} was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} these oils on lipids and lipid oxidation level. Methods: In this experimental study, 88 Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups. Control group (A) was on a normal diet. Groups B, C, and D, in addition to normal diet, were fed with hydrogenated oil-contained palm oil, pure palm olein oil, and canola oil, respectively for 4 weeks. Serum Biochemical factors [total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), LDL, HDL, LDL/HDL ratio, oxLDL, paraoxanase- 1 (PON 1), and malondialdehyde (MDA) ] were measured. Results: The lowest mean serum TC was seen in the control group and the highest in the group B. There were differences in TC, TG, HDL, MDA, and PON 1 between the control group and other groups (P 0. 05). MDA was higher in groups C and D. Conclusion: <b>Canola</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>hydrogenated</b> oil-containing palm and palm olein may increase atherosclerosis risk through decreasing PON 1 activity and elevating oxLDL.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of frying <b>oils</b> (<b>canola,</b> <b>hydrogenated</b> sunflower and soybean oils) available commercially and chill storage on the proximate and fatty acid composition of fried slices of farmed great sturgeon (Huso huso). METHODS: Slices of farmed great sturgeon were fried for four minutes at 160 ºC in a deep-fryer using different frying <b>oils</b> (<b>canola,</b> <b>hydrogenated</b> sunflower and soybean oils). The oil-to-slice ratio was 2 : 1. After frying, the slices were allowed to be air cooled for two minutes prior to analysis. For performing the analysis, each of the abovementioned batches was divided into two groups: one group was analysed immediately after frying and the second group was chill-stored at 4 ºC for three days and then analysed. RESULTS: After frying, the moisture content decreased while that of fat increased. Fatty acid composition of the slices is affected by type of frying oil. Frying increased the omega- 6 -to-omega- 3 (n- 6 :n- 3) fatty acid ratio while decreased Eicosapentaenoic Acid (C 20 : 5 n- 3) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (C 22 : 6 n- 3) contents. Proximate and fatty acid composition of raw slices did not change after chill storage. However, in fried- and chill-stored slices, Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid contents decreased, while linoleic acid content increased. CONCLUSION: The fatty acid composition of the fried slices tended to resemble that of the frying oils, indicating fatty-acid equilibrium between oils and slices and, during chill storage, it is influenced by the type of frying oil. Slices fried with <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> had omega- 6 -to-omega- 3 ratios in the ranges recommended for human health...|$|R

40|$|<b>Canola</b> <b>oil</b> was <b>hydrogenated</b> on an {{industrial}} nickel catalyst at 180 °C under {{a wide range}} of pressures from 1. 5 to 21 bar(a). The effect of hydrogen pressure on the hydrogenation characteristics and fatty acids profile was investigated. The hydrogenation kinetics were described by a simplified three-step model including linolenic acid. The apparent rate constants for the particular reaction steps (hydrogenation, isomerization) kx as well as rate constants kx 0 and reaction orders in hydrogen were determined. The results reveal that with the increasing pressure an increase of values of all rate constants was observed, with the largest increase being observed for the rate constant of hydrogenation of monoenes to stearic acid (about 20 times). Moreover, with the increasing pressure the isomerization rate of cis dienes to trans dienes was found to become lower than the dienes hydrogenation rate. Analogously, the cis/trans monoenes isomerization rate was also found to decrease with the increasing pressure. The reaction orders of the hydrogenation steps with respect to hydrogen were in the range of 0. 35 to 1. 1. The kinetic model was verified by comparsion of predicted fatty acids contents with the experimental data of fatty acids profiles. It emerged that a simplified kinetic model proposed can be utilized to simulate the course of the hydrogenation process and concentrations of fatty acids at a certain iodine value...|$|R

40|$|Blends of <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> (CO) {{and fully}} <b>hydrogenated</b> {{cottonseed}} <b>oil</b> (FHCSO), with 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 % FHCSO (w/w) were interesterified under the following conditions: 0. 4 % sodium methoxide, 500 rpm stirring, 100 C, 20 min. The original and interesterified blends were examined for triacylglycerol composition, melting point, solid fat content (SFC) and consistency. Interesterification caused considerable rearrangement of triacylglycerol species, reduction of trisaturated triacylglycerol content and increase in disaturated-monounsaturated and monosaturated-diunsaturated triacylglycerols in all blends, resulting in lowering of respective melting points. The interesterified blends showed reduced SFC at all temperatures and more linear melting profiles {{if compared with}} the original blends. Consistency, expressed as yield value, significantly decreased after the reaction. Iso-solid curves indicated eutectic interactions for the original blends, which were eliminated after randomization. The 80 : 20, 75 : 25, 70 : 30 and 65 : 35 (w/w) CO: FHCSO interesterified blends showed characteristics which are appropriate for their application as soft margarines, spreads, fat for bakery/all-purpose shortenings, and icing shortenings, respectively. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Recently, {{a number of studies}} have suggested a direct relationship between trans isomers and increased risk of vascular disease. In response, many health organizations have recommended reducing consumption of foods containing trans fatty acids.

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the effect of CLA association with two vegetable oil sources on the body fat of broiler chickens. Broilers were distributed in a completely randomized factorial design 2 x 5 (two oil sources, i. e. soybean or <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> and five levels of CLA supplementation, i. e. 0. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10. 0 g/kg). For both sexes, supplementation with <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> resulted in heavier birds (P< 0. 05) when compared to soybean oil. The effect of CLA supplementation on final body weight of female birds was significant and explained by a linear response (P< 0. 05). A linear reduction in abdominal fat pad content was observed on females receiving <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> and CLA (P< 0. 05). <b>Canola</b> <b>oil</b> fed male and female birds had a reduction in relative liver weight (P< 0. 05) when compared to soybean oil fed birds.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of frying <b>oils</b> (<b>canola,</b> <b>hydrogenated</b> sunflower and soybean oils) available commercially and chill storage on the proximate and fatty acid composition of fried slices of farmed great sturgeon (Huso huso). METHODS: Slices of farmed great sturgeon were fried for four minutes at 160 ºC in a deep-fryer using different frying <b>oils</b> (<b>canola,</b> <b>hydrogenated</b> sunflower and soybean oils). The oil-to-slice ratio was 2 : 1. After frying, the slices were allowed to be air cooled for two minutes prior to analysis. For performing the analysis, each of the abovementioned batches was divided into two groups: one group was analysed immediately after frying and the second group was chill-stored at 4 ºC for three days and then analysed. RESULTS: After frying, the moisture content decreased while that of fat increased. Fatty acid composition of the slices is affected by type of frying oil. Frying increased the omega- 6 -to-omega- 3 (n- 6 :n- 3) fatty acid ratio while decreased Eicosapentaenoic Acid (C 20 : 5 n- 3) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (C 22 : 6 n- 3) contents. Proximate and fatty acid composition of raw slices did not change after chill storage. However, in fried- and chill-stored slices, Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid contents decreased, while linoleic acid content increased. CONCLUSION: The fatty acid composition of the fried slices tended to resemble that of the frying oils, indicating fatty-acid equilibrium between oils and slices and, during chill storage, it is influenced by the type of frying oil. Slices fried with <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> had omega- 6 -to-omega- 3 ratios in the ranges recommended for human health. OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste estudo foi investigar o efeito de óleos de fritura (canola, girassol hidrogenado e soja) disponíveis comercialmente e do armazenamento a frio em postas fritas de beluga (Huso huso), e na composição centesimal e lipídica. MÉTODOS: Postas de beluga de cativeiro foram fritas por imersão durante quatro minutos a 160 ºC utilizando-se óleos de fritura diferentes (canola, girassol hidrogenado e soja). A razão entre óleo e postas foi de 2 : 1. Após a fritura, permitiu-se que as postas esfriassem a temperatura ambiente por dois minutos antes da análise. Para a análise, cada um dos grupos acima foi dividido em dois subgrupos: um subgrupo foi analisado imediatamente após a fritura e o segundo subgrupo foi armazenado resfriado a uma temperatura de 4 ºC por três dias e então analisado. RESULTADOS: Após a fritura, o conteúdo da umidade diminuiu enquanto que da gordura aumentou. A composição dos ácidos graxos das postas foi afetada pelo tipo de óleo utilizado na fritura. A fritura aumentou a razão omega- 6 para omega- 3 e diminuiu os conteúdos dos Ácidos Eicosapentaenoico (C 20 : 5 n- 3) e Docosahexaenoico (C 22 : 6 n- 3). As composições centesimal e lipídica das postas cruas não se alteraram após o armazenamento a frio. Porém, os conteúdos de Ácidos Eicosapentaenoico e Docosahexaenoico nas postas fritas e resfriadas diminuíram, enquanto que de ácido linoleico aumentou. CONCLUSÃO: A composição lipídica das postas fritas tendeu à semelhança do óleo utilizado para a fritura, indicando um equilíbrio de ácidos graxos entre os óleos e as postas. A composição lipídica das postas durante o armazenamento a frio é influenciada pelo tipo de óleo de fritura. Postas fritas com óleo de canola continham uma razão de ômega- 6 para ômega- 3 dentro do intervalo recomendado para a saúde humana...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} if 25 days of <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> intake {{in the absence of}} excess dietary salt or together with salt loading affects antioxidant and oxidative stress markers in the circulation. A further aim was to determine the mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms in the aorta of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats. Methods Male SHRSP rats, were fed a defatted control diet containing 10 % wt/wt soybean oil or a defatted treatment diet containing 10 % wt/wt <b>canola</b> <b>oil,</b> and given tap water or water containing 1 % NaCl. Blood was collected at the end of study for analysis of red blood cell (RBC) antioxidant enzymes, RBC and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), plasma 8 -isoprostane and plasma lipids. The aorta was removed and the mRNA expression of NOX 2, p 22 phox, CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD and EC-SOD were determined. Results In the absence of salt, <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> reduced RBC SOD and glutathione peroxidase, and increased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared with soybean oil. RBC glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in both the salt loaded groups compared to the soybean oil only group. In addition, RBC MDA and plasma HDL cholesterol were significantly higher in both the salt loaded groups compared to the no salt groups. Plasma MDA concentration was higher and LDL cholesterol concentration lower in the <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> group loaded with salt compared to the <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> group without salt. The mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and SOD isoforms were significantly reduced in the <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> group with salt compared to <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> group without salt. Conclusion In conclusion, these results indicate that <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> reduces antioxidant status and increases plasma lipids, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, <b>canola</b> <b>oil</b> in combination with salt intake increased MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation and decreased NAPDH oxidase subunits and aortic SOD gene expression. </p...|$|R
