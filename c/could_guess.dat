25|$|The {{relatively}} simple system of land distribution, {{made possible by}} applying {{the expression of the}} East India Company, allowed the landowners to dispose with legal measurement units: each owner <b>could</b> <b>guess</b> the extent of his property by looking at nature. Thus they only needed to plant distinctive species, such as Dracaena reflexa, to make the boundaries visible and make them known to the neighbours.|$|E
25|$|Digital Reality held {{a contest}} where fans <b>could</b> <b>guess</b> the game's release date. Those who guessed {{correctly}} {{would get a}} chance to receive a free copy of the game.

T-shirts and other promotional merchandise were given away at PAX. Contests for the merchandise were also conducted via the game's official Facebook page.|$|E

Towards {{the end of his}} life, he had to write {{with the help of his}} wife, Edith, who would recite letters of the alphabet until he indicated for her to stop, continuing until she <b>could</b> <b>guess</b> the word or phrase he intended (or, at other times, Rosenzweig would point to the letter on the plate of his typewriter). They also developed a communication system based on him blinking his eyes.|$|E

500|$|Groening {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} an episode in which the character Mr. Burns was shot, which {{could be used as a}} publicity stunt. The writers decided to write the episode [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. Part one was the final episode of the sixth season and originally aired on the Fox network on May 21, 1995. Part two was the premiere of the seventh season and originally aired on September 17, 1995. It was important for the writers to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed the obvious culprit. In the months following the broadcast of the first part, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where the viewers <b>could</b> <b>guess</b> who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 and was one of the first contests to tie together elements of television and the internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. No one, however, was ever animated on the show. This was because no one officially guessed the right answer, so the chosen winner did not have the right answer and was paid a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E

Reichenbach, who had supervised the contest, read out the new name: [...] "The Morning Call." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{screenshots}} of {{the game}} were released in April of that year, it was seen that the original graphic style of Advance Wars would stay unchanged, and one <b>could</b> <b>guess</b> that changes would mostly be cosmetic. When a demo {{of the game}} was released at E3 that year, {{it was clear that}} the gameplay would stay nearly identical to its predecessor Advance Wars, though new content would be added. IGN journalist Craig Harris commented after E3 2003 that [...] " [...] doesn't have an overwhelming sense of newness".|$|E
