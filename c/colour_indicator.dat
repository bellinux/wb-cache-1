40|$|Background Cervical {{cancer is}} a major problem in women and it is {{important}} to find a suitable and acceptable screening method, especially among young in low-resource areas for future human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine follow-up investigations. The study sought to test the acceptability of self-sampling as well as the suitability of the specimen collecting devices. Methods Ninety-eight young women from rural KwaZulu-Natal were enrolled between March and July 2014. Collected genital specimens were transferred to <b>colour</b> <b>indicator</b> cards for HPV detection. Participants answered a questionnaire where they described their experiences with self-sampling. Samples were tested for high-risk HPV using GP 5 / 6 + PCR. Results Of the enrolled participants, 91 answered questionnaires and indicated that self-sampling was preferred by 51 / 91 (56 %) women while 40 / 91 (44 %) indicated preference for sampling by a doctor (p =  0. 023). The majority, 64 % were comfortable using a swab, 22 % preferred a brush while 11 % were comfortable with both devices. Of the 98 self-sampled specimens 61 were negative for HPV in both specimens while 37 were HPV-positive in either brush or swab. Of the 37, 26 (70 %) were HPV-positive in both brush and swab (kappa =  0. 743) and 11 (30 %) were discordant.

These photosynthetic bacteria occur {{throughout the world}} and can rapidly form blooms in eutrophic water systems. The occurrence of these photosynthetic bacteria, in our dwindling drinking water source dams, poses a serious, economic, {{as well as a}} health, threat to and arid country like South Africa due to is potential to produce of toxic metabolites like Microcystins and Nodularins (MCN). MCN's are cyclic peptides toxins, harmful to humans and animals, and its toxicological mechanism is based on a strong inhibition of protein phosphatises in the liver. This may lead to severe liver damage and increased tumour development. Rural communities consuming untreated water in South Africa are most at risk due the high toxicity of MCN’s at low doses. We endeavour to develop an immunosensor for the detection of Microcystins and nodularins using anti-sheep IgG antibody labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immobilised on a modified glassy-carbon polymer surface. The immunosensor will be applied to water samples for MCN’s as a group of compounds recognised by the ADDA moiety common to all MCN congeners. The immunosensor will provide immediate confirmation and quantification of MCN’s in situ. A competitive Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbant Assay (ELISA) and High Performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC) will be used to validate results of our immunosensor.

The aim of this work was to fabricate Acacia gum–stabilised silver nanoparticles (SNPs) using green chemistry to use them as a highly sensitive and cost-effective localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) colorimeter sensor for the determination of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Silver nanoparticles were fabricated by the reduction of an inorganic precursor silver nitrate solution (AgNO 3) using white sugar as the reducing reagent and Acacia gum as the stabilising reagent and a sonication bath to form uniform silver nanoparticles. The fabricated nanoparticles were characterised by visual observation, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The TEM micrographs of the synthesised nanoparticles showed the presence of spherical nanoparticles with sizes of approximately 10 [*]nm. The EDAX spectrum result confirmed the presence of silver (58 %), carbon (30 %), and oxygen (12 %). Plasmon colorimetric sensing of H 2 O 2 solution was investigated by introducing H 2 O 2 solution into Acacia gum–capped SNP dispersion, and {{the change in the}} LSPR band in the UV-Vis region of spectra was monitored. In this study, {{it was found that the}} yellow colour of Acacia gum–stabilised SNPs gradually changed to transparent, and moreover, a remarkable change in the LSPR absorbance strength was observed. The calibration curve was linear over 0. 1 – 0. 00001 [*]M H 2 O 2, with a correlation estimation (R 2) of. 953. This was due to the aggregation of SNPs following introduction of the H 2 O 2 solution.

40|$|Selection {{objectives}} and criteria were defined and appraised {{for a simple}} production system involving a New Zealand Romney breeding flock under North Island hill country conditions, in which all surplus offspring are sold as lambs. Through the availability of New Zealand Wool Board auction data for the seasons 1976 / 77 to 1980 / 81, the influence of wool quality traits on price was analysed by regression techniques. Traits examined included mean fibre diameter (MFD), style(S), mean length (ML) and yield (Y). For the 1980 / 81 season only, further data from the Coded Sales Assistance Report (C. S. A. R.) was available for scouring indicator (SI), <b>colour</b> <b>indicator</b> (CI), felted (F), pen stain (P), cotted (Co), tender (T), mixed length (LV) and mixed quality (QV). In addition, the effects on price of three non-fleece variables, lot weight (LW), mode of offering (MO) and New Zealand Wool Board market intervention policies (Int), were considered. Y was shown {{to have a major}} influence over greasy price. The relationship between price and ML was confirmed as being non-linear, with ML having a greater effect on the price of shorter wools. S and MFD were less influential. The control these four traits jointly exerted over greasy price ranged up to 74. 0 %, which was further enhanced by the introduction of quadratic terms. ML 2 was the most important quadratic term. The inclusion of the C. S. A. R. and non-fleece related traits, failed to provide any further control over price. CI proved to be an effective substitute for S. Selection objectives were defined for greasy and clean wool, combined with short, long and mixed length categories. Economic weights for wool quality traits were directly calculated from the regression of auction price on the level of the traits. Economic weights for number of lambs weaned (NLW), weaning weight (WW), ewe body weight (EBW), greasy fleece weight (GFW) and clean fleece weight (CFW) were calculated using the marginal profit method. The relativities between the calculated economic weights were generally in good agreement with those of previously published estimates. For the selection objectives defined, various selection criteria were appraised. These included the traits in the selection objective, or their respective criteria, as well as hogget body weight (HBW), quality number (QN) and fleece character grade (CHG). NLW (dam), HBW and HGFW were of major importance in the selection index. The remaining traits were of only minimal value. On the basis of cost of measurement and value within the index, the full index was converted to a reduced index of NLW (dam), HBW and HGFW. In terms of accuracy of prediction and economy, this index was considered suitable for most commercial conditions. Further reduced indices were computed which generated less overall genetic gain, but which individual breeders may consider more appropriate to their particular requirements. Sensitivity analyses for HBW, NLW, GFW (CFW) and SC generally produced few changes of any consequence to the selection indices. Restriction of all genetic change in EBW significantly reduced the expected overall genetic gain...|$|E

In this paper, it is demonstrated {{for the first time and}} in the case of a complex sample such as red wine, that also quantification of integral parameters (<b>colour</b> <b>indicators)</b> and specific compounds (total anthocyanins and polyphenols) is possible through a multivariate analysis of CSPT fingerprints. Most of the properties of the method are due to the {{combination of}} light emission and absorption properties that are captured by the CSPT platform. Thanks to this combination, a CSPT fingerprint may contain a comparable amount of information with respect to standard spectrophotometers. Wine measurements were performed on intact samples without the intervention of chemical mediators. The regression models, built by Partial Least Squares, obtained errors of estimation of colour parameters, total polyphenols and anthocyanines that are comparable with those typical of the standard methods in use. Since computation functionalities, video capture and display are embedded in a steadily growing number of ubiquitously distributed equipments (from portable computers to cellular phones), these results indicate a viable methodology for low-cost and largely diffused analytical capabilities.

Refurbishment work includes replacing the original [...] "Panorama Super" [...] headboard panel with a <b>colour</b> LED destination <b>indicator,</b> and a new livery similar to that carried by the 2200 series trains.|$|R
40|$|Net fluxes of Ca 2 + {{and acid}} {{production}} were studied in clonal insulin-releasing cells (RINm 5 F) by using <b>colour</b> <b>indicators</b> and dual-wavelength spectrophotometry. After equilibration with a medium containing 10 - 20 microM-Ca 2 +, only minimal amounts of Ca 2 + (0. 08 mmol/kg of protein) were {{released from the}} cells by subsequent additions of the respiratory blocker antimycin A and the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187. The presence of 20 mM-glucose resulted in an almost 5 -fold increase of the acid production and in a stimulated net uptake of Ca 2 +. The latter process was independent of the extracellular Ca 2 + concentration and reached saturation after 20 +/- 1 min, when it corresponded to 1. 18 +/- 0. 07 mmol of calcium/kg of protein. Whereas the thiol reagent iodoacetamide suppressed the acid production, interference with mitochondrial function by using antimycin A or the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone had the opposite effect. The latter two drugs induced a selective release of Ca 2 + from a pool containing 35 % of that taken up during glucose exposure. Most of the remaining Ca 2 + was liberated by A 23187 or iodoacetamide. Carbamoylcholine was also selective in mobilizing glucose-stimulated calcium, but this calcium (17 %) appeared to originate from the pool insensitive to mitochondrial poisons. The action of carbamoylcholine was blocked by atropine and did {{not depend on the}} presence of extracellular Na+. The opposite effects of glucose and muscarinic-receptor activation on a non-mitochondrial calcium pool are consistent with participation of the endoplasmic reticulum in the glucose-induced sequestration of Ca 2 + in pancreatic beta-cells...|$|R
40|$|PVC films {{containing}} {{methyl violet}} {{have been subjected}} to UV irradiation to induce dehydrochlorination leading to capture of the released HCl by the dye. It is demonstrated that a process similar to the <b>indicator</b> <b>colour</b> change in an aqueous solution can also be induced within the PVC matrix by the action of light. It is also shown that this process can be utilised for lithographic purposes. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|A {{combination}} of these techniques was first used on a large raid to great success {{on the night of}} 17/18 August 1943 in Operation Hydra against German rocket research at Peenemünde. 596 aircraft were led by a Master Bomber to a series of target indicators dropped at several different locations around the target area. By dropping different <b>colours</b> of <b>indicators</b> and calling aircraft to attack each one in turn, the entire area was heavily bombed. The aircraft from No.5 Group used their time-from-landmark technique again. The estimate has appeared in many sources that this raid set back the V-2 experimental programme by at least two months and reduced the scale of the eventual rocket attack. The V-2 team had to hastily move their testing facilities elsewhere. The Master Bomber became a common feature of large-scale raids from this time onwards.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCensus 2011 marked {{erstwhile}} Andhra Pradesh as {{the second}} largest and fifth most populous state of India housing 7 % of its total population. In 2014, it was divided into the two states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh {{on the basis of}} disparities in resource allocation. Mapping regional disparities can aid in effective policy-making at the preliminary stage of planning itself. This paper aims to study the regional disparities in human development in the case of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh through the tool of graduated <b>colour</b> mapping. <b>Indicators</b> mapped were drawn from the Andhra Pradesh Human Development Report of 2007. The studies reveal that while there is a clear case of polarized growth in the case of Hyderabad and its immediate surroundings, we also find similar trends in the Vizianagaram district, {{as well as in the}} Rayalseema region...|$|R
5000|$|Phenomena like watterlogging on {{the surface}} or in {{subsurface}} layers, visible reduction in porosity and changes of soil structure, soil moisture and soil <b>colour</b> are <b>indicators</b> of soil compaction in the field. A blue-grey soil colour and a smell of hydrogen sulphide can occur in the top soil due to extenuated aeration [...] An increase in soil strength can be measured with a penetrometer, which is basically a device for measuring the resistance of a soil. Another important indicator of soil compaction is the vegetation itself. By means of patterns of crop growth, pale leaf colours and root growth, {{it is possible to}} draw conclusions to the extent of compaction. Especially when trying to identify soil compaction in the field with the measurements mentioned above it has been considered particularly important to make a comparison between potentially compacted soil and uncompacted soil nearby.|$|R
