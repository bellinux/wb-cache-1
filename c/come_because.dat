25|$|Upon {{taking the}} throne, Agung's son Susuhunan Amangkurat I {{tried to bring}} {{long-term}} stability to Mataram's realm, by murdering local leaders that were insufficiently deferential to him, including the still-powerful noble from Surabaya, Pangeran Pekik, his father-in-law, and executed Panembahan Adiningkusuma (posthumous: Panembahan Girilaya), king of Cirebon, his son in-law. He also had closing ports and destroying ships in Javanese coastal cities {{to prevent them from}} getting too powerful from their wealth. This action devastated Javanese coastal economy and has crippled Javanese maritime prowess that has been nurtured since Singhasari and Majapahit era, thus making Mataram mainly as an agricultural inland kingdom for centuries to <b>come.</b> <b>Because</b> of this deeds, Amangkurat I was notorious as a ruthless king.

500|$|As a journalist, {{sometimes}} {{employing the}} pseudonym [...] "la Cagoule", Uzanne wrote for L'Écho de Paris, Le Gaulois and other newspapers.

500|$|As {{the season}} wore on, Philadelphia {{developed}} momentum as a wild-card contender. The Phillies dominated the Mets in head-to-head play, posting three separate series sweeps, including a pivotal sweep of a four-game series at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia during late August which included two walk-off hits by Chase Utley and Ryan Howard and comeback victories for the Phillies {{in three of}} the four games. During the season, Burrell also hit two home runs off Wagner, resulting in two blown saves. By the time Philadelphia swept the Mets at Shea Stadium in mid-September, the Phillies were threatening to move from wild-card contender to division leader. With 17 games left to play, the Mets led the Phillies by seven games; during that final stretch, the Mets won only five games and lost twelve, while the Phillies went 13–4. On {{the final day of the}} season, the Phillies won the division, backing up Rollins' quote. Mets starter Tom Glavine gave up seven runs in the first inning to the Florida Marlins, while the Phillies beat the Washington Nationals behind Eastern Pennsylvania native Jamie Moyer to win the division for the first time since 1993. Rollins capped his prediction by adding his first career Most Valuable Player award. According to Baseball Prospectus, the Mets' collapse over the end of the season ranked statistically as the second-worst in baseball history. After the 2007 season, Wagner also said that [...] " [...] collapse didn't <b>come</b> <b>because</b> the Phillies beat us, the collapse came because we played bad".|$|E
500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said Will Forte's {{obsession}} with Twilight led to funny scenes, particularly an impromptu book club meeting with Tom and Donna, {{but said the}} character's efforts to impress his daughter didn't make much sense: [...] "Is there a preteen on the planet who would be anything but mortified to find her middle school buzzing with gossip about her father's Twilight-based sit-in?" [...] Steve Hesiler of The A.V. Club said the episode demonstrated how far the show has <b>come</b> <b>because</b> [...] "it was only mid-season two when Parks & Rec started producing episodes where Pawnee residents showed up two, three, or more at a time—and contributed to the larger town mythology." [...] Heisler also praised how the show could pair two seemingly random characters like Andy and Chris and make them so funny. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik called [...] "Time Capsule" [...] the weakest of the first seven third season episodes, but he said [...] "that speaks more to the high quality of the rest". Poniewozik said the episode demonstrated that, despite how bizarre the complaints of Pawnee residents are, [...] "those concerns and arguments are what makes Pawnee Pawnee". Some reviews were more negative. Matt Richenthal called [...] "Time Capsule" [...] mediocre at best, especially compared to the previous episode, [...] "Flu Season". He said the episode was too centered on the [...] "one-note joke" [...] of Will Forte's character, and that the jokes about Twilight felt dated. Richenthal wrote, [...] "Parks and Recreation features too many hilarious characters to include such a gimmick." ...|$|E
