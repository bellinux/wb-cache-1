She {{attempted}} to stage comebacks in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in 1992, Branson, Missouri in 1994 ("People who <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> performances {{are hungry for}} the truth. They thank me for reminding them {{of the importance of}} God and country."), and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee in 1997. However, at each venue her audiences dwindled and investors were non-existent. By 2002, Bryant and her second husband Charlie Dry had claimed bankruptcy in three states. As of 2006 Bryant was living in Oklahoma City.|$|E

Early during her performance, her microphone failed, leaving Etheridge to play her guitar without singing while an alternate mic was found. Famously, the audience, made up largely {{of members of}} the New York City fire and police departments (and survivors of NYPD and FDNY personnel who were lost in the attacks) sang the lyrics themselves until Etheridge's mic was restored.|$|E

That's how I won the case. Madhubala did <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the presidential election, the image of McCain was removed from the video. During her performance at Petco Park, Madonna [...] congratulated Barack Obama, on his historic win for presidency of the United States. Madonna stated, [...] "This is a historical evening. This is a motherfucking important evening and we are lucky to be sharing it with the World [...] This {{is the beginning of a}} whole new world. Are you ready?! Are you fucking ready?!" [...] The video screens displayed images of Obama along with the message, [...] "We Won". Madonna also publicly voiced her opposition for Republican Vice Presidential candidate for 2008, Sarah Palin. While performing on the tour, Madonna shouted [...] "Sarah Palin can't <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> party. Sarah Palin can't <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> show. It's nothing personal. [...] Here's the sound of Sarah Palin's husband's snowmobile when it won't start. (followed by a loud screeching noise)." [...] While performing [...] "I Love New York" [...] during the request section, the line [...] "Get off my street" [...] was replaced by Madonna screaming [...] "You know who can get off of my street? Sarah Palin! I'm gonna kick her ass if she don't get off of my street." [...] Then she mocked Palin's accent and told the crowd that she loves her.|$|E

Mr Thrale has now treated me with a Repository, - and provided it with the pompous Title of Thraliana; I must endeavour to fill it with Nonsense new and old." [...] These encouraging remarks from Johnson set the theme of the work as it became a new [...] "Johnsoniana" [...] collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E

He played golf in the off-season during his playing days. For the 2011 spring training season, Lofton {{was hired by the}} Indians to coach baserunning and outfield work. He is also a post-game color commentator on the Fox Sports West post-game show for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Lofton considers himself a perfectionist. [...] "I love cleaning.

500|$|All but {{a handful}} of Smetana's {{compositions}} before his departure for Gothenburg had been piano works. Some of these early pieces have been dismissed by music historian Harold Schonberg as [...] "bombastic virtuoso rhetoric derived from Liszt". Under Proksch, however, Smetana acquired more polish, as revealed in works such as the G minor Sonata of 1846 and the E-flat Polka of the same year. The set of Six Characteristic Pieces of 1848 was dedicated to Liszt, who described it as [...] "the most outstanding, finely felt and finely finished pieces that have recently <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> note." [...] In this period Smetana planned a cycle of so-called [...] "album leaves", short pieces in every major and minor key, after the manner of Chopin's Preludes. The project became somewhat disorganised; in the pieces completed, some keys are repeated while others are unrepresented. After Smetana's final return from Gothenburg, when he committed himself primarily to the development of Czech opera, he wrote nothing for the piano for 13years.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} also {{added to the}} six song set list of the Hard Candy Promo Tour in 2008. Madonna wore a shiny black outfit with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was the fourth song of the set list. It was re-invented as a heavy-metal version. As the {{performance}} of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] ended, Madonna picked up an electric guitar and played the first few chords of The Rolling Stones single [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". She then asked the crowd whether {{they thought they had}} come to a Rolling Stones concert. When the crowd responded negatively, she started [...] "Hung Up", while dedicating it to all the people who had waited outside in the queue to watch the show. She declared that the noisy, metallic guitar breakdown of the song symbolised what waiting sounded like in the brain of all those who had waited. The song was performed in the futuristic rave with Japanese influences segment of the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna wore a futuristic robotic outfit designed by Heatherette, with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair. The similar heavy-metal version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] was performed but it later gave way to the ABBA music. Before starting the performance, she played a capella versions of her older hit songs on audience demand, mostly [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". However, after that, the electric guitar was played to make noises, which Madonna dedicated to Republican vice-presidential nominee for the 2008 election, Sarah Palin. She said, [...] "I'd like to express myself to Sarah Palin right now. [...] This is the sound of Sarah Palin thinking. [...] Sarah Palin can't <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> party. Sarah Palin can't <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> show. It's nothing personal." [...] The performance ended with Madonna playing the guitar riff of [...] "A New Level" [...] by heavy-metal band Pantera. For the second European leg of the tour in 2009, [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed from the setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen".|$|E
500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|E
500|$|He then {{quotes a}} Mr. Townson's {{account of how}} crossbills feed on pine cones, {{inserting}} their beaks between the scales and then forcing them sideways, opening the cone. Yarrell then immediately returns to anatomy, describing in detail (nearly a page) how the tongue is used to extract the seed from between the cone scales. Only then does he return to Mr. Townson, quoting him as saying [...] "The degree of the lateral power is surprising, and they are fond of exercising it for amusement; they are, therefore, not a little mischievous. My pets would often <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> table whilst I was writing, and carry off my pencils... and tear them to pieces in a minute." [...] Yarrell then adds an observation of his own, and contradicts an opinion of a famous scientist: [...] "Notwithstanding Buffon's assertion to the contrary, they can pick up and eat the smallest seeds... so perfect and useful is this singular instrument." [...] He goes on to criticise Buffon's description of the crossbill's beak as [...] "an error and defect of Nature, and a useless deformity" [...] as [...] "an erroneous and hasty conclusion". Yarrell concludes by writing [...] "I have never met with a more interesting, or more beautiful example, of the adaptation of means to an end, than {{is to be found}} in the beak, the tongue, and their muscles, in the Crossbill".|$|E
