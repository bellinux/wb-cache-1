5000|$|Coroniceras has a thin {{discoidal}} {{form with}} a <b>circular</b> <b>whorl</b> section, arched venter, single tall keel, and few but strong ribs. Coroniceras {{is included in}} the subfamily Arietitinae ...|$|E
50|$|The {{shell of}} Campbelloceras has a <b>circular</b> <b>whorl</b> section, only {{slightly}} impressed, and a siphuncle that {{is close to}} the venter in all growth stages. Campbelloceras differs from Tarphyceras in that the rate of expansion is greater, the siphuncle is proportionally largers, and an impression is shallower.|$|E
40|$|Rotifers are free-swimming {{aquatic animals}} that feed by {{collecting}} particles {{through the use}} of cilia that are arranged around the mouth in two <b>circular</b> <b>whorls.</b> Specimens of Brachionus plicatilis exposed to 6 µm and 0. 5 µm polystyrene beads (together or separately) captured the particles at significantly different rates. Calculation of the Jacob 2 ̆ 7 s Selectivity Index (D) revealed a significant selectivity for the larger (6 µm) beads, over the smaller (0. 5 µm) beads (pB. plicatilis revealed that bacteria are not likely a significant energy source. Bacterial concentration ≥ 108 cells/ml (100 x typical values) are necessary for feeding on bacterial to support at least 33...|$|R
50|$|Exiteloceras was {{proposed}} by Alpheus Hyatt in 1894 for heteromorph ammonites with shells that are loosely coiled in a plane, early whorls varying from straight limbs connected by semicircular elbows to elliptical or nearly <b>circular</b> loops, later <b>whorls</b> being elliptical to <b>circular.</b> The <b>whorl</b> section is ovate with the dorsum {{on the inside}} curve broader than the venter on the outside. The ribs may be straight or flexuous and mostly slant. Most end with a tubule on the ventrolateral shoulder. The suture is ammonitic. The deeply incised sutural elements are asymmetric, including the double-pronged ventral lobe.|$|R
50|$|In biology, a whorl is {{a cluster}} of cells or tissue that {{surrounds}} another and wraps around another in an expanding <b>circular</b> pattern. <b>Whorls</b> occur {{at the ends of}} different structures or in the middle of structures. Structures of some organs are often described as whorls and used in the aid of identification.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Circular</b> to {{rectangular}} <b>whorl</b> section; fine, low, straight or flexuous simple or branched ribs, periodically truncated by thin, high, enlarged ribs bearing lateral and ventrolateral tubercles; inner whorls {{tending to}} have depressed whorl section and to resemble Olcostephanus.|$|R
50|$|Wool {{from the}} {{mountain}} goat and Salish Wool Dog, now extinct, were used to craft wool woven mats, blankets, clothing, and robes. The wool would be taken from the animals and then mixed with a diatomaceous earth removing oils and adding a white colour. After wetting, the wool would be twisted between the palm and thigh to create a loose strand, after which was spun. Whorls {{were placed on the}} shafts of wood spindles, and the loose strands of wool were spun. Some of the <b>circular</b> spindle <b>whorls</b> were plain, but others had elaborate designs and beings depicted.|$|R
