Classical electrophysiological studies demonstrated that stimulation of <b>command</b> <b>neurons</b> could activate neural circuits to trigger fixed action patterns. Our method was designed to find such <b>command</b> <b>neurons</b> for diverse behaviors by screening flies in which random subsets of brain cells were activated. We took advantage of the large collection of Gal 4 lines from the NP project and crossed 835 Gal 4 strains with relatively limited Gal 4 expression in the brain to flies carrying a UAS transgene encoding TRPM 8, a cold-sensitive ion channel. Low temperatures opened the TRPM 8 channel in Gal 4 -expressing cells, leading to their excitation, and in many cases induced overt behavioral changes in adult flies. Paralysis was reproducibly observed in the progeny of crosses with 84 lines, whereas more specific behaviors were induced with 24 other lines. Stimulation performed using the heat-activated channel, TrpA 1, resulted in clearer and more robust behaviors, including flight, feeding, and egg-laying.

This notion is supported by studies using in vivo calcium imaging in larval zebrafish which show that MiD2cm and MiD3cm are activated along with the M-cell when an offending stimulus is directed towards the head but not the tail, and are correlated with C-starts of a larger initial turn angle.|$|E

Using lamprey brain preparations, and electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and tract tracing experiments, we describe the neural substrate responsible for transforming an olfactory input into a locomotor output.

40|$|SummaryHunger is {{a complex}} motivational state that drives {{multiple}} behaviors. The sensation of hunger is caused by an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. One immediate response to hunger is increased food consumption. Hunger also modulates behaviors related to food seeking such as increased locomotion and enhanced sensory sensitivity in both insects [1 – 5] and vertebrates [6, 7]. In addition, hunger can promote the expression of food-associated memory [8, 9]. Although {{progress is being made}} [10], how hunger is represented in the brain and how it coordinates these behavioral responses is not fully understood in any system. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to identify neurons encoding hunger. We found a small group of neurons that, when activated, induced a fed fly to eat as though it were starved, suggesting that these neurons are downstream of the metabolic regulation of hunger. Artificially activating these neurons also promotes appetitive memory performance in sated flies, indicating that these neurons are not simply feeding <b>command</b> <b>neurons</b> but likely play a more general role in encoding hunger. We determined that the neurons relevant for the feeding effect are serotonergic and project broadly within the brain, suggesting a possible mechanism for how various responses to hunger are coordinated.

40|$|Animals {{decide on}} {{appropriate}} behaviors when encountering various stimuli by integrating sensory information, learning and motivational state. This study takes a neuroethological approach in investigating how the predatory sea-slug Pleurobranchaea californica makes behavioral choices. Pleurobranchaea is a predatory generalist that surveys its environment for potential prey in a trial-and-error fashion. When encountering the Nudibranch Flabellina iodinea and its noxious defense mechanism, the predator quickly learns {{to avoid the}} prey and retains the aversive association for up to 72 hours post-training. The conditioning paradigm is highly specific and {{does not affect the}} internal state of the animal. Feeding thresholds for the appetitive stimulus betaine are not significantly changed, and it continues to attack a related prey species, Hermissenda crassicornis. This prey avoidance paradigm resembles a situation the predators may face in their natural environments, and it shows how they may make appropriate decisions when choosing suitable prey. 	After prey avoidance conditioning, feeding on Flabellina is suppressed in trained animals. The activity of identified feeding <b>command</b> <b>neurons</b> (PCP), necessary and sufficient to activate feeding, was examined in whole animal preparations of conditioned and control animals to assay for neural correlates of conditioning. Suppression of PCP activity was consistent in all preparations during presentation of either Flabellina or Hermissenda, but not during presentation of strong appetitive stimuli such as betaine or squid homogenate. This is not consistent with the results observed in intact animals and in previous food aversion paradigms where suppression of feeding was only present in trained animals during presentation of the conditioned stimuli (Davis and Gillette 1978; Davis et al. 1980; Mpitsos and Cohan 1986 c). This suggests another source of inhibition, possibly a pain induced effect of surgery. Whole animal preparations exhibited increased feeding thresholds, consistent with a general suppression of feeding. Additionally, pain or distress caused by surgery may cause animals to enter a defensive protective state conserving energy and avoiding contact with natural prey. These results suggest that injury-induced suppression of feeding masks the cellular correlates of prey avoidance learning. 	In Pleurobranchaea, active feeding and avoidance turning are mutually exclusive behaviors. The decision to exhibit either behavior is made through integrating sensory stimuli and internal state. The neuronal elements mediating this decision were investigated in isolated nervous system preparations. I monitored components of the feeding network, the PCP <b>command</b> <b>neurons</b> and the presynaptic inhibitory interneurons (I 2 s), during stimulation of the Large Oral Veil Nerve (LOVN) to induce withdrawal and fictive avoidance turning. PCP and I 2 activity was inhibited during the withdrawal period (first 5 - 10 sec post-stimulation) and persisted well into the fictive avoidance turn (the following 30 - 40 sec). The inhibition of PCP s and I 2 s was coincident and thus resembled effects of suppression of feeding during the escape swim. It basically differed from learned food avoidance, in which I 2 s were tonically active during tonic inhibition of PCPs. Members of the swim network were surveyed to determine the source of inhibition. One swim output neuron, Aci- 1, that was previously found to strongly inhibit PCP s and I 2 s via activation of the interneuron I 1 during the swim episode, was shown to be similarly activated in a tonic fashion during withdrawal and the avoidance turn. These results thus provide a neuronal correlate to suppression of feeding during avoidance turning...|$|R
