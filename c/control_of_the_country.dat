5|$|The Battle of Svolder (Svold or Swold) was a naval battle {{fought in}} September 999 or 1000 {{in the western}} Baltic Sea between King Olaf Tryggvason of Norway and an {{alliance}} of his enemies. The backdrop of the battle was the unification of Norway into a single state, long-standing Danish efforts to gain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> {{and the spread of}} Christianity in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the head}} of his army, Simeon I marched from Preslav through the Balkan Mountains and the valley of the river Tundzha and besieged Adrianople. While the bulk of the Bulgarian forces were {{concentrated}} in Thrace, the Byzantines bribed the Serbian prince Pavle Branović, who was a Bulgarian protégé, to switch sides. The Bulgarians answered with a successful intervention in Serbia, easily gained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> and placed in power another Bulgarian candidate, Zaharija Pribisavljević. The conflict in Serbia distracted the Bulgarian military operations against the Byzantine Empire for the rest of 921.|$|E
5|$|Following Habyarimana's death, a {{military}} committee led by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora took immediate <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Under the committee's direction, the Hutu militia Interahamwe and the Presidential Guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures; within 24 hours they had killed all moderate leaders, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The killers then began targeting the entire Tutsi population, {{as well as}} moderate Hutu, beginning the Rwandan Genocide. Over the course of approximately 100 days, over 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, during President Perón's first term in office, the growth in economic nationalism in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> had reached a point where, for many Argentines in search <b>of</b> self-determination, <b>the</b> foreign-owned railways had become symbols <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> economy by foreign powers.|$|R
5|$|In September 1945, Hồ {{declared}} independence {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) following {{the withdrawal of}} Imperial Japan, which had seized <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> from France during the Second World War. At the time, there was a power vacuum, as both Japan and France had been decimated by the war. There was an outbreak of nationalist fervour in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned {{to be the leader}} of the local unit, but he left the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish coup of July 1936 {{fractured}} the Spanish Republican Armed Forces {{and marked}} the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Following a period of troubles in the Second Spanish Republic, a group of officers attempted to overthrow the left-wing Popular Front government, elected five months previously, in a military coup. Planning started in early 1936, and the coup was launched on 17 and 18 July. The coup failed to take complete <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> and civil war ensued.|$|E
5|$|The romantic {{nationalism}} that Tod espoused {{was used}} by Indian nationalist writers, especially those from the 1850s, as they sought to resist British <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Works such as Jyotirindranath Tagore's Sarojini ba Chittor Akrama and Girishchandra Ghosh's Ananda Raho retold Tod's vision of the Rajputs in a manner to further their cause. Other works which drew their story from Tod's works include Padmini Upakhyan (1858) by Rangalal Banerjee and Krishna Kumari (1861) by Michael Madhusudan Dutt.|$|E

50|$|At the Bureau's command bunker, Faulke {{announces that}} {{communications}} worldwide have been jammed and other U.S. military bases {{have been destroyed}} in similar attacks. With no way to contact the White House and other American military leaders, Faulke formally activates the Bureau (now renamed XCOM) and assumes <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> remaining military forces to counter the Outsider threat, while Bureau operatives planted in major cities downplay the attacks as safety drills to keep the civilian populace from panicking.|$|R
5|$|Albania still {{maintained}} some {{links with}} the outside world at this time, trading with neutral countries, such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, the young and the military, whom he feared might threaten his hold on the country. A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party's <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> limited private property and forbade foreign loans. The country sank into a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off from the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat {{required}} considerable restoration in the 20th century, {{mainly the}} removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Khmer Rouge <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, a pavilion was ruined by a stray American shell, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by art thieves working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.|$|E
5|$|Colonial {{rule in the}} Congo {{began in}} the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, {{frustrated}} by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.|$|E
50|$|During the war, {{the company}} {{expanded}} into explosives for their mining operations, becoming Italy’s largest supplier <b>of</b> munitions taking <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country’s</b> industry.

5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son {{as a candidate for}} the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} the book was written, Paraguay was under the {{dictatorship}} of Alfredo Stroessner, {{who went on to}} rule the country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the book to be at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia’s to achieve and maintain the effective <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.|$|E
5|$|EdwardIII was {{not content}} with the peace {{agreement}} made in his name, but the renewal of the war with Scotland originated in private, rather than royal initiative. A group of English magnates known as The Disinherited, who had lost land in Scotland by the peace accord, staged an invasion of Scotland and won a great victory at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332. They attempted to install Edward Balliol as king of Scotland in DavidII's place, but Balliol was soon expelled {{and was forced to}} seek the help of EdwardIII. The English king responded by laying siege to the important border town of Berwick and defeated a large relieving army at the Battle of Halidon Hill. Edward reinstated Balliol on the throne and received a substantial amount of land in southern Scotland. These victories proved hard to sustain, as forces loyal to DavidII gradually regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> In 1338, Edward was forced to agree to a truce with the Scots.|$|E

In 1930, during his first term, he signed the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, which, as a step toward greater independence, granted Britain the unlimited right to station its armed forces in and transit military units through Iraq and also gave legitimacy to British <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> oil industry.|$|R

5|$|Following the French withdrawal, Ali, the wāli (governor) and self-declared khedive (viceroy) of Egypt, {{sought to}} {{consolidate}} his newfound <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> To {{achieve this goal}} he took a number of steps to limit, and eventually eliminate, {{the ability of the}} al-Azhar ulema to influence the government. He imposed taxes on rizqa lands (tax-free property owned by mosques) and madrasas, from which al-Azhar drew a major portion of its income. In June 1809, he ordered that the deeds to all rizqa lands be forfeited to the state in a move that provoked outrage among the ulema. As a result, Umar Makram, the naqib al-ashraf, a prestigious Islamic post, led a revolt in July 1809. The revolt failed and Makram, an influential ally of the ulema, was exiled to Damietta.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Washington pumped USD322.4 {{million into}} South Vietnam, and the {{historian}} George McTurnan Kahin calculated that 87% of this {{came through the}} CIP. From the end of 1955, when Diem took full <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> after ousting Bảo Đại and declaring himself president, until 1961, the US provided Saigon with USD1.447 billion in aid, mostly through the CIP. In addition, USD95.6 million of loans were given. In 1958 and 1959, the CIP accounted for around 80% of economic assistance. By 1960, Diem had accumulated USD216.4 million in reserves. The amount of CIP aid peaked at USD398 million in 1966 and began dropping thereafter, reaching USD233 million by 1973.|$|E

This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their ability to communicate with foreign pilots, which played a role in crash of Flight 1907. In addition, <b>the</b> military's complete <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|R
