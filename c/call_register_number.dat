If the <b>number</b> of <b>registers</b> exceeds the capability of the finite state machine to address them, then registers outside the bounds will be unreachable.

For example, DDR2 SDRAM has a 13-bit Mode Register, a 13-bit Extended Mode Register #1 (EMR1), and a 5-bit Extended Mode Register #2 (EMR2).|$|R
50|$|Australia has a {{national}} Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Register.</b> The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) {{is responsible for}} the register under the Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Register</b> Act 2006. In order to be included on the <b>register,</b> a telephone <b>number</b> must be used or maintained primarily for private or domestic purposes, or exclusively for transmitting and/or receiving faxes. Government body numbers and emergency services numbers are also able and numbers can be removed at any time.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a legal}} {{requirement}} that all organisations (including companies, charities, voluntary organisations and political parties) do not make such <b>calls</b> to <b>numbers</b> <b>registered</b> on the TPS unless consent has been given; however the TPS has no powers of enforcement, and a 2013 survey by Which? found that people registered on the TPS list received twice as many marketing calls as those not on the list. Enforcement {{is the responsibility of}} the Information Commissioner, which until 2012 did not have suitable legal powers to act, but in 2012 acquired the power to impose fines of up to £500,000, although enforcing the rules was not easy given the vast amounts of money that companies which flouted the rules stood to make.|$|R
50|$|Australia has a {{national}} Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Register</b> {{to curb the}} growing number of telemarketing telephone calls that Australians receive. Legislation was passed in the Parliament of Australia on 30 June 2006 enacting the Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Register</b> Act 2006. The Australian Communications and Media Authority is responsible for establishing and overseeing the register and has appointed Service Stream Solutions Pty Ltd to operate the Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Register.</b>|$|R

Several large Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Registers</b> {{have been set up}} by national Governments and, after some initial teething problems, they appear to be working well – with large <b>numbers</b> of <b>registered</b> consumers and numerous examples of enforcement action.

50|$|First, the Act {{establishes}} the Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Registers,</b> on which telephone <b>numbers</b> may be <b>registered.</b> As of 30 April 2017, {{there are three}} Do Not Call Registers: (i) the No Fax Message Register; (ii) the No Text Message Register; and (iii) the No Voice <b>Call</b> <b>Register.</b> Generally, if a telephone number is listed on a Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Register</b> (e.g. the No Text Message Register), then it is not permitted to send a marketing message of the relevant kind (e.g. text message) to that telephone number.|$|R
40|$|Region quadtrees are {{convenient}} {{tools for}} hierarchical image analysis. Like the related Haar wavelets, they are simple to generate within a fixed calculation time. The clustering at each resolution level requires only local data, yet they deliver intuitive classification results. Although the region quadtree partitioning is very rigid, {{it can be}} rapidly computed from arbitrary imagery. This research article demonstrates how graphics hardware can be utilized to build region quadtrees at unprecedented speeds. To achieve this, a data-structure <b>called</b> HistoPyramid <b>registers</b> the <b>number</b> of desired image features in a pyramidal 2 D array. Then, this HistoPyramid is used as an implicit indexing data structure through quadtree traversal, creating lists of the registered image features directly in GPU memory, and virtually eliminating bus transfers between CPU and GPU. With this novel concept, quadtrees can be applied in real-time video processing on standard PC hardware. A multitude of applications in image and video processing arises, since region quadtree analysis becomes a light-weight preprocessing step for feature clustering in vision tasks, motion vector analysis, PDE calculations, or data compression. In a sidenote, we outline how this algorithm {{can be applied to}} 3 D volume data, effectively generating region octrees purely on graphics hardware...|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} form, some {{instructions}} (loads and stores) use all four bits to encode the <b>register</b> <b>number,</b> allowing access to r12-r15.

40|$|This report explores {{community}} {{attitudes to}} unsolicited telemarketing calls and electronic communications, and the awareness {{and effectiveness of}} the regimes that regulate these communications.   The main findings are: • Around one in three Australian adults (32 per cent) have <b>registered</b> a <b>number</b> on the Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Register,</b> although some did not personally <b>register</b> the <b>number.</b> While {{all of these people}} have their home <b>number</b> on the <b>Register,</b> only six per cent of all adults have registered their mobile phone <b>numbers.</b> The <b>Register</b> appears to have been very effective, particularly for those who have their home phone <b>number</b> <b>registered.</b>   Awareness is not the barrier to registration. In fact, awareness of the Register is high, as is the level of interest in registering amongst those not currently on the Register. The key barriers are that people have either not got around to it, or they do not experience problems with telemarketing calls. Awareness and knowledge of aspects of the Do Not <b>Call</b> <b>Register</b> Act and the registration process itself are generally low.   • Awareness and understanding of spam is generally high, as is use of spam filters. Despite these filters, on average, email users are receiving 23 spam emails a week, with most users deleting them without opening them. SMS or MMS spam is less prevalent, with personal mobile phone users receiving an average of two spam messages per month. Awareness of Australia’s anti spam laws is low.   • Generally people are unsure who they would complain to about unsolicited telemarketing calls. Complaining about unsolicited spam messages, however, is a little clearer, with many opting to contact the telephone or internet service provider. Supporting this, nearly one in four have considered making a complaint, but have not gone through with it (mainly because they didn’t know how to). Image: Stéfan / Flick...|$|R
