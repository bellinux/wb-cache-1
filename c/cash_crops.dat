Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of planned liberalism, prioritising <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.|$|E
5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed {{within a few}} decades {{as varied as the}} settlements. <b>Cash</b> <b>crops</b> included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.|$|E
40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{the short run}} and long run <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> output volatility equations in Nigeria. Time series data derived from FAO data base for Nigeria and publications of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) covering the period 1961 to 2010 {{were used in the}} study. Unit root tests conducted on the specified time series showed that all series were integrated of order one at 1 % probability level. The GARCH (1, 1) model was used to generate the <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> output volatility for Groundnut, Cotton seed, Cocoa Rubber and Palm oil. The short-run and long-run elasticities of <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> output volatility with respect to the specify explanatory variables were determined using the techniques of co-integration and error correction model estimation based on Ordinary Least Squares. The empirical results revealed that the nominal inflation rate, nominal exchange rate, loan guaranteed by ACGSF to <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> sector, harvested hectare of <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> and import substitution policy era influenced output volatility of cotton, groundnut, cocoa, rubber and palm oil in both short and long run periods in Nigeria. The study advocated for appropriate short and long term policy packages that should focused on the moderation of the identified significant macroeconomic shifters of <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> output volatility in the country. Also attention should be directed towards improving the quality of land allocated to <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> sub sector. Furthermore, the long run agricultural policies embedded in the import substitution policy should be use as basis for regulating <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> output volatility in Nigeria. </p...|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that <b>cash</b> <b>cropping</b> is {{positively associated with}} deforestation. We use three-year data (2000 - 2002, inclusive) from 493 households to estimate the association between <b>cash</b> <b>cropping</b> rice and deforestation. Doubling the area sown with rice {{is associated with a}} 26 - 30 percent increase in the area of forest cleared during the next cropping season. We simulate the changes in rice cultivation to reach a daily income level of $ 1 /person from <b>cash</b> <b>cropping</b> rice. We find that within 10 years: (1) the amount of deforestation would triple, (2) work requirements would exceed household's labor availability, and (3) fallows duration would decrease two-fold. To avoid the increase of deforestation from <b>cash</b> <b>cropping</b> requires increasing productivity, diversification of income sources, or both...|$|R

5|$|The colony {{supported}} mostly rain-fed agriculture, {{with limited}} irrigation {{for its first}} 30 years. The only <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> were nuts gathered close to the railroad between Kayes and Bamako. However, following successful tests of growing Egyptian cotton in West Africa during World War I, Émile Bélime began to campaign {{for the construction of}} a large irrigation system along the Niger river. Starting in 1921, significant irrigation projects around Koulikoro and later at Baguinéda-Camp and the Ségou Cercle began to bring water. The French believed this project could rival the major cotton growing centers of Egypt and the United States.|$|E

5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined {{largely because the}} plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E
5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on the labor of women, while the production of income depended on the labor of {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} {{human rights and}} {{development}} groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended {{due to lack of}} access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed {{with tens of thousands of}} laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on <b>cash</b> <b>crops.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses {{trade-offs}} between {{carbon sequestration}} and farmers’ incomes from land-use systems implemented in a community-based project, in Mozambique. Systems either focus on carbon sequestration or combine sequestration with <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> cultivation.

Compared with sequestration-only systems those that combine sequestration and <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> production have higher net benefits, {{although they are}} less cost-effective and have less carbon-sequestration potential. Interplanting with faidherbia albidia provides the most attractive balance among competing policy goals.

5|$|Agriculture was the empire's {{main source}} of income through taxes on land and produce. The {{majority}} of the people lived in villages and worked farming the staple crops of rice, pulses, and cotton in the dry areas and sugarcane in areas having sufficient rainfall, with areca and betel being the chief <b>cash</b> <b>crops.</b> The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from their labor.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} primates, {{one of the}} {{principal}} threats to both ruffed lemur species is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining. Both species appear to be very sensitive to logging, and are thought to be the most vulnerable of rainforest lemurs. The hardwoods that are favored for construction materials and selectively logged are also preferred by ruffed lemurs for their fruits and potentially affect their travel routes through the canopy. Deforestation, on the other hand, {{is a result of the}} need to provide firewood and to support subsistence agriculture and <b>cash</b> <b>crops.</b> For red ruffed lemurs, Slash-and-burn agriculture, known locally as tavy, is practiced seasonally on the Masoala peninsula between October and December, and its practice is expanding. Additionally, cattle are sometimes allowed to free-range over these former agricultural clearings, preventing forest re-growth.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E

5|$|Changes in the grazing {{habits of}} Ethiopia's {{indigenous}} peoples following the recent trend of settling in permanent villages have negatively impacted the Stresemann's bushcrow. While previously grazers left the soil loose {{and covered in}} dung to support the bushcrow's prey, this new lifestyle has resulted in overgrazing and soil compaction in some areas. The idea of private land ownership has also led to intensive planting of <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> such as maize. The rich soil that the species needs to forage is also prime farming land. In the Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary, acacia trees are being collected for firewood, removing the bushcrow's nesting site. While protected under law, this sanctuary has difficulties enforcing the law. It is believed that between 1999 and 2003 {{the population of the}} bushcrow declined by 80%.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} Leptospirosis, notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of <b>cash</b> <b>crops,</b> and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important <b>cash</b> <b>crops.</b> This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the five member nations, which could eventually lead to a common East African shilling.|$|E

5|$|The {{colonialism}} that Atangana {{had supported}} was ruinous in Cameroon. Production centred on enriching the chiefs, wooing of foreign investment, and the apparatus of colonial administration, and building only that infrastructure that would {{aid in the}} transport and export of <b>cash</b> <b>crops.</b> Nevertheless, Atangana's story became part of Beti folklore. For example, Beti storytellers related his tale in oral poems and songs that took up to a full night to recite. His legacy was largely forgotten by the nation at large between his death and Cameroonian independence. However, the nationalist scholarship that blossomed after Cameroon's independence in 1960 resurrected his story. Charles Atangana Avenue in downtown Yaoundé is named for him. A statue in his likeness tops a hill nearby, which had fallen into disrepair by 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the empire was largely {{dependent}} on agriculture. Sorghum (jowar), cotton, and pulse legumes grew in semi-arid regions, while sugarcane, rice, and wheat thrived in rainy areas. Betel leaves, areca (for chewing), and coconut were the principal <b>cash</b> <b>crops,</b> and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as turmeric, pepper, cardamom, and ginger grew in the remote Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of masons, sculptors, and other skilled artisans.|$|E
5|$|Cooper grew rapidly {{after being}} established, with {{a post office}} built in the {{community}} in 1871. Cooper was incorporated into a town in 1881 and held its first government elections. That same year, Cooper constructed the county courthouse. The town became the main market center for Delta County, and by 1885, Cooper had a population around 300. The Texas Midland Railroad, which ran through Cooper, was chartered in 1892. The railroad helped promote {{the rapid growth of}} the town. By 1896, Cooper's population had passed 1,000 people, and contained two churches, a school, and 21 businesses, including a bank and a hotel. The town also had two weekly newspapers. Cooper continued to grow into the early 1900s, especially in the area of agriculture. From the early 1890s to around 1910, farms boomed both in number and in value, with the number of <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> nearly tripling.
