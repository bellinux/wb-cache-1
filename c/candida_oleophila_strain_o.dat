40|$|Abstract The {{economic}} losses caused by post-harvest pathogens of apple and pear can still reach 25 %. There is currently an increasing demand to develop sustainable methods to control these post-harvest pathogens. Biocontrol agents are interesting candidates {{to answer this}} demand. Nevertheless, their commercial development is sometimes hampered by a low or non-reliable efficacy comparing to fungicide treatments. Fundamental research on the mode of action of the BCA and of its ecological fitness could help to overcome that phenomenon. This chapter reviews the progresses made during two decades to understand the mode of action and the ecological niche of two BCA, Pichia anomala strain K and <b>Candida</b> <b>oleophila</b> <b>strain</b> <b>O.</b> These advances required the combination of various methodologies (in vitro and in situ) and techniques (microbiology, microscopy, genome charac-terization, transcriptome, proteome, gene disruption [...] .) which are summarized here. Importantly, the practical impact of these discoveries to improve {{the efficacy of the}} biopesticide is also highlighted...|$|E

The {{objective of the}} study was to determine the efficacy of both antagonis-tic yeast's against wound postharvest pathogens of citrus fruits. The efficacy of both strains (applied at 10 s, 106 and 108 CFU/ml) was assessed against Penicillium digi-tclunu and P. italicum inoculated a-fter one hour (at a concentration of 1 Os, 106 and 107 spores/m 1) on citrus varieties 'clementine ' and 'valencia-late'. Fruits were incubated for one week at 24 'C before measurement of lesion diameter. The protective levels rvere positively correlated with high concentration of antagonist and low concentration of pathogen. Flighest protective levels (from 73 to 1 O 0 %) were detected with the appli-cation of strain O or strain K at 108 CFU/ml whatever the pathogen (applied at 1 O 5 spores/ml) and the citrus variety.

The strains were applied at three different concentrations (106, 107, 108 cfu/ml) and their efficacy tested in vivo on three separate fungi (Colletotrichum musae (Berk. & Curt.) Arx, Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon, and Cephalosporium sp.) {{and on a}} parasitic complex formed by association of these three fungi. At the concentrations used C. musae {{appeared to be the}} most pathogenic. The complex showed intermediate aggressiveness between C. musae and both other fungi. Statistically significant antagonistic effects were observed on C. musae, F. moniliforme, and the fungal complex. The highest protection level (54. 4 %) was observed with <b>strain</b> <b>O</b> added at 108 cfu/ml on crowns previously inoculated with the fungal complex. The level was lower when the fungi were inoculated separately. Furthermore, the antagonistic effect was strongly reinforced when <b>strain</b> <b>O</b> at 108 cfu/ml was applied 24 h before fungal complex inoculation (59. 9 %), as compared to its application 15 min (24. 3 %) or 3 h (27. 3 %) after fungal complex inoculation. Bananas showed increased susceptibility to the fungal complex from March to June, and this influenced the level of protection by yeast, which decreased over the same period. A strict negative correlation (R 2 = 0. 83) was highlighted between susceptibility of banana to crown rot and protection provided by yeast. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The in vivo and in vitro activity of exo-β- 1, 3 -glucanase was measured {{as a possible}} biocontrol mode of action for C. oleophila. Mean disease incidence caused by P. expansum was 0. 3 % for apples treated with fludioxonil + ciprodinil, which were used as a positive control, and 1 % for fruits treated {{with a combination of}} the three C. oleophila strains; the effects of these treatments were significantly equivalent. Disease incidence in control apples was 39 % and was significantly different from the other treatments. The in vivo exo-β- 1, 3 -glucanase activity began at 24 h and peaked at 72 and 96 h for all treatments. Strain L 06 had the highest activity (7. 96 nKat) and a specific activity of 2. 92 nKat μg- 1. Candida albicans had the lowest activity (2. 83 nKat) and a specific activity of 0. 67 nKat ug- 1. The highest in vitro activity was for C. albicans (85. 03 nKat) and the lowest for strain L 06 (78. 2 nKat). Significant differences in both in vivo and in vitro enzymatic activity were observed between strain L 06 and C. albicans. Polynomial regression analysis (R² = 0. 96 in vitro and 0. 68 in vivo) indicated that increased enzymatic activity was associated with reduced fruit disease incidence. The production of exo-β- 1, 3 -glucanase by C. oleophila is a possible mode of action for the efficient biocontrol of P. expansum on postharvest apples...|$|R

During a screening program of phenolic acid assimilating capacities it was found that a non-conventional ascomycetous yeast isolate, identified as <b>Candida</b> <b>oleophila,</b> efficiently decolorizes agar plates supplemented with the commercial textile diazo dye Reactive Black 5. Aerobic batch cultures of C. oleophila could completely decolorize up to 200 mg dye l− 1, an ability not yet reported for this yeast species. Moreover, this performance has been achieved in just 24 h of incubation at 26 ◦C in the presence of as little as 5 g glucose l− 1 and without visible signs of dye adsorption to yeast cells. It was found that decolorization occurs during the exponential growth phase and neither laccase nor manganese-dependent peroxidase activities were detected in the culture medium.

Damage caused by the packing-house processing line was also assessed. Treating orange fruits with the yeast Pichia guilliermondii (strain 5 A) in the processing line generally led to a significant reduction of post-harvest decay compared to the processed control, while the commercial product Aspire®, based on <b>Candida</b> <b>oleophila,</b> was ineffective in inhibiting the pathogen when applied alone. The integrated application of thiabendazole or imazalil with the biocontrol agents significantly improved the control of fruit decay. Using thiabendazole at concentrations of 0. 1 and 1. 2 g L - 1, led to similar inhibition of fruit decay in two trials. Both yeasts were equally able to colonize the fruit actively during storage.

50|$|Resistance {{to common}} {{fungicides}} is currently combated {{through the use}} of other chemicals. For example, sodium o-phenylphenate-resistant strains are dealt with via formaldehyde fumigation while imazalil-resistant strains are controlled {{through the use of}} pyrimethanil, a fungicide also approved for fighting strains resistant to other fungicides. As fungicide resistance increases globally, other measures of control are being considered including that of biocontrol. Effective biocontrol agents include bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas syringae as well as fungi such as Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida guilliermondii. In Clementines and Valencia oranges, <b>Candida</b> <b>oleophila,</b> Pichia anomala and Candida famata have been shown to reduce disease. Despite the ability of various biocontrol agents to exhibit antagonistic activity, biocontrol has not been shown to provide complete control over P.digitatum and is therefore commonly used in conjunction with another measure of control. Alternative measures of control include essential oils such as Syzygium aromaticum and Lippia javanica, ultraviolet light, curing, vapour heat and cell-penetrating anti-fungal peptides.|$|R

40|$|The central {{aspect of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the influence of nitrogen feed rate at constant C/N ratio on continuous citric acid fermentation by <b>Candida</b> <b>oleophila</b> ATCC 20177. Medium ammonia nitrogen and glucose concentrations influenced growth and production. Space-time yield (STY) meaning volumetric productivity, biomass specific productivity (BSP), product concentration, product selectivity and citrate/isocitrate ratio increased with increasing residence time (RT). BSP increased in an exponential mode lowering nitrogen feed rates. Highest BSP for citric acid of 0. 13 g/(g h) was achieved at lowest NH 4 Cl concentration of 1. 5 g/l and highest STY (1. 2 g/l h) with 3 g NH 4 Cl/l at a RT of 25 h. Citric acid 74. 2 g/l were produced at 58 h RT and 6 g NH 4 Cl/l. Glucose uptake rate seems to be strictly controlled by the growth rate of the yeast cells. Optimum nitrogen concentration and adapted C/N ratio are essential for successful continuous citric acid fermentation. The biomass-specific nitrogen feed rate is the most important factor influencing continuous citric acid production by yeasts.

40|$|A {{suitable}} {{strain and}} important factors influencing citric acid formation in yeasts were identified. <b>Candida</b> <b>oleophila</b> ATCC 20177 {{was chosen as}} the best citric acid producer from several Candida strains. Yields of 50 g/l citric acid were produced in shake flask and 80 g/l in fed-batch fermentations with 1. 5 and 3 g/l NH(4) Cl under non-optimized conditions. Ammonium nitrogen was identified as the limiting substrate for citrate formation. Citric acid excretion begins a few hours after exhaustion of nitrogen in the medium. The importance of intracellular nitrogen limitation was clarified by elemental analysis of C. oleophila biomass. The nitrogen content of C. oleophila biomass decreased from 7. 45 % during the growth phase to 3. 96 % in the production phase. The biomass contained less carbon and more trace elements in the growth phase compared with the production phase. Relatively high intracellular NH(4) (+) concentration of about 1. 2 mg/g biomass (~ 37. 4 mM) was found during the production phase. The low intracellular nitrogen content and increase of intracellular NH(4) (+) concentration, possibly caused by proteolysis following extracellular nitrogen exhaustion, trigger citric acid production. Intracellular nitrogen limitation and the increase in intracellular NH(4) (+) concentration are the most important factors influencing citric acid formation in yeasts...|$|R

50|$|Several {{cultural}} management {{methods can}} be effective in avoiding disease caused by Pythium aphanidermatum. The pathogen thrives in a moist environment, so {{it is important to}} prevent an excessive amount of moisture from building up in the plant media Irrigation that is too frequent and usage of soil that has poor drainage are common mistakes that result in inoculation. In addition, poor ventilation and insufficient exposure to sunlight can cause the plants themselves to accumulate moisture, potentially spreading disease. Sanitation of the soil using chemical treatment and minimizing the amount of plant debris in which the pathogen can survive is also an effective cultural practice.Fungicides are also effective control methods. Systemic and contact fungicides can be used, but in order to prevent the pathogen from becoming resistant to the treatment it is best to alternate between systemic and contact substances. Several chemical types can be used to manage the pathogen including acylalanines, thiadiazoles, carbamates, cinnamic acid derivatives, phosphonates, and phosphites. In general, these fungicides yield best results when used for preventative purposes.Biological control of the pathogen has also been successful. Bacteria and fungi can be used to treat Pythium aphanidermatum in turf, crops, and flowering greenhouse plants.

The OMP patterns determined by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of one to six major proteins with apparent molecular masses that varied from 27 to 39 kDa except O 27 :K 1 strain isolated from mastitis cow, some other minor protein bands in the range at 3 to 22. 625 kDa were present in all <b>strains</b> except <b>O</b> 119 :K 69 strain isolated from diarrheic calf.

40|$|<b>Strain</b> <b>O</b> 42 (serotype O 44 :H 18) of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) {{has been}} shown to be {{pathogenic}} in volunteer experiments. This strain exhibited plasmid (pO 42) -encoded D-mannose-resistant hemagglutinating activity (MRHA) that was detected only at low temperatures (e. g., 0 degrees C) and only with human erythrocytes. The production of this cryogenic MRHA (cryo-MRHA) was observed when the bacteria were grown in liquid media and was strictly regulated by bacterial growth temperatures. Transposon-insertion mutagenesis revealed that this MRHA is associated with (i) bacterial clump formation in liquid cultures, (ii) bacterial adherence to HEp- 2 cells as well as (Formalin-fixed) human colonic mucosa, and (iii) production of a 16 -kDa outer membrane protein. The PCR designed on the basis of the determined cryo-MRHA-associated DNA sequence sharply distinguished <b>strain</b> <b>O</b> 42 from eight other EAggEC strains whose MRHAs were detected at both cold and room temperatures to the same (or similar) extent. <b>Strain</b> <b>O</b> 42 possessed a surface layer that may enhance the pO 42 -mediated adherence.

40|$|O antigens of the 24 O-serotype {{strains of}} Serratia marcescens were {{investigated}} in dot enzyme immunoassay with whole-cell antigens and by immunoblotting with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens. Three pairs of <b>strains,</b> <b>O</b> 2 /O 3, O 6 /O 7, and O 12 /O 14, had indistinguishable LPS antigens, despite having distinct specificities in agglutination tests with whole-cell antigens. Strong cross-reactions {{were also found}} in LPS antigens from <b>strains</b> <b>O</b> 9 /O 15, O 17 /O 19, O 10 /O 22, and O 16 /O 20.

A panel of absorbed antisera was prepared to facilitate the detection of a reduced set of LPS antigens in a dot enzyme immunoassay.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Food Science, Washington State UniversityYeast {{contamination}} during winemaking, {{particularly by}} Brettanomyces bruxellensis or Zygosaccharomyces bailii, {{can have a}} detrimental impact on wine quality if growth is not controlled. Nevertheless, speculation exists that some Z. bailii strains could be beneficial during vinification, particularly for stuck fermentations. Therefore red wines adjusted to 13, 15, or 17 % v/v ethanol and containing 40 or 60 g/l fructose were inoculated with Z. bailii. However, a Saccharomyces wine strain was more effective at removing the residual sugar and produced less volatile acidity. Consequently, antimicrobial technologies to limit undesirable yeast growth were also evaluated. The efficacy of 200 mg/l dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) was determined against yeasts originally isolated from regional vineyards, including <b>Candida</b> <b>oleophila,</b> <b>Candida</b> californica, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Meyerozyma caribbica, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, and Wickerhamomyces anomalus, inoculated into grape must. Following treatment to 10 ^ 4 or 10 ^ 6 cfu/ml of each yeast, populations initially declined several logs but within several days increased to > 10 ^ 6 cfu/ml, regardless of inocula or strain. When DMDC was added to grape must with Z. bailii, 10 ^ 3 cfu/ml populations were not detected following treatment, although 10 ^ 6 cfu/ml did grow. Conversely, when DMDC was added to wines with 10 ^ 6 cfu/ml Z. bailii, growth was limited for > 85 days. Growth of B. bruxellensis in wines at populations 10 ^ 4 cfu/ml was generally limited by DMDC, although sensitivity was dependent upon strain. However, 4 -ethylphenol and 4 -ethylguiacol production was limited in wine for several years. Alternatively, a factorial experiment using wines inoculated with B. bruxellensis evaluated storage temperature (22 °, 18 °, 15 °, or 10 °C) and molecular SO 2 (mSO 2) addition (about 0. 0, 0. 2, 0. 5, or 1. 1 mg/l) and determined that while some strains could grow at either 10 °C or with about 0. 5 mg/l mSO 2; conditions of 0. 40 mg/l mSO 2 synergistically limited growth. The cumulative results demonstrated that while commercial application of Z. bailii during vinification may not be practical, reliance on DMDC or the interactive impacts of SO 2 and temperature could limit a variety yeasts associated with wine spoilage including Z. bailii and B. bruxellensis.

40|$|Forty-four Escherichia coli <b>O</b> 75 <b>strains</b> from {{patients}} with urinary tract infections {{were characterized by}} a variety of methods to obtain evidence of their clonal distribution and uropathogenic properties. By K and H antigen typing, the strains were divided into the following serotypes: O 75 :K 5 :H- (18 <b>strains),</b> <b>O</b> 75 :K 95 :H- (10 <b>strains),</b> <b>O</b> 75 :K 95 :H 5 (7 <b>strains),</b> <b>O</b> 75 :K 100 :H 5 (4 <b>strains),</b> and <b>O</b> 75 :K-:H 55 (5 strains). Generally, biotyping proved to be of no discriminative value. With two exceptions the strains were found {{to be sensitive to the}} bactericidal effect of normal human serum. As shown by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, the whole-cell protein profile (WCPP), and the patterns of the outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharides, all but the five O 75 :H 55 strains were genetically closely related to each other and could be classified into one clonal group. The O 75 :K-:H 55 strains proved to be quite different and lacked type 1 fimbriae. All 17 K 95 (H-, H 5) strains produced hemolysin and P fimbriae. Five of the O 75 :K 5 :H- strains were different from the other K 5 strains by showing hemagglutinating properties, on the basis of the presence of the OX adhesin. The last two groups are suggested to be uropathogenic and are proposed to represent separate clonal groups or subgroups...|$|R
40|$|Invasion of non-professional phagocytes is a {{strategy}} employed by several mucosal pathogens, but has not been investigated in detail for Moraxella catarrhalis, {{a major cause of}} human respiratory tract infections. We investigated the role of outer membrane protein (OMP) UspA 1 and lipooligosaccharide (LOS) in M. catarrhalis invasion into epithelial cells. An isogenic mutant of <b>strain</b> <b>O</b> 35 E, which lacked expression of the UspA 1 adhesin, demonstrated not only severely impaired adherence (86 %) to but also reduced invasion (77 %) into Chang conjunctival cells in comparison with the wild-type strain. The isogenic, LOS-deficient mutant <b>strain</b> <b>O</b> 35 E. lpxA was attenuated in adherence (93 %) and its capacity to invade was severely reduced (95 %), but not abolished. Inhibition assays using sucrose and cytochalasin D, respectively, demonstrated that clathrin and actin polymerization contribute to internalization of M. catarrhalis by Chang cells. Furthermore, inhibition of UspA 1 -mediated binding to cell-associated fibronectin and alpha 5 beta 1 integrin decreased invasion of M. catarrhalis <b>strain</b> <b>O</b> 35 E (72 % and 41 %, respectively). These data indicate that OMP UspA 1 and LOS profoundly affect the capacity of M. catarrhalis to invade epithelial cells...|$|R
