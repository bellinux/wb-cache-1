40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Information Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. This thesis {{explores the}} notion <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice, and in {{particular}} how they {{make sense of their}} environment in order to create knowledge and enable learning. Traditionally <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice are viewed as stewards of expert knowledge, but this thesis argues that they are better understood as sensemaking phenomena. Chapter one introduces the theory of sensemaking as developed by Karl Weick. This chapter introduces the seven properties of sensemaking. It also explores organisational sensemaking by taking the intersubjective and generic subjective levels of sensemaking into account. Chapter two focuses on the literature on <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice as self-organising knowledge structures. Three structural aspects <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> this kind are introduced, namely domain, community and practice. Following Etienne Wenger two additional aspects <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice—namely meaning and identity—are analyzed as these provide the basis for a link to sensemaking theory. In the final part of this chapter the downside <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice is reviewed as they do not only present opportunities but also unique challenges for organisations. Chapter three combines the conclusions from the previous two chapters by interpreting <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice from a sensemaking perspective. The seven properties of sensemaking are applied to <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice and the role <b>of</b> meaning in <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice is viewed through the lens of sensemaking. Furthermore the role <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice might play in enhancing the phases of organisational sensemaking is indicated. Chapter four concludes that <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice indeed function as sensemaking phenomena in their environments. It is argued that nurturing <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice as centres of sensemaking could be advantageous to organisations and recommendations are made on how to best achieve this...|$|R

40|$|Because of its {{potential}} self-sustainability, <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice may serve as useful practice-based knowledge sharing platforms for collaborative research and training, and thereby enhance development of human resources in the health sector. However, <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice are complex structures and need support from their host organisations and commitment from their members.   This article examines the diverse ways in which <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> nurse educators and practitioners {{who were part of}} a funded program in Tshwane District, South Africa evolved over a period of seven years. Adopting an ethnographic approach of reflexivity and learning, we compared and analysed {{the ways in which the}} <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice became sustainable over time. Our recommendations for institutional support <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice in the health sector are based on the lessons we learned during the program that contributed to the configuration and reconfiguration of some <b>of</b> our <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice and the disengagement of others. We believe that our findings may have implications for replicability and sustainability <b>of</b> other <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice.

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot written about the {{benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice (CoP) in university. The benefit <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice was described with respect to teachers’ qualification and teaching competencies influencing students implicitly as well as to areas related to the students themselves. Many studies prove the fact that the process of learning is of a social character (e. g. Lave, Wenger, 1991). That is why the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice present suitable environment for collaborative learning which makes the process of generating, sharing and storing knowledge easier. The present paper defines on a theoretical level the concept <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice and moreover, provides a brief overview of the latest research in the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice with regard to education. Another part of the article focuses on the pre-research <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice at Faculty of Economics and Management (FEM) Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CULS). Although the authors conform with the opinion that the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice are a natural feature and spontaneously develop wherever {{there is a need for}} sharing implicit or tacit knowledge, the pre-research focused on the verification of this premise in order to continue in the research of a quantitative character. The existence <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice was verified on the basis of fundamental characteristics following Wenger’s model. Other characteristics, considered significant in relation to the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice by McDermott were also investigated. Based on a group interview the existence <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice of the students at FEM at CULS has been verified and a conceptual model was created.
