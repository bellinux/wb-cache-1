40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that fatigue <b>crack</b> growth is retarded after an overload, {{which has been}} explained either by plasticity-induced <b>crack</b> closure or near-tip residual stress.

40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with the testing of short <b>cracks</b> for the fracture characterization of a coarse grained alumina. In the literature, the clear R-curve behavior of the examined alumina has been confirmed, that is, the <b>crack</b> resistance increases with increasing <b>crack</b> length. To investigate the <b>crack</b> initiation and <b>crack</b> growth, the indentation method was used. With indentation <b>cracks</b> and complementary <b>crack</b> opening tests, it was possible to achieve a consistent fracture mechanics result. At room temperature a constant <b>crack</b> resistance of K_R#approx# 4 MPam" 1 "/" 2 was measured in air and K_R#approx# 5. 5 MPam" 1 "/" 2 in vacuum. At 1000 C in air a <b>crack</b> resistance of K_R#approx# 3. 3 MPam" 1 "/" 2 was determined. The results are in qualitative agreement with the reduction of <b>crack</b> resistance due to environmental effects (for example, humidity) and thermally activated <b>crack</b> growth. It was interesting that only constant <b>crack</b> resistance values for controlled, stable <b>crack</b> extension of the indentation <b>cracks</b> were measured for the alumina, in spite of the known R-curve behavior. This result clearly contradicts the published literature, both for the indentation <b>cracks</b> and for the long <b>cracks.</b> It must, however, be regarded as correct because of the accurate analysis of the internal stresses, which are responsible for the propagation of the identation <b>cracks.</b> An attempt was made to investigate the observed difference in <b>crack</b> resistance of indentation <b>cracks</b> and long <b>cracks</b> using <b>crack</b> opening tests. It was indeed found that the ratio of <b>crack</b> opening to <b>crack</b> length was significantly higher for indentation <b>cracks</b> than for long <b>cracks.</b> Obviously the toughening mechanisms that are the basis for R-curve behavior are almost saturated in the case of indentation <b>cracks.</b> In addition, <b>crack</b> propagation experiments with indentation <b>cracks</b> are required in order to confirm generally these considerations for ceramics that show R-curve behavior.

40|$|Abstract. Reflective <b>cracking</b> is a {{major concern}} for {{engineers}} facing the problem of road maintenance and rehabilitation. The problem appears due to the presence of <b>cracks</b> in the old pavement layers that propagate into the pavement overlay layer when traffic load passes over the <b>cracks</b> and due to the temperature variation. The stress concentration in the overlay just above the existing <b>cracks</b> is responsible for the appearance and <b>crack</b> propagation throughout the overlay. The analysis of the reflective <b>cracking</b> phenomenon is usually made by numerical modeling simulating the presence of <b>cracks</b> in the existing pavement and the stress concentration in the <b>crack</b> tip is assessed to predict either the <b>cracking</b> propagation rate or the expected fatigue life of the overlay. Numerical modeling to study reflective <b>cracking</b> is made by simulating one <b>crack</b> in the existing pavement and the loading is usually applied considering the shear mode of <b>crack</b> opening. Sometimes the simulation considers the mode I of <b>crack</b> opening, mainly when temperature effects are predominant. Thus, this paper presents a study where multiple <b>cracks</b> are modeled to assess the reflective <b>cracking</b> phenomenon and to compare to the case of only one <b>crack.</b> The modeling with only one <b>crack</b> was made simulating both mode I and mode II of <b>crack</b> opening taking into account the traffic effects. The influence of multiple <b>cracks</b> was expressed in terms of stress and strain in the zone above existing <b>cracks.</b> One of the conclusions from the current study is that the presence of multiple <b>cracks</b> can lead to a state of stress/strain higher than those obtained with only one <b>crack.</b> Also the position of the <b>crack</b> modeled in the finite elements analysis have a significant influence in the state of stress/strain obtained. However, the consideration of only one <b>crack</b> is sufficient to obtain significant results in the reflective <b>cracking</b> modeling...|$|R
