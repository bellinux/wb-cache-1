40|$|The {{responses}} to the English city riots of 2011 bear a remarkable resemblance to those of historical urban disorders {{in terms of the}} way in which they are framed by concerns over "moral decline", "social malaise" and a "lack of self-restraint" among certain sections of the population. In this paper we draw on the work of Norbert Elias and take a long-term perspective in exploring historical precedents and parallels relating to urban disorder and anti-social behaviour. We reject the notion of "Broken Britain" and argue that a more "detached" perspective is necessary in order to appreciate that perceived <b>crises</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> are ubiquitous to the urban condition. Through this historical analysis, framed by Elias' theory of involvement and detachment, we present three key arguments. Firstly, that a 'retreat into the present' is evident among both policy discourse and social science in responding to contemporary urban disorder, giving rise to ahistorical accounts and the romanticisation of previous eras; secondly, that particular moral panics have always arisen, specifically focused upon young and working class populations and urban disorder; and, thirdly, that previous techniques of governance to control these populations were often far more similar to contemporary mechanisms than many commentaries suggest. We conclude by advocating a long-term, detached perspective in discerning historical precedents and their direct linkages to the present; and in identifying what is particular about today's concerns and responses relating to urban disorder...|$|R

Use of this knowledge should help, among other non-elaborated scientific knowledge to stop the impact <b>of</b> the global <b>crisis</b> and to ensure sustainable development of human civilization. Uses of this knowledge allude to several facts. Primarily, use of knowledge of cybernetics is in practice frequently connected with natural and scientific problems and their solving. Use of knowledge of {{the general theory of}} systems, however not all, collides with notional problems. Nevertheless, this knowledge can be used in wider scope of activities. And in expertise, even if knowledge is oriented mainly on evaluation of “non-living objects” and intellectual property, the evaluations of working competence occur more and more...|$|R

40|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, both the Earth's human {{population}} and its economic output have grown faster than exponential, i. e., in a super-Malthusian mode, {{for most of}} the known history. These growth rates are compatible with a spontaneous singularity occuring at the same critical time 2052 +- 10 signaling an abrupt transition to a new regime. The degree of abruptness can be infered {{from the fact that the}} maximum of the world population growth rate was reached in 1970, i. e., about 80 years before the predicted singular time, corresponding to approximately 4 % of the studied time interval over which the acceleration is documented. This rounding-off of the finite-time singularity is probably due to a combination of well-known finite-size effects and friction and suggests that we have already entered the transition region to a new regime. In theoretical support, a multivariate analysis coupling population, capital, R&D and technology shows that a dramatic acceleration in the population during most of the timespan can occur even though the isolated dynamics do not exhibit it. Possible scenarios for the cross-over and the new regime are discussed. Nottale, Chaline and Grou have recently independently applied a log-periodic analysis to the main <b>crises</b> <b>of</b> different <b>civilisations.</b> It is striking that these two independent analyses based on a different data set gives a critical time which is compatible within the error bars.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between post Darwinian scientific thought and selected literary texts by Hardy, Gissing and H. G.

It involves the examination of primary material in the field of biology, anthropology and medicine, as well as philosophical and social writing of the period and other related literary texts. Chapter One examines the major areas in emerges into biological, medical and cultural reflecting movements within scientific debate social, economic and philosophical concerns. this discussion is extended after 1900 and is light of Wells's own development. which degeneration discussion, itself and broader In chapter Four interpreted in the In the discussion of its biological and pathological emergence, the growth of hereditary determinism is particularly emphasised as crucial to the variety of applications of the concept. Degeneration reflects the prestige of Darwinian evolution, with its unresolved account of inheritance, a growing sense of economic decline, and a tension between the authority of evolutionary science and changing philosophical and ethical concerns. The three literary chapters deal with the impact of degeneration on the writers and illuminate aspects of their major work. While all the texts reflect the impact of degeneration, Gissing is revealed to be more dependent on scientific determinism, as in Demos or The Whirlpool, than is Hardy, who in Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure, exposes the myth of that determinism while appearing to collude with it. Wells's journalism reflects the extent of his scientific endorsement of degeneration-producing in The Time Machine the one fiction about, and constructed around, it. The powerful conjunction of scientific ideas and imaginative writing, 1880 - 1910, can be traced to a perception of social, cultural and ethical <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>civilisation</b> for which both novelist and scientist aspire to speak...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> served Western {{states to}} hierarchically organise international politics and reproduce Western pre-eminence. Russia, {{depending on the}} historical period, has been interpreted as either an ardent follower or a major challenger to Western projects, {{but it has been}} markedly absent from debates regarding the standard. This article proposes to engage Russia in the standard <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> discussion with reference to the standard?s two most considered expositions: the colonial-era ?original? and what the literature interprets as the standard?s contemporary revival. In order to do so, I trace Russia?s nineteenth-century colonial practices and analyse Russia?s selected policies towards post-Soviet states in the post?Cold War period. On the basis of these explorations, I argue that Russia?s application of the standard <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> goes beyond the mere reproduction of hierarchical arrangements between an imagined centre and peripheries. The practices of the standard <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> have been employed to improve Russia?s desired, and imagined, status in international politics ? that of a great power equal to the West. From that it follows that the concept of the standard <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> should be recognised as ordering relations not only of the strong and the weak but also of those in position of power in international politics. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Gianluigi Goggi : Diderot and {{the concept}} <b>of</b> <b>civilisation.</b> In 1772, Diderot wrote a short piece on the <b>civilisation</b> <b>of</b> Russia, whose starting-point was his {{opposition}} to Voltaire's ideas concerning the transplantation of arts and sciences to Peter I's Russia. Diderot discusses the <b>civilisation</b> <b>of</b> Russia {{in the light of}} two other issues emphasized at the time : the <b>civilisation</b> or sédentarisation <b>of</b> savages; and the development <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> in Europe during the Middle Ages. We can see that Diderot's piece combines two conceptions : on the one hand, the idea of a political project leading Russia from barbarism to civilisation through clearly defined stages (beginning with the installation of colonies of foreigners and aiming at transforming Russian society from below); and on the other, a conception <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> as a slow social evolution, based on a very different idea of the pace <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> from that implied by the political project. As he moves from one to the other, Diderot finally takes up certain of Voltaire's suggestions, which he had rejected at the beginning (for example, concerning the role of circumstances in the civilising process).
