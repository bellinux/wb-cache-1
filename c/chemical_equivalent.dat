60|$|It {{is strange}} that this metal {{is almost always}} found {{associated}} with some four or five other metals, most curious in their qualities and characteristics. They are called platiniferous metals; {{and they have not}} only the relation of being always found associated in this manner, but they have other relations of a curious nature, which I shall point out to you by a reference to one of the tables behind me. This substance is always native--it is always in the metallic state; and the metals with which it is found connected, and which are rarely found elsewhere, are palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium. We have the names in one of the tables arranged in two columns, representing, as you see, two groups--platinum, iridium, and osmium constituting one group; and ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium the other. Three of these have the <b>chemical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 98-1/2, and the others a <b>chemical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of about half that number. Then the metals of one group have an extreme specific gravity--platinum being, in fact, the lightest of the three, or as light as the lightest. Osmium has a specific gravity of 21.4, and is the heaviest body in nature; platinum is 21.15, and iridium the same; the specific gravity of the other three being only about half that, namely, 11.3, 12.1, and 11.8. Then there is this curious relation, that palladium and iridium are very much alike, so that you would scarcely know one from the other, though one has only half the weight of the other, and only half the equivalent power. So with iridium and rhodium, and osmium and ruthenium, which are so closely allied that they make pairs, being separated each from its own group. Then these metals are the most infusible that we possess. Osmium is the most difficult to fuse: indeed, I believe it never has been fused, while every other metal has. Ruthenium comes next, iridium next, rhodium next, platinum next (so that it ranks here as a pretty fusible metal, and yet we have been long accustomed to speak of the infusibility of platinum), and next comes palladium, which is the most fusible metal of the whole. It is a curious thing to see this fine association of physical properties coming out in metals which are grouped together somehow or other in nature, but, no doubt, by causes which are related to analogous properties in their situation {{on the surface of the}} earth, for it is in alluvial soils that these things are found.|$|E

The negative electrode weighed at first 20 grains; after the experiment, it, with its button of alloy, weighed 23.2 grains. The tin evolved by the electric current at the cathode: weighed therefore 3.2 grains. The quantity of oxygen and hydrogen collected in the volta-electrometer = 3.85 cubic inches. As 100 cubic inches of oxygen and hydrogen, in the proportions to form water, may be considered as weighing 12.92 grains, the 3.85 cubic inches would weigh 0.49742 of a grain; that being, therefore, the weight of water decomposed by the same electric current as was able to decompose such weight of protochloride of tin as could yield 3.2 grains of metal. Now 0.49742 : 3.2 :: 9 the equivalent of water is to 57.9, which should therefore {{be the equivalent of}} tin, if the experiment had been made without error, and if the electro-chemical decomposition is in this case also definite. In some chemical works 58 is given as the <b>chemical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of tin, in others 57.9. Both are so near to the result of the experiment, and the experiment itself is so subject to slight causes of variation (as from the absorption of gas in the volta-electrometer (716.), &c.), that the numbers leave little doubt of the applicability of the law of definite action in this and all similar cases of electro-decomposition.|$|E

For if {{a body of}} known {{chemical}} composition {{is found to be}} decomposable, {{and the nature of the}} substance evolved as a primary or even a secondary result (743. 777.) at one of the electrodes, be ascertained, the electro-chemical equivalent of that body may be deduced from the known constant composition of the substance evolved. Thus, when fused protiodide of tin is decomposed by the voltaic current (804.), the conclusion may be drawn, that both the iodine and tin are ions, and that the proportions in which they combine in the fused compound express their electro-chemical equivalents. Again, with respect to the fused iodide of potassium (805.), it is an electrolyte; and the <b>chemical</b> <b>equivalents</b> will also be the electro-chemical equivalents.|$|R
50|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of atoms was the law of definite proportions proposed by him in 1792. Richter found that the ratio by weight of the compounds consumed in a chemical reaction was always the same.

From his data, Ernst Gottfried Fischer calculated in 1802 the first table of <b>chemical</b> <b>equivalents,</b> taking sulphuric acid as the standard with the figure 1000. When Joseph Proust reported his work on the constant composition of chemical compounds, the time was ripe for the reinvention of an atomic theory. The law of definite proportions and constant composition do not prove that atoms exist, but they are difficult to explain without assuming that chemical compounds are formed when atoms combine in constant proportions.|$|R

This 'oxy-clay' substitution involves only proton and electron migration through the crystal structure, and therefore occurs nondestructively and reversibly, at relatively low temperatures. The reversible, low-temperature nature of this reaction contrasts with the irreversible nature of destructive dehydroxylation (H 2 O loss) suffered by clays heated to high temperatures.

During embryogenesis and cartilage mat-uration, mechanical stimuli promote chondrogenesis and limb formation. Mechanical loading, which has been characterized using computer modeling and in vivo studies, is crucial for maintaining the phenotype of cartilage. However, excessive or insufficient loading has deleterious effects and promotes the onset of cartilage degeneration. Informed by the prominent role of biomechanics, mechanical stimuli have been har-nessed to enhance redifferentiation of chondrocytes and chondroinduction of other cell types, thus provid-ing new chondrocyte cell sources. Biomechanical stim-uli, such as hydrostatic pressure or compression, have been used to enhance the functional properties of neocartilage.

Objective: To evaluate the physicochemical and equivalency of three brands of quinine sulphate tablets available in South Western region of Nigeria. Methods: The pharmaceutical and chemical equivalence of three brands of quinine sulphate tablets were assessed through the evaluation of some biopharmaceutical parameters and active drug content. Results: All the brands complied with the official specification for uniformity of weight. Two of the brands (A & B) gave similar crushing strengths while the third brand (C) gave a much lower value. Similarly all the brands complied with the official specification of disintegration test but the obtained values were statistically different (p< 0. 05). The T 70 obtained from the dissolution rate profile was less than 45 minutes for the three brands, although A and B were not statistically different but C was statistically from A and B. The quinine content of brands B and C are within the official specification however brand A with percentage content of 110 ± 1. 3 %w/w, is above the specification while it is statistically different from the other brands. Conclusion: Brands B and C could be regarded as <b>chemical</b> <b>equivalent,</b> but they are not biopharmaceutical equivalents, on the other hand, brands A and B may be regarded as biopharmaceutical equivalents but not <b>chemical</b> <b>equivalent...</b>|$|E

When chloride of lead was decomposed, platina being used for both electrodes (395.), there could remain no more doubt that chlorine was passing to the anode, although it combined with the platina there, than when the positive electrode, being of plumbago (794.), allowed its evolution in the free state; neither could there, in either case, remain any doubt that for every 103.5 parts of lead evolved at the cathode, 36 parts of chlorine were evolved at the anode, for the remaining chloride of lead was unchanged. So also, when in a metallic solution one volume of oxygen, or a secondary compound containing that proportion, appeared at the anode, no doubt could arise that hydrogen, equivalent to two volumes, had been determined to the cathode, although, by a secondary action, it had been employed in reducing oxides of lead, copper, or other metals, to the metallic state.
