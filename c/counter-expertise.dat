The call was named Finance Watch. He was joined by about one hundred European, national and regional elected representatives within the European Union. A year later, in June 2011, Finance Watch was set up as a NGO.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Familial {{hypercholesterolemia}} (FH) is {{an inherited}} disorder {{associated with a}} severely increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although DNA test results in FH are associated with important medical and ethical consequences, data on accuracy of genetic tests is scarce. Methods. Therefore, we performed a prospective study to assess the overall accuracy of the DNA test used in the genetic cascade screening program for FH in The Netherlands. Individuals aged 18 years and older tested {{for one of the}} 5 most prevalent FH mutations, were included consecutively. DNA samples were analyzed by the reference and a <b>counter-expertise</b> laboratory following a standardized procedure. Results. 1003 cases were included. In the end, 317 (32 %) carried an FH mutation, whereas in 686 (69 %) samples no mutation was found. The overall accuracy of the reference laboratory was 99. 8 %, with two false positive results identified by the <b>counter-expertise</b> laboratory. Conclusion. The currently used mutation analysis is associated with a very low error rate. Therefore, we do not recommend routine use of duplicate testing...|$|E

The article examines the post-accidental management of the authorities, with a special focus on their risk communication, and explores what went wrong in the process. It deals with the issues of risk assessment, expertise, <b>counter-expertise,</b> policy-makings, stakeholder participation, and trust in crisis and disaster situations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the two techniques: arithmetic means and expertons, used for aggregation of experts’ judgments relative to basic events of fault trees. Valuations as confidence intervals included in [0, 1] have been considered. First, bounds are numbers to one decimal; next, numbers belonging to [0, 1]. In this last case, R+_expertons concept is used, with a <b>counter-expertise</b> form proposed. The means technique is well known in practice, but as fault tree is a logical diagram built by "AND" and "OR" gates, i. e. nonlinear operators, its use leads to wrong results and expertons technique should be used...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIf one is {{to assume}} a {{changing}} role for rationalization in contemporary collectives, how may we consider the relationship between expertise and professionalism? It can be affected by three challenges: maintaining the classical domination of experts; {{trying to cope with}} <b>counter-expertise</b> and conflict; organizing participative expertise. The outputs of these situations are influenced by an identical factor: the paradoxical importance of misunderstanding, which relies on the weak implementation of the strong equipment, patiently elaborated. The first case is examined with a limited approach of this general perspective: experts in medicine and dentistry who try to rationalize their colleagues' practices via guidelines, may be considered as specimen of the classical exercise; members of a symphonic orchestra who cooperate with pupils in specific projects with the help of professors and animators, may portray the aim for participative situations. These situations appear to be open to mutual evolutions...|$|E
40|$|Expert witness {{testimony}} {{provides an}} important source of information for international criminal proceedings, and forensic science expertise from mass graves is no exception: findings from exhumations and examinations have featured in the ad hoc tribunals’ trials and judgments. Whilst the issues surrounding the law-science relationship have been explored within the realm of national legal systems, the mixed system adopted by these tribunals presents an established discussion with a new context. Using forensic archaeology as an example, this article explores some theoretical underpinnings and practical realities surrounding the use of forensic science during international criminal investigations into mass graves before looking at how Trial Chambers aim to establish the relevance and credibility of forensic science evidence. As little guidance regarding admissibility of expert evidence is provided, it is through the case-specific legal process of cross-examination and presentation of <b>counter-expertise</b> that methodological issues are resolved. This, together with reliance on normative principles, is the pragmatic approach adopted to discern reliability of expert opinion...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of non-financial interest groups in EU financial regulatory decision-making. While regulatory capture theories clearly helped identify the causes for the incrementality {{in spite of the}} major shock the 2008 crisis had caused, this article will consider a range of regulatory policy initiatives that do not neatly conform with this theory. I examine the extent to which non-financial groups are able to have their preferences met in the making of three different consumer policies: the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD), stricter regulations of retail investment products (PRIPs/KID) and the reform of EU level supervisory structures. By employing a process-tracing approach based on qualitative interviews to analyze political responses to the 2008 financial crisis, the article demonstrates that newly mobilized groups could translate key advocacy goals into policy by deploying <b>counter-expertise</b> and co-operating with policy-makers in some cases but not in others.

40|$|Extreme river discharges, {{floods and}} debates {{about climate change}} {{triggered}} a shift in flood protection policy in the Netherlands from infrastructural to spatial measures. The new policy directive of `Room for the River¿, details of which were introduced in 2000, should prepare the country for future peak discharges. In {{order to deal with}} `residual risk¿, the concept of `calamity polders¿ for `controlled flooding¿ was launched in the same year. In this contribution we discuss the local protests against these plans against the backdrop of changed thinking about flood protection. We analyse the emergence of the concept, the commission established to inquire into the calamity polder plans, as well as local resistance and the <b>counter-expertise</b> it mobilised. We conclude that the choice to limit public participation in the debates about calamity polders has backfired. It has contributed to the shelving of the plans while increasing public distrust of flood policy. At the same time this episode has created some awareness among policy-makers of the importance of dialogue with the inhabitants of areas affected by flood policy measures...|$|E
40|$|Fleshing out ’ expertise: {{the making}} of {{creative}} industries experts in the United Kingdom The place of expertise in modern systems of government continues to be of concern to critical social scientists. Recent years have seen something of a shift away from conceptions of expertise that tended {{to see it as}} distant, overly technical and aligned with the needs of the state and capital. Expertise is increasingly recognised as having a more complex relation with the subjects of government than just as a means for shoring up authority, offering them a space for engagement, critique and <b>counter-expertise.</b> This paper argues that focusing on particular experts and their changing roles in governmental assemblages can flesh out one-dimensional conceptions of expertise and provide insights into governmental change. Drawing on a variety of literature, it is argued that expertise can usefully be conceived as; first, a social relation based on one party having access to knowledge which gives them authority over another; second, as distributed across a governmental assemblage in a particular way, with some expert relations being positioned to have more influence, understood here as expert power, across the assemblage; and third, as...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing number}} of today’s {{conflicts}} are “local”, {{in the sense of}} having as their premise and target a given place, in its peculiar features, boundaries and connections with the “outside”. Yet are we in front of something really new, or do these conflicts belong to a long-established lineage of social mobilizations? The article begins with comparing new protests with those emerging in the 1970 s, finding significant similarities (as regards for example the weak organizational structure, the single issue orientation, the diffidence for institutional politics and the value assigned to the concrete, lived experience) but also significant differences, both quantitative (for example in respect to the relevance of <b>counter-expertise</b> and of individual autonomy against delegation) and qualitative (for example about the declining relevance of the left/right cleavage and the reemergence of the centre/periphery and urban/rural ones, or about the ethicization of individual engagement). It is argued that, to properly understand new local mobilizations, one has to consider the change in the forms of government corresponding to the advent of “governance” and, behind it, of the neoliberal governmental rationality (or “governmentality”); this with special reference to the impacts of new processes of accumulation on territories and local governments, and to the surfacing of lines of fracture not amenable to the traditional cleavages but rather to the risks and opportunities of globalization. The role of environmental justice, science and ethics in new movements is discussed, showing that the stakes involved are ultimately set by the relationship between assimilation to the individual and collective anthropology implied in the neoliberalization of society and innovative impulses embedded in the practices and the production of sociality that animate social mobilizations...|$|E
40|$|Het RIVM controleert achtmaal per jaar de metingen van de verrijkingsfabriek Urenco te Almelo. Het gaat hierbij om lozingen van radioactiviteit {{in water}} en lucht. De contra-expertise onderbouwt de betrouwbaarheid van de {{analyses}} die Urenco uitvoert. Doorgaans komen de analyses overeen, zo ook in 2006. Uit de metingen blijkt dat er in het afvalwater doorgaans een zeer lage totaal-alfa en totaal-beta activiteit aanwezig is. De radioactiviteit in ventilatielucht ligt zeer dicht bij het niveau van de hoeveelheid radon die van nature in buitenlucht aanwezig is. Het RIVM heeft in acht afvalwatermonsters en acht monsters van ventilatielucht, die verspreid over het jaar 2006 zijn afgenomen, de totaal-alfa en totaal-beta activiteit bepaald. Deze bepaling is een snelle manier om de mate waarin uraan naar het milieu geloosd wordt, aan te tonen. Opdrachtgever is de Kernfysische Dienst van het ministerie van VROM. Within {{the framework of}} a monitoring programme, the RIVM measures the release of radioactivity into the waste water and atmosphere of the Urenco uraan enrichment plant in Almelo. Measurements are carried out eight times per year. This form of <b>counter-expertise</b> is aimed at verifying and supporting the reliability of the analyses carried out by the Urenco plant. The two different sets of measurements are generally in agreement, as was also the case in 2006. As a rule, the waste water contains very low levels of gross alpha and gross beta activity. Radioactivity levels in the ventilation air are very close to those levels expected due to the natural presence of radon in the outside atmosphere. The RIVM determined the gross alpha and gross beta activity in eight waste water samples and eight samples of ventilation air. The samples were taken at time points dispersed throughout 2006. This procedure provides the RIVM with a rapid method for determining the extent of uraan release into the environment.
