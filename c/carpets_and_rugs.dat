5|$|Koniecpolski {{inherited}} some {{seven or}} eight villages from his father. At his death, he owned 12 starostwo districts, with over 300 settlements, including dozens of towns, giving him yearly revenues of over 500,000 złoty. His holdings of land and serfs in western Ukraine were considerable; he owned 18,548 households in Bratslav. Koniecpolski invested much of his wealth in developing his Ukrainian estates, and supported settlement of underpopulated regions. He founded and sponsored the development of many towns and cities, including the town of Brody, which flourished with his investments, and became an important local commercial center. Koniecpolski fortified the town with a citadel and bastions in 1633 and set up workshops for producing Persian-type samite fabrics, <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs.</b> He also constructed a fortified palace in Pidhirtsi (Podhorce) with beautiful Italian gardens. Like most magnates, Koniecpolski was a patron of the arts, sponsoring painters, sculptors, writers. He also founded many churches and sought to upgrade Brody's school to an academy. He sponsored {{the construction of the}} Koniecpolski Palace (now the Presidential Palace) in Warsaw, and military fortifications in Bar and Kudak.|$|E
25|$|The art {{and craft}} of carpet weaving has gone through periods of decline during times of {{political}} unrest, or {{under the influence of}} commercial demands. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a major part in the economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with natural dyes, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs</b> were regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige from the first time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers, until today.|$|E

25|$|Persian <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs</b> {{of various}} types were woven in {{parallel}} by nomadic tribes, in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent different, simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the history of Iran and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections {{all over the world}} today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.|$|E
25|$|Carpets {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a prayer rug), reducing sound from walking (particularly in apartment buildings) and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. In the 2000s, carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and hotels and in private homes. In the 2010s, a huge range of <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs</b> are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are mass-produced in factories and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs which are used in private homes of wealthy families.|$|E
500|$|Marrakesh has {{the largest}} {{traditional}} Berber market in Morocco {{and the image of}} the city is closely associated with its souks. Paul Sullivan cites the souks as the principal shopping attraction in the city: [...] "A honeycomb of intricately connected alleyways, this fundamental section of the old city is a micro-medina in itself, comprising a dizzying number of stalls and shops that range from itsy kiosks no bigger than an elf's wardrobe to scruffy store-fronts that morph into glittering Aladdin's Caves once you're inside." [...] Historically the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist but with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs,</b> traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns. Haggling is still {{a very important part of}} trade in the souks.|$|E

2500|$|After 1940, Romania ousted Carol II's National Renaissance Front government, {{replacing}} it with an openly fascist, pro-Axis regime, the National Legionary State. In parallel, Tzigara managed to gather political support for terminating Nicolae Ghica-Budești's contract and, in 1941, hired architect Gheorghe Ionescu to finalize the Museum's construction. Late in the same year, {{he was one of}} the Romanian scholars who welcomed German Romance studies expert Ernst Gamillscheg on his visit to Bucharest. In 1942, he was tasked by Romania's military dictator Ion Antonescu with creating a monumental National Heroes' Cemetery in Carol Park, but the building works were cut short by the reversal of fortunes on the Eastern Front. Also then, he returned to research with a book about the <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs</b> of Oltenia, which notably stated his ethnic nationalist credo in art: [...] "By using the everlasting heritage of our beautiful folk art in different fields, we will be easily able to get rid of the foreign influences that pervaded Romanian households." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turkish carpets (also {{known as}} Anatolian), whether hand knotted or flat woven, {{are among the}} most well known and {{established}} hand crafted art works in the world. [...] Historically: religious, cultural, environmental, sociopolitical and socioeconomic conditions created widespread utilitarian need and have provided artistic inspiration among the many tribal peoples and ethnic groups in Central Asia and Turkey. [...] Turks; nomadic or pastoral, agrarian or town dwellers, living in tents or in sumptuous houses in large cities, have protected themselves from the extremes of the cold weather by covering the floors, and sometimes walls and doorways, with <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs.</b> The carpets are always hand made of wool or sometimes cotton, with occasional additions of silk. These carpets are natural barriers against the cold. Turkish pile rugs and kilims are also frequently used as tent decorations, grain bags, camel and donkey bags, ground cushions, oven covers, sofa covers, bed and cushion covers, blankets, curtains, eating blankets, table top spreads, prayer rugs and for ceremonial occasions.|$|E

The tails promoted {{the cultures of}} the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name {{to the rear of}} the fuselage corresponding to the province. The [...] "Frontier" [...] tail represented the [...] "Phulkari" [...] (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts and linen. The [...] "Punjab" [...] tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore. The [...] "Balochistan" [...] tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs</b> woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The [...] "Sindh" [...] tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009 management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.|$|E

60|$|He went {{straight}} to Roderick's apartment, deeming this, at an early hour, the safest place to seek him. He found him in his sitting-room, which had been closely darkened {{to keep out the}} heat. The <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs</b> had been removed, the floor of speckled concrete was bare and lightly sprinkled with water. Here and there, over it, certain strongly perfumed flowers had been scattered. Roderick was lying on his divan in a white dressing-gown, staring up at the frescoed ceiling. The room was deliciously cool, and filled with the moist, sweet odor of the circumjacent roses and violets. All this seemed highly fantastic, and yet Rowland hardly felt surprised.|$|E
60|$|Red or blue curtains, strangely embroidered, {{hung over}} the doors, and trophies of swords, shields, and spears, not of steel, but of some darker metal, were fixed on the tall pillars that helped to prop the roof.

The <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs</b> were precisely like those of India and Persia, and I supposed that they must have been obtained through commerce. But I afterwards learned that they were, beyond doubt, of native manufacture.|$|E

60|$|On {{entering}} the room the clerk looked round; but, seeing no one, {{he continued to}} stand, his cap in his hand, examining with the greatest interest a chamber which was so different to any {{to which he was}} accustomed. The days had gone by when a nobleman's hall was but a barn-like, rush-strewn enclosure, the common lounge and eating-room of every inmate of the castle. The Crusaders had brought back with them experiences of domestic luxuries, of Damascus <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs</b> of Aleppo, which made them impatient of the hideous bareness and want of privacy which they found in their ancestral strongholds. Still stronger, however, had been the influence of the great French war; for, however well matched the nations might be in martial exercises, there could be no question but that our neighbors were infinitely superior to us in the arts of peace. A stream of returning knights, of wounded soldiers, and of unransomed French noblemen, had been for {{a quarter of a century}} continually pouring into England, every one of whom exerted an influence in the direction of greater domestic refinement, while shiploads of French furniture from Calais, Rouen, and other plundered towns, had supplied our own artisans with models on which to shape their work. Hence, in most English castles, and in Castle Twynham among the rest, chambers were to be found which would seem to be not wanting either in beauty or in comfort.|$|E
5000|$|Yet {{another group}} of Milas <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs,</b> this time {{distinguished}} {{on the basis of}} their initial conception, are the ones referred to as [...] "medalled".

They are woven on a bed of white and red, regardless of the proportion these colors may occupy at the final stage of the finished product. Prayer rug types are usually woven in a tighter manner, and Karacahisar <b>carpets</b> <b>and</b> <b>rugs</b> looser.|$|E
