40|$|Credit {{expansion}} {{has been}} associated with faster economic growth and with a higher occurrence of financial crises – a pair of results which seem to contradict each other. This paper advances an explanation for these results by separating <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> the private sector into <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> firms and <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> households. The empirical analysis shows that <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> firms is responsible for the positive growth effect, while the higher occurrence of crises is mainly due <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> households. The events of the last decade, where fast <b>credit</b> expansion led <b>to</b> crises and very little growth, can be understood as a shift in the composition of credit towards its household component...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the dominant}} factors influencing bank <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> {{private sector in}} Nigeria over the period 1980 - 2010 using the error correction modeling technique. The results show that broad money, cyclical risk premium and liquidity ratio tend <b>to</b> increase <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> the private sector. However, prime lending rate and reserve ratio lead {{to a reduction in}} <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> the private sector. Private credit increases with inflation, but not one to one, meaning that inflation tends to dampen real bank <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> the private sector...|$|R
