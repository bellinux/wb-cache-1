60|$|Now for Genobaldus, Marcomer and Suno, {{they were}} captains of the Transrhenane Franks in {{the reign of}} Theodosius, and concern us not. We are to begin with Theudomir the first King of the rebelling Salii, called Didio by Ivo Carnotensis, and Thiedo and Theudemerus by Rhenanus. His face is extant in a coin of gold found with this inscription, THEUDEMIR REX, {{published}} by Petavius, and still or lately extant, as Windeline testifies: which shews {{that he was a}} King, and that in Gallia; seeing that rude Germany understood not then the coining of money, nor used either Latin words or letters. He was the son of Ricimer, or Richomer, the favourite of the Emperor Theodosius; and so being a Roman Frank, and of the Salian royal blood, they therefore upon the rebellion made him King. The whole time of his reign you have stated in Excerptis Gregorii Turonensis è Fredigario, cap. 5, 6, 7, 8. where the making him King, the tyranny of Jovinus, the slaughter of the associates of Jovinus, the second taking of Triers by the Franks, and their war with Castinus, in which this King was slain, are as a series of successive things thus set down in order. Extinctis Ducibus in Francis, denuo Reges creantur ex eadem stirpe qua prius fuerant. Eodem tempore Jovinus ornatus regios assumpsit. Constantinus fugam versus Italiam dirigit; missis a Jovino Principe percussoribus super Mentio flumine, capite truncatur. Multi nobilium jussu Jovini apud Avernis <b>capti,</b> & a ducibus Honorii crudeliter interempti sunt. Trevirorum civitas, factione unius ex senatoribus nomine Lucii, à Francis captà & incensa est.--Castinus Domesticorum Comes expeditionem accipit contra Francos, &c. Then returning to speak of Theudomir, he adds: Franci electum à se regem, sicut prius fuerat, crinitum inquirentes diligenter ex genere Priami, Frigi & Francionis, super se crearunt nomine Theudemerum filium Richemeris, qui in hoc prælio quod supra memini, à Romanis interfectus est; that is, in the battle with Castinus's army. Of his death Gregory Turonensis makes this further mention: In consularibus legimus Theodemerem regem Francorum filium Ricimeris quondam, & Ascilam matrem ejus, gladio interfectos.|$|E
5000|$|German medieval {{rock band}} Schelmish {{performed}} [...] "Gaudete" [...] on their 2006 album Mente <b>Capti.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mente <b>Capti</b> is {{the sixth}} studio album, which was {{released}} in July 2006. For {{the first time since}} Codex Lascivus the band has eight members because guitarist Marquis de Guis and den bassist Naj O, der Reine, (later replaced by Johannes, der Säufer) filled the ranks. While the band's previous albums were almost exclusively recorded with medieval instruments Mente <b>Capti</b> focused on a rock instrumentation, i.e. electric guitars and bass and a modern drum set. This way Schlemish re-interpreted old songs but also wrote new pieces that deal with love, melancholy and joy. The vocals were mainly Rimsbold's task while Dextro and Fragor concentrated on string instruments. Luzi and Des Demonia focused on wind instruments and Sakepharus on percussion.|$|E
50|$|The three perfect tenses (Perfect, Future Perfect, and Pluperfect) {{are formed}} using the perfect participle {{together}} {{with part of}} the verb sum 'I am'. The ending of the participle changes according to the gender and number of the subject: captus est 'he was captured'; capta est 'she was captured'; <b>captī</b> sunt 'they were captured', and so on.|$|E
50|$|Two {{months later}} their first DVD Coetus was released. Among {{excerpts}} from the show at the Kulturfabrik Krefeld it contains material of several other shows (e.g. together with Das letzte Einhorn and Flex der Biegsame of In Extremo), two videos as {{a preview of the}} following album Mente <b>Capti</b> as well as numerous interviews, CD previews, photos, easter eggs and also a film about Schelmish. Moreover the DVD was seen as a farewell project for Amsel von Nydeggen. She can be seen in older show recordings and in the film. Also Die Rote Füchsin of Filia Irata is featured on this DVD.|$|E
5000|$|In 1039, he {{travelled}} to Miroalto {{to aid the}} Emperor Henry III {{against the}} rebellious Odo of Blois. While he was returning, he destroyed the grain fields {{of the region and}} the enraged populace retaliated and stole some of his retainers' horses. It was during his blood reprisal that Boniface made his most famous recorded statement. Preparing to hack off the ears and nose of a young man, Boniface was confronted by the youth's mother, who begged him be spared and promised him her son's weigh in silver. Boniface replied to his offer that he [...] "was no merchant, but a soldier," [...] adding: [...] "Absit ut hostes ferro <b>capti</b> redimantur argento". (Far be it that what was captured by steel should be redeemed with silver.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Provehimur pelago Calalus terra incognita. Populum late regem Toltezus Silvanus. Traducti sunt Theodorus suas copias subucie [...] urbe Rhoda et plus septigentia <b>capti.</b> nullus auro urbe eximentur.We {{were driven}} by the sea Calalus unknown land. Sylvan Toltezus people ruling far and wide. Theodore they were led his troops under? Rhoda and more than seven hundred were captured.

[...] —A literal {{translation}} of part of the Latin, illustrating the grammatical and inflectional failings of the inscription. The first object removed from the caliche by Manier was a crudely cast metal cross that weighed 62 lb; after cleaning it was revealed to be two separate crosses riveted together. After his find, Manier took the cross to Professor Frank H. Fowler, Head of the Department of Classical Languages at the University of Arizona, at Tucson, who determined the language on the artifacts was Latin. He also translated one line as reading, [...] "Calalus, the unknown land", from which {{the name of the}} supposed Latin colony was garnered.|$|E
50|$|This {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} references to a proverb now found throughout Europe, 'Catch the bear before you sell his skin'. The heart of the story that the Emperor tells is Aesop's fable, but it has now been adapted to end with the lesson not to count one's eggs before they are hatched. A variation on the story appears in the Neo-Latin author Laurentius Abstemius' collection of a hundred fables (Hecatomythium) written some time in the 1490s. This was titled De Cortario emente pellem Ursi a Venatore nondum <b>capti</b> (How a tanner bought a bear's skin from hunters before it was taken). But it was La Fontaine's Fables that assured the continued popularity of this variation of the tale (V.20.) His version, L'ours et les deux compagnons, is much {{the same as that of}} Philippe de Commynes apart from the detail that only two men are involved, one of whom escapes up a tree (as in Aesop). Aesop, however, had reserved the moral of not anticipating success in an enterprise before it is accomplished for his fable of The Milkmaid and Her Pail.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{frontier}} garrisons {{in the north}} west suddenly evacuated, the Christian king Alfonso I of Asturias could hardly believe his luck, and set about dispatching Asturian troops to seize the empty forts. With remarkable swiftness and ease the northwestern was captured, and {{the banks of the}} upper Ebro were raided by Alfonso and permanently lost to al-Andalus. The Asturians devastated several towns and villages {{on the banks of the}} Douro River, and carried off local populations from the towns and villages in the Galician-Leonese lowlands back to the mountains, creating an empty buffer zone in the Douro River valley (the Desert of the Duero) between the Asturias in the north and al-Andalus in the south. This newly emptied frontier would remain in place for the next few centuries. It is alleged that pastoral Berber mountaineers remained behind in the highlands around Astorga and León. These trapped Berber communities were called [...] "Maragatos" [...] by the local Christian Leonese (etymology uncertain, possibly from mauri <b>capti,</b> [...] "captive Moors"). Although eventually converted to Christianity, the Maragatos retained their distinctive dress, customs and lifestyle of Berber origin down to the early modern era.|$|E
40|$|Ethylene-responsive factors (ERF) {{are usually}} {{considered}} to play diverse roles in plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, an ERF gene <b>CaPTI</b> 1 was isolated from pepper transcriptome database. <b>CaPTI</b> 1 contains an {{open reading frame}} (ORF) of 543 bp, which encodes a putative polypeptide of 180 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 20. 30 kDa. Results of expression profile showed that <b>CaPTI</b> 1 had a highest expression level in roots and this gene could not only response to the infection of Phytophthora capsici and the stresses of cold and drought, but also be induced by the signaling molecule (salicylic acid (SA), Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA), Ethephon (ETH) and hydogen peroxide (H 2 O 2)). Furthermore, virus-induce gene silencing (VIGS) of <b>CaPTI</b> 1 in pepper weakened the defense response significantly by reducing the expression of defense related genes CaPR 1, CaDEF 1 and CaSAR 82 and also the root activity. These results suggested that <b>CaPTI</b> 1 {{is involved in the}} regulation of defense response to P. capsici in pepper...|$|E
40|$|Considering as a {{point of}} {{reference}} the exhibition on the Environmental Art The Space of Image, held in 1967, the article explores the Art photo-documentation published on the Italian Art Periodicals during the Sixties. Thanks to the database www. <b>capti.</b> it, this study proposes a new reading of the photo of Environment and Installation, also based on a statistical approach. The origin of this photographic genre shows some unexpected relations with other photographic practices: the reportage, the photo of architecture and the Art galleries advertising. The documentation status of Photography is thus contaminated with different editing practices...|$|E
