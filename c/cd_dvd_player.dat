The color code cП(v) of a vertex v ∈ H is the ordered k-tuple (<b>d(v,</b> <b>C</b> 1), <b>d(v,</b> <b>C</b> 2), · · ·, d(v, Ck)), where d(v, Ci) = min{d(v, x) |x ∈ Ci} for all i ∈ [1,k]. If all vertices of H have distinct color codes, then c is called a locating k-coloring of H. The locating-chromatic number of H, denoted by χL’ (H), is the smallest k such that H admits a locating- coloring with k colors. If there is no integer k satisfying the above conditions, then we say that χ’L (H) = ∞. Note that if H is a connected graph, then χL’ (H) = χL(H). In this paper, we provide upper bounds for the locating-chromatic numbers of connectedgraphs obtained from disconnected graphs where each component contains a single dominant vertex...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{investments}} of firms in hightech industries. Typical examples are producers of consumer electronic {{products such as}} <b>dvd</b> <b>players,</b> LCD television sets, digital photo cameras, and mobile phones. There are two important characteristics in these markets. The first is (sharply) decreasing sales prices {{and the second is}} decreasing production costs. The introduction of new technologies shortens the life cycle of products. Furthermore, innovations in the production process reduce production costs and prices. The latter effect is strengthened by competition. First we develop a standard real options investment model in which the sales price and the unit production costs per unit both follow geometric Brownian motions. However, using real life data from the LCD industry, we show that the sales price can not be described by a geometric Brownian motion. Consequently, a new real options model in discrete time is developed that fits to the real life data. Finally, the two resulting investment strategies of the models are compared. ∗This is work in progress. The most recent version can be downloaded from...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of dental plaque biofilms for oral and dental disease was proposed recently. This study determined {{the presence of}} Candida spp. in dental plaques of both males and females. Pooled samples of dental plaque were collected from 25 males and 55 females aged between 25 and 50 years. Colony growth was verified and 30 Candida isolates were chosen for the screening. The identification of biofilm forming Candida was confirmed by performing several screening techniques (Microtiter plate method, Test tube method). Screened positive Candida isolates DV 1, DV 17 and DV 21 were characterized by several biochemical tests including growth on Hi-Crome agar. Molecular characterization has also been performed for isolates DV 1, DV 17 and DV 21 by sequencing 18 S rRNA gene. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for three Candida isolates and identified as Candida albicans <b>DV</b> 1, <b>C.</b> albicans <b>DV</b> 17 and <b>C.</b> albicans <b>DV</b> 21. The biofilm formation of Candida spp. on catheter was evaluated using scanning electron microscopic analysis. The extra cellular polysaccharide (EPS) quantity was measured with the effect of different carbon sources, adherence time and biofilm forming time. The above isolates were screened for antifungal resistance against six clinically important antifungal agents such as Amphotericin B, Ketaconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Nystatin and Clotrimazole (10 μg/ml). The biofilm forming isolates were significantly resistant to the antifungal drugs in comparison with non-biofilm forming Candida isolates.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) cultivars with management factors and environments was analyzed {{in terms of}} parameters of a simple physiological model. In one set of experiments seven cultivars were sown at three rates of phosphorus (P) fertilizer (0, 8 and 16 kg P ha− 1). In another set, five cultivars were sown on two dates relative to sowing of millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.). All experiments involved factorial combinations of management and cultivar treatments, and were conducted in 1988 and 1989 at two sites in western Niger. Seed yield, shoot dry matter, vegetative (Dv) and reproductive (Dr) durations were determined and crop growth rate (C) and partitioning (p) to seed estimated Application of P increased seed yield by increasing C. As sowing was delayed from 1 to 3 weeks after the millet was sown, there was a reduction in seed yield due to decreases in <b>C,</b> <b>Dv</b> and Dr. Variation in cultivar performance across years was mainly a function of C and partitioning. In both experiments the C of the landrace Sadore Local was {{greater than that of}} other cultivars, although the partitioning to seed of this cultivar was unstable due to variable control of insect pest damage It is concluded that the primary causes of G × E interactions were differential canopy development and insect damage effects. Therefore in the development of cowpea cultivars for intercropping with millet, emphasis should focus on light capture capabilities. Improved yields would then seem possible with most cultivars, providing insect damage is controlled...|$|R
