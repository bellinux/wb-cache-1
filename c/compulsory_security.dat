40|$|This study {{investigates the}} broadcast/multicast {{authentication}} problems in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs), particularly sensor nodes broadcast authentication and outside user authentication, and proposes efficient and secure solutions for them. The low cost and immunity from cabling have become motivations for many applications of WSNs, for instance, the forest fire alarm, the intelligent traffic system etc. However, the sensitive nature of communication in these applications makes authentication a <b>compulsory</b> <b>security</b> requirement for them. The conventional security solutions are unfeasible for WSNs due to the unique features of sensor networks. Designing a new security mechanism for WSNs, on the other hand, is a challenging task {{due to the nature}} of WSNs. This research proposes a solution to the above mentioned authentication problems in the form of an authentication framework for wireless sensor networks. The proposed framework is comprised of two authentication protocols: one for sensor nodes broadcast authentication and the other for outside user authentication. The latter also facilitates a third type of authentication, i. e., base station to sensor nodes broadcast authentication. These protocols can be applied in WSNs independently tackling individual security problems to achieve different level of security. However, deployed as a unified framework, they ensure a high degree of security with efficiency, providing a single solution to all three authentication problems in WSNs. The performance evaluation results showed that the proposed framework is the most efficient solution when compared to the existing authentication schemes for WSNs, giving a reasonable trade-off between security and efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{text of the}} International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks {{was finally}} adopted at the International Conference held from 14 to 18 May, 2007 in the United Nations Office at Nairobi in Kenya (UNON). The Convention shall enter into force twelve months after having been signed and {{approved}} by ten States. The new Convention will provide a legal frame for the States Parties in removing existing and future wrecks located beyond the territorial sea (within their sovereign rights). First of all it is the exclusive economic zone which we discuss in the paper, or if a state has not established the Zone, it is the territory just beyond the territorial seas which extends not more than 200 NM from the starting lines for determining the size of territorial seas. Although the number of maritime accidents has been reduced recently, {{it has been estimated}} that there are more than 1 300 abandoned wrecks around the world today that pose potential hazards to safe navigation, utilization of the living resources, as well as to the marine environment. In accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Republic of Croatia established Protected Ecological and Fishing Zone comprising sovereign rights characteristic for exclusive economic zones such University of Split, Faculty of Maritime Studies, Split, Croatia e-mail: ranka@pfst. hr a. Adriatic Institute Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Zagreb, Croatia as sovereign right of researching, utilization and conservation of the living resources beyond the outer borders of the territorial sea, as well as their management, and the jurisdiction with regard to the scientific research of the sea and protection and preservation of the marine environment. The Adriatic Sea falls into the category of closed or semi-closed seas by the definition of the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea, and therefore if compared with larger seas, the consequences of pollution would be much greater due to its small size. That is why the adoption of the Convention on the Removal of Wrecks is of great importance to Croatia. The provisions of the Convention oblige the master and the operator of a ship to notify the endangered state party immediately about the accident which may cause a shipwreck, and the state must inform the mariners and other coastal states about the hazard posed by wrecks. The most important fact is that the Convention requires <b>compulsory</b> <b>security</b> for vessels of 300 BT. The vessels of 300 BT are obliged to have the certificate of insurance, or some other financial security as a cover for owner’s liability for the damage caused by the removal of the wreck...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the optimal {{relation}} between social security benefits and retiree age depends on balancing the advantage of providing an otherwise unavailable actuarially fair annuity against the lower rate of return earned in a pay-as-you-go social security system. The ability of <b>compulsory</b> social <b>security</b> programs to provide an actuarially fair annuity implies that benefits should increase with age while the lower return on social security contributions than on private saving implies that a larger fraction of total benefits should be paid {{during the early years}} of retirement. In an economy that contains a mixture of rational life cycle savers and completely myopic individuals who do no saving, it is optimal for benefits to decline during the earlier part of the retirement period and then to begin rising. Numerical calculations based on actual macroeconomic parameters and representative survival probabilities suggest that the optimal age for minimum benefits occurs before age 75. ...|$|R

A simple life—cycle model is used to show that even an actuarially fair, fully funded social security system can reduce national saving. Second, {{to the extent that the}} introduction of social security reduces the size of accidental bequests, the net effect on the consumption of subsequent generations is diminished. Finally, consideration of the welfare gains from <b>compulsory</b> social <b>security</b> requires an examination of the tradeoff between the benefits to early participants from access to the annuities and the costs to generations that follow of a lower capital stock.

30|$|As regards {{sources of}} micro data, {{we use the}} “European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions” (EU-SILC) survey, given its {{cross-country}} comparability, data availability for the pre- and post-crisis periods (2004 – 2012), {{and the fact that}} it covers most of European Union countries. Our sample includes all EU 28 countries (with the exception of Bulgaria, Malta, Romania, Finland, and Croatia), as well as Norway and Iceland. The distinction between public and private sector employment is based on NACE (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities), Rev. 2. The most recent data refers to the 2013 EU-SILC wave, which includes employment and earnings information pertaining to 2012. In this framework, as it is standard in the literature, the “government sector” is an approximation based on either the aggregation of the O (Public Administration and Defense, <b>Compulsory</b> Social <b>Security),</b> P (Education), and Q (Health and social work) sectors of the NACE classification (broad definition), or only the O sector (restricted definition). With the EU-SILC database, it is not possible to separate public employees from private sector employees in any of the sectors, being this particularly relevant for activities P and Q, where private providers are more prevalent. 14 In the case of EU-SILC data, the definition of “wages per employee” is computed based on the individual gross monthly earnings (including only monetary earnings and excluding financial income from investments, assets, savings, stocks, and shares) before netting out taxes and social contributions and the number of hours worked per week in the main job.

40|$|Using {{individual}} level data from Turkstat Household Labor Force Survey for 2005 - 2009 period {{and a variety}} of parametric and semi-parametric techniques, we test two hypothesis regarding formal and informal labor markets: whether there is a wage gap between formal and informal workers and whether this gap is sensitive to variations in unemployment rates across regions and over time, where the formality of employment is defined with respect to registry status of the individuals to <b>compulsory</b> Social <b>Security</b> System. In line with most studies, the formal workers earn more than informal workers, as suggested by standard wage regressions, conditional on workers' observed individual characteristics. On the other hand, considering the limitations of parametric methods and possibility of misleading results due to the different distributional characteristics of formal and informal workers, we alternatively implement propensity score matching. In contrast with the recent studies for other developing countries showing that the wage gap estimates with propensity score matching is insignificant, we do find large and sizable wage gaps between formal and informal workers in Turkey. While parametric methods give similar estimates for formal-informal wage gap within gender groups, the semi-parametric estimates suggest that the observed formal-informal wage gap is larger among females compared to males. Finally, we show that although the parametric methods, such as wage curve regressions, suggest that wages of informal workers decreases and wages of formal workers do not change with higher unemployment rates, the semi-parametric methods show that these gaps are insensitive to unemployment rate variations across regions or over time.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The E-commerce Survey is an annual survey designed to measure {{the extent of the}} use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) and electronic trading by businesses in the UK. It is the only survey that measures ICT activity and e-commerce within UK businesses, including foreign-owned businesses. The survey has been subject to a number of revisions each year, and the 2001 survey is classed as "experimental", is of low quality, and was subject to significant revisions. Subtle changes in the survey questions can make any comparison between survey years difficult, and so researchers are advised to double-check all questions. The sample is selected from the Inter-Departmental Business Register. Businesses with more than 1, 000 employees are sent the questionnaire every year, whilst those with less than 1, 000 employees are randomly sampled and do not therefore necessarily receive the questionnaire every year. The sample allocation uses an algorithm and optimises the sample on key variables that have remained the same since 2003. The survey does not include businesses with between 1 and 9 employees for certain years, e. g. 2005. The survey samples businesses in the UK from all Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, except for: Agriculture, Hunting and Forestry (Section A) Fishing (Section B) Mining and Quarrying (Section C) Public Administration and Defence; <b>Compulsory</b> Social <b>Security</b> (Section L) Education (Section M). The survey has collected information on a consistent basis from SICs since 2000, with only minor adaptations in certain SICs. The survey refers to the year from 1 January to 31 December. There are separate E-commerce Survey questionnaires for the financial and non-financial sectors. Non-financial sectors are excluded from estimates relating to the proportions of businesses buying and selling electronically, and the values of their sales and purchases. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research. For the sixth edition (July 2016), the 2014 Provisional data file has been added. Main Topics : The main topics covered by the E-commerce Survey vary from year to year. The 2013 survey included the following topics: use of computers and computer networks ICT specialists and skills access and use of internet cloud computing sharing of information electronically within the business use of EDI-type messages suitable for automated processing sharing supply chain management information electronically use of radio frequency identification technologies electronic invoicing e-commerce use of social media </ul...|$|R
40|$|In the 17 th and 18 th centuries, {{relations}} between the European states had a relatively predictable evolution. They {{were the result of}} the fight between the great European powers for supremacy. Spain, then France and finally England imposed their policy and had continental domination for a long time. If {{at the beginning of the}} period, the role of diplomacy was almost insignificant, throughout the 17 th century, first in France then in other states, the European monarchs built an ever more specialised diplomatic system. The tools for the new external policy of the European states became more diverse. If at the beginning of the period, diplomatic attempts were still shy and based on other practices rather than modern diplomacy, we can notice a specialisation and diversification of negotiation practices and preservation of good relations with the partners. We could say that modern diplomacy was tightly related to the economic development and the bourgeois revolution. When economic interests came to the foreground, politicians began to be more cautious with the “others”. The state was often “compelled” from within to revise its attitude towards its European partners. From the 17 th to the 19 th centuries, national spirit of affirmation was stronger and stronger. Once the affirmation of nations, the European wars acquired new connotations. Diplomacy, including the secret one, earned its role in the given geopolitical context. The state increased its diplomatic activity as it first aimed at setting its power on much firmer bases. It was the main goal of external policy and of the whole activity making it possible to reach the objectives of the state. The promulgation of efficient laws, the homogenisation of jurisprudence, the establishment of an efficient administrative framework, the enforcement of new viable financial methods together with military force and political stability were measures of <b>compulsory</b> national <b>security</b> to face the pressure of neighbouring powers. At times of peace or war, the great powers used their diplomacy to get “great advantages” needed by modern economic societies. They were defined by the following elements: market and monopoles, strategic harbours and vital borders, furs, fish, raw materials for naval constructions, wheat, tropical products, or other sources of wealth. To briefly characterise the relation system between the great European powers, we can point out that great monarchies connected through an interesting matrimonial, economic and geostrategic system feared “each other”. Consequently, most European states tried to build a system of alliances meant to guarantee the implementation of the pursued policy. In general, the international relations system on the continent was characterised by the rivalry between the Habsburgs and the Bourbons. England played an important role in the system. After gaining maritime supremacy, England sought to impose its own policy on the continent. The image conferred by rivalries between the great European states changed in both form and content. ...|$|R
40|$|Social {{exclusion}} {{has become}} {{a cause for concern}} in contemporary societies. It {{has become a}} global phenomenon that requires the participation of several players. Adopting constitutional and legal frameworks that seek to promote inclusiveness of social protection programmes has become more imperative than ever before. More often than not economic shocks have left many people not only marginalised but also vulnerable to the hazards and vicissitudes of life. In order to provide social protection cover, it is incumbent upon governments to intervene by way of providing adequate social security to the citizenry. Post-colonial governments inherited social security systems lacking inclusivity. Rising unemployment levels, poor performing economies, natural calamities and the HIV/AIDS epidemic have forced progressive and responsible governments the world over to re-think on social security strategies. Social security systems that existed during the colonial era were purposely designed to exclude the natives. The Government of Zimbabwe inherited a social security system that was exclusionary. Formal social protection was a privilege of the elite hence soon after independence the need to address the imbalances of the colonial era became a priority. The introduction of a national social security system was to achieve social inclusivity through the establishment of more schemes catering for the different segments of the Zimbabwean community. The National Social Security Act [Chapter 17 : 04] of 1989 brought into existence a formal and <b>compulsory</b> social <b>security</b> policy which was to coexist with other social protection intervention strategies of the past. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a critical overview of the social security policy of the Government of Zimbabwe. The qualitative study established that the prevailing economic challenges triggered massive retrenchments which exposed the citizenry to social exclusion. The majority of the people have opted for the informal sector economy in order to earn a living. The problem with this traditional form of employment is that, currently, formal social security has not been extended to cover the informal sector. To establish the relevance of the existing social security systems, a review of literature on social protection strategies was adopted. Views of community members who are supposed to be the ultimate beneficiaries of the various social security schemes were established through the use of interviews and general discussions. Also analysed in this study are the attempts by governments in general, and the Zimbabwean Government in particular, to extend social security to the informal sector. An examination of journal articles and reviews of general reports on the overall performance of social security schemes in developing countries suggest that social security intervention strategies have not been very effective in cushioning people against economic shocks and hardships. Efforts aimed at achieving social inclusivity have been inhibited by a number of challenges. In the absence of formal employment, concerted effort to extend social security coverage to the informal sector has not yielded positive results. All forms of employment, formal or informal, should be harnessed, if social inclusivity is to be achieved. The various social protection strategies adopted by Government over the years should be synchronised in order to improve the general welfare of the people. The current situation which is characterised by the scarcity of resources does not require a disjointed and fragmented approach. The study recommends the creation of more social security schemes to cater for the different segments of the Zimbabwean community. Accountability and transparency should be the foundation for better management practices capable of retaining public trust. It has been concluded that for the Zimbabwean populace to enjoy their right to social security the Government of Zimbabwe needs to adopt a multisectoral approach.
