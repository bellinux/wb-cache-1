5|$|Free basic water. Inspired by the Human Right to Water, two {{important}} cities in Colombia make a basic {{amount of water}} (Minimo Vital de Agua Potable) available to their poorest residents free of charge. In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> water per month and per person - or 10 cubic meters {{for a family of}} four - available for free to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns. In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> free basic water per household for households in classes 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households. The annual cost is estimated at 60 billion Pesos (USD 33 million).|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 2014 TDIC {{announced}} {{the completion of}} the first permanent gallery structure to mark {{the first anniversary of the}} start of construction.

5|$|Although {{rainfall}} is low, Sismiut has abundant natural {{supplies of}} fresh, drinkable surface water, collected from a reservoir under Alanngorsuaq. Water is also pumped to the waterworks from another lake around 2.5 kilometers {{away in the}} mountains. The water mains are preinsulated and electrically heated to supply the residents during the winter months. The water supply network is capable of producing some 882,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> water per year; two water-supplying lakes by the town have a combined annual minimum capacity of more than 7.2 million cubic meters.|$|E
50|$|The gas {{field was}} {{discovered}} in 1956 along with the giant oilfield of Hassi Messaoud. Production started in 1961. Its recoverable reserves have been estimated at 2.415 trillion <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> <b>of</b> natural gas, and probable reserves at 2.7-3 trillion <b>cubic</b> <b>meter.</b> The annual producing capacity is around 100 billion <b>cubic</b> <b>meter</b> <b>of</b> natural gas.

5|$|Several oil {{and natural}} gas wells are {{scattered}} throughout the shoreline and a few are included in the waters of Carancahua Bay. The most notable include the wells of the Appling Field segment, a mile offshore from Port Alto, which is believed to contain 33 billion cubic feet (0.93 billion <b>cubic</b> <b>meters)</b> <b>of</b> natural gas. The field was first discovered in the 1950s, but later abandoned. Brigham Exploration is working with Royale Energy to develop ten reserves in the area, spotted during a seismic survey.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the better}} known {{pipelines}} were the Northern Lights {{line from the}} Komi petroleum deposit to Brest on the Polish border, the Soiuz line running from Orenburg to Uzhgorod near the Czechoslovak and Hungarian borders, and the Export pipeline from the Urengoy gas field to L'vov and thence to First World countries, including Austria, Italy, West Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The 1,420-millimeter Export pipeline was 4,451 kilometers long. It crossed the Ural and Carpathian Mountains and almost 600 rivers, including the Ob', Volga, Don, and Dnepr. It had 41 compressor stations and a yearly capacity of 32 billion <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> natural gas.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{itself was}} also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and {{teenagers}} worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory {{was turned into}} a submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles. Despite these preparations, the capital was within striking distance of German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale air raids on the city. The air raids caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.|$|E

5|$|Applications {{for federal}} aid {{continued}} through June, with state approvals reaching $54 million on June 3. By this date, the Army Corps of Engineers reported that 964,170 cubic yards (737,160 cubic meters), roughly 58%, of the 1.65 million cubic yards (1.26 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters)</b> <b>of</b> debris had been removed. Assistance for {{farmers and ranchers}} who suffered severe losses from the tornadoes was also available by June 3. After {{more than a month}} of being open, emergency shelters were set to be closed on June 18. On June 21, an educational road show made by FEMA visited the hardest hit areas in Oklahoma to urge residents to build storm cellars. According to FEMA, more than 9,500 residents applied for federal aid during the allocated period {{in the wake of the}} tornadoes. Most of the applicants lived in Oklahoma and Cleveland counties, 3,800 and 3,757 persons respectively. In all, disaster recovery aid for the tornadoes amounted to roughly $67.8 million by the end of July 2.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the SR 125 {{toll road}} started in September 2003; it was {{projected}} {{to open in}} 2006. Over the next few years, 1.5 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions {{to allow for the}} interchange with SR 54 to be built. In 2005, the road was given the South Bay Expressway name. The South Bay Expressway extended SR 125 southward from SR 54 to Otay Mesa. This toll road was one of four privately financed toll highway projects, including the 91 Express Toll Lanes, that were approved in 1990; it was also one of two toll roads financed and controlled by both public and private sources, although the 91 Express Lanes, the other road, soon became entirely publicly owned. A partnership known as the South Bay Expressway operated the road, while an Australian company, Maquarie Group Ltd., handled financial and construction matters.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{search and}} rescue efforts for {{thirteen}} people who were listed as missing through May 7 were assisted by urban {{search and rescue}} dogs from across the country. Nearly 1,000 members of the Oklahoma National Guard were deployed throughout the affected region. The American Red Cross had set up ten mobile feeding stations by this time and stated that 30 more were en route. On May 8, a disaster recovery center was opened in Moore for individuals recovering from the tornadoes. According to the Army Corps of Engineers, roughly 500,000 cubic yards (382,277 <b>cubic</b> <b>meters)</b> <b>of</b> debris was left behind and would likely take weeks to clear. Within {{the first few days}} of the disaster declaration, relief funds began being sent to families who requested aid. By May 9, roughly $180,000 had been approved by FEMA for disaster housing assistance.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} of matter and energy have changed over the history of the Universe. Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> volume. The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{production}} at the plant was halted after a combined FBI and EPA raid in 1989. Due {{to the end of}} the Cold War, changes in nuclear weapons policy, and years of protests, the Rocky Flats Plant was shut down, with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site. The site's mission then changed to cleanup. The Rocky Flats Plant was declared a CERCLASuperfund site in 1989 and began its transformation to a cleanup site in February 1992. Removal of the plant and surface contamination was largely completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with federal and state agency support and stakeholder input. The cleanup effort decommissioned and demolished over 800 structures; removed over 21 tons of weapons-grade material; removed over 1.3 million <b>cubic</b> <b>meters</b> <b>of</b> waste; and, treated more than 16 million gallons of water. Four groundwater treatment systems were also constructed. The site achieved regulatory closure in 2006.|$|E
