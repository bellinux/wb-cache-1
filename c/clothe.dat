5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to <b>clothe</b> them, then was forced to follow suit and <b>clothe</b> the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E

The typical uniform by the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862 was a slouch hat or kepi, a shell-jacket, and a pair of sky-blue or gray cloth trousers, with brogans.|$|E

40|$|A {{picture of}} a nude {{isolated}} {{in a series of}} pictures of <b>clothed</b> models was quite memorable, but when compared with a <b>clothed</b> picture, the nude impaired memory for background picture details as well as pictures immediately following the nude (anterograde amnesia). Recall of details given picture-gist recall, as well as recognition of person details, were equivalent in the <b>clothed</b> and nude conditions. A <b>clothed</b> picture isolated in a series of nudes did not hurt memory for background information, nor did it produce anterograde amnesia. Apparently, distinctiveness supports good memory for the gist of the nude or <b>clothed</b> pictures. However, distinctiveness is not responsible for the anterograde amnesia and poor memory for background details found with nudes. The information processing capacity of man varies from moment to moment depending upon the nature of the information being processed.

25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small.

Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, <b>clothe,</b> vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.|$|E
25|$|During the Famine, Ireland {{produced}} enough food, flax, {{and wool}} {{to feed and}} <b>clothe</b> double its nine million people. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782–83, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their protests. There was no such export ban in the 1840s. Some historians have argued that in this sense the famine was artificial, caused by the British government's choice not to stop exports.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Testosterone {{is known}} to {{regulate}} male sexual interest, but the exact way that androgens influence men's sexual cognition remains unclear. Aim: To investigate the influence of androgen deprivation (AD) on visual responses to sexually suggestive stimuli in men treated for prostate cancer with AD therapy. Methods: Patients with AD-treated prostate cancer, patients with prostate cancer not on AD therapy, and age-matched healthy control participants were exposed to images {{of male and female}} runway models fully or minimally <b>clothed.</b> Eye tracking was used to compare looking behavior among groups. Main Outcome Measures: Proportion of fixations on fully <b>clothed</b> vs minimally <b>clothed</b> models and proportion of fixations on target areas of interest (ie, legs, chest, pelvis, and face) of fully <b>clothed</b> and minimally <b>clothed</b> models were analyzed and compared among groups. Results: Although men not on AD exhibited a larger proportion of fixations on the minimally <b>clothed</b> compared with the fully <b>clothed</b> images, {{there was no difference between}} the 2 image types for men on AD. This was true regardless of whether the images depicted male or female models. Groups did not differ in their fixations to target areas of interest. Conclusion: These results suggest that testosterone can influence men’s visual attention to sexual stimuli; specifically, AD can attenuate the time spent fixated on sexualized targets.

It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities.

40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{is a valuable}} green energy, which is important in achieving a successful building design for thermal comfort in indoor environment. This paper considers solar radiation indoors into the transient thermal transfer models of a <b>clothed</b> human body and offers a new numerical method to analyze the dynamic thermal status of a <b>clothed</b> human body under different solar radiation incidences. The evaluation model of solar radiation indoors {{and a group of}} coupled thermal models of the <b>clothed</b> human body are developed and integrated. The simulation capacities of these integrated models are validated through a comparison between the predicted results and the experimental data in reference. After that, simulation cases are also conducted to show the influence of solar radiation on the thermal status of individual <b>clothed</b> body segments when the human body is staying indoors in different seasons. This numerical simulation method provides a useful tool to analyze the thermal status of <b>clothed</b> human body under different solar radiation incidences indoors and thus enables the architect to efficiently utilize the green solar energy in building development.
