40|$|As most Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) {{engage in}} {{securities}} lending or {{are based on}} total return swaps, they expose their investors to counterparty risk. In this paper, we estimate empirically such risk exposures for a sample of physical and swap-based funds. We find that counterparty risk exposure is higher for swap-based ETFs, but that investors are compensated for bearing this risk. Using a difference-in-differences specification, we uncover that ETF flows respond significantly to changes in counter-party risk. Finally, we show that switching to an optimal <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolio</b> leads to substantial reduction in counterparty risk exposure...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} effects of informational asymmetries on corporate finance. Two distinct settings are considered, one empirical and one theoretical. ^ In the first chapter, I show that strong creditor rights facilitate the financing of innovation, using a novel dataset of patent <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Using the random timing of court decisions {{as a source of}} exogenous variation in creditor rights, I show that patenting companies raise more debt financing when they can more credibly pledge their patents as collateral. Consequently, R 2 ̆ 6 D investment and patenting output also increase, as do the technological diversity and average citation count of the patents produced. These findings demonstrate that low leverage in innovative industries is due to information asymmetry, not incentive problems, and that a strengthening of creditor rights alleviates this friction by increasing collateral values. ^ In the second chapter, we identify three new factors that affect the firm 2 ̆ 7 s decision between equity issuance and asset sales in the presence of information asymmetry. First, equity investors own a claim to the capital raised, which mitigates the information asymmetry of the underlying balance sheet (the 2 ̆ 2 certainty effect 2 ̆ 2). Second, firms can disguise the sale of a low-quality asset as instead motivated by dissynergies, and thus receive a higher price (the 2 ̆ 2 camouflage effect 2 ̆ 2). Third, unlike with an equity issuance, a 2 ̆ 2 lemons 2 ̆ 2 discount on assets need not lead to a low stock price, as the asset is not a carbon copy of the firm (the 2 ̆ 2 correlation effect 2 ̆ 2). The findings demonstrate that information asymmetry {{is a function of the}} nature and purpose of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s financing decisions. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an {{enormous}} {{growth in the}} use of securities as collateral. Purchasing securities with borrowed money secured by other securities or cash itself is called [...] "buying on margin". Where A is owed a debt or other obligation by B, A may require B to deliver property rights in securities to A, either at inception (transfer of title) or only in default (non-transfer-of-title institutional). For institutional loans, property rights are not transferred but nevertheless enable A to satisfy its claims in the event that B fails to make good on its obligations to A or otherwise becomes insolvent. Collateral arrangements are divided into two broad categories, namely security interests and outright collateral transfers. Commonly, commercial banks, investment banks, government agencies and other institutional investors such as mutual funds are significant collateral takers as well as providers. In addition, private parties may utilize stocks or other securities as <b>collateral</b> for <b>portfolio</b> loans in securities lending scenarios.|$|R
30|$|There {{were five}} {{key players in}} the CDO {{innovation}} and governance process: securities firms, CDO managers, rating agencies, financial guarantors, and investors (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Securities firms, CDO managers, and financial guarantors participated in the development process by originating and underwriting CDOs, selecting <b>collateral</b> and managing <b>portfolios,</b> and providing protection against default, respectively. Meanwhile, rating agencies and audit companies performed oversight governance by providing basic guidelines on collateral content and CDO structure and signing prospectuses, respectively, to ensure that investors (who buy CDOs) are protected (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Nevertheless, rating agencies’ effectiveness in this governance role is considered poor (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011) because of conflicts of interest arising between these agencies and innovators (Mullard, 2012), as well as flaws in the rating models/methodologies used to assess risk and define rating guidelines (Griffin and Tang, 2011). In addition to self-regulation through rating agencies, there was some statutory regulation in the form of guidelines for calculating net capital reserves (to hold against securities portfolios) and the approval of documents (e.g. prospectuses) by various government institutions (e.g. the SEC). However, these occurred just before commercialisation with very little on-site examination (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{contribution}} is to provide an extension to a model developed by Tassinari and Corradi [9] to price equity and debt tranches of a Collateralized fund of hedge fund Obligations. Since the value of every tranche depends on the evolution of the <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolio</b> during the life of the contract, the idea is to evaluate each CFO liability as an option on the underlying basket of hedge funds. The proposed model is able to capture skewness, excess-kurtosis in hedge funds’ log-returns distribution and to generate a more complex dependence structure than the linear one. At the same time, this new model can be calibrated to the empirical correlation matrix. Finally, the adopted approach allows to find explicit relations among physical and risk neutral processes and distributions at both marginal and joint level...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{existence}} of endogenous fluctuations with a rational bubble and the stabilizing role of fiscal and monetary policies. Consumers' credit constraints, the role of <b>collateral</b> and a <b>portfolio</b> choice are the key ingredients of our analysis. We consider an overlapping generations model where households realize a portfolio choice between three assets with different returns (capital, money and bonds). Expectation-driven fluctuations and the multiplicity of steady states occur under a positive bubble on bonds, gross substitutability and large input substitution because of credit market imperfections. Focusing on the stabilizing role of policies, we show that a progressive taxation on capital income may rule out expectation-driven fluctuations and the multiplicity of steady states. In contrast, a monetary policy under a Taylor rule has a mitigated stabilizing role, depending on the reactiveness of the policy rule and the concavity of the utility function. When the monetary authority decides instead to fix the nominal interest rate regardless the inflation, decreasing {{the level of the}} nominal interest rate can rule out expectation-driven fluctuations, restore the uniqueness of steady states, but can damage the welfare at the steady state...|$|R
40|$|In a two-country {{portfolio}} {{model with}} leverage constraints, I focus on private assets {{in order to}} understand how their behaviour can justify an expected excess return as well as the flight-to-safety observed in the data. The specific goal is to study how much these phenomena are {{explained by the fact that}} investors cannot always borrow the same amount of resources pledging domestic assets as pledging foreign collateral. Modeling the leverage constraints accordingly, I propose a methodology to deal with this heterogeneous pledgeability and solve for country portfolios. The central feature of this approach is that any idiosyncratic shocks generate an expected excess returns which compensate the current effects of the shock on the relative riskiness of local versus foreign <b>collateral.</b> The resulting <b>portfolio</b> solution shows that, in equilibrium, investors care for this risk and renounce to a part of the expected excess return - favouring current borrowing. The main consequences are: the home equity bias is smaller than in a model where assets are homogeneously pledgeable; the ex post dynamics of the relative premium paid on collateralized assets contribute to the cross-border transmission of shocks. Given these dynamics, idiosyncratic shocks to the pledgeability of local assets affect the value of external claims and liabilities of the country hit by the shock in such a way that its net foreign assets match those observed in the data during times of flight-to-safety. portfolio choice, riskiness of pledged collateral, return di¤erentials, macroeconomic interdependence...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{that started in}} 2007 has seen central banks play an unprecedented role both to ensure financial stability and to support economic activity. While {{the importance of the}} central bank in ensuring financial stability is well known (see e. g. Padoa-Schioppa (2014)), the unprecedented nature of the {{financial crisis}} led central banks to resort to new instruments for which the literature offered little guidance. This thesis aims to bridge this gap, using both theory and data to better understand one of the main instruments used by central banks: collateralized loans. The general contribution of the thesis is thus both retrospective and forward looking. On a retrospective point of view, it helps understanding the actions of the central bank during the crisis and the mechanisms involved. Looking forward, {{a better understanding of the}} tools used during the crisis allows to better inform future policies. The first chapter starts from the observation that the literature, starting with Bagehot (1873), has generally assumed that the central bank should lend against high quality collateral. However in the 2007 - 2013 crisis central banks lent mostly against low quality collateral. In this chapter, we explore when it is efficient for the central bank to relax its collateral policy. In our model, a commercial bank funds projects in the real economy by borrowing against collateral from the interbank market or the central bank. While collateral prevents the bank from shirking (in the spirit of Holmstrom and Tirole (2011)), it is costly to use as its value is lower for investors and the central bank than for the bank. We find that when the bank has high levels of available collateral, it borrows in the interbank market against low collateral requirements so that the collateral policy of the central bank has no impact on banks' borrowing. However, when the amount of available collateral falls below a threshold, the lack of collateral prevents borrowing. In this case, the collateral policy of the central bank can affect lending, and it can therefore be optimal for the central bank to relax its collateral requirements to avoid the credit crunch. The second chapter focuses on collateralized loans in the context of the euro area. According to the literature on optimum currency area, one of the main drawbacks of currency unions is the inability for the central bank to accommodate asymmetric shocks with its interest rate policy. Suppose that there are 2 countries in an economy and one suffers a negative shock while the other has a positive shock. Theory would suggest an accommodative policy - low interest rates - in the first country and a restrictive policy - high interest rates - in the second one. This is however impossible in a currency union because the interest rate must be the same for both countries (Mundell 1961, McKinnon 1963, de Grauwe 2012). In this chapter I show that collateral policy can accommodate asymmetric shocks. I extend the model of collateralized lending of the first chapter to two banks A and B and two collateral types 1 and 2. I also introduce a central bank deposit facility which allows the interest rate instrument to be compared with the collateral policy instrument in the context of a currency area hit by asymmetric shocks. Macroeconomic shocks impact the investment opportunities available to banks and the value of their collateral and the central bank seeks to steer economy rates towards a target level. I show that when banks have different <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolios</b> (as in a monetary union where banks invest in the local economy), an asymmetric shock on the quality and value of their collateral can increase interest rates in the country hit by the negative shock while keeping them unchanged in the country with a positive shock. The third chapter provides an empirical illustration of this “collateral channel” of open market operations. We use data on assets pledged by banks to the ECB from 2009 to 2011 to quantify the “collateral substitution / smoother transmission of monetary policy” trade-off faced by the central bank. We build an empirical model of collateral choice that is similar in spirit to the model on institutional demand for financial assets of Koijen (2014). We show how the haircut of the central bank can affect the relative cost of pledging collateral to the central bank and how this cost can be estimated using the amount of assets pledged by banks. Our model allows to perform a broad set of policy counterfactuals. For example, we use the recovered coefficient to assess how a 5 % haircut increase on all collateral belonging to a specific asset class (e. g. government bonds or ABS) would affect the type of collateral used at the central bank. The final chapter focuses on the use of loans as collateral by banks in the euro area. While collateral is generally viewed as consisting of liquid and safe assets such as government bonds, we show that banks in Europe do use bank loans as collateral. We identify two purposes of bank loan collateral: funding and liquidity purposes. The main distinction between the two purposes is with respect to the maturity of the instruments involved: liquidity purposes refer to the use of bank loans as collateral to obtain short term liquidity and manage unexpected liquidity shocks. In practice the central bank is the main acceptor of these collateral. The second type of use is for funding purposes, in which case bank loans are used as collateral in ABSs or covered bonds. The collateral in these transactions allow banks to obtain a lower long-term funding cost. Doctorat en Sciences économiques et de gestioninfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{behaviour}} of {{the efficient}} frontier for CDOs of bespoke portfolios is investigated under one-factor copula marginal distributional assumptions. This {{approach has been}} thoroughly used in statistical literature. The main feature of these models is that default events, conditional on some latent state variable, are independent. This eases the computation of the aggregate loss distribution, a crucial element in credit portfolio optimisation. Both Gaussian and Clayton copula models are applied to the default dependence structure. The Clayton copula model demonstrates superiority in capturing the default dependence inherent in credit portfolios. The portfolio optimisation problem set-up under the newly defined Copula Marginal Expected Tail Loss (abbreviated as CMETL) risk measure is convex and can be easily solved in terms of linear programming algorithms.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} pricing of collateralized debt {{obligation}} (CDO) using Monte Carlo and analytic methods. Both methods are developed {{within the framework}} of the reduced form model. One-factor Gaussian Copula is used for treating default correlations amongst the <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolio.</b> Based on the two methods, the portfolio loss, the expected loss in each CDO tranche, tranche spread, and the default delta sensitivity are analyzed with respect to different parameters such as maturity, default correlation, default intensity or hazard rate, and recovery rate. We provide a careful study of the effects of different parametric impact. Our results show that Monte Carlo method is slow and not robust in the calculation of default delta sensitivity. The analytic approach has comparative advantages for pricing CDO. We also employ empirical data to investigate the implied default correlation and base correlation of the CDO.

40|$|This {{research}} work investigates the theoretical foundations and computational aspects of constructing optimal bespoke CDO structures. Due to the evolutionary {{nature of the}} CDO design process, stochastic search methods that mimic the metaphor of natural biological evolution are applied. For efficient searching the optimal solution, the nondominating sort genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used, which places emphasis on moving towards the true Paretooptimal region.

The algorithm further demonstrates attractive constraint handling features among others, which is suitable for successfully solving the constrained portfolio optimisation problem. Numerical analysis is conducted on a bespoke CDO <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolio</b> constructed from constituents of the iTraxx Europe IG S 5 CDS index. For comparative purposes, the default dependence structure is modelled via Gaussian and Clayton copula assumptions. This research concludes that CDO tranche returns at all levels of risk under the Clayton copula assumption performed better than the sub-optimal Gaussian assumption. It is evident that our research has provided meaningful guidance to CDO traders, for seeking significant improvement of returns over standardised CDOs tranches of similar rating...|$|E
