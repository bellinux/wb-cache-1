25|$|The biscuit {{reinforced}} {{butt joint}} {{is a fairly}} recent innovation in butt joint construction. It is used primarily in carcase and frame construction. The biscuit is an oval shaped piece of specially dried and <b>compressed</b> <b>wood,</b> usually beech, which is installed in matching mortises in both members of the joint {{in a similar fashion}} to a loose or floating tenon. Biscuit joints are common in both frame and carcase construction. They are particularly convenient for panel glue ups as they facilitate alignment of panel members.|$|E

25|$|The {{technique}} of <b>compressing</b> <b>wood</b> pulp into pellets or artificial logs can reduce emissions. The combustion is cleaner, {{and the increased}} wood density and reduced water content can eliminate some of the transport bulk.

A large number of Spitfire VBs were fitted with [...] "gun heater intensifier" [...] systems on the exhaust stacks. These piped additional heated air into the gun bays.

30|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{developing}} a thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processing to <b>compress</b> poplar <b>wood</b> and investigating {{the effects of}} high temperature, moisture, and pressure during the THM processing on the changes in microstructure, porosity, mechanical properties, and dimensional stability of <b>compressed</b> poplar <b>wood.</b> The variations in these properties were correlated and their mathematical relations were determined. Poplar woods with high moisture content were compressed using different pressures at a temperature of 160  °C for different periods. The compression level was characterized by the volume compression ratio (CR), which {{is defined as the}} ratio of the compression volume and the original volume of sample before and after THM processing. The obtained results indicated that the high pressure of THM process caused the collapsing of wood cell lumens and the developing of a certain amount of fractures in the cell wall. The damage level of wood cells increased with increasing pressure and time. Moreover, the pressure narrowed the cell lumens, which decreased significantly the pore volume in wood substrate. The pore size distribution shifted from the level of macropores to those of mesopores and micropores after THM process. The THM process created superior mechanical property, especially for those with higher CR. Besides, it was revealed that the process decreased dramatically the set recovery of treated woods and improved their dimensional stability. A significant improvement was achieved in terms of the mechanical and physical properties of <b>compressed</b> poplar <b>wood</b> via the structural reformation during the THM process.|$|R
30|$|Thermal {{treatment}} is a wood improvement and preservation process against biotic and abiotic factors [5]. Although the mechanical properties of wood {{are affected by}} the thermal treatment process [6], it provides some important improvements in wood properties including dimensional stability, hygroscopicity, and decay resistance [7 – 9]. Thermal treatments affect chemical factors required for the growth of fungi such as nitrogen, vitamins, minor metals and mineral elements [10]. With thermal treatment, wood becomes more resistant to fungi due to chemical modifications of the wood components of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin [11 – 13]. On the other hand, thermal treatments reduce most of the mechanical strength properties of wood [14 – 17]. As a result of these undesired disadvantages, extensive commercial utilisation of thermally treated wood has been limited [18]. Through the modification of densification, many of the physical and mechanical properties of wood can be improved. The modification process of densification in wood is usually performed by <b>compressing</b> <b>wood</b> in a transverse direction. Additionally, wood material can be densified via the impregnation of various chemicals into the cell cavities of the wood.|$|R
50|$|Hordern-Richmond Aircraft Ltd was {{registered}} {{as a private}} company on 29 April 1937 with a nominal capital of £10,000 in 10,000 shares of £1. The objects were {{to carry on the}} business of manufacturers of and dealers in aircraft and aeronautical equipment. Frederick Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond with Edmund Hordern (former test pilot of Heston Aircraft Company Ltd.) originally formed the company with the intention of producing aircraft of their own design, specifically the Hordern-Richmond Autoplane, based at Denham Aerodrome. As the time did not appear appropriate, effort was concentrated on the production of wooden airscrews, with the intention of using plastics and <b>compressed</b> <b>woods</b> for the same purpose at a later date. The company employed A.A.D. Lang, who had long experience of airscrew production and Tony Fletcher as chief designer. Hordern-Richmond merged with Lang Propellers of Weybridge, and a new factory was built at Haddenham, near Thame, Buckinghamshire. In April 1940 Flight magazine reported that the de Havilland company acquired an interest in the company with A.S. Butler taking a seat on the board.|$|R

5000|$|Pellets are {{produced}} by <b>compressing</b> the <b>wood</b> material which has first passed through a hammer mill to provide a uniform dough-like mass.

The paper wasps use their mandibles to <b>compress</b> the <b>wood</b> fibers into thin sheets, which are used as cells for the nest and coverings—except in Polistes, where cells are not enclosed. The nests created in this fashion are structurally resilient and relatively weatherproof. Inside the nest, the cells along the perimeter are roughly circular while the inner cells are more hexagonal.

The experimental results show that the charring rate decreases exponentially with the increase in density. For densities above 800  kg/m the charring rate reaches a constant value and becomes independent of the density. The reason for the non-linear charring behavior is the thermal conductivity of wood which increases with the increase in density.
