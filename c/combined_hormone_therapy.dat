25|$|Data exist {{from both}} {{observational}} and randomized clinical trials regarding {{the association between}} menopausal hormone replacement therapy (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative {{risk of breast cancer}} of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers (hazard ratio = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years. HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring in the placebo group, and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term use of hormones for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no breast cancer risk. A correlation was found between the use of hormonal contraceptives and subsequent reliance on hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} long term risks and {{benefits}} of hormone replacement therapy (<b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> versus placebo, and oestrogen alone versus <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy).</b> Design Multicentre, randomised, placebo controlled, double blind trial. Setting General practices in UK (384), Australia (91), and New Zealand (24). Participants Postmenopausal women aged 50 - 69 years at randomisation. At early closure of the trial, 56 583 had been screened, 8980 entered run-in, and 5692 (26 % of target of 22 300) started treatment. Interventions Oestrogen only therapy (conjugated equine oestrogens 0. 625 mg orally daily) or <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> (conjugated equine oestrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2. 5 / 5. 0 mg orally daily). Ten years of treatment planned. Main outcome measures Primary outcomes: major cardiovascular disease, osteoporotic fractures, and breast cancer. Secondary outcomes: other cancers, death from all causes, venous thromboembolism, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, and quality of life. Results The trial was prematurely closed during recruitment, after a median follow-up of 11. 9 months (interquartile range 7. 1 - 19. 6, total 6498 women years) in those enrolled, after the publication of early results from the women's health initiative study. The mean age of randomised women was 62. 8 (SD 4. 8) years. When <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> (n= 2196) was compared with placebo (n= 2189), there was {{a significant increase in the}} number of major cardiovascular events (7 v 0, P= 0. 016) and venous thromboembolisms (22 v 3, hazard ratio 7. 36 (95 % CI 2. 20 to 24. 60)). There were no statistically significant differences in numbers of breast or other cancers (22 v 25, hazard ratio 0. 88 (0. 49 to 1. 56)), cerebrovascular events (14 v 19, 0. 73 (0. 37 to 1. 46)), fractures (40 v 58, 0. 69 (0. 46 to 1. 03)), and overall deaths (8 v 5, 1. 60 (0. 52 to 4. 89)). Comparison of <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> (n= 815) versus oestrogen therapy (n= 826) outcomes revealed no significant differences. Conclusions Hormone replacement therapy increases cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk when started many years after the menopause. The results are consistent with the findings of the women's health initiative study and secondary prevention studies. Research is needed to assess {{the long term}} {{risks and benefits of}} starting hormone replacement therapy near the menopause, when the effect may be different.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 6 months of <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> with transdermal {{estradiol}} (0. 05 mg/day x 21 days) and different oral progestogens (10 mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] {{in the last}} 12 days, 10 mg/day dihydrogesterone in the last 12 days, and 50 mg/day cyproterone in the first 10 days), on menopausal symptoms and hypothalamo pituitary-ovarian function were studied in normal perimenopausal women. The study included 38 perimenopausal women, aged 43 - 49 years, with regular cycles of 26 - 32 days in length and menopausal symptoms. Endocrine status was determined by assay of basal levels of gonadotropins (LH, FSH), E 2, and P every week until menstrual bleeding, {{before and during the}} first month of therapy. Plasma levels of LH and FSH were suppressed in the first month of therapy while E 2 had a mean value of 45 +/- 12 pg/ml. Ultrasound examination and low levels of P indicated a complete block of ovulation and hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian activity. All women reported the disappearance of vasomotor symptoms and nocturnal sweating. Transdermal estradiol and oral progestogens were well tolerated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} uterine effects of 60 mg of {{raloxifene}} with a continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy,</b> a preparation of 2 mg 17 beta-oestradiol (E(2)) and 1 mg norethisterone acetate for a duration of 12 months. DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind trial. SETTING: Multicentre: Europe, Israel, South Africa. POPULATION: Asymptomatic postmenopausal women with {{risk factors for}} osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease who had an endometrial thickness of less than 5 mm. One thousand and eight women were randomised for the six month core; of these 420 were invited to continue into a six month extension period. METHODS: Randomisation to either raloxifene or continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> Patients, recruiters and assessors were blinded to the treatment used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency of vaginal spotting/bleeding as recorded in a diary, endometrial thickness and uterine volume as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: After six months of therapy with raloxifene, the rate of women on raloxifene reporting vaginal bleeding and spotting (6. 8 %) {{was similar to the}} rate in the lead-in phase (8. 3 %) but increased from 7. 0 % to 55. 1 % in the continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> group. Raloxifene treatment was not associated with a significant change from baseline to endpoint in mean endometrial thickness (P = 0. 11), whereas continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> treatment was associated with an increase in this value of mean (SD) of 1. 2 (2. 2) mm (P < 0. 001). Compared with raloxifene, mean endometrial thickness for women on continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> was significantly increased at endpoint [4. 6 (2. 1) mm vs 3. 5 (1. 7) mm; change from baseline P < 0. 001]. In the raloxifene group, there was a trend towards a decrease from baseline in uterine volume [from 31. 4 (20. 3) to 30. 3 (16. 2) mm; P = 0. 37]; in the continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> group, there was a significant increase in uterine volume [from 31. 3 (16. 3) to 54. 0 (36. 1) mm; P < 0. 001], and the difference in the effect of both compounds on change in uterine volume at endpoint reached statistical significance (P < 0. 001). Statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were sustained for all parameters during the extension period. Early discontinuation rates, both overall and due to adverse events, were significantly lower (P < 0. 001) in the raloxifene group after 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION:Compared with continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy,</b> 6 and 12 months of raloxifene treatment do not lead to vaginal bleeding/spotting, are not associated with increased endometrial thickness or uterine volume and result in a significantly lower rate of early treatment discontinuations in asymptomatic women receiving treatment to prevent long term postmenopausal health risks. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effects of <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> {{replacement}} <b>therapy</b> on markers of endothelial function and inflammatory activity. Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting: Academic hospital. Patient(s) : Healthy postmenopausal women with an intact uterus.

40|$|The role of progestins in <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> is the {{inhibition}} of uterine epithelial cell proliferation. The Women’s Health Initiative study provided evidence for {{an increased risk}} of breast cancer in women treated with conjugated equine estrogens plus the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), compared with conjugated equine estrogens-only treatment. These findings continue to be discussed, and it remains to be clarified whether the results obtained for MPA in the Women’s Health Initiative study are directly applicable to other progestins used in hormone therapy. In this study we compared in a mouse model the effects of the synthetic progestins, MPA, and drospirenone in two major target organs: the uterus and mammary gland. As quantitative measures of progestin activity, we analyzed maintenance of pregnancy, ductal side branching in the mammary gland, and proliferation of mammary and uterine epithelial cells as well as target gene induction in both organs. The outcome {{of this study is that}} not all synthetic progestins exhibit the same effects. MPA demonstrated uterine activity and mitogenic activity in the mammary gland at the same doses. In contrast, drospirenone behaved similarly to the natural hormone, progesterone, and exhibited uterine activity at doses lower than those leading to considerable proliferative effects in the mammary gland. We hypothesize that the safety of <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> in postmenopausal women may be associated with a dissociation between the uterine and mammary gland activities of the progestin component...|$|E

40|$|Background In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) {{randomized}} trial, estrogen plus progestin increased both {{breast cancer}} incidence and mortality. In contrast, most observational studies associate estrogen plus progestin with favorable prognosis breast cancers. To address differences, {{a cohort of}} WHI observational study participants with characteristics similar to the WHI clinical trial was studied. MethodsWe identified 41 449 postmenopausal women with no prior hysterectomy and mammogram negative within 2 years who were either not hormone users (n = 25 328) or estrogen and progestin users (n = 16 121). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). All statistical tests were two-sided. ResultsAfter a mean of 11. 3 (SD = 3. 1) years, with 2236 breast cancers, incidence was higher in estrogen plus progestin users than in nonusers (0. 60 % vs 0. 42 %, annualized rate, respectively; HR = 1. 55, 95 % CI = 1. 41 to 1. 70, P <. 001). Women initiating hormone therapy closer to menopause had higher breast cancer risk with linear diminishing influence as time from menopause increased (P <. 001). Survival after breast cancer, measured from diagnosis, was similar in <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> users and nonusers (HR = 1. 03, 95 % CI = 0. 79 to 1. 35). On a population basis, there were somewhat more deaths from breast cancer, measured from cohort entry (HR = 1. 32, 95 % CI = 0. 90 to 1. 93, P =. 15), and more all-cause deaths after breast cancer (HR = 1. 65, 95 % CI = 1. 29 to 2. 12, P <. 001) in estrogen plus progestin users than in nonusers. ConclusionsConsistent with WHI randomized trial findings, estrogen plus progestin use is associated with increased breast cancer incidence.

30|$|Mammographic density {{has been}} shown to be {{influenced}} by sex hormone levels (Boyd et al. 2002 a). Reproductive factors such as nulliparity and late age at first birth which are positively associated with breast cancer risk have been shown to be positively associated with high mammographic density (Gram et al. 1995). Moreover, <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> has been associated with high mammographic density (Greendale et al. 2003; McTiernan et al. 2005). Physical activity may protect against breast cancer through hormonal mechanisms (Friedenreich & Cust 2008), either directly through influencing circulating hormones or protein levels, or indirectly by reducing body mass resulting in lower levels of circulating sex hormones (van Gils et al. 2009), or by increasing insulin sensitivity. Thus it is possible that physical activity exerts its effect on breast cancer through mammographic density. Further, women who are physically active are often leaner than women who are not, and body mass index (BMI) is inversely associated with mammographic density (Stone et al. 2009), thus complicating the association between physical activity and mammographic density.|$|E

Women were randomized to open-label continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> or no treatment, or to blind hormone therapy or placebo. The average follow-up period was 3. 6 years. Prevalence of symptoms and quality of life according to EQ- 5 D were assessed by annually mailed questionnaires.

40|$|Introduction <b>Hormone</b> {{replacement}} <b>therapy</b> (HRT) {{is commonly}} prescribed to postmenopausal women {{to improve their}} postmenopausal symptoms. Postmenopausal hormone use is associated with increase in mammographic density and increased incidence of breast pain. Mammographic density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer. Objective Our purpose was to evaluate the effects of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> on mammographic density in postmenopausal women in Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Malaysia. Material and Method An observational study was conducted {{for a period of}} 18 months. A total of 33 postmenopausal women who received <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> (containing estrogen and progesterone) were included as study subjects. Mammograms were performed at baseline and after 12 months of receiving HRT. Mammographic density was evaluated according to BIRADS classification of breast density. During follow-up, patients were also enquired about breast pain and they were asked to classify according to a specified scale. Result The categorical assessments showed that there was a significant shift in categorical classification as assessed by BIRADS categories among the postmenopausal women receiving <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> Amongst these women, 30. 3 % had increased mammographic density after treatment with HRT. There was also significant xiv association between breast pain and increase in mammographic density. Amongst the study population, 33. 3 % complained of breast pain after hormonal therapy.

METHODS: Four hundred five patients that received a dose of at least 30 Gy were considered evaluable for acute toxicity assessment. Toxicity was grouped in a few categories: general, genito-urinary, and lower gastro-intestinal. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the World Health Organisation (WHO) toxicity score and grouping together toxicity scores in different bimodal and trimodal groups. RESULTS: Overall, our data show that age, previous surgery and irradiation dose are important predictive factors for acute toxicity, but not the use of <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy.</b> Fifteen percent of patients suffered of moderate to severe acute toxicity (WHO G 3 -G 4). Life threatening toxicity was observed in six cases (1. 5 %). CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of toxicity combining in different groups the original five scores scale produced conflicting results similar to those commonly reported in literature.

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess whether endometrial cancer risk among {{long-term}} users of (1) sequential estrogen plus progestin 10 - 24 days per month exceeds that of nonusers and (2) daily estrogen plus progestin (continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy)</b> is below that of nonusers. Study Design In this population-based case-control study with 1038 endometrial cancer cases diagnosed in 1985 - 1999 and 1453 control subjects, exclusive users of a single form of hormone therapy were compared with never users of hormone therapy. Results For sequential therapy, only long-term use (= 3 D 6 years) was associated with increased risk (odds ratio, 2. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 2 - 3. 5). Continuous combined therapy was associated with decreased risk (odds ratio, 0. 59; 95 % CI, 0. 40 - 0. 88), with no increased risk among long-term users (odds ratio, 0. 77; 95 % CI, 0. 45 - 1. 3). Conclusion These results support the hypotheses that continuous combined therapy does not increase (and may decrease) endometrial cancer risk and that long-term sequential therapy can lead to a modest increased risk. However, the collective results of all studies of these questions and their clinical implications remain unclear...|$|E

40|$|Raloxifene is marketed in France for {{prevention}} of nontraumatic vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women. In animal pharmacology studies, {{it was found}} to both agonize and antagonize estrogen. The assessment file is methodologically sound but fails to answer many practical questions.

In this trial, raloxifene also reduced {{the risk of breast}} cancer. Two trials versus <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> (HRT) showed HRT had a more favourable effect on surrogate end points reflecting the risk of fracture and cardiovascular risk (changes in bone mineral density and lipid profile).

40|$|Abstract Background Very little {{data are}} {{available}} on the natural course or level of disturbance of vasomotor symptoms among middle-aged women. Using readily collected trial data we studied the persistence of vasomotor symptoms among untreated women. Methods In a trial comparing <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> to placebo or no treatment (control groups), a cohort of women aged 50 – 59 at recruitment were followed annually by questionnaires. Women in the control groups (n[*]=[*] 486) were grouped by the number of years followed, with the prevalence and severity of symptoms calculated both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results About two thirds of the women (67 %) reported vasomotor symptoms and half (46 %) bothersome symptoms at recruitment. In the cross-sectional analysis, their prevalence declined between recruitment and 1 -year follow-up (32 % bothersome symptoms) and 2 -year follow-up (27 %). Thereafter it remained about the same level. In the longitudinal analysis, there was a notable variation in the prevalence of disturbing vasomotor symptoms over time, time entering the study and the compliance to the surveys. In the two groups having most follow-up times, the proportion of women with bothersome symptoms first increased and then decreased. Conclusions There was a notable variability in the development of disturbing vasomotor symptoms over time in a selected group of women aged 50 – 59. Population-based follow-up studies of untreated women would be useful to estimate the symptom burden. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Hormone therapy (HT) is {{more and}} more universally applied in {{treatment}} of menopausal agecomplaints. Thrombotic-embolic diseases are among the most dangerous and undesirable complications of HT. Hormones can lead to pro-thrombotic changes and the risk of thrombosis and its complications may be even 3 -fold increased. Hormone therapy influences the metabolism of proteins participating in processes of clottingand lysis. The purpose of the research was to determine the long-term influence of HT on the kinetics of plasmafibrin polymerization and lysis in postmenopausal women. Material and methods: The material was fresh frozen plasma from 64 menopausal women either takingHT for 12 months (study group, n = 32) or with no treatment (controls, n = 32). For experiments thrombin wasapplied at the final concentration of 0. 5 U/ml and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) at the final concentrationof 60 ng/ml. Changes of turbidity were registered with a kinetic program for 55 minutes at λ = 415 nm. Themaximum velocity of polymerization and half time of fibrin lysis were calculated. Results: Long-term HT treatment caused changes of fibrin plasma polymerization and fibrin lysis. The parametersof coagulation were increased and significant inhibition of lysis was noted in the women taking HT. Conclusions: 12 months of oral hormone therapy resulted in increased initial velocity of clot formation andinhibition of fibrinolysis. The increased level of fibrinogen and its higher polymerization may partly explain theincrease in venous thrombosis and cardiovascular events reported after the use of <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{modifications}} on basal and post-methionine homocysteine (Hcy) levels induced by transdermal vs. oral continuous <b>combined</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>therapy</b> (HT). DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTING: Outpatient service at university hospital. PATIENT(S) : Twenty-four healthy postmenopausal women. INTERVENTION(S) : Six-month administration of transdermal (50 microg/d of E(2) and 140 - 170 microg/d of norethisterone [NET] acetate; n = 12) or oral (2 mg of E(2) and 1 mg of NET acetate; n = 12) HT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Fasting levels of Hcy, cysteine (Cys), folate, and vitamin B 12. Post-methionine Hcy concentrations. RESULT(S) : During HT, a slight decrease of fasting Hcy (8. 9 [6. 7; 15. 2] micromol/L vs. 8. 3 [4. 9; 12. 0] micromol/L) and fasting Hcy/Cys, a possible index of Hcy trans-sulfuration (0. 061 [0. 039; 0. 107] micromol/L vs. 0. 048 [0. 032; 0. 093] micromol/L) was observed. Modifications {{were similar in}} the transdermal and oral group. Net decreases of Hcy and Hcy/Cys observed during HT were related linearly to pretreatment values (r = 0. 821 and r = 0. 775, respectively), and were significant for Hcy above, but not below, 9 micromol/L. Transdermal (33. 5 [27. 5; 75. 9] micromol/L vs. 28. 4 [17. 4; 48. 9] micromol/L) or oral HT (36. 1 [17. 7; 74. 8] micromol/L vs. 29. 9 [17. 5; 50. 3] micromol/L), decreased, similarly, post-methionine Hcy levels.
