50|$|Plastic <b>casings</b> are {{generally}} made from polymers such as polyamide, polypropylene, or polyethylene. Polyamide (Nylon) plastic <b>casings</b> {{are the most}} commonly used in production of cooked sausages and hams such as luncheon meat and bologna. Polyamide <b>casings</b> come in two main varieties: Oriented and non-oriented. The oriented polyamide are shrinkable <b>casings</b> and will shrink during the cooking process thereby reducing the water loss. Non-oriented polyamide <b>casings</b> remain the same diameter during the cooking process and thereby allow for expansion of the meat during cooking. The use of polyamide <b>casings</b> has expanded recently with the advent of various varieties and structures of <b>casings</b> such as multilayer <b>casings.</b>|$|R

5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed <b>casing.</b> The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to the <b>casing.</b> Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) <b>casing,</b> the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) <b>casings,</b> in {{the form}} of stay-in-place formwork, provide an attractive alternative to conventional confinement reinforcement for concrete columns. These <b>casings</b> can fulfill multiple functions of; i) formwork, ii) confinement reinforcement, and iii) protective shell against corrosion, weathering and chemical attacks. This paper investigates the use of stay-in-place FRP formwork as concrete confinement reinforcement for HSC columns with circular and square crosssections. Large-scale specimens with 270 mm cross-sectional dimension and up to 90 MPa concrete strength, were tested under combined axial compression and incrementally increasing lateral deformation reversals. FRP <b>casings</b> were manufactured from carbon fiber sheets and epoxy resin. One of the square columns was provided with internal FRP crossties, a new technique introduced by the authors, to provide welldistributed lateral restraints along the column face, thereby improving the mechanism of confinement. The results indicate that the deformation capacity of HSC columns can be improved significantly by using FRP <b>casings.</b> The results further indicate that the confinement effectiveness of <b>casings</b> of square columns is significantly affected by the corner radius of <b>casings.</b> Confinement efficiency of these <b>casings</b> improves with the use of FRP crossties.

5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel <b>casing</b> that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The <b>casing</b> weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R.

The air-smoothed <b>casing</b> was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors.
