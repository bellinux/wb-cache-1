5|$|The {{remaining}} sections are the amendments. For reasons unknown, this constitution {{has never}} been directly updated since its adoption. The amendments are enumerated in this Article. Essentially, {{this section of the}} article records the development of the constitution through amendments.

5|$|Captain Waggett, the stuffy English {{commander}} of the local Home Guard, orders Odd to guard the cargo, but Macroon casually remarks that, by long-standing custom, a man cannot marry without hosting a party in which whisky must be served. Taking the hint, the sergeant allows himself to be overpowered, and the locals manage to offload {{a large number of}} <b>cases</b> <b>before</b> the ship goes down. Campbell had been sent to his room by his mother for a prior transgression, but is persuaded to leave and assist with the salvage by MacCodrun. This proves fortunate, as Campbell rescues the Biffer when he is trapped in the sinking freighter. The whisky also fortifies the teetotal Campbell's courage enough so he can stand up to his mother regarding Catriona.|$|E

5|$|Henry Washington Sawyer III (December 23, 1918 – July 31, 1999) was an American lawyer, {{civil rights}} activist, and Democratic politician. Born in Philadelphia, {{he served in}} World War II and {{attended}} the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Sawyer worked as a corporate lawyer but {{is best known for}} his advocacy of civil liberties, especially in First Amendment cases. In Abington School District v. Schempp and Lemon v. Kurtzman, he successfully argued <b>cases</b> <b>before</b> the Supreme Court of the United States that became the basis for all modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence. He pursued civil rights causes in Philadelphia and in the South during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. He also served a four-year term on Philadelphia City Council, where he worked for civil service reform and to increase the amount of public art in the city.|$|E
5|$|Judah Benjamin {{was sworn}} in as senator from Louisiana on March 4, 1853, at a brief meeting called just prior to President Pierce's inauguration. These new colleagues {{included}} Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia, and Sam Houston of Texas. The slavery issue was in a brief remission as much of the country wished to accept the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement. When the Senate was not in session, Benjamin remained in Washington, D.C., conducting a lucrative practice including many <b>cases</b> <b>before</b> the Supreme Court, then conveniently located in a room of the Capitol. His law partners in New Orleans took care of his firm's affairs there. About this time Benjamin sold his interest in Bellechasse, lacking the time to deal with plantation business.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{opened a}} law {{practice}} in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny {{as a partner}} in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the <b>cases</b> <b>before</b> the judge and jury. Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office {{for the first time as}} the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|The P90 has {{provisions}} for mounting {{a number of}} different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal. This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of 184mm (7.2in), a diameter of 35mm (1.4in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5lb). When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch will collect up to one hundred <b>cases</b> <b>before</b> filling.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} {{included two}} judges, {{one for the}} civil court {{and one for the}} criminal court. In the same building were the Office and Court of Appeals. The judges of the Castellania were native Maltese and dealt with cases {{that took place in the}} district of Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities. Other districts, such as those under the courts of Mdina and Rabat, followed the same model and had to adopt decisions taken at the Castellania. On three days per week, the Fiscal Prosecutor brought <b>cases</b> <b>before</b> the judges. There was also a Cancelliere, who was responsible for receiving and preserving judicial acts, registering the sentences meted out by the judges and supervising the other workers in the courts. There was a Gran Visconte (the Chief of police) who coordinated the police, and the Capitani di notte who implemented the sentences. Other workers included an official who saw that prisoners were treated fairly, those who were responsible for the archives and advocates for legal aid. Advocates were generally Italian-speaking Maltese, as most knights and foreigners considered the position as for the inferior people. A report was drafted weekly and sent to the palace of the Grand Master, informing about occurrences presented to the Castellania.|$|E

5|$|There {{were several}} border {{conflicts}} between Colombia and Peru {{in the early}} part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the Salomón-Lozano Treaty in an attempt to resolve them. As part of this treaty, the border town of Leticia and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the Amazon River. On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land as a result organised an armed takeover of Leticia. At first, the Peruvian government did not recognise the military takeover, but President of Peru Luis Sánchez Cerro decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The Peruvian Army occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations. After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their <b>cases</b> <b>before</b> the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded. In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and Putumayo Rivers, and a pledge of non-aggression.|$|E
