40|$|The paper {{revolves}} around the interaction of three ideas: (1) Because {{of the nature of}} some workplace technologies, “critical workers ” can have a disproportionately negative effect on a firm’s value added. (2) In many firms managers have little verifiable information about performance. (3) There are unobservable productiv-ity differences among individuals. In this context we study the properties of low-powered incentives, in which compensation is not directly tied to performance and all but clearly unsatisfactory employees are retained. Low-powered incentives are compared to a potentially viable high-powered alternative, a rank-order tournament with pre-announced prizes. Low-powered incentives are found to be effective in mo-tivating <b>critical</b> <b>workers,</b> while tournaments can be dysfunctional in that regard. The latter result stems from an “uneven playing field effect ” in the tournament: By encouraging high-productivity workers, tournaments disadvantage and discourage low-productivity workers.

40|$|<b>Critical</b> social <b>workers</b> seek to {{practice}} in empowering ways with marginal groups and to transform power relations in organisations and society generally. This thesis explores how Foucault’s theorising {{has been used by}} Australian <b>critical</b> social <b>workers</b> to think about power and empowerment practice. However there are many authors who contest that Foucault’s theorising is useful for any kind of liberatory thinking or practice. This makes the use of Foucault’s insights on power to re-formulate empowerment practice contestable. In this study I aim to draw distinctions between aspects of Foucault’s work that can make a contribution to empowerment practice and those aspects that do not or cannot assist <b>critical</b> social <b>workers</b> to think about empowerment. To draw these theoretical distinctions is particularly timely, as the term “empowerment” itself is used, over-used and misused and appears to have almost contradictory meanings when used by the so-called political left and right. One of the limitations of Foucault’s insights on power, especially in his early and middle work is the underdeveloped notion of human agency. This short-coming in his theorising led me to draw on the work of a political theorist, Hannah Arendt, who starts with the notion of human agency when theorising power, politics and freedom. Hannah Arendt is a strikingly original and inspirational political thinker. Arendt seeks to reclaim and revalue “the political”. Her understanding of political action is considered novel and I aim to show that it is highly relevant for <b>critical</b> social <b>workers</b> in pursuing empowerment practice. I aim to show that Arendt’s notion of political action adds much to re-thinking critical social work empowerment practice by reflecting on two case studies. The first case study is focused on empowering the poor in the 1970 s Family Centre Project by the Brotherhood of St Laurence. The second case study is about equity practitioners’ work in Victorian Higher Education institutions (1990 - 1995) aimed at increasing the participation of the disadvantaged in further education. Both case studies aimed to alter and transform power relations and serve as historic specific events for thinking with Arendt and Foucault about power, politics, identity, participation and freedom...|$|R
40|$|<b>Critical</b> social <b>workers</b> now {{contend that}} an individual’s {{everyday}} living both shapes and {{is shaped by}} overarching social structures and discourses. As such, the subjectivity of the individual is considered an axis on which the existing social order can be either perpetuated or transformed. Transformations {{on the level of}} the individual are therefore argued to contribute to transformations on the levels of larger societal arrangements. For this reason, many critical social work theorists today argue that clinical social work practice with individuals is an essential component of effecting egalitarian forms of social change. Yet, <b>critical</b> social <b>workers</b> also widely acknowledge that clinical social work theory is currently a relatively underdeveloped area within critical social work literature. Contemporary relational psychoanalytic theory offers highly textured accounts of the interdependence of sociopolitical arrangements and cultural discourses, on the one hand, and the subjectivity of the individual, on the other, and has much to contribute to critical social workers’ current efforts to overcome oppressive relations on personal, interpersonal, and ultimately, societal levels...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{learning}} tasks require human input in labeling massive data. For this labeling {{and because of the}} quantity of the data, crowdsourcing has become very crucial. The collected data though are usually low quality as workers are not appropriately incentivized to put effort. Significant research has focused on designing appropriate incentive schemes but do not capture the full range of tasks that appear in practice. Moreover, even if incentives are theoretically aligned noise in the data can still exist because it is hard to model exactly how workers will behave. In this work, we provide a generic approach that is based on verification of only few worker reports to guarantee high quality learning outcomes for various optimization objectives. Our method, identifies small sets of <b>critical</b> <b>workers</b> and verifies their reports. We show that many problems only need poly(1 /ε) verifications, to ensure that the output of the computation is at most a factor of (1 ±ε) away from the truth. For any given instance, we provide an instance optimal solution that verifies the minimum number of workers possible to approximately certify correctness. In case this certification step fails, a misreporting worker will be identified. Removing these workers and repeating until success, guarantees that the result will be correct and will depend only on the verified workers. Surprisingly, as we show, for several computation tasks more efficient methods are possible. These methods always guarantee that the produced result is not affected by the misreporting workers, since any misreport that affects the output will be detected and verified...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2004, a {{compulsory}} National Standard for the Australian rail {{industry was}} introduced outlining health standards that drivers must meet {{to be deemed}} fit to drive. AIM: To examine the trend in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) risk factors in train drivers between 2004 and 2009, following {{the introduction of a}} National Standard. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of IHD risk factors of drivers (n = 386) of an Australian train company, who underwent health assessments between February 2004 and November 2009, was performed. The Framingham Score for 10 -year risk of coronary artery disease, body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking, diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol were compared with that of controls at these two time periods. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in the rates of 10 -year coronary heart disease risk/year (OR = 0. 47; 95 % CI 0. 19, 0. 75) in the train drivers compared with the control population. This was driven by a reduction in the rate of cigarette smoking (OR = 0. 87; 95 % CI 0. 79, 0. 96) and total cholesterol (OR = - 0. 05; 95 % CI - 0. 09, 0. 003) and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels (OR = 0. 02; 95 % CI 0. 006, 0. 03) between groups over time. This was despite an increase in BMI (OR = 0. 10; 95 % CI 0. 01, 0. 19). Conclusion: Following the introduction of a National Standard for drivers in Australia, there has been a significant improvement in the health of drivers. Such a programme may have a significant impact in this group of safety <b>critical</b> <b>workers.</b> K. L. Ng, S. Quinn, T. K. Gill, C. Hill and E. M. Shanaha...|$|E

Furthermore, no one-size-fits-all candidate exists that is equally preferred in both technology fields. HR decision makers in mechanical element firms prefer specialists to generalists, whereas those in clean technology attach special importance to a candidate's orientation towards environmental concerns and sustainability...|$|R

40|$|This {{proposal}} {{is intended to}} examine human trustworthiness as a key component for countering insider threats {{in the arena of}} corporate personnel security. Employees with access and authority have the most potential to cause damage to that information, to organizational reputation, or to the operational stability of the organization. I am interested in studying the basic mechanisms of how to detect changes in the trustworthiness of an individual who holds a key position in an organization, by observing overt behavior ??? including communications behavior ??? over time. Rotter (1980) defines trust as a generalized expectancy - held by an individual or a group - which the communications of another (individual or group) can be relied upon. In this investigation, ???trustworthiness??? is defined as the degree of correspondence between communicated intentions and behavioral outcomes that are observed over time (Rotter, 1980 & 1967). The degree of correspondence between the target???s words and actions remain reliable, ethical and consistent, which its degree of fluctuation does not exceed observer???s expectations over time (Hardin, 1996). To be able to tell if the employee is trustworthy is thus determined by the subjective perceptions from individuals in his/her social network that have direct business functional connections, and thus the opportunity to repeatedly observe the correspondence between communications and behavior. This study adopts the concept of correlating data-centric attributions, as observed changes in behavior from human perceptions; as analogous to ???sensors??? on the network. The Attribution Theory is adopted in the experimental situations (the ???leader???s dilemma??? game) to extract indirect perceptions of trustworthiness toward a <b>critical</b> <b>worker</b> over time in a group dynamics (Kelley, 1973). The principles of distinctiveness, consensus and consistancy are applied in these experimental situations...|$|R
