5|$|Although Ilaiyaraaja uses a {{range of}} complex <b>compositional</b> techniques, he often {{sketches}} out the basic melodic ideas for films in a very spontaneous fashion.|$|E
5|$|Leontovych's move to Tulchyn {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a period of <b>compositional</b> maturity and major artistic achievements {{in the life of the}} composer.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{influence}} plus their academic training from Rimsky-Korsakov, especially in the cases of Anton Arensky and Glazunov, these composers combined the best <b>compositional</b> techniques of The Five and Tchaikovsky in their music. Often, however, composers in this group fell back on two sources—musical clichés and mannerisms handed down from The Five, and academic <b>compositional</b> techniques learned at the Conservatory. Also, the eclecticism about which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote tended to overpower originality in many works, including those of Glazunov. Nevertheless, the Belyayev circle continued to influence the development of Russian music well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{painters}} {{are also}} inspired by El Greco's art. Kysa Johnson used El Greco's {{paintings of the}} Immaculate Conception as the <b>compositional</b> framework for some of her works, and the master's anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's portraits.|$|E
5|$|Lightning Bolt {{are known}} for their guerrilla-style live performances, where they {{typically}} play on the ground rather than a stage, with the crowd gathered around them. The band's sound is typically loud and aggressive, though the group cites composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra as <b>compositional</b> influences.|$|E
5|$|Lutosławski's {{life as well}} as {{detailed}} and thorough discussion of Lutosławski's music and <b>compositional</b> techniques can be found in both Stucky (1981) and Bodman Rae (1994, 1996, 1999), but also in Witold Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw (2013) by the National Institute of Fryderyk Chopin.|$|E
5|$|The <b>compositional</b> {{process of}} the last sonatas can be studied owing to the almost {{complete}} survival of their manuscripts. According to these, the sonatas were written in two stages – a preliminary sketch (the first draft) and a full, mature final version (the fair copy).|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} systematicity and {{productivity}} {{depend on the}} <b>compositional</b> structure of language means that language has a combinatorial semantics. If thought also has such a combinatorial semantics, then {{there must be a}} language of thought.|$|E
5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to {{her ideas}} about the role of a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its <b>compositional</b> skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E
5|$|Although rather solitary and introspective by nature, Elgar {{thrived in}} Worcester's musical circles. He {{played in the}} violins at the Worcester and Birmingham Festivals, and one great {{experience}} was to play Dvořák's Symphony No. 6 and Stabat Mater under the composer's baton. Elgar regularly played the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and <b>compositional</b> skills.|$|E
5|$|Bloc Party {{aimed to}} create an album that appealed to {{followers}} of different musical genres. Building on the arrangements in their demo songs recorded in 2004, the band members moulded tracks largely through live takes during the Silent Alarm studio sessions. The <b>compositional</b> focus was on rhythm and the drum and bass parts, while lyricist Kele Okereke's writing examined the feelings and hopes of young adults, including views on global politics. Following the album's completion, Bloc Party embarked on promotional tours before its release.|$|E
5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex <b>compositional</b> approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style {{emerged in the}} United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E
5|$|Experimental pop is {{pop music}} that cannot be {{categorized}} within traditional musical boundaries or which attempts to push elements of existing popular forms into new areas. It may incorporate experimental {{techniques such as}} musique concrète, aleatoric music, or eclecticism into pop contexts. Often, the <b>compositional</b> process {{involves the use of}} electronic production effects to manipulate sounds and arrangements, and its settings may combine sound-based work and note-based work, though not always simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Given that Ganymede is {{completely}} differentiated {{and has a}} metallic core, its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated {{in a similar fashion}} to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior. The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by <b>compositional</b> convection in the core, if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.|$|E
5|$|Hu Zhengyan was a noted seal-carver, {{producing}} personal seals {{for numerous}} dignitaries. His style {{was rooted in}} the classical seal script of the Han dynasty, and he followed the Huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary He Zhen. Hu's calligraphy, although balanced and with a clear <b>compositional</b> structure, is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed. Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu {{did not make a}} regular practice of artificially aging his seals.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Ilaiyaraaja began a music {{course with}} Professor Dhanraj in Madras (now Chennai), which {{included}} {{an overview of}} Western classical music, <b>compositional</b> training in techniques such as counterpoint, and study in instrumental performance. Ilaiyaraaja specialized in classical guitar and had taken a course in it at the Trinity College of Music, London.|$|E
5|$|MFGM is a {{structurally}} complex bioactive milk component, {{found in}} human milk {{as well as}} the milk of other mammalian species. The MFGM in human milk contains many bioactive components with diverse functions and has been linked to cognitive and health benefits to infants. Some <b>compositional</b> differences are reported to exist between species, but bovine MFGM, the best-studied non-human source, generally contains a lipid and protein composition, which {{is similar to that of}} human MFGM.|$|E
5|$|Ramprasad is {{credited}} with creating a new <b>compositional</b> form that combined the Bengali folk style of Baul music with classical melodies and kirtan. The new style took root in Bengali culture with many poet-composers combining folk and raga-based melodies, mixing every common style of music from classical to semi-classical and folk. His songs are sung today, with a popular collection—Ramprasadi Sangit ("Songs of Ramprasad")—sold at Shakta temples and pithas in Bengal.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's last sonatas are {{sometimes}} compared to Mozart's last symphonies, as unique <b>compositional</b> achievements: both consist of trilogies with one tragic, minor-key work, and two major-key works; both were created during an astoundingly {{short period of}} time; and both creating a culmination of the composer's lifetime achievement in their respective genres.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's last sonatas mark a {{distinct}} change of <b>compositional</b> style from his earlier piano sonatas, with several important differences. The typical movement length has increased, {{due to the}} use of long, lyrical, fully rounded-off, ternary-form themes, the insertion of development-like passages within expositions, and the lengthening of the development section proper. Texturally, the orchestral grandeur of the middle-period sonatas gives way to a more intimate writing that resembles a string ensemble. New textures appear in the last sonatas – scale-like melodic elements, free counterpoint, free fantasia, and simple accompanimental patterns such as Alberti bass, repeated chords, and ostinati; the orchestral unison texture, abundant in the preceding sonatas, has disappeared. The harmonic language has also changed: more distant key relationships are explored, longer modulatory excursions, more major/minor shifts of mode, and more chromatic and diverse harmonic progressions and modulations, using elements such as the diminished seventh chord. In general, the last sonatas seem to enact a return to an earlier, more individual and intimate Schubertian style, here combined with the <b>compositional</b> craftsmanship of Schubert's later works.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{references}} {{a number}} of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional <b>compositional</b> formulas. Pictorial artifice {{gives way to the}} epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, as is evident in Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (18181819) and Eugène Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{focuses on}} Morricone's lesser-known soundtrack work, with Ipecac founder Mike Patton consciously wishing to distance it from similar compilations. Released on October18, 2005, Crime and Dissonance has been met with favorable reviews by critics. The album has attracted comments on Morricone's experimental and innovative <b>compositional</b> style, often {{in contrast to}} the spare-sounding westerns he is known for.|$|E
5|$|The flank vents have erupted {{andesite}} and dacite, {{belonging to}} a potassium-poor calcalkaline series. Such a limited range of composition is typical for these volcanoes but might reflect {{the small amount of}} research conducted on them. Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to <b>compositional</b> data. Holocene eruptions have near-identical composition. Minerals found in Burney rocks include amphibole, plagioclase and pyroxene; foreign components include clinopyroxene and olivine crystals as well as granite xenoliths stemming from the Patagonian batholith.|$|E
5|$|The frescoes {{inside the}} church are {{commonly}} dated to the 14th–15th century, though they follow a standard <b>compositional</b> model which had been established in Bulgarian church decoration since the 13th century. Unusually, most of the captions which accompany the images are in Byzantine Greek, though a few are in Old Church Slavonic. In terms of style, the murals {{have much in common}} with churches from the southwestern Bulgarian lands.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{follow the}} calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, {{containing}} silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava rocks are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green to gray in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, hornblende, plagioclase and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, hornblende, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from porphyritic to vitreophyritic. Andesites {{are more common}} in Pliocene rocks, and Pleistocene rocks tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a <b>compositional</b> trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such <b>compositional</b> trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E
5|$|Wolfgang was {{qualified}} by {{his skills}} {{at the keyboard}} and violin, and by his <b>compositional</b> experience, for a post as Kapellmeister; but at 17 he was too young. He therefore remained in Colloredo's employ at the Salzburg court, increasingly discontent, until his dismissal from the Archbishop's retinue during its stay in Vienna, in 1781. Leopold, unpromoted from his rank of vice-Kapellmeister, remained with the court {{until his death in}} 1787.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This <b>compositional</b> theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of <b>compositional</b> {{constraint}} on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Compositional</b> {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Compositional</b> mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's <b>compositional</b> skills.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1890s, Janáček led the {{mainstream}} of folklorist activity in Moravia and Silesia, using a repertoire of folksongs and dances in orchestral and piano arrangements. Most of his achievements in this field were published in 1899–1901 though his interest in folklore would be lifelong. His <b>compositional</b> work was still influenced by the declamatory, dramatic style of Smetana and Dvořák. He expressed very negative opinions on German neo-classicism and especially on Wagner in the Hudební listy journal, which he founded in 1884. The death of his second child, Vladimír, in 1890 was followed by an attempted opera, Beginning of the Romance (1891) and the cantata Amarus (1897).|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring <b>compositional</b> tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|Gustav Theodore Holst (born Gustavus Theodore von Holst; 21 September 1874– 25 May 1934) was an English composer, {{arranger}} and teacher. Best {{known for}} his orchestral suite The Planets, he composed {{a large number of}} other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive <b>compositional</b> style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as Maurice Ravel, led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.|$|E
5|$|Handel's {{earliest}} opera compositions, in the German style, {{date from}} his Hamburg years, 1704–06, {{under the influence}} of Johann Mattheson. In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his <b>compositional</b> skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.|$|E
