5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E
25|$|Serna's {{unit was}} ordered to begin an advance towards the Meuse River and Argonne Forest in France. When his unit arrived at St. Mihiel, they {{encountered}} a German machine gunner who killed 12 soldiers. Serna <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> to the machine gunner's left flank. Even though his helmet was hit twice with bullets, Serna {{was able to get}} close enough to throw four grenades into the nest. Eight Germans surrendered and the rest in the nest were dead.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November 1944, Sepoy Bhandari Ram's platoon {{was pinned}} down by machine-gun fire. Although wounded he <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> to a Japanese light machine-gun {{in full view}} of the enemy and was wounded again, but {{continued}} crawling to within 5 yards of his objective. He then threw a grenade into the position, killing the gunner and two others. This action inspired his platoon to rush and capture the enemy position. Only then did he allow his wounds to be dressed.|$|E

25|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, then-Lieutenant Arnold {{made his way}} to Pearl Harbor under fire. After quite a bit of trouble convincing the crew of a {{whaleboat}} to take him to Ford Island, his normal duty station, he finally got to the island. There, {{during the middle of the}} first wave’s attack, he fired up the only flyable Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter on the island. A ground crew member <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> on the wing telling him, “You can’t take this airplane!” “The heck I can’t, get off my wing!” Arnold replied. “But it doesn’t have any ammunition!” came the response.|$|E
25|$|Legere {{was convicted}} {{in the murder of}} shopkeeper John Glendenning, of Black River Bridge, New Brunswick, which {{occurred}} on the evening of June 21, 1986. After cutting the power, Legere and his accomplices Todd Matchett and Scott Curtis, broke into the elderly couple's store. After repeatedly beating John and his wife Mary, the trio fled the scene. Mary then discovered her husband (who had been beaten to death); she <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> the stairs to the phone and dialed 911. The dispatcher spoke with Mary on the phone until the emergency forces arrived. Police tracked down the three and arrested them. Matchett pleaded guilty to murdering John Glendenning and brutally beating his wife Mary; Curtis and Legere were convicted at trial.|$|E
2500|$|That night, {{a warrior}} <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> {{and set the}} {{blockhouse}} on fire. [...] When the sentries opened fire on the arsonist, the 600-strong Indian war party attacked {{the west side of}} the fort. [...] Taylor ordered the fort's surgeon and a handful of defenders to control the fire. [...] The blockhouse, which was attached to the barracks, had a store of whiskey, which soon ignited, and the fire raged out of control. [...] Taylor admitted in his report that the situation looked hopeless, and two of his healthy men fled the fort. [...] Warning the fort that [...] "Taylor never surrenders!", the captain organized a bucket brigade to fight the fire before it destroyed the fort's picket walls. [...] One woman, Julia Lambert, even lowered herself down into the fort's well to fill buckets more quickly.|$|E

2500|$|For the {{coverage}} of the moon landing itself, ITV used computer captions such as [...] "Armstrong taking manual control" [...] and [...] "Touchdown, The Eagle has landed". The captions were made by listening to the Houston-Lunar Module talkback, then entering in computer codes, which translated the Eagle's speed and altitude into on-screen information. Paul Haney described the moonwalk on {{the coverage}} as [...] "the greatest thing to happen since fish <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> on the beach and survived." [...] On the landing he remarked the landing was only four miles off the point projected [...] "which is pretty good for Government work". Reminiscing in 1999, ITN producer David Nicholson remembered it as [...] "perhaps the most exciting twelve minutes I've ever seen on television. It was a hugely thrilling moment. I remember in the ITN control room there was a gasp from the production staff." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Crazy Horse and I {{left the}} crowd and rode down along the river. We came to a ravine, then we {{followed}} up the gulch to {{a place in the}} rear of the soldiers that were making the stand on the hill. Crazy Horse gave his horse to me to hold along with my horse. He <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> the ravine to see where he could see the soldiers. He shot them as fast as he could load his gun. They fell off their horses as fast as he could shoot." [...] When they found they were being killed so fast, the ones that were left broke and ran as fast as their horses could go to some other soldiers that were further along the ridge toward Custer. Here they tried to make another stand and fired some shots, but we rushed them along the ridge where Custer was. Then they made another stand (the third) and rallied a few minutes. Then they went along the ridge and got with Custer’s men." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 25 September, Obukhov was {{appointed}} commander of a pontoon boat for the Dnieper crossing. He first reached the river's west bank with 25 soldiers. While still crossing the river, the pontoon came under German fire while 100 {{meters from the}} shore. Bullet holes were causing the pontoon to sink when Obukhov reportedly began patching holes with overcoats and caps. He reportedly ordered the soldiers {{to do the same}} {{and they were able to}} successfully cross [...] the river, keeping the pontoon afloat. During the landing, the infantry officer commanding the soldiers was wounded when German troops opened fire with automatic weapons and Obukhov reportedly replaced him in command. Obukhov organized machine gun fire and was able to neutralize the German positions. Another German machine gun was firing from a bunker, preventing the crossing of more pontoon boats. Obukhov reportedly <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> to the bunker and destroyed the machine gun, killing its crew with two anti-tank grenades. Obukhov [...] then repaired his pontoon and reportedly managed to cross the Dnieper again, ferrying two antitank guns and 50 soldiers.|$|E

2500|$|At Bois de St. Guillain, between Allemant and the Laffaux–Pinon ravine, at [...] the 140th Regiment {{was stopped}} by fire from machine-gun nests, until French tanks <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> and knocked them out. The advance was resumed by the right wing, as the left flank units halted on a line from Vallée Guerbette, to a point [...] north of Allemant. The attackers on the right, astride the St. Guillain and Laffaux–Pinon ravines, reduced St. Guillain Farm and {{assaulted}} the second German position, over-running Giraffe and Lizard trenches by noon in a rainstorm. Except for Bois 160, south of Vaudesson, where the garrison held out until {{the early hours of}} 24 October and for some isolated quarries, the German position south of the [...] and east of the Allemant ravine had fallen. The 27th Division faced Pinon and covered Vaudesson, which had been secured by XXI Corps. XIV Corps had pivoted on its left flank to a line perpendicular with the start line. The Germans on the Mont des Singes and in Pinon with the Ailette at their backs, were menaced from the south and the west. XIV Corps had also taken [...] several guns, machine-guns and trench mortars.|$|E
2500|$|As {{reptiles}} {{in general}} are oviparous, {{until the end of}} the twentieth century it had been seen as possible that smaller plesiosaurs may have <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> on a beach to lay eggs, like modern turtles. Their strong limbs and a flat underside seemed to have made this feasible. This method was, for example, defended by Halstead. However, as those limbs no longer had functional elbow or knee joints and the underside by its very flatness would have generated a lot of friction, already in the nineteenth century it was hypothesised that plesiosaurs had been viviparous. Besides, it was hard to conceive how the largest species, as big as whales, could have survived a beaching. Fossil finds of ichthyosaur embryos showed that at least one group of marine reptiles had born live young. The first to claim that similar embryos had been found with plesiosaurs was Harry Govier Seeley, who reported in 1887 to have acquired a nodule with four to eight tiny skeletons. In 1896, he described this discovery in more detail. If authentic, the embryos of plesiosaurs would have been very small like those of ichthyosaurs. However, in 1982 Richard Anthony Thulborn showed that Seeley had been deceived by a [...] "doctored" [...] fossil of a nest of crayfish.|$|E
2500|$|Jourgensen has {{subsequently}} expressed extreme {{dislike for}} Ministry's With Sympathy-era output. He often refuses {{to talk about}} the album directly. He has provided different (and sometimes conflicting) explanations for his antipathy, saying in one interview that after signing his contract with Arista, all artistic control of Ministry was [...] "handed over" [...] to other writers and producers. In his autobiography, Jourgensen gave a different explanation, saying that he was pressured by Arista management into producing his songs in the then-popular synthpop style, as a means of making them more commercially palatable. However, in the 1980s, Jourgensen said that when he discovered hardcore music, his musical direction simply changed, and he reiterated this point in 2012. Additionally, video of local concerts Ministry performed in Chicago 1 year or more previous to their signing with Arista show the band dressed in [...] "new wave" [...] styles and playing new wave and synthpop music. Jourgensen assumes a false English accent for all of the songs, for which he also later expressed great disliking, though his ex-wife Patty Marsh stated in a 2013 interview [...] "...the English accent thing was more an homage to the bands he loved than anything else. He was not trying to come off as British. The Stones used a southern accent and no one <b>crawled</b> <b>up</b> their ass for it.|$|E
