5|$|<b>Caradoc</b> {{was back}} in action by 17 November when she participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. This was a {{successful}} attempt by the British to intercept German minesweeping forces that were clearing British minefields in the North Sea. The 6th LCS screened the two light s of the 1st Cruiser Squadron during the battle together with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron. The British lost the German minesweepers in the smoke screen laid by the four German light cruisers and pursued the latter ships {{for most of the}} battle, although they inflicted little damage in the poor visibility caused by the German smoke. <b>Caradoc,</b> being the rear ship in her squadron, fired the least. She did not score any hits on her opponents, nor did they damage her.|$|E
5|$|<b>Caradoc,</b> {{the second}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was ordered in December 1915 as part of the 1915–16 War Programme.

She was assigned to the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron (LCS) of the Grand Fleet together with three other C-class cruisers. With her sister , she ran aground on Fair Isle on 15 August, but both ships were successfully refloated.|$|E

5|$|After Caesar's {{preliminary}} low-scale {{invasions of}} Britain, the Romans invaded in force in 43 AD, forcing their way inland through several battles against British tribes, including the Battle of the Medway, the Battle of the Thames, the Battle of Caer <b>Caradoc</b> and the Battle of Mona. Following a general uprising {{in which the}} Britons sacked Colchester, St Albans and London, the Romans suppressed the rebellion in the Battle of Watling Street {{and went on to}} push as far north as central Scotland in the Battle of Mons Graupius. Tribes in modern-day Scotland and Northern England repeatedly rebelled against Roman rule and two military bases were established in Britannia to protect against rebellion and incursions from the north, from which Roman troops built and manned Hadrian's Wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{story to}} feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also {{appears in the}} late 12th-century Life of <b>Caradoc,</b> a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century Perlesvaus, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing {{to come to the}} same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.|$|E
5|$|The troublemaker Bricriu once incites three heroes, Cú Chulainn, Conall Cernach and Lóegaire Búadach, {{to compete}} for the champion's portion at his feast. In every test that is set Cú Chulainn comes out top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire will accept the result. Cú Roí mac Dáire of Munster settles it by visiting each {{in the guise of a}} hideous churl and {{challenging}} them to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them in return. Conall and Lóegaire both behead Cú Roí, who picks up his head and leaves, but when the time comes for him to return they flee. Only Cú Chulainn is brave and honourable enough to submit himself to Cú Roí's axe; Cú Roí spares him and he is declared champion. This beheading challenge appears in later literature, most notably in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Other examples include the 13th century French Life of <b>Caradoc</b> and the English romances The Turke and Gowin, and Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle.|$|E

A cognate name in Modern English is Jennifer, from Cornish.|$|R
50|$|The 16th century Welsh antiquary David Powel {{claimed his}} Historie of Cambria was a {{continuation}} of this chronicle. At {{the end of the}} 18th century Iolo Morganwg wrote what he claimed was <b>Caradoc's</b> lost chronicle, Brut Aberpergwm.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae. In particular, Arthur features {{in a number of}} well-known vitae ("Lives") of post-Roman saints, none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources (the earliest probably dates from the 11th century). According to the Life of Saint Gildas, written in the early 12th century by <b>Caradoc</b> of Llancarfan, Arthur is said to have killed Gildas' brother Hueil and to have rescued his wife Gwenhwyfar from Glastonbury. In the Life of Saint Cadoc, written around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan, the saint gives protection to a man who killed three of Arthur's soldiers, and Arthur demands a herd of cattle as wergeld for his men. Cadoc delivers them as demanded, but when Arthur takes possession of the animals, they turn into bundles of ferns. Similar incidents are described in the medieval biographies of Carannog, Padarn, and Eufflam, probably written around the 12th century. A less obviously legendary account of Arthur appears in the Legenda Sancti Goeznovii, which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century (although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century). Also important are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury's De Gestis Regum Anglorum and Herman's De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudensis, which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return, a theme that is often revisited in post-Galfridian folklore.|$|E

25|$|The genealogies {{from the}} 13th-century Mostyn MS. 117 assert that Arthur {{is the son}} of Uthyr, the son of Custennin, the son of Cynfawr, the son of Tudwal, the son of Morfawr, the son of Eudaf, the son of Cadwr the son of Cynan, the son of <b>Caradoc,</b> the son of Bran, the son of Llŷr.|$|E
25|$|Chrétien de Troyes tells {{yet another}} version of Guinevere's abduction, this time by Meleagant (whose name is {{possibly}} derived from Melwas) in Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart. The abduction sequence is largely a reworking of that recorded in <b>Caradoc's</b> work, but here the queen's rescuer is not Arthur (or Yder) but Lancelot, whose adultery with the queen is dealt with {{for the first time}} in this poem. It has been suggested that Chrétien invented their affair to supply Guinevere with a courtly extramarital lover. Mordred could not be used as his reputation was beyond saving, and Yder had been forgotten entirely.|$|R

It was difficult to believe her Miltoun's sister. It was difficult to believe any of those four young <b>Caradocs</b> related. The grave ascetic Miltoun, wrapped in the garment of his spirit; mild, domestic, strait-laced Agatha; Bertie, muffled, shrewd, and steely; and this frank, joyful conquering Barbara--the range was wide.|$|R

The efforts of the Merchant to try and swindle the kingdom, as well as King <b>Caradoc's</b> occasional spending splurges can at times prove to be great sources of stress for him.|$|R

60|$|That which disconcerted all who had {{dealings}} with Miltoun was the discovery made soon or late, {{that they could}} not be sure how anything would strike him. In his mind, as in his face, there was a certain regularity, and then--impossible to say exactly where--it would, shoot off and twist round a corner. This was the legacy no doubt of the hard-bitten individuality, which had brought to the front so many of his ancestors; for in Miltoun was the blood not only of the <b>Caradocs</b> and Fitz-Harolds, but of most other prominent families in the kingdom, all of whom, in those ages before money made the man, must have had a forbear conspicuous by reason of qualities, not always fine, but always poignant.|$|R

5000|$|He {{may have}} been the subject of a number of Elizabethan satires such as Thomas Nashe's Lenten Stuffe, Ben Jonson's Every Man in his Humour, and {{may have been}} the model of Shakespeare's Falstaff, who was {{originally}} given the name [...] "Oldcastle". Sir John Oldcastle was an ancestor of Lord Cobham. Though Falstaff is more likely modelled on his father William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham (also descended from John Oldcastle) who was married to Frances Newton, whose family name was originally Caradock; referenced in 2 Henry IV when Falstaff sings [...] "The Boy and the Mantle," [...] a ballad in which Sir <b>Caradoc's</b> wife comes away with her fidelity and reputation intact (McKeen 1981). This could point to William Brooke, being married to a Caradock such as the Sir Cacadoc in the ballad sung by Falstaff, as the model for Falstaff rather than Henry, being the son of a Caradock.|$|R
25|$|Thomas <b>Caradoc</b> Rose Price CB (21 October 1842 – 3 July 1911), often {{known as}} Colonel Tom Price, was an Australian soldier, and acting commandant of the Commonwealth Military Forces in Victoria in 1902. Joining the British Indian Army {{in his early}} years, he served 20 years in India before {{returning}} to Australia. In 1885, he raised the Victorian Mounted Rifles, and was instrumental in establishing the concept of light horse units within the Australian Army. In 1900, he led a Victorian contingent during the Second Boer War, and was the only Australian officer during that war to command a force of British regulars. He remained in the Australian military after the war, serving in Queensland until 1904 when he was medically discharged. He retired to Victoria again and died in 1911 {{at the age of}} 68.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war on 3 September 1939, <b>Caradoc</b> was at Portland Harbour and was reassigned to operate off the North American coast shortly afterwards. The following month, she ferried £ two million of gold to Halifax, Nova Scotia. On 23 October the light cruiser [...] and the Canadian destroyer [...] spotted the German oil tanker Emmy Friedrich in the Yucatán Channel. When <b>Caradoc</b> stopped the ship, the Germans scuttled her to prevent her capture. On 11 December 1940 the German blockade runner Rhein was intercepted by the Dutch sloop Van Kinsbergen west of the Florida Strait. Rhein was set on fire by her own crew to prevent her capture and the wreck was sunk later that day by <b>Caradoc.</b> The ship was refitted in New York City between 28 October 1941–26 February 1942 where her [...] "pom-pom"s were exchanged for five [...] Oerlikon light AA guns on single mounts. In addition <b>Caradoc</b> was fitted with a Type 271 and Type 290 surface-search radars.|$|E
500|$|By April 1920, <b>Caradoc</b> was {{deployed}} off {{the coast}} of Georgia supporting the Volunteer Army against the Bolsheviks and continued to do so through May. She was withdrawn from Georgia in June in response to the Greek offensives during the Greco-Turkish War and arrived in Istanbul on 18 June. During the Chanak Crisis of September 1922, the ship was deployed to watch the Gulf of Smyrna. <b>Caradoc</b> participated in the withdrawal of ships from Turkish waters in December 1922 as the Treaty of Lausanne that ended the war was being negotiated. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until December 1926 when she was briefly transferred to the China Station. Around 1924–26, she was fitted with a pair of 2-pounder (40mm) Mk II [...] "pom-pom" [...] AA guns. After returning home, <b>Caradoc</b> began a lengthy refit from 15 September 1927 to October 1928 when she was assigned to the North America and West Indies Station. The ship remained there until February 1930 when she returned to the UK and was briefly placed in reserve. <b>Caradoc</b> was recommissioned in July for service on the China Station with the 5th Cruiser Squadron. She returned home four years later and was again placed in reserve on 17 October 1934.|$|E
60|$|Still {{we have a}} few indubitable Caers in England itself {{surviving}} to our own day. Most of {{them are}} not far from the Welsh border, {{as in the case of}} the two Caer <b>Caradocs,</b> in Shropshire, crowned by ancient British fortifications. Others, however, lie further within the true English pale, though always in districts which long preserved the Welsh speech, at least among the lower classes of the population. The earthwork overhanging Bath bears to this day its ancient British title of Caer Badon. An old history written in the monastery of Malmesbury describes that town as Caer Bladon, and speaks of a Caer Dur in the immediate neighbourhood. There still remains a Caer Riden on the line of the Roman wall in the Lothians. Near Aspatria, in Cumberland, stands a mouldering Roman camp known even now as Caer Moto. In Carvoran, Northumberland, the first syllable has undergone a slight contraction, but may still be readily recognised. The Carr-dyke in Norfolk seems to me to be referable to a similar origin.|$|R
60|$|From {{the legendary}} sword of that Welsh {{chieftain}} who by {{an act of}} high, rewarded treachery had passed into the favour of the conquering William, and received, with the widow of a Norman, many lands in Devonshire, to the Cup purchased for Geoffrey Caradoc; present Earl of Valleys, by subscription of his Devonshire tenants on the occasion of his marriage with the Lady Gertrude Semmering--no insignia were absent, save the family portraits in the gallery of Valleys House in London. There was even an ancient duplicate of that yellow tattered scroll royally, reconfirming lands and title to John, the most distinguished of all the <b>Caradocs,</b> who had unfortunately neglected to be born in wedlock, by one of those humorous omissions {{to be found in the}} genealogies of most old families. Yes, it was there, almost cynically hung in a corner; for this incident, though no doubt a burning question in the fifteenth century, was now but staple for an ironical little tale, in view of the fact that descendants of John's 'own' brother Edmund were undoubtedly to be found among the cottagers of a parish not far distant.|$|R
60|$|The Marchioness of Steyne was of {{the renowned}} and ancient family of the Caerlyons, Marquises of Camelot, who have {{preserved}} the old faith ever since {{the conversion of the}} venerable Druid, their first ancestor, and whose pedigree goes far beyond the date of the arrival of King Brute in these islands. Pendragon is the title of the eldest son of the house. The sons have been called Arthurs, Uthers, and <b>Caradocs,</b> from immemorial time. Their heads have fallen in many a loyal conspiracy. Elizabeth chopped off the head of the Arthur of her day, who had been Chamberlain to Philip and Mary, and carried letters between the Queen of Scots and her uncles the Guises. A cadet of the house was an officer of the great Duke and distinguished in the famous Saint Bartholomew conspiracy. During the whole of Mary's confinement, the house of Camelot conspired in her behalf. It was as much injured by its charges in fitting out an armament against the Spaniards, {{during the time of the}} Armada, as by the fines and confiscations levied on it by Elizabeth for harbouring of priests, obstinate recusancy, and popish misdoings. A recreant of James's time was momentarily perverted from his religion by the arguments of that great theologian, and the fortunes of the family somewhat restored by his timely weakness. But the Earl of Camelot, of the reign of Charles, returned to the old creed of his family, and they continued to fight for it, and ruin themselves for it, as long as there was a Stuart left to head or to instigate a rebellion.|$|R
