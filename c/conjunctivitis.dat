5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and <b>conjunctivitis</b> from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, <b>conjunctivitis</b> (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
5|$|Ectropion is {{the outward}} rolling of the eyelid, which {{abnormally}} exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial <b>conjunctivitis</b> or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal <b>conjunctivitis,</b> and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E
5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, <b>conjunctivitis,</b> and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local erythema, edema, blisters, eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as <b>conjunctivitis</b> and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as <b>conjunctivitis,</b> keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
5|$|As {{the reigning}} 200 m {{champion}} {{at both the}} World Youth and World Junior championships, Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the Senior World Championships in Paris. He beat all comers at the 200 m in the World Championship trials. Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted that, {{even if he did}} not make the final, he would consider setting a personal best a success. However, he suffered a bout of <b>conjunctivitis</b> before the event, and it ruined his training schedule. Realising {{that he would not be}} in peak condition, the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals, on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced. Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity, but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead. Even though he missed the World Championships, Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on the strength of his junior record-equalling run.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun {{declared}} the entire {{of the country}} excluding Seoul and Incheon as special disaster areas, after touring the storm damage in Busan. The government provided tax breaks and allocated ₩1.4trillion (KRW, $1.2billion) in assistance to the affected residents, after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003. This included ₩100billion (KRW, $90million USD) in immediate funds for search and rescue missions. After the storm, residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated, {{which led to the}} high death toll. Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm. A damaged rail line prompted operators to provide alternate bus service. Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes. By three days after the storm, most damaged roads and highways were reopened. About 33,000members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts, such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims. Workers quickly restored power to 95% of customers within 24hours. The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port, and assisted operators to ensure exports would not be delayed. Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise, and fish and crop exports rose 9.2% on average. The rice harvest was the lowest in 23years, due to the storm and a government effort to limit production. To assist farmers, the government increased purchases in federal contracts. Three government-run banks provided low-rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm. Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of <b>conjunctivitis</b> in the southern portion of the country. To prevent additional outbreaks, the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1,000workers to storm-damaged areas. The Korea Stock Exchange fell 1.8% due to fears that storm damage would disrupt exports.|$|E
25|$|Inclusion <b>conjunctivitis</b> of {{the newborn}} (ICN) is a <b>conjunctivitis</b> {{that may be}} caused by the {{bacteria}} Chlamydia trachomatis, and may lead to acute, purulent <b>conjunctivitis.</b> However, it is usually self-healing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conjunctivitis</b> {{is part of}} {{the triad}} of {{reactive}} arthritis, which is thought to be caused by autoimmune cross-reactivity following certain bacterial infections. Reactive arthritis is highly associated with HLA-B27. <b>Conjunctivitis</b> is associated with the autoimmune disease relapsing polychondritis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conjunctivitis</b> is {{identified}} by irritation and redness of the conjunctiva. Except in obvious pyogenic or toxic/chemical <b>conjunctivitis,</b> a slit lamp (biomicroscope) {{is needed to}} have any confidence in the diagnosis. Examination of the tarsal conjunctiva is usually more diagnostic than the bulbar conjunctiva.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial <b>conjunctivitis</b> usually vanishes without treatment. Topical {{antibiotics}} may {{be needed}} only if no improvement is observed after three days. No serious effects were noted either with or without treatment. As they do speed healing in bacterial <b>conjunctivitis,</b> their use may be considered.|$|E
25|$|About 3 to 6 {{million people}} get <b>conjunctivitis</b> {{each year in}} the United States. In adults viral causes are more common, while in {{children}} bacterial causes are more common. Typically people get better in one or two weeks. If there is visual loss, significant pain, sensitivity to light, signs of herpes, or a person is not improving after a week, further diagnosis and treatment may be required. <b>Conjunctivitis</b> in a newborn, known as neonatal <b>conjunctivitis,</b> may also require specific treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conjunctivitis</b> is {{the most}} common eye disease.|$|E
25|$|Keratoconjunctivitis is the {{combination}} of <b>conjunctivitis</b> and keratitis (corneal inflammation).|$|E
25|$|Blepharoconjunctivitis is {{the dual}} {{combination}} of <b>conjunctivitis</b> with blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids).|$|E
25|$|Ocular {{involvement}} (mild bilateral <b>conjunctivitis)</b> {{occurs in}} about 50% {{of men with}} urogenital reactive arthritis syndrome and about 75% of men with enteric reactive arthritis syndrome. <b>Conjunctivitis</b> and uveitis can include redness of the eyes, eye pain and irritation, or blurred vision. Eye involvement typically occurs early {{in the course of}} reactive arthritis, and symptoms may come and go.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conjunctivitis</b> due to {{chemicals}} {{is treated}} via irrigation with Ringer's lactate or saline solution. Chemical injuries (particularly alkali burns) are medical emergencies, {{as they can}} lead to severe scarring and intraocular damage. People with chemically induced <b>conjunctivitis</b> should not touch their eyes, {{regardless of whether or}} not their hands are clean, as they run the risk of spreading the condition to another eye.|$|E
25|$|Adenoviruses is {{the most}} common cause of viral <b>conjunctivitis</b> (adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis). Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis (caused by herpes simplex viruses) can be serious and {{requires}} treatment with acyclovir. Acute hemorrhagic <b>conjunctivitis</b> is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses, Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.|$|E
25|$|A {{patch test}} {{is used to}} {{identify}} the causative allergen in the case where <b>conjunctivitis</b> is caused by allergy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conjunctivitis</b> {{may also}} be caused by allergens such as pollen, perfumes, cosmetics, smoke, dust mites, Balsam of Peru, and eye drops.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conjunctivitis</b> {{resolves}} in 65% {{of cases}} without treatment, within {{two to five}} days. The prescription of antibiotics is not necessary in most cases.|$|E
25|$|Allergic <b>conjunctivitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the conjunctiva (the membrane covering the white part of the eye) due to allergy. Allergens differ among patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurological}} {{and psychological}} symptoms can occur with only mild deficiencies. Dermatitis, <b>conjunctivitis,</b> and hair loss will generally occur only when deficiency becomes more severe.|$|E
25|$|Povidone-iodine eye {{solution}} {{has been}} found to prevent <b>conjunctivitis</b> following birth. As it is less expensive it is being more commonly used for this purpose globally.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} (previously Reiter's disease) – asymmetrically involves heel, sacroiliac {{joints and}} large joints of the leg. It is {{usually associated with}} urethritis, <b>conjunctivitis,</b> iritis, painless buccal ulcers, and keratoderma blennorrhagica.|$|E
25|$|When {{investigated}} as a treatment, Povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution {{has also}} been observed to have some effectiveness against bacterial and chlamydial <b>conjunctivitis,</b> with a possible role suggested in locations where topical antibiotics are unavailable or costly.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{diagnosis}} of measles requires {{a history of}} fever {{of at least three}} days, with {{at least one of the}} three C's (cough, coryza, <b>conjunctivitis).</b> Observation of Koplik's spots is also diagnostic of measles.|$|E
25|$|Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is the {{combination}} of <b>conjunctivitis</b> with blepharitis and keratitis. It is clinically defined by changes of the lid margin, meibomian gland dysfunction, redness of the eye, conjunctival chemosis and inflammation of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of cases during World Wars I and II focused {{attention}} on the triad of arthritis, urethritis, and <b>conjunctivitis</b> (often with additional mucocutaneous lesions), which {{at that time was}} also referred to as Fiessenger-Leroy-Reiter syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Viral <b>conjunctivitis</b> {{is often}} {{associated}} with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, or a sore throat. Its symptoms include excessive watering and itching. The infection usually begins with one eye, but may spread easily to the other.|$|E
25|$|Zika, {{recently}} notorious, though rarely deadly. It causes fever, joint pain, rashes and <b>conjunctivitis.</b> The {{most serious}} consequence appears when the infected {{person is a}} pregnant woman, since during pregnancy this virus can originate a birth defect called microcephaly.|$|E
25|$|Viral <b>conjunctivitis</b> shows a fine, diffuse pinkness of the conjunctiva, {{which is}} easily mistaken for the ciliary {{infection}} of iris (iritis), {{but there are}} usually corroborative signs on microscopy, particularly numerous lymphoid follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva, and sometimes a punctate keratitis.|$|E
25|$|Pleconaril {{works against}} rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, by {{blocking}} a pocket {{on the surface}} of the virus that controls the uncoating process. This pocket is similar in most strains of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, which can cause diarrhea, meningitis, <b>conjunctivitis,</b> and encephalitis.|$|E
25|$|Most infections with {{adenovirus}} {{result in}} infections {{of the upper}} respiratory tract. Adenovirus infections often show up as <b>conjunctivitis,</b> tonsilitis (which may look exactly like strep throat and cannot be distinguished from strep except by throat culture), an ear infection, or croup. Adenoviruses, types 40 and 41 can also cause gastroenteritis. A combination of <b>conjunctivitis</b> and tonsilitis is particularly common with adenovirus infections. Some children (especially small ones) can develop adenovirus bronchiolitis or pneumonia, both {{of which can be}} severe. In babies, adenoviruses can also cause coughing fits that look almost exactly like whooping cough. Adenoviruses can also cause viral meningitis or encephalitis. Rarely, adenovirus can cause hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder—a form of urinary tract infection — with blood in the urine).|$|E
25|$|Viral <b>conjunctivitis</b> usually {{resolves}} {{on its own}} {{and does}} not require any specific treatment. Antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) or mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromolyn) {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Povidone iodine has been suggested as a treatment, but as of 2008 evidence to support it was poor.|$|E
