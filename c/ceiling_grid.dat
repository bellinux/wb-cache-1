5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his <b>ceiling</b> <b>grid</b> with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented <b>ceiling</b> <b>grid</b> once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{differences}} on the setting requirements of fire detectors in the buildings used <b>grid</b> or flat <b>ceilings.</b> In this paper, applied researches on the setting standard of fire detector below <b>grid</b> <b>ceilings</b> were firstly carried out. On {{the basis of the}} setting requirements of fire detector, the numerical simulation of smoke movement below and above <b>grid</b> <b>ceilings</b> with four kinds of hollowing rates was conducted in the standard combustion lab by using FDS software. After that, according to the GB 4715 - 2005 National Standard's sensitivity requirements of the 75 mm¥ 75 mm size <b>grid</b> <b>ceilings,</b> the experimental researches on the response characteristics of photoelectric smoke detectors, which were above or under the <b>grid</b> <b>ceilings,</b> were carried out under conditions of different obscuration rates and in FDS simulations.

50|$|A {{fan filter}} unit (FFU) {{is a type of}} {{motorized}} air filtering equipment. It is used to supply purified air to cleanrooms, laboratories, medical facilities or microenvironments by removing harmful airborne particles from recirculating air. The units are installed within the system's <b>ceiling</b> or floor <b>grid.</b> Large cleanrooms require a proportionally large number of FFUs, which in some cases may range from several hundred to several thousand. Units often contain their own pre-filter, HEPA filter and internally controllable fan air distribution.|$|R

50|$|The {{plan of the}} sanctum (garbhagriha) is {{a square}} {{pyramidal}} one, with a plain exterior with simple pilasters, a vestibule (antarala) separating the sanctum from a closed hall (mantapa) with an exceptionally well sculptured section called the mahamantapa or navaranga. The superstructure over the shrine (shikhara) and vestibule (sukanasi) have been renovated at a later period but the base on which the temple stands (Adhiṣṭhāna) is original in construction. The doorjamb (sakha) and the lintel above the main door have exceptional art. The doorjamb exhibits seated door keepers (dwarapalas) at the base, bold scrolls of decorative creepers that run {{along the sides of}} the main door and contain Yaksha (benevolent spirits from Hindu mythology) and Yakshis (or Yakshinis, their female counterparts). Above the door, forming the lintel (lalata) is a sculpture of Gajalakshmi (a version of the goddess Lakshmi) with elephants showering her from either side. Sarma feels this sculpture may have inspired the monolithic carving at the main entrance (called akhanda bagilu) on the Vindyagiri hill in the famous Jain heritage town of Shravanabelagola. The <b>ceiling</b> panel <b>grid</b> (ashta-dik-pala grid) of images in the mahamantapa (a section of the mantapa) needs special mention and speaks of the good taste of the Ganga-Nolamba architects. The panel images include a four handed dancing and well ornamented Shiva, and a four tusked elephant (gaja) carrying on its back the god Indra and his consort Sachi.|$|R
40|$|In 1986, Keil {{provided}} an O(n(2)) time algorithm {{for the problem}} of covering monotone orthogonal polygons with the minimum number of r-star-shaped orthogonal polygons. This was later improved to O(n) time and space by Gewali et al. in [L. Gewali, M. Keil, S. C. Ntafos, On covering orthogonal polygons with star-shaped polygons, Information Sciences 65 (1992) 45 - 63]. In this paper we simplify the latter algorithm-we show that with a little modification, the first step SWEEP 1 of the discussed algorithm-which computes the top <b>ceilings</b> of horizontal <b>grid</b> segments an be omitted. In addition, for the minimum orthogonal guard problem in the considered class of polygons, our approach provides a linear time algorithm which uses O(k) additional space, where k {{is the size of}} the optimal solution-the algorithm in [L. Gewali, M. Keil, S. C. Ntafos, On covering orthogonal polygons with star-shaped polygons, Information Sciences 65 (1992) 45 - 63] uses both O(n) time and O(n) additional space. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.

50|$|The plenum is {{the space}} between a {{suspended}} ceiling and the structural deck above it. Since most offices have such spaces, sound masking speakers are commonly added there. For open offices, uniformity of the sound masking in the inhabited area is important and is largely determined by the horizontal spacing of the masking speakers as described above. Speaker arrays are generally rectangular. They generally face upwards to reflect sound from the deck and broaden {{the distribution of the}} sound to create a more uniform sound field. The diagram on the right shows an example. For closed offices, uniformity of sound level is not an issue. Generally, ceiling tiles with a high transmission loss are recommended, those with CAC (Ceiling Attenuation Class) ratings of 30 or greater. This reduces the impact of sound masking in adjacent open areas which would have excessive levels in those offices. Typically the ceiling plenum is used as a return air duct requiring an open grill. Sound masking in the plenum above a closed office can generate excessive levels. There are simple metal covers that are placed above the grille to reduce the impact of the hole. Available ones are sufficiently large so do not impede air flow. The upper figure n the left shows a masking speaker that mounts directly on the <b>ceiling</b> tile <b>grid.</b> The two lower figures are examples of speakers that are hung in the ceiling plenum. If the ceiling plenum is shallow, a low profile speaker is required. This speaker radiates sound horizontally rather than vertically to improve the uniformity of the masking in the occupied area below. An example is shown in the lower left figure.|$|R
