This tension motivates us to examine whether Barcelona en Comú preserved a decentralizated structure or adopted a conventional centralized organization. In this article we analyse the Twitter networks of the parties that ran for this election by measuring their hierarchical structure, information efficiency and social resilience. Our results show that in Barcelona en Comú two well-defined groups co-exist: a cluster dominated by the leader and the <b>collective</b> <b>accounts,</b> and another cluster formed by the movement activists.

Three anti-racist contemporary legends, which are ironic about prejudice rather than justifying it in a roundabout way - as is generally the case - are presented here.

A review is made of their appearances and their variations in the different media. The study then examines relations between these contemporary legends and similar narrative genres (exemple, fables, trivial events, jokes).

Qualitative semi‐structured interview data were collected from 14 early career secondary geography teachers in Scotland as they reflected on their first three years of teaching.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} varying and {{contrasting}} {{ways in which}} stereotypes, as representations of groups, and stereotyping as an activity, have been constructed and understood within contemporary social psychology. These distinct theoretical approaches include the dominant social cognitive tradition, which views stereotypes as cognitive schemas that simplify reality, and self-categorization theory, which views stereotypes as psychologically valid representations which reflect the actualities of intergroup relations. We articulate how more social and <b>collective</b> <b>accounts</b> based on social representations theory, ideology and discursive psychology can enrich our understanding of stereotypes and stereotyping. Stereotypes are not the product of individual cognitive activity alone, but are also social and collective products which function ideologically by justifying and legitimizing existing social and power relations within a society. We also discuss recent contributions to the enduring enigma within social psychology regarding the relationship between stereotypes and social reality, and identify the inherent ideological problems which plague positivist attempts to explicate this relationship. Finally, we discuss {{the need for an}} integrative social psychological theory of stereotyping which links the cognitive and psychological analyses of stereotyping to more social, structural and discursive analyses...|$|E

The research design and the WAI pilot programme were informed by an eco-feminist approach {{which is the most}} common feminist approach applied in the outdoor adventure field. The programme was based on the 'Personal Growth through Adventure' model developed by Jackie Kiewa (1994). The objectives of this research were to acknowledge and validate the participants' experiences of the programme by documenting their personal and <b>collective</b> <b>accounts</b> and to make recommendations based on the findings for {{the development and implementation of}} further programmes for young women. The method used in this research was that of a naturalistic inquiry using a qualitative research design based on eco-feminist methodology. The data was collected through the use of summative and formative written questionnaires, tape recordings and written/art material. The data was analysed using content analysis to code and then categorise the responses into themes. For this research I decided to test the hypothesis that a therapeutic adventure approach is a beneficial alternative to traditional counselling methods through the use of activities and group therapy incorporated into the experience of an outdoor journey (Jennifer Davis-Berman & Dene Berman, 1994, USA). This thesis describes the responses of the participants and facilitators who attended the WAI pilot programme. The research findings support the use of eco feminism, and the 'Personal Growth through Adventure' model, indicating that overall the programme was a positive experience for each of the participants and the general consensus was that further programmes would be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: South Africa is {{a country}} faced with complex health and social inequalities, in which HIV/AIDS has had devastating impacts. The study aimed to gain {{insights}} into the perspectives of rural communities on HIV-related mortality. METHODS: A participatory action research (PAR) process, inclusive of a visual participatory method (Photovoice), was initiated to elicit and organise local knowledge and to identify priorities for action in a rural subdistrict underpinned by the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). We convened three village-based discussion groups, presented HDSS data on HIV-related mortality, elicited subjective perspectives on HIV/AIDS, systematised these into <b>collective</b> <b>accounts</b> and identified priorities for action. Framework analysis was performed on narrative and visual data, and practice theory was used to interpret the findings. FINDINGS: A range of social and health systems factors were identified as causes and contributors of HIV mortality. These included alcohol use/abuse, gender inequalities, stigma around disclosure of HIV status, problems with informal care, poor sanitation, harmful traditional practices, delays in treatment, problems with medications and problematic staff-patient relationships. To address these issues, developing youth facilities in communities, improving employment opportunities, timely treatment and extending community outreach for health education and health promotion were identified. DISCUSSION: Addressing social practices of blame, stigma and mistrust around HIV-related mortality may be a useful focus for policy and planning. Research that engages communities and authorities to coproduce evidence can capture these practices, improve communication and build trust. CONCLUSION: Actions to reduce HIV should go beyond individual agency and structural forces to focus on how social practices embody these elements. Initiating PAR inclusive of visual methods can build shared understandings of disease burdens in social and health systems contexts. This can develop shared accountability and improve staff-patient relationships, which, over time, may address the issues identified, here related to stigma and blame...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{adopts a}} discourse-centered approach to culture {{in order to}} explore the local meanings attached to alcohol and drinking in contemporary Navajo society. Against a backdrop of drastic cultural transformations, Navajo discourse reveals {{a wide range of}} accounts in which drinking is situated within the context of individual experiences and histories. Alcohol and drinking are connected to personal memories of important events, emotions, and relationships. Beyond the level of individual stories, these narratives help organize <b>collective</b> <b>accounts</b> of the Navajo as a people by providing comprehensive evaluations and commentaries on drinking. A number of collective meanings are embedded in narratives about alcohol that reference cultural sentiments and prominent moral values and offer a social commentary that defines what is, and is not, Navajo. Further insights are offered by an examination of aging-out, a salient pattern of Navajo drinking. Former problem drinkers who have aged out and no longer experience alcohol related difficulties offer narratives that frame drinking in certain set ways. The discourse on aging-out among the Navajo not only provides detail on a category of drinker that is largely ignored in accounts of Native American drinking but also illustrates some of the values and meanings attached to drinking cessation and personal change. The discourse of alcoholism treatment provides other understandings regarding Navajo conceptions of alcohol, including the character of this substance and the effect it has on people [...] especially Native Americans. Consideration of this set of discourse reveals insights into the treatment process as well as commentaries and evaluations of treatment effectiveness and other related issues. This study suggests that Navajo narratives of alcohol and drinking provide important idioms for expressing moral and self-identity, individual experience, collective history, and cultural degeneration. The discourse on drinking in Navajo society reveals a social world of polarization, contention, and intergenerational conflict...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{a personal}} attempt to explore leadership in a holistic manner that recognises {{the contribution of}} both individuals and the collective whilst remaining sensitive to contextual factors. It endeavours to do this through presentation, analysis and discussion of two empirical studies of leadership, informed by distributed and practice perspectives, which regard leadership as a shared and contextually situated social process. The thesis begins with an overview of leadership theory and research, proposing that {{the time is right}} for a reframing of the field of leadership studies in order to redress the balance accorded to individual and <b>collective</b> <b>accounts</b> of leadership; review how we recognise, reward and develop leadership; and revisit our methodologies and approaches to leadership enquiry. The first empirical study investigates perceptions and experiences of leadership in the UK higher education sector, proposing that whilst leadership may be considered as widely dispersed, the notion of ‘distributed leadership’ also carries a powerful rhetorical function that may mask an uneven distribution of power, resources and rewards. The second empirical study explores the notion of ‘leadership-as-practice’ in three large, complex organisations outside the HE sector, and reveals the significant impact of discourse and sensemaking in shaping perceptions, experiences and the accomplishment of leadership for middle-senior level operational managers. The discussion chapter draws together the various themes explored in the thesis, in particular demonstrating the significance of issues of discourse, identity and purpose in making sense of the elusive nature of leadership practice. It is argued that a holistic representation of leadership remains difficult to achieve because of the manner in which grand Discourses and micro-level discourses of leadership interact to attribute the social process of leadership to the actions of individual leaders. The thesis concludes with a series of recommendations that highlight the value of a somewhat eclectic approach to leadership theory, research, practice and development that facilitates the emergence and recognition of contextually-appropriate ‘hybrid configurations’ of leadership.

40|$|The place {{occupied}} by eco-activism is simultaneously a "mythic and real contestation {{of the space}} we live in". It is contesting a non-tangible capitalism and hopes to create a space of ecological politics organised around environmental values. Mainstream media and political parties place environmental activism in a heterotopia of deviance (Foucault's term), by denigrating both their environcentric agenda and the actual spaces of eco-activism (recent climate camps, squatted land etc). But things seem to have changed. Eco-activism is shifting it's place of protest, and engaging with the mainstream media in their own terms and in their own space, eco-activists are attempting to develop a counter-site to the heterotopia of deviance. This {{is the result of}} a long-term process. For many activists however, the big 'moment', occurs in 2005 when the Climate Camp gives the media an open invitation onto site, marking a 'turning point' in the relations of power between activists and journalists and a passage from passive to active representation of their cause. This paper examines the UK-based environmental activism movement and looks at the coming-into-being of the political 'moment' in relation to 'place', using Foucault's idea of heterotopia and its affinity to the structuralist concept of the 'non-place' as place of contestation and resistance (Bosteels 2003). It explores how the camp and the site of protest shift from spaces of deviance to truly heterotopic space which challenge the 'emptying out' of the eco-activists' political endeavours by mainstream press but also accommodate differences of opinion by different generations of activists who do not always agree on the movement's (best) relation to the press. A 'moment' therefore emerges retrospectively and in the <b>collective</b> <b>accounts</b> of diverge groups as the inaugural shift from one mode of being-operating (deviance) to another (true heterotopia). The 'moment' is the point at which agency becomes possible. It is therefore over-determined (historically and spatially) and involves a subtle exchange between 'the place' and 'the place-holder' (Bosteels) which warrants both a Foucauldian and a Psychoanalytic reading as well as a 'pragmatic' one for the prospect of turning sites of protest into permanently radical (revolutionary, contestation-al) spaces...|$|E
40|$|Should {{youth and}} {{community}} work practitioners and trainers {{use their own}} identity as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) to support the learning of students in Higher Education (HE) and young people in informal education? As educators how we use our identity within professional settings {{is an issue that}} all practitioners, especially those who identify as LGBT or Queer must explore. In this paper the authors present some initial findings as to whether the issues and challenges are the same for youth and community workers, academics teaching in the field and for students and young people they work with. We seek to examine issues including the difference between naming yourself ‘Queer’ rather than ’LGBT’ and whether we, as ‘out’ lesbians within our work place, are letting our ‘hetero’ colleagues off the hook. Our research used an autoethnographic approach: ‘sharing politicized, practical, and cultural stories that resonate with others’ (Adams & Jones 2011 : 111). We recognise that our stories are not the truth but are contextual (Bourdieu, 1992). They are selective accounts, some made consciously and some made unconsciously although we aim to be as transparent as possible about our ‘conscious partiality’ (Bourdieu in Miles, 1993). We focussed on our individual identity and journeys and shared collective identities (Bruner 2004, Buchroth and Parkin, 2010) and used our <b>collective</b> <b>accounts</b> as a means of reflection on our educational approaches. In providing a reflexive account we are intending to stimulate debate with others about their sexual identity narrative accounts. As lesbians we discuss how our identity relative to queer theory presented through narratives of our lived experiences can support our role as educators. We examine the usefulness of issues raised by Queer Theorists for educators within HE and practitioners of youth and community work. We look at a range of ideas including Butler’s Theory of Performativity (1999), the usefulness of ‘Queering of the public discourse’ (Shildrick, 1997 : 192), challenging of the binary division (Stein and Plummer, 1994) and using ‘Queer’ as a ‘deliberately disruptive term’ (Marinucci, 2010 : 33 citing Halperin, 2003).

40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper {{discusses}} the two primary theories that have attempted to provide groups with moral status. By examining their respective methods for assigning moral rights to a group, I elucidate problems in both accounts, showing them insufficient in their attempt to defend group ethics. The corporate account establishes a group identity entirely separable from the identities of its individuals. However, this allows the rights of the individuals to clash with those of the group. The <b>collective</b> <b>account</b> asserts that the group identity, and the only source of a group’s moral status, lies in the sum of the rights of its members, creating a group-as-a-whole. This, however, poses the practical problem of changing numbers within a group, and shifts in membership. I introduce my own group identity theory, the extension account, which provides the possibility of a group that can hold rights by virtue of its being made of autonomous individuals who all bear moral standing and are subject to the moral responsibilities relevant to their membership within the group. The extension account establishes an identity of the group-itself, separate from its members, but the origin of its moral status is extended directly from th...|$|R
