50|$|Chicken is {{also sold}} in dismembered pieces. Pieces may include quarters, or fourths of the chicken. A chicken is {{typically}} cut into two leg quarters and two breast quarters. Each quarter contains {{two of the}} commonly available pieces of chicken. A leg quarter contains the thigh, drumstick and {{a portion of the}} back; a leg has the back portion removed. A breast quarter contains the breast, wing and portion of the back; a breast has the back portion and wing removed. Pieces may be sold in packages of all of the same pieces, or in <b>combination</b> <b>packages.</b> Whole chicken cut up refers to either the entire bird cut into 8 individual pieces. (8-piece cut); or sometimes without the back. A 9-piece cut (usually for fast food restaurants) has the tip of the breast cut off before splitting. Pick of the chicken, or similar titles, refers to a package with only some of the chicken pieces. Typically the breasts, thighs, and legs without wings or back. Thighs and breasts are sold boneless and/or skinless. Dark meat (legs, drumsticks and thighs) pieces are typically cheaper than white meat pieces (breast, wings). Chicken livers and/or gizzards are commonly available packaged separately. Other parts of the chicken, such as the neck, feet, combs, etc. are not widely available except in countries where they are in demand, or in cities that cater to ethnic groups who favor these parts.|$|E

High altitude shipments are encountered when trucks travel over high mountain passes or when cargo and feeder aircraft transport packages in non-pressurized or partially-pressurized cargo holds. Both these types of transport methods will result in severe changes in pressure and temperature conditions as compared to packages being transported close to sea-level The testing of packages under these conditions is critical since package integrity may be compromised. The current shipping tests performed in test labs do not account for pressure changes and vibration together.

40|$|AbstractPurposeAdolescent {{health is}} a major concern in low- and middle-income countries, but little is known about its predictors. Family {{disadvantage}} and abusive parenting may be important factors associated with adolescent psychological, behavioral, and physical health outcomes. This study, based in South Africa, aimed to develop an empirically based theoretical model of relationships between family factors such as deprivation, illness, parenting, and adolescent health outcomes. MethodsCross-sectional data were collected in 2009 – 2010 from 2, 477 adolescents (aged 10 – 17) and their caregivers using stratified random sampling in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Participants reported on sociodemographics, psychological symptoms, parenting, and physical health. Multivariate regressions were conducted, confirmatory factor analysis employed to identify measurement models, and a structural equation model developed. ResultsThe final model demonstrated that family disadvantage (caregiver AIDS illness and poverty) was associated with increased abusive parenting. Abusive parenting was in turn associated with higher adolescent health risks. Additionally, family disadvantage was directly associated with caregiver mental health distress which increased adolescent health risks. There was no direct effect of family disadvantage on adolescent health risks but indirect effects through caregiver mental health distress and abusive parenting were found. ConclusionsReducing family disadvantage and abusive parenting is essential in improving adolescent health in South Africa. Combination interventions could include poverty and violence reduction, access to health care, mental health services for caregivers and adolescents, and positive parenting support. Such <b>combination</b> <b>packages</b> can improve caregiver and child outcomes by reducing disadvantage and mitigating negative pathways from disadvantage among highly vulnerable families...|$|E

40|$|<b>Combination</b> <b>packages</b> for HIV {{prevention}} can leverage {{the effectiveness}} of biomedical and behavioural elements to lower disease incidence with realistic targets for individual and population risk reduction. We investigated how sexual network structures can maximise {{the effectiveness of}} a package targeting sexually active adults in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with intervention components for medical male circumcision (MMC) and sexual partnership concurrency (having > 1 ongoing partner). Network-based mathematical models of HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) transmission dynamics among heterosexual couples were used to explore how changes to MMC alone and in combination with changes to concurrency impacted endemic HIV- 1 prevalence and incidence. Starting from a base model parameterised from empirical data from West Africa, we simulated the prevalence of circumcision from 10 % to 90 % and concurrency was modelled at four discrete levels corresponding to values observed across SSA. MMC and concurrency could contribute to the empirical variation in HIV- 1 disease prevalence across SSA. Small reductions in concurrency resulted in large declines in HIV- 1 prevalence. Scaling up circumcision in low-concurrency settings yields a greater relative benefit, but the absolute number of infections averted depends on both the circumcision coverage and baseline incidence. Epidemic extinction with this package will require substantial scale-up of MMC in low-concurrency settings. Dynamic sexual network structure should be considered in the design and targeting of MMC within combination HIV- 1 prevention packages. Realistic levels of coverage for these packages within southern Africa could lead to a reduction of incidence to the low levels observed in western Africa, and possibly, epidemic extinction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The HIV {{epidemic}} in Sub Saharan Africa has been traditionally {{assumed to be}} driven by high risk heterosexual and vertical transmission. However, there is an increasing body of data highlighting the disproportionate burden of HIV infection among MSM in the generalized HIV epidemics across of Southern Africa. In South Africa specifically, there has been an increase in attention focused on the risk status and preventive needs of MSM both in urban centers and peri-urban townships. The study presented here represents the first evaluation of HIV prevalence and associations of HIV infection among MSM in the peri-urban townships of Cape Town. Methods The study consisted of an anonymous probe of 200 men, reporting ever having had sex with another man, recruited through venue-base sampling from January to February, 2009. Results Overall, HIV prevalence was 25. 5 % (n = 51 / 200). Of these prevalent HIV infections, only 6 % of HIV- 1 infected MSM were aware of their HIV status (3 / 50). 0 % of men reported always having safe sex as defined by always wearing condoms during sex and using water-based lubricants. Independent associations with HIV infection included inconsistent condom use with male partners (aOR 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 5. 4), having been blackmailed (aOR 4. 4, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 20. 2), age over 26 years (aOR 4. 2, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 10. 6), being unemployed (aOR 3. 7, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 9. 3), and rural origin (aOR 6. 0, 95 % CI 2. 2 - 16. 7). Bisexual activity was reported by 17. 1 % (34 / 199), and a total of 8 % (16 / 200) reported having a regular female partner. Human rights violations were common with 10. 5 % (n = 21 / 200) reporting having been blackmailed and 21. 0 % (n = 42 / 200) reporting being afraid to seek health care. Conclusions The conclusions from this study include that a there is a high risk and underserved population of MSM in the townships surrounding Cape Town. The high HIV prevalence and high risk sexual practices suggest that prevalence will continue to increase among these men {{in the context of an}} otherwise slowing epidemic. These data further highlight the need to better characterize risk factors for HIV prevention and appropriate targeted <b>combination</b> <b>packages</b> of HIV interventions including biomedical, behavioural, and structural approaches to mitigate HIV risk among these men. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction of test formulation of candesartan 16 mg tablet and felodipine extended release 5 mg tablet together in a <b>combination</b> <b>package,</b> comparing with the fasting period intake of commercial formulations of both Atacand® 16 mg tablet and Splendil® extended release 5 mg tablet (Test formulation and reference formulation from AstraZeneca, Brazil) in 36 volunteers of both sexes. The study was conducted open with randomized three period crossover design and a one week wash out period. The candesartan and felodipine were analyzed by LC-MS-MS. The mean ratio of parameters Cmax and AUC 0 -t and 90 % confidence intervals of correspondents were calculated to determine the pharmacokinetic interaction. Geometric mean of candesartan exposure together in a <b>combination</b> <b>package</b> felodipine individual percent ratio was 102. 51 % AUC 0 -t and 110. 40 % for Cmax. The 90 % confidence intervals were 90. 00 - 116. 77 % and 93. 94 - 129. 74 %, respectively. Geometric mean of felodipine exposure together in a <b>combination</b> <b>package</b> candesartan individual percent ratio was 102. 69 % AUC 0 -t and 96. 17 % for Cmax. The 90 % confidence intervals were 89. 46 - 117. 88 % and 82. 07 - 112. 69 %, respectively. The major variable in this respect, AUC, was not signicantly affected by felodipine and candesartan with concomitant administration. The Cmax of candesartan was not signicantly affected by co-administration of felodipine. Based on these data and in presence in the market of isolated candersatana and felodipino formularizations used in combination in medical practice, it is concluded {{that there are no}} risk with concomitant administration between felodipine and candesartan. © 2011 Abib Jr E, et al...|$|R
