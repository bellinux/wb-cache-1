25|$|More recently, in situ methods like steam-assisted gravity-drainage (SAGD) and cyclic steam {{stimulation}} (CSS) {{have been}} developed to extract bitumen from deep deposits by injecting steam to heat the sands and reduce the bitumen viscosity {{so that it can be}} pumped out like <b>conventional</b> <b>crude</b> oil.|$|E
25|$|Heavy crude oil, {{which is}} much more viscous than <b>conventional</b> <b>crude</b> oil, and tar sands, where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, are {{becoming}} more important as sources of fossil fuel. Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen, a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield synthetic crude oil when heated (pyrolyzed). These materials have yet to be exploited commercially. These fuels can be employed in internal combustion engines, fossil fuel power stations and other uses.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with natural-gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil, called synbit. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, <b>conventional</b> <b>crude</b> oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as Western Canadian Select. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as Mexican Mayan or Arabian Dubai Crude.|$|E
40|$|The crude from Canadian {{oil sands}} {{provides}} enormous security and economic advantages to the United States, but {{the carbon dioxide}} emitted during its extraction and refinement is about double that of most <b>conventional</b> <b>crudes.</b> This paper proposes that the U. S. government formulate policies that foster the diversion of Canadian oil sands crude to U. S. Gulf refineries, offsetting the additional carbon dioxide they create by using gas instead of coal to generate electricity. The development of oil sands should reduce the U. S. trade deficit; it would also ease the economic pressure to accelerate the production of coal-to-liquid fuels, which would result in {{four times as much}} carbon dioxide per gallon of fuel as the Canadian oil sands...|$|R
50|$|Heavy {{crude oils}} provide an {{interesting}} {{situation for the}} economics of petroleum development. The resources of heavy oil {{in the world are}} more than twice those of <b>conventional</b> light <b>crude</b> oil. In October 2009, the United States Geological Survey updated the Orinoco deposits (Venezuela) recoverable value to , making this area one of the world's largest recoverable oil deposits. However, recovery rates for heavy oil are often limited from 5-30% of oil in place. The chemical makeup is often the defining variable in recovery rates. New technology utilized for the recovery of heavy oil is constantly increasing recovery rates.|$|R
50|$|Venezuela {{produces}} {{a mix of}} <b>conventional</b> heavy <b>crude</b> and unconventional crude derived from bitumen. This latter source, previously too expensive to produce in quantity, now makes up an increasing large percent of Venezuela's oil exports - 600,000 of Venezuela's three {{million barrels per day}} in 2006. In the Maracaibo Basin, the balance of reserves is toward its conventional deposits. As the country continues shifting toward bitumen production due to its increasing profitability and decreases in conventional reserves, the level of Maracaibo Basin oil production will decrease, while that of the Orinoco Belt and its massive bitumen deposits will increase.|$|R
25|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>crude</b> oil is {{normally}} {{extracted from the}} ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as horizontal drilling, water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production {{is used in the}} Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8–12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5–6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered {{only a small fraction of}} the oil in place, so it not often used today.|$|E
25|$|The {{top three}} oil {{producing}} countries are Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States. About 80 {{percent of the}} world's readily accessible reserves {{are located in the}} Middle East, with 62.5 percent coming from the Arab 5: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Qatar and Kuwait. A large portion of the world's total oil exists as unconventional sources, such as bitumen in Canada and extra heavy oil in Venezuela. While significant volumes of oil are extracted from oil sands, particularly in Canada, logistical and technical hurdles remain, as oil extraction requires large amounts of heat and water, making its net energy content quite low relative to <b>conventional</b> <b>crude</b> oil. Thus, Canada's oil sands are not expected to provide more than a few million barrels per day in the foreseeable future.|$|E
500|$|Oil shale is an organic-rich {{fine-grained}} {{sedimentary rock}} containing kerogen (a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds) from which liquid hydrocarbons called shale oil (not {{to be confused}} with tight oil—crude oil occurring naturally in shales) can be produced. [...] Shale oil is a substitute for <b>conventional</b> <b>crude</b> oil; however, extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the production of <b>conventional</b> <b>crude</b> oil both financially and in terms of its environmental impact. [...] Deposits of oil shale occur around the world, including major deposits in the United States. A 2016 estimate of global deposits set the total world resources of oil shale equivalent of [...] of oil in place.|$|E
30|$|Presently, 12  % of {{the total}} global oil supply comes from heavy oil {{production}} (Silverman et al. 2011). This is because the exploitation of heavy crude oil deposit is hampered by the recovery challenges such as the cost involved in its production, the cost of pre-processing before refining, its low market value, and the pace of getting the heavy oil out of the reservoir {{as fast as the}} production of <b>conventional</b> light <b>crude</b> oil. It presents difficulties at all stages of recovery and processing, mainly due to their low fluidity {{as a result of the}} extreme high viscosity (due to the presence of high molecular weight compounds such as asphaltenes and resins) of the oil at reservoir conditions of temperature and pressure. This affects the reservoir productivity index (PI). Additionally, it is difficult to transport heavy oil and bitumen via pipeline to refineries without the addition of diluents or pipeline heating which incurs additional cost. Other problems of processing and refining these resources include the presence of impurities like sulphur, nitrogen, heavy metals (V, Ni), asphaltenes, resins, etc., that drastically deactivate downstream catalyst and process equipment (Nares et al. 2007). These challenges have lowered their price at the world market even though on the same volume basis, heavy oil contains more energy than <b>conventional</b> light <b>crude</b> oils. Therefore, upgrading heavy crude oil to almost light oil in situ will add more value to it.|$|R
30|$|Also {{with the}} {{depletion}} of the <b>conventional</b> light <b>crude</b> oil reserve, more and lower quality crude oil feedstock is supplied to the refinery, which has to be cracked into fuel fractions using FCC process, causing even more challenge to the HDS process, as the sulfur compounds in the FCC diesel often contains higher content dibenzothiophene (DBT) and dimethyl dibenzothiophene (DMDBT) then the straight run diesel [7, 8, 9]. Given an existed refinery, where little space is available for new reactors or devices installation, the only option {{is to develop a}} more robust catalyst, which is to be dropped in the existed reactors to achieve the required standards in the diesel. This might be the reason why there are so many works focusing on the novel catalyst development in these years.|$|R

Analyses using a range of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques, including microsatellite repeat polymorphism analysis at the NM 23 -H 1 locus and sequencing of exons 5, 7, and 8 of the p 53 gene, were performed successfully. Universal PCR amplification was also carried out on the microdissected material and probes suitable for use in comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) were obtained in all cases. This technique will enable a range of effective genetic analyses {{to be carried out}} on specific subsets of cells that have been characterised previously by immunohistochemistry...|$|R
500|$|By location: A {{frequently}} used distinction considers whether processing is done {{above or below}} ground, and classifies the technologies broadly as ex situ (displaced) or in situ (in place). [...] In ex situ processing, also known as above-ground retorting, the oil shale is mined either underground or at the surface and then transported to a processing facility. [...] In contrast, in situ processing converts the kerogen while it {{is still in the}} form of an oil shale deposit, following which it is then extracted via oil wells, where it rises in the same way as <b>conventional</b> <b>crude</b> oil. [...] Unlike ex situ processing, it does not involve mining or spent oil shale disposal aboveground as spent oil shale stays underground.|$|E
500|$|The {{shale oil}} derived from oil shale does not {{directly}} substitute for crude oil in all applications. It may contain higher concentrations of olefins, oxygen, and nitrogen than <b>conventional</b> <b>crude</b> oil. [...] Some shale oils may have higher sulfur or arsenic content. By comparison with West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark standard for crude oil in the futures-contract market, the Green River shale oil sulfur content ranges from near 0% to 4.9% (in average 0.76%), where West Texas Intermediate's sulfur content has a maximum of 0.42%. The sulfur content in shale oil from Jordan's oil shales may rise even up to 9.5%. [...] The arsenic content, for example, becomes an issue for Green River formation oil shale. The higher concentrations of these materials means that the oil must undergo considerable upgrading (hydrotreating) before serving as oil-refinery feedstock. [...] Above-ground retorting processes tended to yield a lower API gravity shale oil than the in situ processes. Shale oil serves best for producing middle-distillates such as kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Worldwide demand for these middle distillates, particularly for diesel fuels, increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s. [...] However, appropriate refining processes equivalent to hydrocracking can transform shale oil into a lighter-range hydrocarbon (gasoline).|$|E

40|$|As {{the declining}} {{production}} of <b>conventional</b> light <b>crude</b> oils in North America continues there is {{increased interest in}} the heavy oils and bitumen resources of Western Canada. While these oils represent a very large resource, they exhibit unique behavior during upgrading to lighter products. In particular, the heaviest fraction from bitumen pitch (end-cut) is exceptionally intractable. An earlier study showed that the molecular structure of the end-cut comprises three clusters of condensed aromatic and hydroaromatic rings, joined by aliphatic bridges. In this present work we use Computer Aided Molecular Dynamics (CAMD) to provide further insight into the structure of this component. Energy minimization indicates that the most likely bridge length between the clusters comprises five to seven carbon atoms. The calculations also provide information on molecular size and shape, i. e., those properties most closely associated with reactivity in catalytic upgrading processes.

30|$|It is hard {{to recover}} and process heavy crude oil and bitumen, owing to their high {{viscosity}} (i.e. resistance to flow) at reservoir conditions (making their mobility extremely low) and high carbon-to-hydrogen atomic ratios. Hitherto, with the rising price of crude oil, declining reserves of medium and light crude oil and the abundance of unconventional crude oil (i.e. heavy oil and bitumen/tar sands), their exploitation is therefore favoured. However, heavy crude oil and bitumen exploitation is faced with technical challenges at all stages from recovery/production from the reservoir to transportation and refining. Transporting heavy crude oil and bitumen via pipeline is usually challenging due to their high density and viscosity (> 1, 000  cP) and very low mobility at reservoir temperature. Asphaltene deposition, heavy metals, sulphur and brine or salt content {{make it difficult to}} be transported and refined using conventional refinery methods without firstly upgrading them to meet <b>conventional</b> light <b>crude</b> oil properties (Zhang et al. 2010; Hart 2012). Also, the presence of brine or salt in the heavy crude stimulates corrosion problems in the pipeline (Martinez-Palou et al. 2011).

To exploit heavy oil reserves economically with less environmental impact, the toe-to-heel air injection and its add-on CAtalytic upgrading PRocess In-situ (THAI–CAPRI™) process was developed for its recovery and upgrading in situ in the reservoir. This technology was propelled by several factors: producing oil of commercial value in situ that meets refinery feedstock specifications, the rising global demands for energy, the declining of conventional light oil reservoirs, increasing price of light crude alongside fluctuating supply, and most importantly the abundant deposits of heavy oil and bitumen energy resources worldwide that is waiting exploitation. With estimated 8  trillions of heavy oil and bitumen reserves, it shows their capacity to boost global energy source for decades.
