25|$|The Virginia {{big-eared bat}} is {{classified}} as Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus. The Corynorhinus genus, called the North American Big-Eared Bats, consists of three different species located from central Mexico to southwestern Canada (C. mexicanus, C. rafinesquii, C. townsendii). The subspecies of C. townsendii are C. t. townsendii, C. t. pallescens, C. t. australis, C. t. ingens, and C. t. virginianus, all of which primarily occupy North America. It is hypothesized that the MRCA, most recent common ancestor, of the Corynorhinus species diverged into two different lineages, creating a C. rafineesquii ancestor and C. mexicanus/ C. townsendii ancestor, during the warm periods of the Pliocene, approximately 5.0-2.5 mya. Then, during the <b>cooling</b> <b>period</b> of the early Pleistocene, 2.5 mya, the C. mexicanus/ C. townsendii lineage split, separating C. mexicanus and C. townsendii. During this same period, the C. townsendii species was further divided into three lineages, isolating a C. t. townsendii ancestor, a C. t. pallescens/ C. t. australis ancestor, and a C. t. ingens/ C. t. virginianus ancestor. Subsequent glacial advances around 1.8-1.0 mya finally divided all these lineages into the subspecies that are found today. The events that caused the subspeciation between C. t. ingens and C. t. virginianus {{are believed to have}} separated the already disjunct populations from each other, leading the then unified species towards separate refugia, leading to divergence and subsequent subspeciation.|$|E

This peaking concern is partially attributable to the fact much less was then known about world climate and causes of ice ages. Climate scientists were aware that predictions based on this trend were not possible - because the trend was poorly studied and not understood (for example see reference). Despite that, in the popular press the possibility of cooling was reported generally without the caveats present in the scientific reports, and [...] "unusually severe winters in Asia and parts of North America in 1972 and 1973...pushed the issue into the public consciousness".|$|E

When GSHP is used for both heating and cooling applications {{it is very important to}} determine the optimum length of GHX. In the present research the length of horizontal and vertical GHX is optimized for a 1. 5 TR GSHP system assuming different combination of heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>periods.</b> Eight operating parameters of GHX at three levels have been assumed and L 27 orthogonal array has been employed to obtain experimental trials. For both horizontal and vertical GHXs, Taguchi method has been used to obtain independent optimum length for heating and cooling applications and then utility concept has been employed to estimate a single optimum length for a given weightage for heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>periods.</b> Results were obtained for different combinations of heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>periods</b> expressed as weighting factor in utility concept, ranging from 20 % to 80 % for both type of GHXs. Effect of variation in COP of the ground source heat pump system where the GHX is used is also analyzed to determine its influence on the length of GHX. Length of vertical GHX is found to remain constant for all the combinations of heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>periods,</b> however, the length of vertical GHX is about 33 % higher for cooling than that for heating. In contrast, horizontal GHX showed about 20 % variation at lower and upper bounds and 50 % variation exactly at the middle bound...|$|R
