50|$|Fixed <b>cutter</b> <b>bits</b> {{were the}} first type of drill bit {{employed}} in rotary drilling, and they are mechanically much simpler than rolling <b>cutter</b> <b>bits.</b> The cutting elements do not move relative to the bit; {{there is no need}} for bearings or lubrication. The most common cutting element in use today is the polycrystalline diamond cutter (PDC), a sintered tungsten carbide cylinder with one flat surface coated with a synthetic diamond material. The cutters are arranged on the blades of the bit in a staggered pattern with the diamond coated cutter surface facing the direction of bit rotation to provide full coverage of the borehole bottom. Other fixed <b>cutter</b> <b>bits</b> may employ natural industrial-grade diamonds or thermal stable polycrystalline diamond (TSP) cutting elements.|$|E
5000|$|Drill bits are broadly {{classified}} into two main types {{according to their}} primary cutting mechanism. Rolling <b>cutter</b> <b>bits</b> drill largely by fracturing or crushing the formation with [...] "tooth"-shaped cutting elements on two or more cone-shaped elements that roll {{across the face of}} the borehole as the bit is rotated. Fixed <b>cutter</b> <b>bits</b> employ a set of blades with very hard cutting elements, most commonly natural or synthetic diamond, to remove material by scraping or grinding action as the bit is rotated.|$|E
50|$|Most {{rolling cutter}} and fixed {{cutter drill bits}} have {{internal}} passages to direct drilling fluid, conveyed by the drill pipe from surface pumps, through hydraulic nozzles directed {{at the bottom of}} the wellbore to produce high velocity fluid jets that assist in cleaning the old cuttings off the bottom before the next tooth contacts the rock. Placement of the nozzles, particularly in rolling <b>cutter</b> <b>bits,</b> is also often done to assist in keeping the cutting elements free of cuttings build-up in certain kinds of clay and shale formations.|$|E

Drilling {{of large}} {{diameter}} wells {{to be used}} for dewatering of lignite deposits is inefficient due to the presence of large packages of loose Quaternary and Tertiary strata. Moreover, considerable dewatering of the rock mass favors serious complications and drilling break-downs connected with the sliding of wellbore walls. Accordingly, new technical and technological solutions, which enable faster drilling, are searched for. In this way the time of operation of drilling mud on the near-wellbore zone can be shortened and the safety of drilling works increased. For the sake of obtaining higher rates of drilling in large diameter dewatering wellbores a new <b>cutter</b> <b>bit</b> 0. 96 m of diameter was designed. Drillability tests in industrial conditions followed. These tests were performed in separated, loose and low-compaction, macroscopically homogeneous rocks of similar drillability. The tests were performed on selected sections 0. 3 to 1. 0 m long, and each of the sections was drilled at constant rotational velocity and weight on bit. Prior to these tests there were established limitations regarding weight on bit and rotational velocity of the bit, in reference to the technical characteristic of the rig, strength of the string and the <b>cutter</b> <b>bit.</b> Two different regression models were considered to find a dependence of mechanical drilling rate on weight on bit and rotational velocity of the bit for selected macroscopically homogeneous strata. The most favorable results were obtained for a power model representing impact of axial stress and rotational velocity of the bit on the drilling rate. They have been confirmed by calculated regression coefficients and statistical parameters. Industrial tests were performed to assess the efficiency of drilling large diameter dewatering wells with a <b>cutter</b> <b>bit</b> of 0. 96 m diameter {{on the basis of the}} presented model of average drilling rate. The results for the average drilling rate turned out to be much higher than the ones obtained so far. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

50|$|Several factors affect {{drill bit}} selection. Due {{to the high}} number of wells that have been drilled, {{information}} from an adjacent well is most often used to make the appropriate selection. Two different types of drill bits exist: fixed cutter and roller cone. A fixed cutter bit is one where there are no moving parts, but drilling occurs due to shearing, scraping or abrasion of the rock. Fixed <b>cutter</b> <b>bits</b> can be either polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or grit hotpressed inserts (GHI) or natural diamond. Roller cone bits can be either tungsten carbide inserts (TCI) for harder formations or milled tooth (MT) for softer rock. The manufacturing process and composites used in each type of drill bit make them ideal for specific drilling situations. Additional enhancements can be made to any bit to increase the effectiveness for almost any drilling situation.|$|E
5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{rolling cutter}} drill bit design was disclosed in U.S. patents granted to Howard R. Hughes, Sr. on August 10, 1909, and {{which led to}} the creation of what became the Hughes Tool Company. This bit employed two conical steel rolling elements with milled teeth that engaged the formation, when the device was rotated, to produce the cutting action. This design represented a significant improvement in drilling performance over the so-called [...] "fish tail" [...] scraper type bits commonly used in rotary drilling at the time, and over the next two decades, rotary drilling with rolling <b>cutter</b> <b>bits</b> largely replaced all other drilling methods in the oilfield. The significance of the Hughes Two-Cone Drill Bit was recognized on its 100th anniversary when it was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{commercial}} rolling <b>cutter</b> <b>bits</b> usually employ three cones {{to contain}} the cutting elements, although two cone or (rarely) four cone arrangements are sometimes seen. These bits mainly fall into two classes depending on the manufacture of the cutting elements or [...] "teeth". Steel-tooth bits have cones that have wedge-shaped teeth milled directly in the cone steel itself. Extremely hard tungsten carbide material is often applied to the surfaces of the teeth by a welding process to improve durability. Tungsten carbide insert (TCI) bits have shaped teeth of sintered tungsten carbide press-fit into drilled holes in the cones. Some types of steel-tooth bits also have TCI elements {{in addition to the}} milled teeth. The cones rotate on roller or journal bearings that are usually sealed from the hostile down-hole drilling fluid environment by different arrangements of o-ring or metal face seals. These bits usually also have pressure compensated grease lubrication systems for the bearings.|$|E

The advancements in {{drilling}} {{have always}} {{depended on the}} cost of drilling of new wellbores, therefore mathematical models of the drilling process were elaborated to minimize the cost.

The paper addresses works which prove that in some particular situations the influence of the tools wear on the drop of rate of penetration can be neglected, thanks to which simple formulae are obtained, based on the fundamental parameters and which are easily applicable in the field conditions. The MSE is an amount of energy used for drilling a given volume of rock. This approach is useful and practicable because allows for detecting possible inefficiencies in a relatively short time (as compared to other parameters). Attempts are made to compare the drillability indications ZSP with MSE plots, thanks to which new conclusions and observations can be drawn as far as the analysis and interpretation of drillability plots is concerned.

40|$|Background: Frictional {{ignitions}} {{continue to}} be a problem facing the U. S. underground coal mining industry. Many methane ignitions are associated with the impact of mining machine <b>cutter</b> <b>bits</b> on quartzitic material (e. g., sandstone) during the coal-cutting process. Most ignitions result in small methane-air fireballs often only a few feet in size and limited to the cutter head location. However, under certain conditions, frictional ignitions can lead to larger methane explosions and/or fires with the potential for causing serious injury or death to the mining machine operator and other nearby miners. The requirements for a frictional ignition are a flammable volume of methane-air and an ignition source. This source is usually the hot streak caused by the frictional impact of the mining bit on hard rock, and the frequency of occurrence increases with increased bit wear. Another possible ignition source is the frictional impact of rock on rock during a roof fall. In addition to flammable methane gas, some underground coal mines encounter heavier molecular weight liquid hydrocarbons that can generate flammable vapors. For example, a coal mine in Utah experienced significant inflows of liquid hydrocarbons, with approximately 1, 200 gal being pumped from the mine per day. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) reported that this mine experienced several ignitions, including one in 1998 that led to a significant fire. MSHA listed liquid hydrocarbons as contributing to this fire [Elkins et al. 2001]. On July 31 -August 1, 2000, there were multiple explosions and a fire at the same mine, resulting in 2 fatalities and 12 injuries. The MSHA investigation report listed methane and liquid hydrocarbons as contributing to the explosions and fire [McKinney et al. 2001]. Approach: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effect of added hydrocarbon liquids on the frictional ignition potential from the impact of mining bits on sandstone. The experiments were conducted in a laboratory test apparatus where a single miner bit on a cutter drum struck a sandstone block. The bit was worn so that the shank steel was exposed. A 100 -ft 3 mixture of flammable methane-air was enclosed by a plastic diaphragm that broke and vented the explosion after ignition. The relative ease of ignition was measured by the number of strikes necessary to cause ignition. Tests were conducted with flammable methane-air mixtures and with added liquid hydrocarbons on the sandstone block. The first series of tests was conducted to determine the number of strikes of the bit on the sandstone block necessary to ignite a flammable mixture of methane-air. With the cutter drum rotating, the sandstone block was moved horizontally in front of the cutter bit so {{that there would be a}} fresh surface for each strike of the bit. Additional tests were done with hydrocarbon liquid sprayed on the sandstone just before each test. Since hydrocarbon liquid samples No. 530 March 2008 from actual mines were not available for this study, a liquid hydrocarbon simulant was mixed based on the MSHA analyses of the hydrocarbons at the Utah mine [Elkins et al. 2001]. MSHA reported that "the hydrocarbons were tested and were determined to be chemically similar to a mixture of 15 % gasoline, 35 % diesel fuel, and 50 % motor oil" [Elkins et al. 2001]. Results: Using a worn bit, five tests were conducted with only methane-air in the test chamber. The mixture did not ignite in any of the five tests, with an average of greater than 90 strikes per test. An additional five tests were conducted with added liquid hydrocarbon simulant on the sandstone. The methane-air mixture ignited in each of these five tests, with an average of about 30 strikes to ignition. The explanation may be that the liquid hydrocarbon ignites more easily than methane, and then it forms a pilot flame that ignites the methane. The hydrocarbon vapors can ignite at significantly lower temperatures than the methane. Based on these results, NIOSH researchers determined that the presence of a hydrocarbon liquid in the mining environment has the potential to increase the ignition hazard associated with the frictional heating from impact of steel on sandstone. Recommendations: Improving the ventilation airflow should be the main method for reducing any flammable gas volume, thereby limiting the extent of flame propagation if a frictional ignition should occur. The frictional ignition probability decreases with new sharp bits. Replacing worn bits on a regular basis and using adequate back-mounted water sprays (that cool the frictional hot spots) have been shown to reduce the frictional ignition probability of methane when used on longwall and continuous mining machines. The increased fire and explosion hazard associated with the presence of heavy hydrocarbons can be estimated by collecting and measuring the flash point of the fresh hydrocarbon liquid. If the flash point is at or below the ambient mine temperature, the liquid can ignite and burn even without methane. If the flash point is above ambient temperature, the liquid hydrocarbon can enhance the ignition probability of methane. When using a handheld methanometer in the presence of heavier hydrocarbons, the instrument needs to be calibrated with gas mixtures that reflect the presence of the heavier hydrocarbon vapors. The instrument manufacturer should be contacted for advice on calibration procedures that will ensure accurate measurement of potentially flammable mixtures. In summary, extra precautions to prevent fires and explosions must be taken when heavier molecular weight liquid hydrocarbons are present in addition to methane in an underground coal mine.

40|$|In This Chapter [Where methane is emitted at {{longwall}} faces Where methane accumulates at longwall faces Using {{the modified}} shearer-clearer to eliminate ventilation eddy zones Using a walkway curtain to reduce methane buildup during the headgate cutout Control of frictional ignitions and The best {{location for the}} methane monitor] The methane released along a longwall face represents only 10 %- 20 % of the total methane emitted from the entire longwall panel. Nevertheless, in very gassy coal seams, this methane released at the face can pose a problem because the shearer is a ready ignition source. Preventing methane ignitions at longwall faces requires four actions. The first is to provide better ventilation around the shearer to eliminate the ventilation eddy zones at the drums where methane builds up. These eddy zones are eliminated by mounting additional water sprays on the shearer to direct air into them. The second action to prevent methane ignitions is to install a water spray behind each <b>cutter</b> <b>bit</b> and regularly replace worn bits. Water sprays behind each <b>cutter</b> <b>bit</b> act to quench the hot metal streak that follows a worn bit when it strikes rock. The third {{is to ensure that}} no ventilation eddy zones are inadvertently created by poor placement of water sprays. The fourth is to ensure that the methane monitor on the shearer is in the best location to detect methane accumulations. ADDRESSING METHANE ACCUMULATIONS AT LONGWALL FACES 3 Cecala et al. [1985 a, 1989] and Denk and Wirth [1991] studied methane emission and ventilation patterns at longwall faces to find where methane accumulations are most likely. Although not always the case, the major source of methane at longwall faces is usually the breakage of coal by the shearer.
