40|$|Dense media {{separation}} (DMS) {{plays an}} integral part in coal processing {{as well as in}} the upgrade of low grade ore bodies prior to further processing like flotation and leaching. Various separating vessels are used in DMS; of which the dense media (DM) cyclone is the most common. However, the limited materials of construction available for DM cyclones leave the industry with little choice. In addition, the DM cyclones available moved away from the basic principles of classification hydrocyclones which is to reduce the turbulence in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> in order to achieve improved efficiency. The ceramic tiled DM cyclones available in the market have ceramic tiles installed perpendicular to each other in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber,</b> which increase the turbulence in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> at the expense of longer equipment life. For that reason, a research project was initiated to establish the current installed base of DM cyclones in Southern Africa and to develop and evaluate a DM cyclone with a laminar spiral <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> design to reduce the turbulence when feeding the cyclone, whilst achieving the same or superior wear properties. Because Cavex is well proven in hard rock mining and coal classification, it was used as basis for the development of a DM cyclone. Individual moulds were developed and produced in order to fabricate a Cavex DM cyclone with the exact laminar spiral <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> that exists when moulded out of rubber. Afterwards, the Cavex ceramic tiled (CVXT) cyclone was manufactured, installed and commissioned. Using the basic operating principles of hydrocyclones, the predicted results were achieved. The 650 CVXT results confirmed that a DM cyclone and a classification cyclone are inherently the same piece of equipment; it is the selection criteria and material of construction that differ. There is a definite benefit in focussing on metallurgical efficiency in conjunction with wear properties, rather than equipment life (wear life) as the only parameter during equipment fabrication. A simple way to achieve improved performance is to reduce the turbulence in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber.</b> Further work must include the evaluation of the Cavex CVXT DM cyclone in near gravity coal circuits and to investigate whether the same lower operating pressures (6 D compared to conventional 9 D) will result in improved coal yield, as was illustrated successfully in the separation of fluorspar by DMS, whilst achieving the desired ash contents. The work must include detailed studies on the effect of feed pressure vs. yield/recovery, when the turbulence the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> is reduced. Overall energy savings should be quantified by reducing the cyclone feed pressure...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the thermal}} Power Plants in the Kyushu Districts {{are obliged to}} use low quality coal for fuel, they have no {{alternative}} but to utilize combustion of pulverized coal. The Unit System Tube Mill is a low costing Pulveruzer, but this system has its difficulties with automatic <b>coal</b> <b>feeding.</b> The reason being that as the feed control is carried out by interlinking the draft of the exhauster which blows the pulverized coal into the furnace with the feed rate of the coal feeder, after operation over a long period，excessive quantities of coal accumulates within the mill causing Mill- over or shortage of pulverized coal comes about decreasing the load of the Power Plant. With such difficulties constantly happening, perfect automatic combustion cannot be obtained. These defects can be corrected by disconnecting the interlink between the coal feeder and the exhauster, and controlling the feed rate of the coal feeder so that a fixed quantity of coal is constantly retained within the Tube Mill. Since a detector is necessary to determine the quantity of coal retained in the Tube Mill, the Author has invented and developed an Electro-acoustic Mill Level Meter which is quick responding and enables the operator to accurately detect the quantity of coal retained within the Mill. Recently the Unit System Tube Mill <b>coal</b> <b>feeding</b> system of the No. 2 Minato Power Plant of the Kyushu Power Company was completely switched to automatic operation by the use of this invention.

40|$|Highveld parent coal {{was crushed}} into three size fractions, namely: 5 mm– 75 mm, 5 mm– 53 mm, and 5 – 37. 5 mm. The crushed samples were {{subjected}} as <b>feed</b> <b>coals</b> to heating in a packed-bed reactor {{to investigate the}} influence of particle size reduction on char formation and reactivity. Coal petrography was utilized to assess the maceral and char formation distribution of the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The maceral distribution of the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. Maceral distribution was further divided into total reactive maceral particles, total inert maceral particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> samples had the highest total reactive maceral particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high inertinite maceral group content of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample had higher content of total reactive maceral particles and lower content of total inert maceral particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample had high content of reactive maceral particles and high content of total inert maceral particles. This variation in maceral group content lead to the 53 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample. This was due to inert maceral particles restricting the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas. This was also this was attributed to variation in volatile propagation of the three particle sizes. This confirms that a <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> with smaller particle sizes results in different reactivity, char formation, and better heat transfer during combustion than the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> with large particle size range. Another important factor that {{plays a role in}} combustion is maceral association; it was observed that maceral distribution has a great influence on the char formation and its reactivity more than coal particle size.

The transport reactor is an advanced circulating fluidized-bed reactor designed to operate as either a combustor or a gasifier using one of two possible particulate control devices (PCDs). The transport reactor was operated as a pressurized gasifier during GCT 3. GCT 3 was planned as a 250 -hour test run to commission the loop seal and continue the characterization {{of the limits of}} operational parameter variations using a blend of several Powder River Basin coals and Bucyrus limestone from Ohio. The primary test objectives were: (1) Loop Seal Commissioning [...] Evaluate the operational stability of the loop seal with sand and limestone as a bed material at different solids circulation rates and establish a maximum solids circulation rate through the loop seal with the inert bed. (2) Loop Seal Operations [...] Evaluate the loop seal operational stability during <b>coal</b> <b>feed</b> operations and establish maximum solids circulation rate. Secondary objectives included the continuation of reactor characterization, including: (1) Operational Stability [...] Characterize the reactor loop and PCD operations with short-term tests by varying <b>coal</b> <b>feed,</b> air/coal ratio, riser velocity, solids circulation rate, system pressure, and air distribution. (2) Reactor Operations [...] Study the devolatilization and tar cracking effects from transient conditions during transition from start-up burner to coal. Evaluate the effect of process operations on heat release, heat transfer, and accelerated fuel particle heat-up rates. Study the effect of changes in reactor conditions on transient temperature profiles, pressure balance, and product gas composition. (3) Effects of Reactor Conditions on Syngas Composition [...] Evaluate the effect of air distribution, steam/coal ratio, solids circulation rate, and reactor temperature on CO/CO{sub 2 } ratio, H{sub 2 }/converted carbon ratio, gasification rates, carbon conversion, and cold and hot gas efficiencies. Test run GCT 3 was started on December 1, 2000, with the startup of the thermal oxidizer fan, and was completed on February 1, 2001. This test was conducted in two parts; the loop seal was commissioned during {{the first part of this}} test run from December 1 through 15, which consisted of hot inert solids circulation testing.
