5|$|Originally, Manstein {{was promised}} four panzer divisions. Due to German {{reluctance}} to weaken certain sectors by redeploying German units, {{the task of}} opening a <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> German 6th Army fell to the 4th Panzer Army. The German force was pitted against several Soviet armies tasked with {{the destruction of the}} encircled German forces and their offensive around the lower Chir River.|$|E
5|$|Abd el-Hamid {{meanwhile}} {{reported the}} dire situation of his forces at 5:30 PM on October 17. The 16th Brigade {{had been in}} heavy combat for three consecutive days – ammunition was becoming scarce, and the brigade was heavily outnumbered and outgunned due to its losses, including the destruction of its artillery units. Abd el-Hamid received orders from 16th Division headquarters to retreat. His brigade abandoned its Chinese Farms positions and reinforced {{the lines of the}} 18th Mechanized Brigade to the north during the night of October 17/18. This finally opened the Tirtur and Akavish roads to Israeli forces, ensuring Operation Abiray-Lev would proceed. Missouri remained in Egyptian hands though, posing a threat to the Israeli <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canal.|$|E
5|$|Alcatraz cellhouse had a {{corridor}} naming system named after major American streets and landmarks. Michigan Avenue was the <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side of A-Block, and Broadway {{was the central}} corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with a clock on the wall), before entering the dining hall for their meals. Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. The corridor in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of}} each block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E

5|$|Herbivores, {{including}} wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela {{conservation area}} and migration <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{south of the}} park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season {{and return to the}} park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the Ministry of Transport invited {{construction}} company Freeman Fox, Wilbur Smith Associates (FFWSA) {{to investigate and}} report {{on the impact of}} the New Town proposals on traffic demand between the proposed New Town site and Wolverhampton, and the best highway solution to meet this demand. The predicted demand was that of 75,000 vehicles per day by 1990 and a need for a dual 3-lane motorway. Two corridors were identified for a possible new motorway route, and a third option to possibly upgrade existing roads. The route could have followed the A5 <b>Corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> M6 South of Gailey, at junction 12, or a new corridor could have been established to the M6, north-east of Featherstone, at junction 11. Additionally, it was proposed that the existing A5 could be upgraded to full dual carriageway grade separated standards together with improvements to the A41 and A464 trunk routes.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, other {{difficulties}} were surfacing. Sharon {{reported to}} Southern Command that {{one section of}} the roller bridge, being towed by Erez's brigade, had been damaged and that the engineers needed a few hours to repair it. He also requested additional forces to help secure the corridor, noting the stiff resistance facing Reshef's brigade. Sharon's report prompted Bar-Lev to alert Adan to prepare to open the corridor with his division. Sharon argued for Adan's division to cross the canal on rafts and to proceed with Operation Abiray-Lev without waiting for the bridges. Both Gonen and Bar-Lev rejected Sharon's suggestion since, without a secure <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canal, Israeli forces on the west bank would be threatened with encirclement. Subsequently, Bar-Lev ordered that no more Israeli forces or equipment would cross to the west bank until the bridges had been laid.|$|E

From its south end at I-110 in San Pedro, it heads east across the Vincent Thomas Bridge to the island {{and the end of}} state maintenance. The state highway begins again at the junction with I-710 on Terminal Island, crossing the Schuyler Heim Bridge north to the mainland and the second terminus, where SR 103 begins.

5|$|The Battle of the Chinese Farm {{took place}} during October 15 to October 17, 1973 between the Egyptian Army and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), {{as part of the}} Yom Kippur War. It was fought in the Sinai Peninsula, north of the Great Bitter Lake and just east of the Suez Canal, near an Egyptian {{agricultural}} research station. The farm featured specialized Japanese-made machinery; Israeli soldiers mistook Japanese characters on this equipment for Chinese, leading to the area being labeled 'Chinese Farm' on Israeli military maps. The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev ("Stouthearted Men"), attempting to establish a <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing. Accordingly, the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm.|$|E
5|$|The Ben Franklin Bridge {{was opened}} on July 1, 1926 and was {{designated}} to carry US 30 across the Delaware River. A parkway called the Camden-Atlantic City Parkway was planned in 1932 {{to connect the}} Ben Franklin Bridge southeast to Atlantic City; this was never built. After World War II, freeway connections were planned {{on both sides of}} the Ben Franklin Bridge. In Philadelphia, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the Vine Street <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present-day Schuylkill Expressway in 1945. The North-South Freeway was proposed in New Jersey as a connection from the bridge south along the Route 42 corridor. In 1950, the city of Philadelphia began planning the construction of the Vine Street Expressway, which would run along a depressed alignment through the city.|$|E

5|$|At around 4:00 PM on October 17, the {{pontoon bridge}} had been fully assembled, opening the first Israeli {{bridge across the}} canal. The roller bridge was laid soon after at dawn on October 18, and by afternoon, Adan's {{division}} crossed {{to the west bank}} followed by Kalman Magen's division. Adan, supported by Magen, would go on to reach Suez after the failure of a United Nations ceasefire, thereby cutting off two infantry divisions of the Egyptian Third Field Army. Sharon also crossed with part of his division, simultaneously trying to defend and expand the Israeli <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Suez Canal—as well attacking northwards on the west bank to Ismailia in an attempt to similarly cut off the Second Army. His efforts bogged down, and he was unable to reach Ismailia (see Battle of Ismailia), while attempts to seize critical positions and expand the Israeli corridor on the east bank saw little to no success.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} that day, Egyptian Chief-of-Staff Saad el-Shazly arrived at Second Army Headquarters in Ismailia, at President Sadat's request. Shazly sought {{to assess the}} situation {{and to work with}} Khalil on a plan to counter the Israeli advance. They agreed to withdraw the 15th Armored Brigade from the east bank and keep it north of Ismailia as a reserve force, and to have Egyptian forces on the east bank attack southward to sever or at least narrow the Israeli <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canal. Azmy's brigade meanwhile would continue defending the area south of the Ismailia Canal, and additional Sa'iqa units would be committed. Shazly also solved a major problem concerning anti-tank weaponry. Azmy's brigade was almost completely lacking anti-tank weapons; it had been stripped of its anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) battalion, equipped with AT-3 Saggers and RPG-7s, which was sent to the east bank to support the initial offensive. This battalion, and a second belonging to the 118th Infantry Brigade, were now withdrawn from the east bank throughout October 18 and brought back to their units. Shazly and Khalil carried out these orders in relative secrecy, as they were disobeying direct orders from Sadat and the Minister of War, Ahmed Ismail, not to withdraw any units from the east bank. Several measures decided upon were not implemented however.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Major Generals Shmuel Gonen and Chaim Bar-Lev, {{the heads}} of Israeli Southern Command and Sharon's superiors, {{continued}} to press Sharon to send forces to the east bank to widen the <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Israeli bridgehead, while Sharon ignored these commands repeatedly, claiming that the attacks were unnecessary. Gonen finally issued a peremptory order to Sharon to transfer troops to the east bank and conduct a full-scale attack to widen the corridor. Sharon only sent five tanks as reinforcement to the armored brigade on the east bank tasked with launching the attack. Consequently, the Israelis suffered heavy losses and the assault was repulsed. Gonen and Bar-Lev were now joined by Lieutenant General David Elazar, and ordered Sharon to renew the attack, this time transferring Reshef's brigade. Sharon opposed this however, and argued that if he succeeded in his mission, the Egyptian Second Army would collapse, thereby eliminating any Egyptian threat to the Israeli corridor and bridgehead. He retorted with the claim that {{had it not been}} for Southern Command's hesitation, he could have encircled Ismailia by now. When his superiors remained adamant, Sharon bypassed the chain of command and contacted the Minister of Defense, Moshe Dayan, who called off any further attacks on the east bank. As a result, Sharon would be able to concentrate his attention and the efforts of his three brigades in the final push to capture Ismailia.|$|E

5|$|East of MD43 and the {{adjacent}} General Services Administration facility, MD150 becomes a five-lane road with center turn lane east to Carroll Island Road. East of that county highway, {{which leads to}} the community of Bowleys Quarters, the state highway reduces to two lanes. MD150 passes under a Norfolk Southern Railway spur from the Amtrak Northeast <b>Corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Charles P. Crane Generating Station and intersects Marshy Point Road, which leads into Dundee Natural Environment Area. The route ends at its intersection with Ebenezer Road and Graces Quarter Road in the community of Chase. Graces Quarter Road serves as a connector to the main section of the county highway, which heads east into a unit of Gunpowder Falls State Park. The county highway also heads west as Ebenezer Road, which passes over Eastern Avenue and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor immediately to the northeast on Eastern Avenue. Eastern Avenue itself continues northeast as a county highway to its end at Greenbank Road on the Gunpowder River.|$|E
5|$|Newark Penn Station, {{situated}} {{just east}} of downtown, is the city's major train station.

5|$|The German {{offensive}} {{caught the}} Red Army by surprise and made large gains {{on the first}} day. The spearhead forces enjoyed air support {{and were able to}} defeat counterattacks by Soviet troops. By 13 December, Soviet resistance slowed the German advance considerably. Although German forces took the area surrounding Verkhne-Kumskiy, the Red Army launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December. Operation Little Saturn crushed the Italian 8th Army on Army Group Don's left flank, threatening the survival of Manstein's entire group of forces. As resistance and casualties increased, Manstein appealed to Hitler and to the commander of the German 6th Army, General Friedrich Paulus, to allow the 6th Army to break out of Stalingrad; both refused. The 4th Panzer Army continued its attempt to open a <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 6th Army on 18–19 December, but was unable to do so without the aid of forces inside the Stalingrad pocket. Manstein was forced to call off the assault on 23 December and by Christmas Eve the 4th Panzer Army began to withdraw to its starting position. Due to the failure of the 6th Army to breakout and the attempt to break the Soviet encirclement, the Red Army was able to continue the strangulation of German forces in Stalingrad.|$|E

5|$|The failed Egyptian {{offensive}} {{gave the}} initiative to the Israelis, who immediately launched Operation Abiray-Lev, aiming to cross the canal between two Egyptian armies in order to encircle Egyptian forces on the east banks and cut their supply lines. Optimistically planned, the operation began smoothly, but quickly ran into problems. The Israelis faced difficulties in establishing a <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canal due to unexpectedly determined resistance by Egyptian defenses, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of the Chinese Farm. After several days of heavy fighting, they were able to secure the roads to the canal, and by October 18 had two bridges laid down at Deversoir, at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake. By the next day there were three Israeli armored divisions across the canal. Two advanced south toward Suez City, while the 143rd Armored Division under Major General Ariel Sharon advanced north to seize Ismailia, hoping to sever the supply lines to three Egyptian divisions of the Second Field Army across the canal.|$|E
5|$|Tuvia Raviv's armored brigade {{began its}} diversionary {{attack against the}} 16th Division's {{bridgehead}} at 5:00 PM on October 15, striking at the bridgehead's center from the east, after a fire preparation. It was repulsed by the Egyptians, as had been expected, but succeeded in its purpose. When the 16th Division's southern flank came under increasing Israeli attack, the Egyptians assumed that the Israeli objective was to roll up the Second Army's right flank, not to open a <b>corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west bank for Israeli forces to cross the canal. For the next 24 hours, this remained the general impression among Egyptian commanders, and they reacted accordingly.

5|$|With {{the area}} having a {{generally}} low density and lacking transit-oriented development, the Metrorail {{was designed as}} a park and ride system, with the idea being that suburban residents would drive to the stations, then commute {{the rest of the way}} into the city. Nearly all of the stations outside of downtown Miami have parking facilities, except Tri-Rail Station. Several have large parking garages, such as Dadeland North and South stations, located at the southern end of the system, which combined have space for over 3,000 cars. Earlington Heights, located just northwest of Downtown and adjacent to Interstate 95 and the Airport Expressway, has a large garage that was formerly dedicated to Metrorail riders. However, that is now used by the county due to the station's low ridership, with only 95 vehicle spaces currently available. The successful Dadeland garages are at or over capacity, with two of Metrorail's proposed extensions, the West Kendall Corridor and South Link, intended to help alleviate them. The two northernmost stations, which are located near the Palmetto Expressway, Palmetto and Okeechobee, appeal to Broward County commuters with nearly 2,000 combined spaces. Additionally, the proposed North <b>Corridor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Broward/Miami-Dade county line would have included five park and ride facilities totaling 2,650 spaces. In the late 1990s, the plan was to potentially even continue the Metrorail line into Broward County along 27th Avenue (University Drive), ending at Broward Boulevard near Broward Mall in Plantation.|$|E
