50|$|On February 29, 2012, ZoomerMedia {{received}} a license from the CRTC. In that same decision, a <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> by Evanov Communications for a soft adult contemporary station on 102.9 was denied. The station was originally {{to operate at}} 104.9 MHz; however, Bayshore Broadcasting was approved to use the 104.9 frequency in Shelburne, forcing CFMO-FM to find an alternate frequency.|$|E
50|$|In the licence approval, {{however, the}} CRTC noted {{that because the}} 103.9 {{frequency}} is second-adjacent to Evanov's own Z103.5, and Evanov would therefore have to give its consent to accept a zone of radio frequency interference to Z103's signal, the company would effectively have held a veto over any <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> for the frequency. The Catholic station, conversely, was one of eight applicants for a single frequency, 101.3, which was awarded to the multicultural station CJSA-FM.|$|E

50|$|The station {{originated}} as CKIQ-AM, first {{signing on}} the air on November 8, 1971. It was {{owned and operated by}} veteran broadcasters Walter Gray, who would later serve as three-term mayor of Kelowna, and Bob Hall through their company Four Seasons Radio. Four Seasons also owned several stations in Golden, Revelstoke and Salmon Arm. The licence, for an AM station operating on 1150 kHz with a day and night power of 1,000 watts, was awarded July 22 of the same year and beat out a <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> from J.B. Cooper.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} first {{licensed}} in 2005 with the call sign CKNS-FM. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the {{application for a}} station serving Haldimand, but assigned the frequency for which the station initially applied, 106.7 FM, to another station in a nearby market (CIKZ). Bel-Roc Communications then applied for 92.9, from a transmitter location approximately 20 kilometers east of the original, at lower effective radiated power, but from a higher tower. A contemporaneous <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> from CHCD in nearby Simcoe, Ontario sought the adjacent frequency, 93.1, for a CHCD repeater in Haldimand.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, Rufino Landry {{on behalf}} of a company to be {{incorporated}} (would be known as Radio-Aboiteaux ltée), received approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to operate a new French-language AM radio station at Moncton. CHLR-AM would be the first private French radio station in Moncton with an effective radiated power was 10,000 watts. Also the same year, a <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> by Edward J. McGrath (English, 1400 kHz, 10,000 watts) was denied on the grounds, since Moncton could not support two new stations.In 1984, CHLR was authorized to become an affiliate of the network operated by Télémédia Communications Inc.|$|E

50|$|Direct3D and OpenGL are <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> {{programming}} interfaces (APIs) {{which can}} be used in applications to render 2D and 3D computer graphics. Hardware acceleration of this process has been commonplace since approximately 1999. , graphics processing units (GPUs) almost always implement one version of both of these APIs. Examples include: DirectX 9 and OpenGL 2 circa 2004; DirectX 10 and OpenGL 3 circa 2008; and most recently, DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4 circa 2011. GPUs that support more recent versions of the standards are backward-compatible with applications that use the older standards; for example, one can run older DirectX 9 games on a more recent DirectX 11-certified GPU.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> {{with the}} FCC, coupled with {{difficulties}} finding a tower location that would satisfy the FAA, delayed {{the construction of}} KUOO for roughly two years.

50|$|With CNN {{already being}} widely {{available}} in Canada during the 1980s, private and public Canadian broadcasters began {{to apply for a}} licence for a similar 24-hour news service in Canada. In 1987 the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) awarded a licence to the CBC. Its launch was delayed several times: first when Allarcom, who had filed a <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> for an all-news channel, chose to appeal the CRTC decision; second, when the federal cabinet issued a directive to the CBC to revise its service plan for the network to include private commercial broadcasters and to launch a parallel French language service; and finally when cable companies were reluctant to add the service just five months after a similar launch of numerous other channels.|$|E
50|$|On July 11, 1977, Ed Skutnik {{filed an}} {{application}} {{on behalf of}} his Company, Green Valley Broadcasting Co., Ltd. for a construction permit to build a new FM station in Greenfield, Massachusetts. It was designated for hearing by the FCC when a <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> was filed by Poet's Seat Broadcasting, Inc. for the same vacant FM channel (95.3 MHz in Greenfield). After comparative hearings at the FCC, the FCC Administrative Law Judge decided in August 1979 that Green Valley Broadcasting Co. should be awarded the construction permit. Poet's Seat appealed the decision to a three-member FCC judicial panel. They upheld the original decision to award the construction permit to Green Valley Broadcasting Co. Poet's Seat appealed once more to the seven FCC commissioners, who voted 7-0 in Green Valley's favor. This gave Green Valley Broadcasting Co. the authority to begin construction starting in January 1981.|$|E
50|$|However, {{shortly after}} the {{transaction}} occurred, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC's rules giving preferential treatment to companies owned by minorities {{to allow them to}} acquire licenses under agency investigation were unconstitutional. As a result, the FCC rejected Whitehead's application. However, even though the U.S. Supreme Court decided to uphold the ruling by the D.C. Appeals Court when the case regarding the purchase discounts for minority firms was brought to a hearing in 1990, Whitehead and Diller chose to submit their application to the FCC once again. However, San Francisco-based West Coast United Broadcasting Co.; Arthur Liu of New York City-based Multicultural Radio Broadcasting Inc. and a consortium between Tennessee-based Pen Holdings Inc. and San Jose developer John S. Wong each filed petitions objecting to the sale. West Coast United Broadcasting subsequently filed a <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> to the FCC, in doing so filing a challenge to Diller and Whitehead's argument that they had full rights to purchase the station.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{well-known}} local newspaperman, Al McIntosh, {{became aware of}} an application pending at the FCC to locate an AM radio station in Luverne. This application was initiated by {{the owner of a}} radio station in York, NE, so McIntosh convinced four other local businessmen, Mort Skewes, Warren Schoon, Rollie Swanson, and Dominic Lippi, to join forces and submit a <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> to the FCC. These two applications were mutually exclusive, and sat {{in the hands of the}} FCC for upwards of two years before local stakeholders accelerated the process. In the spring of 1968 Paul Hedberg, an experienced owner of another radio station in southern Minnesota, joined the five businessmen from Luverne, and together they entered negotiations with their competitor to withdraw his application with the FCC. Soon thereafter the FCC granted the six-member ownership group, now organized as Siouxland Broadcasting, the construction permit for KQAD. At its inception KQAD broadcast a pop music format, and was affiliated with the ABC Radio Network.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1961, Robert Crites, {{owner and}} manager of local CBS-affiliated radio station KBLU, formed a partnership, called Desert Telecasting, and applied to the FCC on November 30, 1961 for a {{construction}} permit to build a station on channel 13. New England Industries had filed a <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> for the same channel nearly a month earlier, but on July 23, 1962, the FCC granted the construction permit to Desert Telecasting, and KBLU-TV came into existence, to be the market's CBS television affiliate. [...] It {{would not be an}} easy road to sign-on, as Bruce Merrill, owner of both KIVA and the local cable television system, was convinced that the market could not support a second local television station and fought to keep the new station from opening. Merrill opposed a KBLU-TV partnership restructure, an extension of time to construct the station, and a proposal to increase power, then, in September 1963, filed a [...] "motion to stay" [...] to prevent KBLU-TV from building its facilities. [...] All of Merrill's petitions were denied, and on the evening of November 2, 1963, one hour after receiving notice of program test authority, KBLU-TV began broadcasting.|$|E
5000|$|Beside {{his stock}} and stock {{reserved}} for Disinger, Neumann and Smith, Scanlan sold off stock to 43 other stockholders, mostly residents of Alpena. The construction permit application was filed on September 22, 1971 and specified using {{the tower of}} WHSB-FM radio at Manning Hill, near Lachine, MI, some 15 miles west of Alpena. Expectations were that the permit would be granted and the station {{could be on the}} air by the summer of 1972, most likely as an ABC affiliate. On November 22, 1971 a <b>competing</b> <b>application</b> was filed for Channel 11 by a group headed by cable operator Bruce Freel. Freel's North American Broadcasting Company specified a much larger coverage area than that applied for by Scanlan, with a 792 foot tower near Millersburg, and coverage extending well to the west of Interstate 75. To maximize its opportunity to receive a grant in the event the FCC designated the two applications for a hearing, Scanlan amended the Thunder Bay application in 1972 to specify a shared tower with Alpena's non-commercial WCML-TV, Channel 6. With both Freel's and Scanlan's group applying for facilities that would duplicate, to a small degree, that of Traverse City's WGTU, Channel 29, Traverse City, the President of WGTU, Thomas Kiple, urged his group, Northern Entertainment, to ask the FCC to invoke their [...] "UHF Impact Policy" [...] on the applications. The UHF Impact Policy is no longer active, but at the time, 1972, the FCC would entertain applications to limit, or deny applications from proposed VHF facilities seeking new or improved facilities that would duplicate existing or planned UHF coverage.|$|E

40|$|The global {{nature of}} energy creates {{challenges}} and opportunities for developing operating system policies to effectively manage energy consumption in batterypowered mobile/wireless devices. The proposed currentcy model creates the framework for the operating system to manage energy as a first-class resource. Furthermore, currentcy provides a powerful mechanism to formulate energy goals and to unify resource management policies across diverse <b>competing</b> <b>applications</b> and spanning device components with very different power characteristics. This paper explores {{the ability of the}} currentcy model to capture more complex interactions and to express more mature energy goals than previously considered. We carry out this exploration in ECOSystem, an “energycentric” Linux-based operating system. We extend ECOSystem to address four new goals: 1) reducing residual battery capacity {{at the end of the}} targeted battery lifetime when it is no longer required (e. g., recharging is available), 2) dynamic tracking of the energy needs of <b>competing</b> <b>applications</b> for more effective energy sharing, 3) reducing response time variation caused by limited energy availability, and 4) energy efficient disk management. Our results show that the currentcy model can express complex energy-related goals and behaviors, leading to more effective, unified management policies than those that develop from per-device approaches. ...|$|R
