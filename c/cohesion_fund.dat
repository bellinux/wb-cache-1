25|$|Since {{joining the}} EU in 1973, Ireland has {{received}} over €17 billion in EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These {{are made up}} of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) and were used to increase investment in the education system and to build physical infrastructure. These transfer payments from members of the European Union, such as Germany and France, were as high as 4% of Ireland's gross national product (GNP). Ireland is unique among cohesion countries, having allocated up to 35% of its Structural Funds to human resource investments, compared with an average of around 25% for other <b>cohesion</b> <b>fund</b> recipients. The Irish economy's increased productive capacity is sometimes attributed to these investments, which made Ireland more attractive to high-tech businesses, though the libertarian Cato Institute has suggested that the EU transfer payments were economically inefficient and may have actually slowed growth. The conservative Heritage Foundation also attributed to transfer payments no significant role in causing growth.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecent {{debt crisis}} in several European {{countries}} has triggered a debate concerning the government debt sustainability and management. One {{of the important}} topics {{is the question of}} public expenditures and their efficiency.

However, to perform proper evaluation and use modern methods it is necessary to have a robust and complex database which allows researchers and policy makers to utilize modern data-demanding methods. Although there are many data sources in the Czech Republic there is no single complex database covering all cohesion expenditure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} the European Union {{regional}} policy on growth and convergence of productivity. We constructed a large database on Structural and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>funds</b> by gathering information on three programming periods: 1975 - 1988, 1989 - 1993, 1994 - 1999. On average, EU funding had a positive, but concave, effect on productivity growth. However, by separately considering the three programming periods and the composition of the funds according to the objectives defined by the EU, we find that: i) only the funds allocated in the third programming period, when they remarkably increased, had a significant impact; and ii) only Objective 1 and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>funds</b> played a significantly positive effect, while funds devoted to Objectives 2, 3, 4 and 5 had a non significant or small effect. These results indicate that funding became effective when it reached a critical level, and that the funds allocated to Objectives different from Objective 1 and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> may hinder the efficient reallocation of resources across sectors i...|$|R

40|$|In view {{to improve}} the {{competitiveness}} and economic growth {{as well as to}} 		diminish the gaps between Romania and the EU developed states, the Structural and 		<b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> represent an outstanding source of investment. 		The operationalisation of the structural instruments is paramount for a sustainable socio- 		economic development. 		After Romania joined the European Union, during the programming period 2007 - 2013, 		Romania has been allocated approximately 19. 21 billion euro from Structural and 		<b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> and Romania’s contribution (including private sources) to complement the 		EU investments was forecasted to reach at least 5. 6 billion euro.
