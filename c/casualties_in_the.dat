5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy <b>casualties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battles. Estimates of {{the number}} of Austro-Hungarian casualties vary. Jordan states that the Austro-Hungarians suffered a total of 37,000 <b>casualties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle, of whom 7,000 were fatalities.

Historian David Stevenson states that 4,500 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|<b>Casualties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle are {{notoriously}} hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception (Scipion), records {{made by the}} French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither {{of which can be}} treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French <b>casualties</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.|$|E

5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations was perhaps tested {{by the rise of}} the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel. These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian <b>casualties.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E
