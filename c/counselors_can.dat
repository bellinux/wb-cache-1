The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to focus on what they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school <b>counselors</b> <b>can</b> be key players in student success.

2500|$|Typically counselors {{will suggest}} an {{applicant}} {{apply to a}} mix of {{the different types of}} schools, usually having at least one safety school, but the numbers of the others are up to students and families. Andover's counseling director recommends that a student apply to a minimum of two [...] "solid" [...] schools and two [...] "probable" [...] schools. Many high schools subscribe to an online service called Naviance, which, among other things, can help a student gauge the likelihood of admission to a particular college. It is based on a student's grades and test scores in comparison to the admissions results from students from previous years applying to that particular college (see diagram). Naviance uses a scattergram to graphically illustrate the chances for a student from a particular high school being admitted into a particular college or university. In addition, <b>counselors</b> <b>can</b> help a student consider different types of colleges, such as liberal arts colleges, research universities, and specialty schools.
