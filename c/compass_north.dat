Kate discovers that Sun speaks English {{when the two}} are working in the garden, and Sun asks her not to tell anyone. Locke finds Sayid {{trying to make sense}} of Danielle Rousseau's maps, and gives him a compass. Sayid tells Jack that {{according}} to Locke's <b>compass,</b> <b>north</b> is not where it should be, causing him to believe that the instrument is defective. Hurley and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) spend the day fishing. After Hurley fails to catch anything and accidentally steps on a sea urchin after giving up, Jin treats the wound and later gives Hurley a fish.|$|E
25|$|This {{two-level}} {{station has}} two island platforms (one on each level) and four tracks. It stands {{over the south}} (railroad east) side of the roadway, but formerly spanned the whole plaza. Trains running into Queens stop on the upper level and Manhattan-bound trains below. The BMT Astoria Line (which to the south joins with the 60th Street Tunnel Connection and heads through the 60th Street Tunnel to the BMT Broadway Line) uses the two tracks west (<b>compass</b> <b>north)</b> of the platforms and the IRT Flushing Line uses the east two tracks.|$|E

2500|$|Compass {{problems}} {{are one of}} the cited phrases in many Triangle incidents. While some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the area, such anomalies have not been found. Compasses have natural magnetic variations in relation to the magnetic poles, a fact which navigators have known for centuries. Magnetic (<b>compass)</b> <b>north</b> and geographic (true) north are only exactly the same for a small number of places – for example, as of 2000, in the United States, only those places on a line running from Wisconsin to the Gulf of Mexico.|publisher=United States Geological Survey|url=http://geomag.usgs.gov/charts/IGRF2000.dec.na.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-02-28}} But the public may not be as informed, and think there is something mysterious about a compass [...] "changing" [...] across an area as large as the Triangle, which it naturally will.|$|E

2500|$|Outside of the village, NY371 {{heads in}} a {{generally}} northeasterly direction {{through the town}} of Cohocton, following the Cohocton River valley through sparsely populated areas of the town. Over the next , the route closely parallels {{the river and the}} main line of the B Rail Corporation as it serves a series of farms and a small hamlet known as Kirkwood. At Atlanta, a hamlet about [...] west of NY371, the river valley turns west toward Wayland. While the B line curves westward to follow the valley, NY371 continues north to the smaller community of North Cohocton, where it passes a block of homes before ending at a junction with NY21. Like NY415 in Cohocton, NY21 is straight (<b>compass</b> <b>north)</b> ahead while NY21 south is reached by turning left (compass west).|$|E
6000|$|On {{the east}} coast of Admiralty Inlet, there is a broad sound with very deep water and rapid tides, but affording good {{anchorage}} in the mouth of the river. Here Vancouver landed and took formal possession of the country on Monday, the 4th of June, (with the usual solemnities, and under a royal salute from the ships), in the name of his Britannic Majesty King George the Third, and for his heirs and successors--that day being His Majesty's birthday--from latitude 39 degrees 20 minutes to the entrance of this inlet, supposed to be the Strait of Juan de Fuca, as well the northern as the southern shores, together with those situated in the interior sea, extending from the said strait in various directions between the north-west, north-east, and south quarters. This interior sea he named the Gulf of Georgia, and the continent bounding the said gulf, and extending southward to the 45th degree of north latitude, New Georgia, in honour of His Majesty George the Third. The sound he named, from this incident, Possession Sound. Of the country round the sound he thus writes:--"Our eastern view was now bounded by the range of snowy mountains from Mount Baker, bearing by <b>compass</b> <b>north,</b> to Mount Rainier, bearing north 54 degrees east. This mountain was hid by the more elevated parts of the low land; and the intermediate snowy mountains, in various rugged and grotesque shapes, were seen just to rear their heads above the lofty pine trees, which appeared to compose an uninterrupted forest between us and the snowy range, presenting a most pleasing landscape; nor was our west view destitute of similar diversification. The ridge of mountains on which Mount Olympus is situated, whose rugged summits were seen no less fancifully towering over the forest than those of the east side, bounded to a considerable extent our western horizon; on these, however, not one conspicuous eminence arose, nor could we now distinguish that which on the sea-coast appeared to be centrally situated, forming an elegant biforked mountain. From the south extremity of these ridges of mountains there seemed to be an extensive tract of land, moderately elevated and beautifully diversified by pleasing inequalities of surface, enriched with every appearance of fertility." ...|$|E
