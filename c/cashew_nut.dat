40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of the addition of <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> meal (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 %) to laying hen diets on egg quality and yolk composition. The variables studied were: egg weight, specific gravity, Haugh Units, percentages of shell, albumen, and yolk, moisture, total solids, total lipids, fatty acids profile, and yolk cholesterol. The addition of up to 25 % of <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> meal to hen diets did not affect egg quality and freshness, moisture and total solids content. However, an increase in total lipid content and a decrease in yolk pigmentation was observed. Oleic acid level increased in the yolk, whereas palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acid levels decreased. The addition of <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> meal increased the monounsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio in the yolk and reduced the cholesterol content. Therefore, the use of <b>cashew</b> <b>nuts</b> meal in laying hen diets favorably modifies the fatty acid composition of egg yolk and contributes to a better acceptance of this food by consumers since it also reduces yolk cholesterol levels...|$|R
