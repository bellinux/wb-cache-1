40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to design an intelligent control system for die casting processes involving cooling of a die with multiple channels. The work consists of two parks. First, a correlation between die insert temperature and <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> outlet temperature is established, {{which can be used}} to deduce local die surface temperatures without destructively inserting thermal sensors into a die from its back. Second, a new on-line thermal management scheme is proposed based on an intelligent real-time monitoring and control system (IRMCS) developed for a die insert containing multiple cooling channels. In this scheme, extra <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> controlled by a pump and solenoid valves are hooked up to each established cooling channel. The system is capable of monitoring temperature signals from the die insert and flow rate signals from the cooling lines {{on the basis of its}} built-in control algorithms. Pump and solenoid valves can be actuated either automatically or manually to introduce additional <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> to the die insert for preventing die overheating.

40|$|The SWR 1000 {{fuel pool}} coolers are tubular heat exchangers. They are {{installed}} on the fuel pool wall around the spent fuel storage racks. Fuel pool <b>water</b> is <b>cooled</b> by means of natural convection. Forced circulation flow of closed-cooling water exists on the tube side of each heat exchanger. The penetrations of the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> supply <b>lines</b> through the fuel pool liner are all located above the pool water surface. This ensures that the fuel pool cannot lose water {{in the event of}} a pipe break. Integration of the cooling components inside the fuel pool ensures only noncontaminated piping within the reactor building. The fuel pool cooling system consists of two redundant cooling trains.

40|$|A {{thin layer}} of fresh water from summer monsoon rain and river runoff in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) has {{profound}} influence on air-sea interaction across the south Asian region, but the mechanisms that sustain the low-salinity layer are as yet unknown. Using the first long time series of high-frequency observations from a mooring in the north BoB and satellite salinity data, we show that fresh water from major rivers is transported by large-scale flow and eddies, and shallow salinity stratification persists from summer through the following winter. The moored observations show frequent 0. 2 - 1. 2 psu salinity jumps with time scales of 10 min to days, due to O(1 - 10) km submesoscale salinity fronts moving past the mooring. In winter, satellite sea surface temperature shows 10 km wide filaments of <b>cool</b> <b>water,</b> in <b>line</b> with moored data.

40|$|This {{design of}} the {{liquid-cooling}} garment for NASA spacesuits allows the suit to remove metabolic heat from the human body more effectively, thereby increasing comfort and performance while reducing system mass. The garment is also more flexible, with fewer restrictions on body motion, and more effectively transfers thermal energy from the crewmember s body to the external cooling unit. This improves the garment s performance {{in terms of the}} maximum environment temperature in which it can keep a crewmember comfortable. The garment uses flexible, highly thermally conductive sheet material (such as graphite), coupled with <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> of improved thermal conductivity to transfer the thermal energy from the body to the liquid cooling lines more effectively. The conductive sheets can be layered differently, depending upon the heat loads, in order to provide flexibility, exceptional in-plane heat transfer, and good through-plane heat transfer. A metal foil, most likely aluminum, can be put between the graphite sheets and the external heat source/sink in order to both maximize through-plane heat transfer at the contact points, and to serve as a protection to the highly conductive sheets. Use of a wicking layer draws excess sweat away from the crewmember s skin and the use of an outer elastic fabric ensures good thermal contact of the highly conductive underlayers with the skin. This allows {{the current state of the}} art to be improved by having cooling lines that can be more widely spaced to improve suit flexibility and to reduce weight. Also, cooling liquid does not have to be as cold to achieve the same level of cooling. Specific areas on the human body can easily be targeted for greater or lesser cooling to match human physiology, a warmer external environment can be tolerated, and spatial uniformity of the cooling garment can be improved to reduce vasoconstriction limits. Elements of this innovation can be applied to other embodiments to provide effective heat transfer over a flexible and surface-conformable fashion without the limitation of fluid freeze points...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>water</b> {{systems are}} used to remove excess heat from a {{chemical}} process to the atmosphere. The primary components of these systems are the cooling tower and the heat exchanger network. There is a strong interaction between these individual components, thus their performances are interrelated. Most published {{research in this area}} has focused mainly on optimization of the individual components i. e. optimization of heat exchanger network or optimization of the cooling towers. This approach does not optimize the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system as a whole. Previous research work in which a holistic approach was used is limited to <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems with single <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> source. This work presents a technique for integrated optimization of complex <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems. The system under consideration consists of multiple cooling towers each supplying a set of heat exchangers. A superstructural approach is employed to explore all possible combinations between the heat exchangers and the cooling towers. The <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> reuse opportunities within the heat exchanger networks are also explored. A detailed mathematical model consisting of the cooling towers and the heat exchanger networks model is developed. Two practical scenarios are considered and the mathematical formulations for Case I and II yield nonlinear programing (NLP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) structure respectively. Although the reuse/recycle philosophy offers a good debottlenecking opportunity, the topology of the associated <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network is more complex, hence prone to higher pressure drop than the conventional parallel design. This is due to an increased network pressure drop associated with additional reuse/recycle streams. Therefore, it is essential to consider pressure drop during the synthesis of <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> networks where the reuse/recycle philosophy is employed. The on-going research in this area is only limited to <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> networks consisting of a single <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> source. The common technique used is mathematical optimization using either superstructural or non superstructural approach. This work further presents a mathematical technique for pressure drop optimization in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems consisting of multiple cooling towers. The proposed technique is based on the Critical Path Algorithm and the superstructural approach. The Critical Path Algorithm is used to select the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with minimum pressure drop whilst the superstructural approach allows for <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> reuse. The technique which was previously used in a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with single source is modified and applied in a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with multiple sources. The mathematical formulation is developed considering two cases. Both cases yield mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models. The cooling tower model is also used to predict the exit condition of the cooling tower given the inlet conditions from the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network model. The results show up to 29 % decrease in total circulating <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flowrate when the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system is debottlenecked without considering pressure drop. Consequently, the overall cooling towers effectiveness was improved by up to 5 %. When considering pressure drop the results showed up to 26 % decrease in total circulating water flowrate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} the effective and efficient use of ozone in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems. The study focuses on proving that ozone treated systems will: (1) Improve compressor energy consumption; (2) Improve the heat exchangers efficiency through limited scale deposition and fouling; (3) Reduce water consumption; and (4) Encourage or support corrosion at high concentrations compared to when <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> is chemically treated. For this study, data log readings from compressor heat exchanger approach temperatures were used for energy saving calculations and equipment efficiency (scaling). Using conservation of energy principles and municipal power costs, {{it was found that}} over four years, R 425 991 was saved. Conventional chemical <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems showed high approach temperatures, resulting in high scaling rates and high energy consumption in the compressors. In contrast, ozone <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems showed a lower approach temperatures which resulted in lower scaling rates and lower energy consumption in the compressors. Also, for this study data log readings from <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flow rates and weekly water quality analyses were used for water saving calculation and corrosion predictions. In ozone <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems, there was a reduction in makeup water use confirming water savings. According to Mosugelo (2010) water quality is a bigger contributor to corrosion than ozone is. In <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems with good quality makeup water, ozone treated systems were found to have lower corrosion rates in the heat exchangers than conventional chemicals systems. It can be concluded that effective and efficient use of ozone in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment provides triple bottom line benefits (economic, social and environmental). Environmental benefits include effluent disposal reduction, water and energy conservation. Social benefits include safety and health impacts.
