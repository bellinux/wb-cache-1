5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis {{occurs in}} two disjunct ranges in {{southern}} Australia. In southwest Western Australia, {{it has been}} recorded from Perth and the Avon wheatbelt southwest to Augusta and east along the southern coastline to Esperance. In the southeast of the continent, it is found from eastern South Australia, {{where it has been}} recorded from Mount Gambier and the Fleurieu Peninsula, the Mount Lofty Ranges around Adelaide, the Murraylands, and north to the Flinders Ranges and from Lincoln National Park at the apex of the Eyre Peninsula, through to southeast Queensland. It also occurs in Tasmania. It can be found in eucalypt and pine forests, in habitats as diverse as the arid scrubland of Wyperfeld National Park and subalpine areas of Mount Buffalo National Park, as well as in urban parks and gardens. Fruit bodies can be numerous and occur in overlapping clusters on dead wood. Outside Australia, it has been recorded from Norfolk Island.

25|$|Ahead of {{the system}} {{impacting}} Vanuatu, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Council issued various tropical cyclone alerts to warn residents about the approaching cyclone, which included a red alert for the Maewo, Pentecost and Ambae islands. Because of the upcoming cyclone the national radio station extended its programming to run throughout the night of January 5–6. Vanautu's domestic airline Vanair closed its airfields in the northern islands and cancelled all of its flights except for several direct flights between Santo Island and Port Vila {{the capital city of}} Vanuatu. All ships and small boats were advised to seek refuge due to the high seas and swells that were expected from Susan. However, during January 7, Susan moved south-eastwards and the Fijian islands and spared Vanuatu a direct hit. Despite being spared a direct hit, heavy rain and gale force winds caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan Islands, including on Ambrym Island, where a woman died after being hit by a falling <b>coconut</b> <b>tree,</b> while gathering supplies to secure her house with. After the alerts were cancelled on January 7, by the National Disaster Management Council, most shops and government buildings on Efate island kept their shutters up because Cyclone Katrina was predicted to directly affect the archipelago within a few days.|$|E

25|$|At {{this stage}} as the cyclone was moving towards the {{southwest}} it posed a severe threat to Vanuatu however, during that day Susan recurved towards {{the southeast and}} subsequently spared Vanuatu a direct hit. After sparing Vanuatu a direct hit, Susan started to accelerate towards the southeast and while starting to weaken significantly passed close enough to Fiji during January 7 and 8 to cause gale force winds in Fiji's southern and western islands. While continuing to move towards the southeast, Susan started to interact with Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron during January 8 before it absorbed Ron by 0600UTC {{the next day and}} starting to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of the combined systems were then monitored for another day until they were last noted on January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand. Despite sparing Vanuatu and Fiji direct hits, heavy rain and gale force winds associated with Susan were reported to have caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan and Fijian islands. These islands included Viti Levu where a possible tornado destroyed the roof of a shopping centre and the Vanuatuan island of Ambrym, where a woman died after being hit by a falling <b>coconut</b> <b>tree,</b> while gathering supplies to secure her house with.|$|E
