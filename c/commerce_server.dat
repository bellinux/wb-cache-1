40|$|Electronic <b>commerce</b> <b>servers</b> have a {{significant}} presence in today's Internet. Corporations want to maintain high availability, sufficient capacity, and satisfactory performance for their E-commerce Web systems, and want to provide satisfactory services to customers. Workload characterization and the analysis of customers' interactions with Web sites are the bases upon which to analyze server performance, plan system capacity, manage system resources, and personalize services at the Web site. To date, little empirical evidence has been discovered that identifies the characteristics for Web workloads of E-commerce systems and the behaviours of customers. This thesis analyzes the Web access logs at public Web sites for three organizations: a car rental company, an IT company, and the Computer Science department of the University of Saskatchewan. In these case studies, the characteristics of Web workloads are explored at the request level, functionlevel, resource level, and session level; customers' interactions with Web sites are analyzed by identifying and characterizing session groups. The main E-commerce Web workload characteristics and performance implications are: i) The requests for dynamic Web objects {{are an important part}} of the workload. These requests should be characterized separately since the system processes them differently; ii) Some popular image files, which are embedded in the same Web page, are always requested together. If these files are requested and sent in a bundle, a system will greatly reduce the overheads in processing requests for these files; iii) The percentage of requests for each Web page category tends to be stable in the workload when the time scale is large enough. This observation is helpful in forecasting workload composition; iv) the Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL) is heavily used and most Web objects are either requested primarily through SSL or primarily not through SSL; and v) Session groups of different characteristics are identified for all logs. The analysis of session groups may be helpful in improving system performance, maximizing revenue throughput of the system, providing better services to customers, and managing and planning system resources. A hybrid clustering algorithm, which is a combination of the minimum spanning tree method and k-means clustering algorithm, is proposed to identify session clusters. Session clusters obtained using the three session representations Pages Requested, Navigation Pattern, and Resource Usage are similar enough so that it is possible to use different session representations interchangeably to produce similar groupings. The grouping based on one session representation is believed to be sufficient to answer questions in server performance, resource management, capacity planning and Web site personalization, which previously would have required multiple different groupings. Grouping by Pages Requested is recommended since it is the simplest and data on Web pages requested is relatively easy to obtain in HTTP logs...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of electronic commerce systems {{will have a}} major impact on their acceptability to users. Different users will also demand different levels of performance from the system, that is, they will have different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Electronic commerce systems are the integration of several different types of servers and each server must contribute to meeting the QoS demands of the users. In this paper we focus on the role, and the performance, of a database server within an electronic commerce system. We examine the characteristics of the workload placed on a database server by an electronic commerce system and suggest a range of QoS requirements for the database server based on the examination of the workload. We argue that a database server must be able to dynamically reallocate its resources in order to meet the QoS requirements of different transactions as the workload changes. We describe Quartermaster, which is a system to support dynamic goal-oriented resource management in database management systems, and discuss how it can be used to help meet the QoS requirements of the electronic <b>commerce</b> database <b>server.</b> We provide an example of the use of Quartermaster that illustrates how the dynamic reallocation of memory resources can improve the {{performance of}} the database server under an example electronic commerce workload. We briefly describe the memory reallocation algorithms used by Quartermaster and present experiments to show the impact of the algorithms on the performance of the database server...|$|R
40|$|Transaction {{processing}} {{has emerged}} as the killer application for commercial servers. Most servers are engaged in transactional workloads such as processing search requests, serving middleware, evaluating decisions, managing databases, and powering online <b>commerce.</b> Currently, commercial <b>servers</b> are built from one or more high-performance superscalar processors. However, commercial server applications exhibit high cache miss rates, large memory footprints, and low instruction level parallelism (ILP), which leads to poor utilization on traditional ILP-focused superscalar processors [11]. In addition, these ILP-focused processors have been primarily optimized to deliver maximum performance by employing high clock rates and large amounts of speculation. As a result, we are now {{at the point where the}} performance/Watt of subsequent generations of traditional ILP-focused processors on server workloads has been flat [4] or even decreasing. The lack of increase in processor performance/Watt, coupled with the continued decrease in server hardware acquisition costs and likely increases in future power and cooling costs is leading to a situation where total cost of server ownership will soon be predominately determined by power [4]. In this paper, we argue that attacking thread-level parallelism (TLP) via a large number of simple cores on a chip multiprocessor (CMP) leads to much better performance/Watt for server workloads. As a case study, we compare Sun's TLP-oriented Niagara processor against the ILP-oriented dual-core Pentium Extreme Edition from Intel, showing that the Niagara processor has a significant performance/Watt advantage for throughput-oriented server applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{technological}} developments have affected most lifestyles, {{especially with the}} growth in Internet usage. Internet applications highlight the E-commerce capabilities and applications which are now available everywhere; they receive {{a great number of}} users on a 24 - 7 basis because online services are easy to use, faster and cheaper to acquire. Thus E-commerce web sites have become crucial for companies to increase their revenues. This importance has identified certain effective requirements needed from the performance of these applications. In particular, if the web server is overloaded, poor performance can result, due to either a huge rate of requests being generated which are beyond the server¿s capacity, or due to saturation of the communication links capacity which connects the web server to the network. Recent researches consider the overload issue and explore different mechanisms for managing the performance of E-commerce applications under overload condition. This thesis proposes a formal approach in order to investigate the effects of the extreme load and the number of dropped requests on the performance of E- III <b>commerce</b> web <b>servers.</b> The proposed approach is based on the class-based priority scheme that classifies E-commerce requests into different classes. Because no single technique can solve all aspects of overload problems, this research combines several techniques including: admission control mechanism, session-based admission control, service differentiation, request scheduling and queuing model-based approach. Request classification is {{based on the premise that}} some requests (e. g. buy) are generally considered more important than others (e. g. browse or search). Moreover, this research considers the extended models from Priority Scheduling Mechanism (PSM). These models add a new parameter, such as a review model or modify the basic PSM to low priority fair model, after the discovery of ineffectiveness with low priority customers or to add new features such as portal models. The proposed model is formally specified using the ¿ -calculus in early stage of models design and a multi-actor simulation was developed to reflect the target models as accurately as possible and is implemented as a Java-based prototype system. A formal specification that captures the essential PSM features while keeping the performance model sufficiently simple is presented. Furthermore, the simplicity of the UML bridges the gap between ¿-calculus and Java programming language. IV There are many metrics for measuring the performance of E-commerce web servers. This research focuses on the performance of E-commerce web servers that refer to the throughput, utilisation, average response time, dropped requests and arrival rate. A number of experiments are conducted in order to test the performance management of the proposed approaches...|$|R
