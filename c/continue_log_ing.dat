With the difference between wavelength values of the comparison stimuli held constant, a large difference between wavelengths of the sample stimuli resulted in a higher <b>log</b> <b>d</b> 0 value than that for a small difference between sample stimuli, without changing the rate of decrement in discriminability, b.

The result of variation in the point of interpolation of ambient illumination in the delay interval indicated that levels of discriminability at longer delays were independent of discriminability levels at earlier delays, consistent with the properties of the exponential function.

In the univariate case, binary segmentation yields the fastest known method for multiplication of integer polynomials, even slightly faster than fast Fourier transform methods (however, the underlying fast integer multiplication method {{is based on}} fast Fourier transforms). Fischer and Paterson ("SIAM-AMS Proceedings, 1974," pp. 113 - 125) {{seem to be the}} first authors who suggest binary segmentation for polynomials with coefficients in { 0, 1 }. Schönhage (J. Complexity 1 (1985), 118 - 137), as well as Bini and Pan (J. Complexity 2 (1986), 179 - 203) have applied the binary segmentation to univariate polynomial division and gcd calculation. In the multivariate case, well- known methods are the iterated application of univariate binary segmentation and Kronecker′s map. Our method of binary segmentation to the contrary is based on a one-step algebra homomorphism mapping multivariate polynomials directly into integers. More precisely, the variables x 1,..., xn of a multivariate polynomial are substituted by integers 2 ν 1,..., 2 νn, where ν 1 < · · · < νn are chosen as small as possible.
