40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} veterinarian-dog interaction styles during a routine vet consult. Since petting and using <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> are known to be comforting to dogs, these parameters were used to determine if different veterinarians used different interaction styles towards dogs. The hypothesis was that the amount of petting and <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> directed at the dogs would differ among the veterinarians involved in this study. The results showed that the amount of petting and using <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> indeed differs between veterinarians, but the differences in the amount of petting seem to be clearer than in the amount of <b>comfort</b> <b>talk.</b> The second aim of the study was to determine if the veterinarian interaction style had an effect on dogs’ behavioural responses to two routine vet procedures; giving an injection and taking the rectal body temperature. The hypothesis was that the veterinarian interaction style would affect the dogs’ behavioural responses during the two routine procedures. Dogs examined by a veterinarian with a high petting or high <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> interaction style would exhibit lower duration or frequencies of behavioural indicators of ‘stress’ pre- and post-vaccination and pre-, during- and post-temperature than dogs who were examined by vets with a low petting or low <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> interaction style. The results suggest that this was true for some behaviours, however for other behaviours it seemed that dogs couldn’t cope with the situation very well. The clearest difference was with hiding with the owner; this was much more common with dogs that were high petted, compared to low petted dogs. In the future, for all 37 dogs the amount of petting and <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> should be determined, instead of using three dogs per veterinarian and assume that the amount of petting will be the same for the other dogs. Furthermore, the study should include more veterinarians, but especially more dogs per veterinarian have to be included in this study...|$|R

A {{unique set of}} co-occurring linguistic features and intonation patterns which characterize the <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> register was identified. Descriptive data reveal that nurses reserve this register for patients only and that linguistic adjustments are made within the register for children. The nurses' <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> register is also characterized by a restricted set of pragmatic functions which include: (1) helping patients to 'hold on'; (2) obtaining information {{that contributes to the}} assessment of the patient's condition; (3) giving and receiving information about procedures; and (4) verbally communicating a sense of caring to the patient.

40|$|In {{this study}} 22 dogs with {{separation}} anxiety related behavior (SRB) and 7 dogs without SRB were participating with their owners {{in a clinical}} trial to observe the owner-dog interaction. The behavior of the owner {{is thought to be}} an underlying cause of separation anxiety in dogs The behaviors of the owner and dogs were recorded during three phases: the table phase, separation phase and reunion phase. Owners filled in a questionnaire about the prevalence of SRB symptoms and a questionnaire about the ‘quality of life’ of their dog. This study’s focus is on the behavior of the owner during the reunion phase. Results show that SRB owners touched their dog more, showed more control talk, looked more to their dog and sit more facing their dog than non-SRB owners did. Female owners petted their dog more and showed more control talk and general talk to their dog in comparison with male owners. A significant positive correlation was found between control talk and non-verbal control of the owner, between control talk and total talking to the dog, between <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> and total talking to the dog and <b>comfort</b> <b>talk</b> and the sum of all physical interactions...|$|R

This paper uses longitudinal data from a survey of Scottish teenagers (N= 5041) to show how low parental monitoring predicts early sexual activity for both sexes (with some reverse causation), and for females it also predicts more sexual partners and less condom use.

Mothers of 11 - to 15 -year-olds (N = 50) were assigned to an intervention or control group, resulting in 20 dyads in each group. All dyads were assessed twice, on self-reported and observed communication, AIDS knowledge, and perceived vulnerability to AIDS. Intervention group mothers received two training sessions. Observational data revealed that intervention group mothers reduced their amount of speaking, asked more open-ended questions, acted less judgmental, and discussed dating and sexuality more than did control group mothers.

A quasi-experimental design was used that included a pre- and posttest assessment of 683 adolescent males. Results revealed that youth exposed to the 10 -week curriculum had significant increases in knowledge and decrease in behavior related to high risk sexual behaviors. Out of eight scale measures (ATSS, Perceived Risk, HIV Knowledge, CAPS: <b>Talk,</b> CAPS: <b>Comfort</b> <b>Talk,</b> CAPS: Cool Sex, ATA, Cultural Esteem, and Hombres Con Palabra) seven yielded a significant and positive outcome results.

40|$|Most {{information}} on family communication about sexuality has been derived from surveys and statistical analyses. We lack data on what actually occurs in conversations and how family members make meaning of their communication. Using a phenomenological perspective, {{the purpose of}} this study was to create an in-depth description and analysis of communication about sexuality among a sample of mothers and adolescent daughters. Methods included videotaped conversations, follow-up, audiotaped interviews after participants watched their videotapes, and quantitative data from a written questionnaire. A purposive sample was comprised of 30 African American mother-daughter pairs, 15 recruited from a free teen clinic and 15 recruited via advertisement, word of mouth, and participant referral. Qualitative analyses triangulating observational, interview, and questionnaire data suggested five key findings: (1) although most mothers and daughters reported prior experience and <b>comfort</b> <b>talking</b> about sexuality topics, both qualitative and quantitative results suggest that certain topics (e. g., abstinence, reproductive “facts,” and the consequences of sexual activity) were emphasized over other topics (e. g., condom use, choosing sexual partners, and masturbation); (2) differences in communication style (didactic versus interactional) play a role in the perceived effectiveness of the communication; (3) mothers framed sexuality largely as negative—feelings and behaviors to avoid because of the harmful consequences. Positive aspects of being sexual, such as pleasure, were not discussed; (4) perspectives on how male and female sexuality play out in teen relationships revealed conflicting and often adversarial gender role beliefs and illuminated tension between female sexual empowerment and disempowerment; (5) the quality of the relationship—the connection—underlies the “effectiveness” and quality of sexuality communication. Roadblocks to sexuality communication that may contribute to (and be evidence of) disconnection include not listening, anger, making assumptions and judgments, and silence. Facilitators of sexuality communication that may contribute to (and be evidence of) connection include getting an early start, persistence, listening, empathizing, being there and spending time together, managing conflict in nondestructive ways, and treating feelings as real. ...|$|R
40|$|PurposeThis {{exploratory}} {{study examined the}} experiences of black and Latino teen young {{men who have sex}} with men (YMSM) and their preferences for communication with school staff about matters related to sexual orientation. MethodsParticipants for this study were recruited in three urban centers in the United States and by multiple community-based organizations serving black and Latino YMSM. Eligible youth were male, black or Latino, ages 13 - 19, enrolled in 90 days of school in the previous 18 months, and reported attraction to or sexual behavior with other males, or identified as gay or bisexual. Participants completed Web-based questionnaires (n= 415) and/or in-depth interviews (n= 32). ResultsQuestionnaire participants reported willingness to talk to at least one school staff member about: safety, dating and relationships, and feeling attracted to other guys (63. 4 %, 58. 4 %, and 55. 9 %, respectively). About one-third of the sample reported they would not talk with any school staff about these topics. Exploratory analyses revealed youth who experienced feeling unsafe at school and who had higher levels of trust in the information provided by school staff were more likely to be willing to talk with school staff about safety issues, dating, or same sex attraction (aOR= 2. 80 and aOR= 4. 85, respectively). Interview participants reported being most willing to talk to staff who (1) were able and willing to help them; (2) would keep discussions confidential, and (3) expressed genuine care. Preferences for confiding in school staff perceived to be LGBT and having similar racial/ethnic background were also noted. ConclusionFindings suggest school staff can serve as points of contact for reaching YMSM and professional development and interventions can be tailored to reach YMSM and connect them to services they need. Additional research is needed to understand how to increase YMSM <b>comfort</b> <b>talking</b> with school staff about sexual health or sexual identity concerns. 200 - 2009 - 30503 /PHS HHS/United StatesCC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 09 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26436114 PMC 458952...|$|R

Self-report questionnaires revealed increases in general closeness with parents, increases in sexual and dating experiences, and both more sexually permissive as well as more gender stereotyped attitudes. Qualitative analyses of individual interviews indicated a movement from unilateral and restrictive, sex-based topics to more reciprocal and relationship-focused conversations over time. Gender analyses revealed that young women reported more restrictive sex messages and young men more positive-sex messages.

40|$|Parental {{involvement}} {{is assumed to}} be an important component of successful school-based family life education programs. Historically, however, parents have been described as uninvolved in their adolescents’ sexuality education. Few data exist that explain either parents’ non-involvement or adolescents’ perceptions of parents as resources to support healthy sexual development. Existing research adopts a narrow, social control perspective on adolescent sexuality and on evaluation of community-based sexuality education programs. Given the increasing numbers of school-based family life education programs and of national organizations encouraging parental involvement components in preventive programs, empirical research on the interface of school and home-based sexuality education is needed. This exploratory study, based on the ecological developmental model of Bronfenbrenner (1977, 1986), describes eighth graders’ perceptions of an existing school-based sexuality education program and of parents as resources for problem solving and sex-specific information. Early adolescents report that these programs increase <b>comfort</b> when <b>talking</b> with parents, but not frequency of talking.
