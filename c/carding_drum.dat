5000|$|Coffeehousing - A player may {{not perform}} {{extraneous}} or overt actions with {{the express purpose}} of frustrating or distracting a player. Some unscrupulous players use various emotional hooks, snapping <b>cards,</b> <b>drumming</b> fingers on table, inducing FUD: Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt, false flattery, sarcasm, embarrassment, greed, etc. Better known as [...] "coffee housing", such misdeeds include making improper remarks, gestures, hesitations or the like, with the intention to confuse or mislead opponents (Law 73). After numerous deliberate opponent hesitations, Charles Goren advised a perpetrator, [...] "Madam, that second hesitation certainly was an overbid!" [...] Similarly, George Kaufman once retorted to his opponents, [...] "Let's have a review of the bidding again, with all the inflections." ...|$|R

40|$|Friction {{minimization}} between {{magnetic media}} (tape, <b>cards,</b> <b>drums,</b> etc.) and magnetic transducer (heads, etc.) {{is a key}} requirement in recording systems. Results are presented for an investigation intended to eliminate previously encountered shortcomings of friction-reducing treatments by a deposition of an inert liquid film on a fully manufactured (cured) magnetic medium. The film contains no particles, represents a compound characterized by good lubricating and thermal properties, is inert {{with respect to the}} normal formulation constituents, and has low surface tension and vapor pressure characteristics. The deposited film need only be molecularly thin to impart adequate lubricating properties to the tape. The discussion covers the characteristics of the surface lubricant, method of application, and surface coated magnetic media test results. Greater than 5 million passes of the 3 M 900 tape on a loop tester are achieved with no apparent effect on the tape and with head wear decreased by as much as a factor of te...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 May 2005, Ganilau {{strongly}} criticised Prime Minister Qarase for {{his calls}} for ethnic Fijians to unite politically to provide stable national leadership. Ganilau said this policy was [...] "divisive and a travesty of good governance and responsible leadership in a multiracial country like Fiji." [...] He called on his fellow-chiefs {{to take a}} stand against what he considered a move to pit indigenous Fijians against other races. Ganilau also spoke of the importance of chiefly institutions, saying that chiefs provided permanent leadership for the Fijian people, unlike politicians who could be dismissed at the ballot box and were susceptible to the temptation to appeal to voters' racist sympathies to win power. [...] "Very often, to remain in power the easiest option for them would be to play the racist <b>card,</b> <b>drum</b> up fears of marginalisation and extinction of other ethnic groups," [...] he said. He said the country would prosper if all political leaders would support the role of chiefly leaders and make [...] "a serious effort" [...] to bring together all the people of Fiji.|$|R
50|$|Cottage carding {{machines}} {{differ significantly from}} the simple <b>drum</b> <b>card.</b> These carders do not store fibre in the card cloth as the drum carder does but, rather, fibre passes through {{the workings of the}} carder for storage or for additional processing by other machines.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} machine carder is {{the drum}} carder. Most drum carders are hand-cranked {{but some are}} powered by electric motor. These machines generally have two rollers, or <b>drums,</b> covered with <b>card</b> clothing. The licker-in, or smaller roller meters fibre from the infeed tray onto the larger storage drum. The two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain-drive so that their relative speeds cause the storage drum to gently pull fibres from the licker-in. This pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the storage <b>drum's</b> <b>card</b> cloth. Fibre is added until the storage <b>drum's</b> <b>card</b> cloth is full. A gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full.|$|R
50|$|All MR {{versions}} could {{house up}} to three expansion cards, each one holding up to 24 megabytes of samples and sound data. That was a first (and last) for Ensoniq products. Three are known: Perfect Piano, Urban Dance Project and World Sounds. Each cost about $250. A fourth <b>card,</b> the <b>Drums</b> Expansion, could give the rack version a feature that was a standard part of the keyboard versions. It was a 2 mebibyte add-on and contained about 700 drum sounds. A fifth card was the aforementioned flash expansion.|$|R
50|$|The {{machine was}} {{programmed}} primarily {{with a plastic}} tape that moved synchronously with the typewriter carriage. Each tape would typically handle one application. The tape mechanism was mounted behind the carriage in the typewriter unit. Further programming was provided in the <b>card</b> machines program <b>drums.</b> Programs were only executed as the machine typed or spaced over a column - tabbing or carriage returning was not recognised.|$|R
50|$|The short draw {{technique}} can be {{done from}} carded rolags, as well, {{but this does not}} produce a strictly worsted yarn. Yarns spun from a rolag will not have all the fibers parallel to the yarn though, with the short draw technique, many will be. <b>Drum</b> <b>carded</b> fiber, however, does have the fibers all parallel to each other, and thus can be used to create a strictly worsted yarn.|$|R
5000|$|Four rounds were played; {{after two}} rounds, either the contestants changed {{partners}} or, {{in the all-star}} version, each team's partners switched positions. The team with the lowest total elapsed time won the game, and the [...] "civilian" [...] contestant {{went on to the}} bonus round. On All-Star Baffle, the winning celebrity team drew a <b>card</b> from a <b>drum</b> (filled out by the studio audience) and the lucky audience member got to play the bonus round.|$|R
50|$|IBM 024, 026, and 029 keypunches {{and their}} {{companion}} verifiers, the 056 and 059, could {{be programmed to}} a limited extent using a Program Card, {{also known as a}} <b>drum</b> <b>card.</b> The keypunch or verifier could be programmed to automatically advance to the beginning of each field, default to certain character types within the field, duplicate a field from the previous card, and so on. Program cards were an improvement over the Skip Bar used in some earlier keypunches.|$|R
50|$|Many music genres {{that made}} use of {{electronic}} instruments developed into contemporary styles mainly due to the MIDI protocol, which enabled computers, synthesizers, sound <b>cards,</b> samplers, and <b>drum</b> machines to {{interact with each other}} and achieve the full synchronization of sounds. Electronic dance music is typically composed using computers and synthesizers, and rarely has any physical instruments. Instead, this is replaced by digital or electronic sounds, with a 4/4 beat. Many producers of this kind of music however, such as Darren Tate and MJ Cole, were trained in classical music before they moved into the electronic medium.|$|R
40|$|This current text {{reports on}} a musical work written in 1970 {{with the help of}} the Electrologica X- 8 {{computer}} of the University of Utrecht, Holland, using the program PROJECT 2 by Gottfried Michael Koenig. This article, which deals historically with the retrieval of the work, offers a musicological treatment of the composition referred to, which was written to be performed by a group of musicians who made live use of scrap and common daily objects, such as: glass and plastic bottles, dustbin lids, iron pipes and cardboard tubes, papers, nuts and bolts, marbles, plastic counters, index <b>cards,</b> oil <b>drums,</b> etc. This was the original idea, which, in that year of 1970, was courageous and innovative. This was at a time when ecological proposals had not been considered and were not yet in fashion. On the other hand, the work made use of Koenig's subprograms, which although studied in classrooms in Utrecht, only came to be published in December of 1970. The historical focus thus is intended to indicate the direction of a musicology of contemporary Brazilian creation, which has the computer as cooperator...|$|R
5000|$|The UNIVAC 1004 was a plug-board {{programmed}} {{punched card}} data processing system, introduced in 1962, by UNIVAC. Total memory was 961 characters (6 bits) of core memory. Peripherals were a card reader (400 cards/minute), a card punch (200 cards/minute) using proprietary 90-column, round-hole cards or IBM-compatible, 80-column <b>cards,</b> a <b>drum</b> printer (400 lines/minute) and a Uniservo tape drive. The 1004 was also supported as a remote card reader & printer via synchronous communication services. A U.S. Navy (Weapons Station, Concord) 1004 {{was dedicated to}} printing from tape {{as a means of}} offloading the task from their Solid State 80 mainframe, which produced the tapes. A plug-board program called Emulator was widely installed to convert 1004s to stored-program operation, reading in instructions from program decks of cards which determined the processing of the following data decks. Once installed, Emulator was rarely removed as it could run the machine as desired and, as almost every machine function was used, it was physically heavy from the sheer mass of installed jumpers filling nearly the entire board. Emulator was not a Univac product, rather it was built by each customer, a tedious task. Its heavy use of the 1004's program-branching reed relays, called selectors, caused increased failures, later solved by the use of electronic selectors in the follow-on 1005.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{improvements}} of the 709 {{over the}} previous 704 involved more magnetic core memory and apparently the first use of independent I/O channels. Whereas I/O on 704 is a programmed function of the central processor - data words are transferred to or from the I/O register, one at a time, using a [...] "copy" [...] instruction - the 709 uses the IBM-766 Data Synchronizer, which provides two independently [...] "programmed" [...] I/O channels. Up to three Data Synchronizers can be attached to a 709, each able to control up to 20 IBM 729 tape drives and an IBM 716 alphanumeric line printer, IBM 711 card-reader and 721 card punch. This allows six times as many I/O devices on 709, and allows I/O to proceed on multiple devices while program execution continues in parallel. Up to two IBM 733 Magnetic Drum units, each with 8,192 words of memory, could be attached independently from the Data Synchronizers. The 709 could initially load programs (boot) from <b>card,</b> tape or <b>drum.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85. The most {{impressive}} thing about the band {{was the fact that}} Frazer had already printed some 2 colour t shirts and he had a car! I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the <b>cards)</b> and the <b>drummer</b> left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but I do remember we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it. Yeah the flexi disc for white dwarf was an odd one, John Blanche, the art editor painted our first cover so it all came about quite easy, it does sound shockingly bad though." ...|$|R
