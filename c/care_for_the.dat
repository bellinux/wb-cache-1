40|$|The {{elderly are}} {{the fastest growing}} {{population}} in the United States. Nurses' attitudes toward <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly are a very real concern and may determine nurses' behaviors with the elderly. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the attitudes of nurses toward <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly residing in long term care institutions. A modified questionnaire, "Attitudes Toward Caring <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Elderly" was used. A combination of Jean Watson's theory of caring and the Ajzen & Fishbein's theory of reasoned action was the theoretical framework used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> study. Three research questions were asked. Data were collected from 32 registered nurses in four long term care institutions. Results showed that nurses attitudes toward <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly were positive. There were no significant relationships between demographic and personal data and nurses' attitudes toward <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly. Full time versus part time employment was a significant predictor of nurses attitudes toward <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly. The low reliability of the tool (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 57) could have contributed to the lack of significant data.

5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E

Cherry remarks {{that there was a}} certain tension within the team: Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and was not willing to give up his authority, and Jackson, a talented center, was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot; however, as the season progressed, the three began to mesh better. Chamberlain did not <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sixers' coach, Dolph Schayes, because Schayes, according to him, had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA.|$|E

5|$|Black {{honeyeaters}} feed on nectar, {{and have}} a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers {{such as those of}} the emu bush. They also take insects on the wing, and regularly eat charcoal left behind at campfires. The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest building and incubation. Both sexes feed and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater is sufficiently numerous and widespread to be considered least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
