40|$|We {{describe}} GLEANS, a summarization {{system that}} uses four novel techniques for summarizating document collections. (i) GLEANS first maps all documents {{in a collection}} into a canonical, database-like representation that makes explicit the main entities and relations in a document collection. (ii) GLEANS also classifies each document collection into one of four categories: collections about a single person, single event, multiple event, and natural disaster. (iii) For each type of document collection, GLEANS generates a short headline using a set of predefined templates. For multi-event documents, GLEANS also generates from scratch, using predefined templates, the first two sentences in the abstract. (iv) The rest of the summary is then generated by extracting from the database sentences that conform {{to a set of}} predefined schemas and by presenting them in an order that reflects coherence constraints specific to each <b>collection</b> <b>category...</b>|$|E

The author argues that without this type of information, agencies are hindered in really knowing the "proponent of terror," and thus limited in the possibilities for neutralizing the subject. The study analyzes genetic inheritance and childhood environment and presents case studies on Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Ilich Ramirez Sanchez ("Carlos").

40|$|A {{method of}} using string-matching to analyze {{hypertext}} navigation was developed, and evaluated using {{two weeks of}} website logfile data. The method is divided into phases that use: (i) exact string-matching to calculate subsequences of links that were repeated in different navigation sessions (common trails through the website), and then (ii) inexact matching to find other similar sessions (a community of users with a similar interest). The evaluation showed how subsequences {{could be used to}} understand the information pathways users chose to follow within a website, and that exact and inexact matching provided complementary ways of identifying information that may have been of interest to a whole community of users, but which was only found by a minority.
