40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for radial conical ring rolling with a closed die structure {{on the top}} and bottom of driven roll, simplified as RCRRCDS, was established. The plastic penetration and biting-in conditions in RCRRCDS process were determined. A mandrel feeding strategy for RCRRCDS process was proposed. The mandrel feed rate and its reasonable value range were deduced. The coupled thermal-mechanical FE model of RCRRCDS process was established. The reasonable value range of the mandrel feed rate was verified by using numerical simulation method. The results indicate that the reasonable value range of the mandrel feed rate is feasible, the proposed mandrel feeding strategy can realize a steady RCRRCDS process, and the forming quality of <b>conical</b> ring <b>rolled</b> by using the proposed feeding strategy is better than that of <b>conical</b> ring <b>rolled</b> by using a constant mandrel feed rate...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{the study}} and {{implementation}} of a sensor with a metamaterial (MM) lens in electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation (eNDE). Thus, {{the use of a}} new type of MM, named <b>Conical</b> Swiss <b>Rolls</b> (CSR) has been proposed. These structures can serve as electromagnetic flux concentrators in the radiofrequency range. As a direct application, plates of composite materials with carbon fibers woven as reinforcement and polyphenylene sulphide as matrix with delaminations due to low energy impacts were examined. The evaluation method is based on the appearance of evanescent modes in the space between carbon fibers when the sample is excited with a transversal magnetic along z axis (TMz) polarized electromagnetic field. The MM lens allows the transmission and intensification of evanescent waves. The characteristics of carbon fibers woven structure became visible and delaminations are clearly emphasized.

40|$|Metallic strip {{gratings}} (MSG) {{have different}} applications, ranging from printed circuits to filters in microwave domains. When {{they are under}} the influence of an electromagnetic field, evanescent and/or abnormal modes appear in the region between the traces, their utilization leading to the development of new electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation methods. This paper studies the behavior of MSGs in the sub-subwavelength regime when they are excited with TEz or TMz polarized plane waves and the slits are filled with different dielectrics. The appearance of propagating, evanescent and abnormal modes is emphasized using an electromagnetic sensor with metamaterials lens realized with two <b>conical</b> Swiss <b>rolls,</b> which allows the extraction of the information carried by the guided evanescent waves. The evanescent waves, manipulated by the electromagnetic sensor with metamaterial lenses, improve the electromagnetic images so that a better spatial resolution is obtained, exceeding the limit imposed by diffraction.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the project presented in this thesis is to model and simulate the dynamic roll-bending process for forming a thick plate to a conical hollow shape. The project is realized using the Finite Element Method (FEM), which is integrated into the ANSYS/LS-DYNA software. In this study, the continuous three-roll pyramidal configuration is applied to form a thick plate to a conical hollow shape. The final goal {{is to provide a}} simulation tool that allows the optimization of the parameters of the process, and to demonstrate the feasibility of fulfilling the conical geometry adapted to the manufacture of Francis turbine crowns. The kinematic and geometrie relationships of the process are developed first: they allow sliding to be kept to a minimum between the workpiece and the <b>rolls</b> using <b>conical</b> <b>rolls.</b> Detailed steps for modeling the Finite Elements (FM), including the element type, the meshing, the contact surfaces, the boundary conditions and the constraints, are then presented. This 3 D simulation is based on the explicit finite element method, which is able to deal with nonlinear elasto-plastic deformation behavior. Next, a typical example is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling the process using this numerical tool. The results of the dynamic roll-bending process, going from the initial plate plane to its final conical form are examined, that is, the progressive change in the geometry along with the evolution of the residual stress distribution in the workpiece. A convergence test, which varies the meshing size, is also carried out {{in order to ensure that}} the proper element sizes are chosen. Furthermore, the reaction forces and the residual stress obtained through the numerical simulation are compared with the results of a simplified analytic calculation. To compare the geometric precision of the shape generated with that of that specified, a dimensional verification algorithm was developed. The algorithm, which is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear optimization method, allows the smoothing of the coordinates of the nodes of the final shape obtained, based on a conical surface. Next, the deviations are calculated in order to analyze the effects of the variables of the process and of the simulation parameters on the final forming results. These parameters include the friction coefficient, the plate thickness, the materials properties, the spatial arrangement of the outer rolls and the plate temperature. This sensitivity study evaluates the influence of the parameter on the reaction forces, the residual stresses and the geometric compliance of the final formed piece...|$|R

The {{data were collected}} monthly over two hours between March and September 2015. Fifteen gall morphotypes were found in twelve plant species distributed among seven families. The plant family with the greatest richness of galls was Fabaceae (n = 8). The following gall morphologies were found: globoid, lenticular, marginal leaf <b>roll,</b> <b>conical,</b> cylindrical, fusiform, spherical and pocket shaped. Cecidomyiidae induced globoid, lenticular, conical, fusiform, spherical and cylindrical morphotypes. In addition, species of microhymenoptera belonging to the Eulophidae, Eurytomidae and Encyrtidae families were found. Marginal leaf roll and pocket-shaped galls induced by Thysanoptera were also verified. Springtails were also identified as a successor.

40|$|The current {{stage of}} {{non-destructive}} evaluation techniques imposes {{the development of}} new electromagnetic methods that are based on high spatial resolution and increased sensitivity. Printed circuit boards, integrated circuit boards, composite materials with polymeric matrix containing conductive fibers, as well as some types of biosensors are devices of interest in using such evaluation methods. In order to achieve high performance, the work frequencies must be either radiofrequencies or microwaves. At these frequencies, at the dielectric/conductor interface, plasmon polaritons can appear, propagating between conductive regions as evanescent waves. Detection of these waves, containing required information, can be done using sensors with metamaterial lenses. We propose in this paper the enhancement of the spatial resolution using electromagnetic methods, which can be accomplished in this case using evanescent waves that appear in the current study in slits of materials such as the spaces between carbon fibers in Carbon Fibers Reinforced Plastics or in materials of interest in the nondestructive evaluation field with industrial applications, where microscopic cracks are present. We propose herein a unique design of the metamaterials for use in nondestructive evaluation based on <b>Conical</b> Swiss <b>Rolls</b> configurations, which assure the robust concentration/focusing of the incident electromagnetic waves (practically impossible to be focused using classical materials), as well as the robust manipulation of evanescent waves. Applying this testing method, spatial resolution of approximately Î»/ 2000 can be achieved. This testing method can be successfully applied in a variety of applications of paramount importance such as defect/damage detection in materials used in a variety of industrial applications, such as automotive and aviation technologies...|$|R
