Weak and unable to concentrate, Etty painted very little, and spend {{the next few months}} visiting friends and touring the sights of Yorkshire.

5|$|Mayfair {{was mainly}} open fields until {{development}} {{started in the}} Shepherd Market area around 1686-8 to accommodate the May Fair that had moved from Haymarket in St James's because of overcrowding. There were some buildings before 1686 – a <b>cottage</b> <b>in</b> Stanhope Row, dating from 1618, which was destroyed in the Blitz in late 1940. A 17th century English Civil War fortification was established {{in what is now}} Mount Street in Mayfair, and known as Oliver's Mount by the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Mrs Smith's Cottage is a {{mid-19th century}} Grade II listed {{building}} made from early Victorian red bricks. The range, {{the heart of}} the house, was in daily use for cooking and heating until the mid-1990s. The only access to the bedrooms is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap – installed to prevent the local council condemning the <b>cottage</b> <b>in</b> the late 1970s – and an inside toilet. The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed.|$|E
5|$|Pentangle's {{first major}} concert {{was at the}} Royal Festival Hall in 1967, and their first album was {{released}} in the following year.

He did, however, continue to record, releasing Rosemary Lane in 1971. The tracks for this album were recorded on a portable tape recorder by Bill Leader at Jansch's <b>cottage</b> <b>in</b> Ticehurst, Sussex—a process which took several months, with Jansch only working {{when he was in}} the right mood.|$|E
