5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the <b>carry</b> <b>bit</b> from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E

5000|$|In most computers, the carry {{from the}} most {{significant}} bit of an arithmetic operation (or bit shifted out from a shift operation) is placed in a special <b>carry</b> <b>bit</b> {{which can be used}} as a carry-in for multiple precision arithmetic or tested and used to control execution of a computer program. The same <b>carry</b> <b>bit</b> is also generally used to indicate borrows in subtraction, though the bit's meaning is inverted due to the effects of two's complement arithmetic. Normally, a <b>carry</b> <b>bit</b> value of [...] "1" [...] signifies that an addition overflowed the ALU, and must be accounted for when adding data words of lengths greater than that of the CPU. For subtractive operations, two (opposite) conventions are employed as most machines set the carry flag on borrow while some machines (such as the 6502 and the PIC) instead reset the carry flag on borrow (and vice versa).|$|E

50|$|The second takes {{advantage}} of the identity that −x = not(x)+1 and computes a−b as a+not(b)+1. The carry flag is set according to this addition, and subtract with carry computes a+not(b)+C, while subtract without carry acts as if the <b>carry</b> <b>bit</b> were set. The result is that the <b>carry</b> <b>bit</b> is set if a≥b, and clear if a<b. The System/360, 6502, MSP430, ARM and PowerPC processors use this convention. The 6502 is a particularly well-known example because it does not have a subtract without carry operation, so programmers must ensure that the carry flag is set before every subtract operation where a borrow is not required.|$|E

50|$|A carry-save adder {{is a type}} {{of digital}} adder, used in {{computer}} microarchitecture to compute the sum of three or more n-bit numbers in binary.
