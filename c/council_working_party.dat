50|$|The {{concept of}} ECLI was first {{launched}} at the Legal Access Conference (Paris, December 2008) and at Jurix Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law in Florence (December 2008). Around the same time, {{the study by}} a task group of the EU Council Working Group on e-Law showed that accessibility of judicial decisions, both at the national and European level, was seriously hampered {{by the lack of}} standardised identifiers and metadata:The task group suggested to establish a voluntary common identification system based on the European Case-Law Identifier (ECLI). ECLI as an identifier would be linked to an index with references. This would enable any citizen or legal practitioner to find any decision to which ECLI has been attributed from any public or private register or database in the EU. In addition a Dublin-core implementation for case-law should be established to facilitate searching case-law in different search engines.Based on the report of this task group, the Council of Ministers agreed on the principles of ECLI and common metadata, and asked the EU <b>Council</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Party</b> on Legal Data Processing (e-Law) to elaborate the initial work.

5000|$|A {{large-scale}} council reorganisation in 1972 saw the Parks Police and Airport Police disbanded {{as police}} forces and merged to form [...] "Liverpool City Security Force". However, the Markets Police continued {{in a separate}} existence for a further four years, until they too were merged into the Security Force in 1976. As part of the merger, the Market Police officers were offered a choice between positions within the (better-paid) Security Force, subject to passing an entrance exam, or becoming gatekeepers at their current rate of pay. At {{the start of the}} 1990s, a <b>council</b> <b>working</b> <b>party</b> that was looking into rising crime and disorder in the Markets recommended that the Markets Police be re-formed, and a further council reorganisation in October 1992 led to the Markets Police being reintroduced, consisting of one inspector and 13 constables. The first officers underwent six weeks’ training with Merseyside Police. [...] In 1995, the force had increased to 1 inspector (who left in 1996), 2 sergeants and 15 constables, with cover being provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The country's first [...] "Market Watch" [...] scheme was established in 1997, in co-operation between the Markets Police Merseyside Police Crime Prevention Unit. [...] In 2002 the Markets Police consisted of 4 sergeants and 10 constables. Most officers were on duty during the markets' opening hours, and two officers on duty when the market was closed, thus providing a 24-hour service. The force was funded by the City Council and from a charge paid by the Market Traders Association. Training consisted of six weeks in-house, covering general police duties, followed by six months on-the-job. The Markets Police were disbanded in 2002, when the City Council privatised the markets, and their functions were taken on by a private security company.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} European Union (EU) {{committees in}} two parts. The first part presents an empirical {{overview of the}} three types of committees that constitute what may be called the “EU committee system. ” After examining Commission expert groups, <b>Council</b> <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> and Comitology committees to elucidate their key traits and primary roles in the policy process, {{the first part of the}} paper demonstrates that despite diverse roles and variations in constitutional and procedural formality, the different committees play equally influential roles in the policy process. This section concludes that the committees make an essential contribution to the politics and policy of the EU. The second half of the paper turns to a more normative assessment of committees. In light of growing public hostility toward committees, this section searches for normative strategies to redress the legitimacy deficit of committee governance. This part of the paper reviews the existing normative debate over committees but rejects the implied reform strategies as impractical and unrealistic. As an alternative, five models traditionally used to legitimize administrative processes are applied to the committee system. While individually insufficient, together the five models offer a realistic set of reform options capable of boosting the legitimacy of committee governance while preserving the features of EU committees that are so crucial to the EU policy process...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. ] This chapter {{argues that}} an {{important}} fabric of EU administrative governance is the emerging multilevel community administration. This community administration integrates essential parts of national government institutions and important segments of the EU institutions. The study demonstrates that the domestic components of the community administration include the lower middle levels of the member-states’ ministries and agencies/directorates. At the EU-level the community administration covers the lower echelons of the Commission services, the Commission agencies, the Commission expert committees, the <b>Council</b> <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> the comitology committees, and finally the national civil servants seconded to the Commission for shorter periods of time (Trondal 2004). Together, this community administration meshes and integrates executive institutions at two levels of government charged with responsibilities for policy initiation, policy decisions and policy implementation (Heywood and Wright 1997). This study highlights {{the development of a}} community administration within the three classes of EU committees referred to above. These committees integrate national civil servants into EU decision-making processes. They pose, however, different challenges to the decision-making behaviour, roles and loyalties among the officials attending these committee meetings. The survey data presented reveals that the institutional autonomy of the community administration is stronger within the European Commission than within the Council and the comitology setting. Hence, the picture of one unified community administration has to be sacrificed for the model of a multifaceted community administration balancing intergovernmental, functional and supranational dynamics. The data thus seriously challenges sweeping generalisations of administrative fusion and bureaucratic engrenage (Wessels 1998). This chapter also demonstrates that deliberative dynamics are not omnipotent within the comitology committees as asserted by Joerges and Neyer (1997) ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Medical Research <b>Council</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Party</b> on Congenital Dislocation of the Hip have {{reported}} an ascertainment-adjusted incidence {{of a first}} operative procedure for congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) of 0. 78 per 1000 livebirths, {{which is similar to}} the incidence of CDH {{before the start of the}} UK screening programme. The report showed that CDH had not been detected by routine screening before age 3 months in 70 % of children reported to the national orthopaedic surveillance scheme. This report raised concerns about the merit of screening at birth for CDH. We aimed to find out the incidence of an operative procedure for CDH in the first 5 years of life among children born in South Australia between 1988 and 1993, and the proportion of these patients that were detected at age 3 months or older. METHODS: The state's database for inpatient separations between January, 1988, and April, 1998 was searched. Case records were examined for the age and circumstances of diagnosis, and type of operative procedures. Prevalence rates of CDH were obtained from the South Australian Birth Defects Register, which receives notifications from a statutory perinatal data collection of birth defects detected at birth and subsequent voluntary notifications for children up to age 5 years. FINDINGS: Of the 55 children born in South Australia between 1988 and 1993 identified as having non-teratological CDH and operative procedures, only 22 (40 %) had been diagnosed at age 3 months or older. 18 had an open reduction of the hip joint or osteotomy, or both, and the remainder had arthrograms, closed reductions, and/or tenotomy. The prevalence of non-teratological CDH in children was 7. 74 per 1000 livebirths. The incidence of surgery for CDH in the first 5 years of life was 0. 46 per 1000 livebirths (95 % CI 0. 34 - 0. 59) and only 0. 19 per 1000 livebirths (0. 11 - 0. 26) for those diagnosed late (age 3 months or older). These children diagnosed late represented 2. 4 % of all known cases of CDH. INTERPRETATION: Only 2. 4 % of known cases of CDH in children born in South Australia had been detected late and required surgery.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} the cause of death and incidence of neoplasia in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone. DESIGN [...] A long term cohort study established to receive details of death certification and tumour registrations through the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and NHS central register. PATIENTS [...] All patients (1246 male, 662 female) treated for short stature with pituitary growth hormone under the Medical Research <b>Council</b> <b>working</b> <b>party</b> and health services human growth hormone committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Death or development of neoplasia. RESULTS [...] 110 patients died (68 male, 42 female; aged 0. 9 - 57 years) from 1972 to 1990. Fifty three death were from neoplasia responsible for growth hormone deficiency (27 craniopharyngioma, 24 other intracranial tumour, two leukaemia); two from histiocytosis X; and 13 from pituitary insufficiency. Six patients died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, six of other neurological disorders, and eight of acute infection. Other deaths were apparently unrelated to growth hormone deficiency or its treatment. Seventeen tumours (in 16 patients) were identified during or after growth hormone treatment. Four were in patients with previous intracranial neoplasia and two were after cranial irradiation. Thirteen were intracranial, the others being Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoma of colon, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS [...] Recurrence or progression of intracranial tumours and potentially avoidable metabolic consequences of hypopituitarism were the main causes of death. Growth hormone treatment probably did not contribute to new tumour development. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after pituitary growth hormone treatment continues to occur in the United Kingdom.

Modules were given after four and roughly 19 weeks on treatment. Each included two doses of daunorubicin (45 mg/m 2 /day), cytosine arabinoside (100 mg/m 2 twice daily X 5), etoposide (100 mg/m 2 /day X 5), and 6 -thioguanine (80 mg/m 2 /day X 5). A total of 132 courses were given. This study included all new patients except girls aged 1 - 14 years with presenting leucocyte count less than 20 X 10 (9) /l. Twenty patients with recurrent disease were also included. The first 32 patients were given cytosine as a 24 hour infusion, but combined with the other agents this was associated with severe intestinal toxicity, which necessitated a change to a less toxic 12 hourly bolus regimen. The complications of the module are reviewed in terms of myelosuppression, enterotoxicity, infection, and other clinical problems encountered. All patients became profoundly neutropenic and thrombocytopenic. The latter was significantly more severe after cytosine infusion. Overall, 64 % received platelet transfusions and 85 % were re-admitted with fevers requiring intravenous antibiotics for between four and 56 days.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. com © BlackwellBACKGROUND: Two previous randomized controlled trials (RCT) demonstrated that the administration of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improved survival in selected patients with hypoxic {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) or chronic airflow limitation (CAL). AIMS: The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether the survival of CAL patients prescribed LTOT at Flinders Medical Centre (FMC) was gender and age related, and equivalent to that of the previous RCT. METHODS: A list of patients prescribed domiciliary oxygen therapy for CAL at FMC was generated from Respiratory Unit records and hospital financial records for the supply of this therapy. Survival was compared with that reported for the original RCT, and for Swedish and Belgian COPD patients. Factors influencing survival were studied. RESULTS: Five hundred and five (249 males, 256 females) patients were prescribed LTOT for CAL at FMC during the study period and included in the survival analysis. The patients were elderly with multiple comorbidities. Survival was less than for the control arms of the previous RCT (apart from the Medical Research <b>Council</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Party</b> (MRC) female group) but comparable with recent overseas data. Overall crude survival was 75. 1 %, 51. 3 %, 18. 9 % and 1. 1 % at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years respectively. Females experienced longer survival than males. Multivariate analysis indicated that age, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, body mass index (BMI) and the number of comorbidities were prognostic indicators for females; BMI was a prognostic indicator for males. A survival advantage existed for females using at least 19 h concentrator oxygen per day. CONCLUSIONS: In routine practice, survival of unselected CAL patients with multiple comorbidities is less than that reported in the original RCT. A. J. Crockett, J. M. Cranston, J. R. Moss and J. H.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} a successful co-operation between academic researchers and non-academic institutions to investigate the quality and viability of videoconference-based interpreting in legal proceedings. The collaborative approach outlined here will {{be of interest to}} a number of public services, especially to legal, healthcare and local government institutions, which encounter problems with access to qualified interpreters. The collaboration started in 2008 in response to the observation that videoconference links were widely used by police forces, courts, probation and prison services in Europe and that the use of interpreters in such video links was rapidly increasing. Furthermore, in 2008, the Metropolitan Police Service in London began to consider the use of ‘remote interpreting’ via video link to reduce interpreter travel costs. At European level, the adoption of Directive 2010 / 64 /EU on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings created a legal basis for using videoconference links to gain access to qualified legal interpreters. However, until 2008, very little was known about the viability and quality of videoconference-based interpreting in legal proceedings. There was a high risk of potential miscarriages of justice through the combined effects of videoconferencing and interpreting. Relevant training for legal practitioners and interpreters was non-existent. There was thus an urgent need for practice-oriented research and research-led practical guidance. To address these issues, we formed a European partner consortium that included research institutions with combined experience in legal interpreting and videoconference communication (University of Surrey, KU Leuven, Institut Télécom Paris); relevant governmental bodies (Ministry of Security and Justice of the Netherlands, Dutch Legal Aid Board, Local Police Antwerp); a lawyer from the Antwerp-based law firm Van der Mussele-Vanden Bosch; a lawyer-linguist with 30 years’ experience as a Magistrate in the UK; and the Polish Society of Sworn and Specialised Translators. The aim was to conduct a comparative study of traditional and video interpreting, and to use the findings to develop guidelines of good practice and to design and pilot training modules for interpreters and legal practitioners. This collaboration was funded by the European Commission, Directorate-General for Justice from 2008 - 11 (AVIDICUS 1; JLS/ 2008 /JPEN/ 03) and 2011 - 13 (AVIDICUS 2; JUST/ 2010 /JPEN/AG/ 1558). The presentation first explains how this collaboration was implemented and outlines its major achievements, which include a collaborative book publication by the consortium partners (Braun & Taylor, eds, 2012. Videoconference and remote interpreting in legal proceedings.
