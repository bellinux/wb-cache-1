500|$|Doggett tells Reyes that, {{in order}} to resolve the situation, she must turn off his {{respirator}} and allow him to die, but she refuses. Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next, Skinner convinces Reyes {{to go back to}} her apartment while he, Scully, and Follmer monitor her. She returns and is attacked by Lukesh. The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head, killing him. Reyes then returns to the hospital, <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as she shuts off Doggett's respirator. [...] As she opens her eyes, the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared earlier. Reyes, stunned and fighting back tears, embraces Doggett as he, evidently unaware of any of the previous events, asks her what is wrong.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} Madonna at {{the empty}} suite of an abandoned hotel, a similar setting to her [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] music video. It was shot in a single frame, with the camera approaching Madonna, as she stands behind a pillar. She rotates around it and sings the song, as air blows through the room. The video ends with Madonna looking up towards the camera the last time, and then <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> It was treated with sepia color. Carol Vernallis, author of Experiencing music video: aesthetics and cultural context felt that the video was {{a good example of}} how image can direct the viewer's attention towards the shift in instrumentation and arrangement of the song. She noted the aimless movement of the camera towards her as [...] "bringing focus to the main subject, with the viewer's attention fully captured." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Sun of a Gun", {{directed}} by ThirtyTwo, was first released onto Vevo on 19 October 2010. It was filmed in 2010 in Brooklyn, and displays Oh Land {{in two different}} themes: dark and light. According to Oh Land herself, she [...] "wanted the video to show the two different states {{that you can get}} in when you are in love with someone". The dark side reflects her [...] "desire to protect oneself from being hurt and celebrating independence", while the light side reflects her [...] "desire to be loved and the joys of being in love". The video opens with the dark side of Oh Land, wearing a black dress and extensive eye makeup. She performs the song's choreography atop a cloud-like stage, surrounded by blinking lights. As the track's chorus begins, the light side of Oh Land appears, in a skin-colored dress and longer hair, in front of a screen displaying the sun. The second verse finds her wearing a different black dress, and singing the song by many mirrors; simultaneously, visuals of Oh Land on the ground dancing appear. The following chorus shows the same scenario, but in the same skin-colored dress from earlier. In the song's bridge, both versions of the singer pull a shawl over their head, allowing it to move with the wind. The video concludes with Oh Land <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as the screen cuts to black.|$|E

2500|$|In the MGM film, an {{adolescent}} farm girl named Dorothy (played by Judy Garland), her dog Toto, and their farmhouse are swept away from Kansas by a tornado {{and taken to}} the magical Land of Oz. The house falls on and kills the Wicked Witch of the East, freeing the Munchkins from her tyranny. Glinda the Good Witch of the North arrives via magic bubble and shows Dorothy the dead woman's two feet visibly sticking {{out from under the}} house wearing the ruby slippers. When the Wicked Witch of the West comes to claim her dead sister's shoes, Glinda magically transfers them to Dorothy's feet. Glinda tells Dorothy to keep tight inside of them and never take them off, as the slippers must be very powerful or the Wicked Witch would not want them so badly. Throughout the rest of the film, the Wicked Witch schemes to obtain the shoes. When she captures Dorothy, she tries to take the slippers, but receives a painful shock. The Wicked Witch then realizes that the slippers will only come off if the wearer is dead, so she decides to kill Dorothy. Before she does, however, Dorothy accidentally splashes her with a bucket of water, causing her to melt away. At the end, it is revealed that Dorothy can return home by simply <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> clicking the heels of the slippers together three times and repeating the phrase, [...] "There's no place like home." ...|$|E
