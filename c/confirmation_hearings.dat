5|$|In {{response}} to conservative {{criticism that the}} State Department lacked hardliners, Reagan in 1981 nominated Ernest W. Lefever as Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. Lefever performed poorly at his <b>confirmation</b> <b>hearings</b> and the Senate committee rejected his nomination by vote of 4–13; Lefever withdrew his name.|$|E

5|$|The {{hearing in}} the case of Ruto, Kosgey and Sang took place in The Hague between 1 and 8 September 2011. The three {{defendants}} had all filed applications challenging the jurisdiction of the court which were rejected by the chamber. Although the defence teams had initially proposed calling 43 witnesses to the confirmation of charges hearings the chamber instructed them to present just two witnesses each at the <b>confirmation</b> <b>hearings,</b> which they did. Ruto and Sang additionally made unsworn statements in person.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} {{required a}} Saxbe fix, passed and {{signed into law}} in December 2008. <b>Confirmation</b> <b>hearings</b> before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, {{a week before the}} Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton. By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal. On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94–2. Clinton took the oath of office of Secretary of State, resigning from the Senate later that day. She became the first former first lady to serve in the United States Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent <b>confirmation</b> <b>hearings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{outcomes}} of the <b>confirmation</b> of charges <b>hearings</b> were announced on 23 January 2012.

25|$|Bush {{appointed}} the two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1990, Bush {{appointed the}} largely unknown appellate judge David Souter to replace liberal icon William Brennan. Souter was easily confirmed and served until 2009, but joined the liberal bloc of the court, disappointing Bush. In 1991, Bush nominated the conservative Clarence Thomas to succeed Thurgood Marshall, another long-time liberal stalwart. Thomas won <b>confirmation</b> after contentious <b>hearings</b> {{in a narrow}} 52-48 vote, and Thomas {{became one of the}} most conservative justices of his era.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Government) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Academia {{has argued}} that Congress has a vested {{interest}} in controlling the agencies of the federal government. While most of these agencies are not considered apolitical, the Offices of Inspectors General (OIGs) are distinctly required to remain independent and apolitical. However, the Inspectors General (IGs) still operate within a political system and are not immune to political interference. This research looked at whether Congress employs subtle methods for attempting control of the IGs or whether Congress recognizes the importance of autonomous IGs for the public trust and generally resists the temptation to attempt control. The research focused on the testimonial process, OIG appropriations, and the results of interviews of IGs and congressional staff. Results show that attempts at control or influence do occur; the extent of which varies. Control may be attempted through the <b>confirmation</b> process, <b>hearings,</b> appropriations, press, letters, and direct communication. Governmen...|$|R
5|$|Solis's <b>confirmation</b> <b>hearings</b> {{were held}} on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy {{repeatedly}} praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E

5000|$|The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, Pub. 238, 75th Congress, 50 Stat. 551 (August 2, 1937) was a United States Act {{that placed}} {{a tax on}} the sale of cannabis. The H.R. 6385 act was drafted by Harry Anslinger and {{introduced}} by Rep. Robert L. Doughton of North Carolina, on April 14, 1937. The seventy-fifth Congress held hearings on April 27, 28, 29th, 30th, and May 4, 1937. Upon the congressional <b>hearings</b> <b>confirmation,</b> the H.R. 6385 act was redrafted as H.R. 6906 and introduced with House Report 792.

40|$|From the introduction: Rarely {{do people}} stay glued to their {{televisions}} {{in order to}} watch events they do not enjoy. But such was unquestionably {{the case with the}} Senate hearings on Clarence Thomas 2 ̆ 7 nomination to the Supreme Court. There was widespread agreement on only one thing: Something had gone terribly wrong with the process. Right or left, feminist or not, pro-life or pro-choice, however one stood on the question of <b>confirmation,</b> the <b>hearings</b> defied simple analysis. Racism and sexism provided a troubling backdrop as the hearings reminded us how little we understand one another. Neither Thomas nor Hill were easily stereotyped. Thomas radiated real strength and confidence. But equally real was the feeling of vulnerability that accompanied the charge that his opponents had made him the victim of a high-tech lynching. And Thomas was not the only paradox. Anita Hill had a prim and fastidious appearance that made her solemn use of words like 2 ̆ 2 penis 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 pubic hair 2 ̆ 2 seem surreal and unaccountable. Thus, the hearings generated a confusing array of images; like a kaleidoscope, they reflected American political life from many strange and unfamiliar perspectives...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted {{to stop the}} ICC process. The government appealed to both the United Nations Security Council and the Court itself regarding the admissibility of the case. The National Assembly voted in favour of removing Kenya as a state party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty which established the ICC. Despite this opposition, the suspects cooperated with the proceedings and attended preliminary hearings in The Hague in April 2011 and <b>confirmation</b> of charges <b>hearings</b> in September of that year. The Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014. However the Chief prosecuter has asked that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial.|$|R
5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the <b>confirmation</b> of charges <b>hearings</b> in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the hearings in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding the hearings in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the hearings in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|R
5000|$|Kagwanja {{is better}} known {{for his work on}} youth and generational {{politics}} published as a series of articles and book chapters between 2003 and 2007. His research highlights the transformation of the Mungiki youth group from a social movement that emerged in the 1980s in the pristine rural parts of Kenya as part of the larger national resistance against one-party authoritarianism to a stridently violent extremist and criminal gang upon its entry into the urban milieu. [...] In a 2006 article, [...] "Power to Uhuru", Kagwanja argued that Mungiki popularized a brand of generational politics based on Gikuyu traditional system of power transfer across generations known as itwika as an idiom of resistance, pushing for a change of guard from the old political class to the ‘Uhuru' (independence) generation. Mungiki’s generation politics failed to deliver power to the youth during the 2002 General Elections, forcing some of its elements to turn to violent extremist strategies. Mungiki reportedly featured in the 2008 post-election violence, but Kagwanja argues that {{in the context of the}} diffused violence in the post-Moi era, Mungiki had come to refer more to ‘Kikuyu’ youth in the margins of political and economic power than to a known cohesive youth movement with an organizational structure and chain of command. [...] In September 2011, during the <b>confirmation</b> of charges <b>hearings</b> at the Hague-based International criminal Court (ICC), the court's chief Prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, invoked one of Kagwanja's articles to draw a link between Uhuru Kenyatta and the Mungiki. [...] In a press statement on September 29, 2011, Kagwanja dismissed the Prosecutor's use of his research as unethical, predatory and careless.|$|R

Garland also expressed admiration for the writing style of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.. Senate Republicans did not then schedule a vote on Garland's confirmation, not because of concerns over Garland's qualifications but because of a dispute over whether to fill the seat.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the <b>confirmation</b> <b>hearings,</b> sexual {{harassment}} allegations by Anita Hill, a law professor who had previously worked under Thomas at the United States Department of Education and then at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), were leaked to the media from a confidential FBI report. The allegations led to a media frenzy and further investigations. Televised hearings were re-opened and held by the Senate Judiciary Committee before the nomination was moved to the full Senate for a vote. Thomas was confirmed by a narrow majority of 52 to 48.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, President George H. W. Bush {{nominated}} Thomas {{for a seat}} on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He {{served in}} that role for 16 months and on July 1, 1991, was nominated by Bush to fill Marshall's seat on the United States Supreme Court. Thomas's <b>confirmation</b> <b>hearings</b> were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed attorney Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and subsequently at the EEOC.
