25|$|The group soon {{learns that}} the St. Johns {{had a deal}} with local bandits; they gave the bandits food and in {{exchange}} the bandits would not attack the dairy. The bandits launch {{an attack on the}} motel that attracts walkers, and the group is forced to abandon their base and supplies. During the attack, Duck is bitten. The group <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> <b>a</b> freight train and get it working, heading towards Savannah, with the intention of finding a boat and getting out onto the ocean. During the trip, Duck succumbs to his bite; the loss drives Katjaa to suicide. Kenny is completely inconsolable by the ordeal of losing his wife and son. The group encounter Christa and Omid, two other survivors who join them.|$|E
25|$|Riley's group {{arrives at}} the city only to <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> <b>a</b> raised drawbridge. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but {{a small group of}} zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning. Riley and the others manage to dispose of and evade the zombies. After {{crossing}} the bridge, they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies. Realizing it is too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. It is then revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan, thus surviving the assault. Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups. As they see Big Daddy and the zombies (who are, curiously, not attacking the surviving humans) leaving the city, Riley decides to leave them alone, citing that they are just {{looking for a place to}} go, too. While lighting up the rest of the fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the zombies but are now useless since they don't distract the horde anymore), Riley's group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning.|$|E
500|$|Passing the Fairfield exit, {{it crosses}} over Business 33 {{and the two}} roads merge as a two-lane road. [...] Route 33 passes along the {{southern}} section of the Naval Weapons Station Earle and then becomes a residential access road. The road then runs concurrent with Route 34 and becomes a divided four-lane avenue as it travels into Wall Township. Routes 33/34 <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> <b>a</b> roundabout and they both split as Route 33 continues east thru a rural section into Tinton Falls. It goes past the intersection with Route 66, past the interchange with the Garden State Parkway, across the highway and into Neptune Township. The road passes through suburban and rural sections until it comes upon the interchange with Route 18. Immediately past the exit, Route 33 borders Neptune City on the south and Neptune Township on the north for a brief stretch before completely re-entering Neptune Township. After it crosses Route 35, the avenue ends and becomes a two-lane road for a brief stretch. Route 33 then ends at Route 71, just west of Ocean Grove.|$|E

2500|$|Bonobos do {{not form}} {{permanent}} monogamous sexual relationships with individual partners.

When bonobos <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> <b>a</b> new food source or feeding ground, the increased excitement will usually lead to communal sexual activity, presumably decreasing tension and encouraging peaceful feeding. This quality is also described by Dr. Susan Block as [...] "The Bonobo Way" [...] in her book of the same title [...] "The Bonobo Way: The Evolution of Peace Through Pleasure".|$|E

[...] In this work, the {{characters}} <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> <b>a</b> secret society's foul plot to destroy mankind, and pursue it first near {{to home and}} then in a series of exotic locations. This template was to be followed in many subsequent campaigns, including Fungi from Yuggoth (later known as Curse of Cthulhu and Day of the Beast), Spawn of Azathoth, and possibly the most highly acclaimed, Masks of Nyarlathotep. Many of these seem closer in tone to the pulp adventures of Indiana Jones than H. P. Lovecraft, but they are nonetheless beloved by many gamers.|$|E

Therefore on this day we read the portion commencing 'after the death of the two sons of Aaron', that the people may hear and lament the loss of the righteous and obtain {{forgiveness}} for their sins. For whenever a man so laments and sheds tears for them, God proclaims of him, 'thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged' (Isa. Vl, 7).

2500|$|While {{writing a}} poem about God one day he was {{interrupted}} by the visit of a business acquaintance who {{expressed an interest in}} his activity, perhaps because he was so busy typing. Mr. Chase read a portion of what he was writing and he was astounded when his friend told him that he had recently <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> <b>a</b> man who had declared that God had “walked upon the earth.” Immediately Mr. Chase expressed interest and asked to be conducted to this person. Chase was then put in touch with Ibrahim George Kheiralla, recently immigrated to the United States and the second Bahá'í in America after Anton Haddad. A small group began to study the religion with Kheiralla. Stockman indicates that 5 June 1894 was probably the day the class began. A week later he was noted in Pueblo, CO, and then attended a memorial observance for Bunker Hill back in Chicago. Chase's status as a Bahá'i is accepted pointing to this time though several others accepted the new religion before him, but did not stay with the religion. Thus Chase should be considered the first American to become and remain a Bahá'í, and not the first American Bahá'í chronologically. In January 1897 his speech at an insurance agents convention was described as [...] "beautiful…, bright and sublime in its imagery", about attaining to noble ideals above [...] "killing time". In February Chase used an editorial commending of the insurance agent association for [...] "inviting men in various walks of life to its banquets to speak to the members on topics that inspire, elevate, and encourage", and expands on the theme, quoting his words: ...|$|E
