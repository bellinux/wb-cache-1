5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal <b>claws</b> <b>and</b> a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal <b>claws</b> <b>and</b> a separated petiole.|$|E

The Silver Samurai severs Logan's adamantium <b>claws</b> <b>and</b> begins to extract Logan's healing abilities, {{revealing}} {{himself to be}} Ichirō, who had faked his death. Ichirō regains his youth, but Mariko intervenes and stabs Ichirō with Logan's severed claws. Logan regenerates his bone <b>claws</b> <b>and</b> kills Ichirō. Logan collapses and has one final hallucination of Jean, in which he decides to finally let go of her. Mariko becomes CEO of Yashida Industries and bids farewell to Logan {{as he prepares to}} leave Japan. Yukio vows to stay by Logan's side as his bodyguard, and they depart to places unknown.|$|E

5|$|Bears are carnivoran mammals of {{the family}} Ursidae. They are {{classified}} as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing {{in a wide variety}} of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile <b>claws,</b> <b>and</b> short tails.|$|E

The city arms of Kiruna were granted in 1949, and the municipal arms were registered in 1974. Blazon: Party per fess: Argent, the Iron alchemical symbol azure; Azure, a ptarmigan argent.

5|$|The paws of the cheetah are {{narrower}} {{than those}} of other felids. The slightly curved claws lack a protective sheath and are weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the big cats, which have fully retractable <b>claws,</b> <b>and</b> a similarity to canids. Additionally, the claws of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter {{than those of}} other cats. Absence of protection makes the claws blunt; however, the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E
5|$|William Morton Wheeler {{comments}} that P. longiceps were possibly an arboreal nesting species. This means the ant {{did not live}} in the soil and nested in trees instead. He assumed this due to its long legs, strong <b>claws</b> <b>and</b> long mandibles; Prionomyrmex was also assumed to be predacious, equipped with a well developed and powerful sting that was most likely used to kill prey. Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations, and is even more primitive in its body structure than Myrmecia. Female stylopids were known to parasite Prionomyrmex ants.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable <b>claws,</b> <b>and</b> teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E

5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and <b>claws</b> <b>and</b> pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants {{existed in}} Europe during the Eocene and Late Oligocene. Cesare Baroni Urbani {{collected}} Prionomyrmex janzeni in Baltic amber from Kaliningrad, Russia and Prionomyrmex wappleri in Germany. Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr collected Prionomyrmex longiceps in Baltic amber from the Eocene, but {{the exact location}} of its discovery is unclear, due to the lost type material. P. longiceps were an arboreal nesting species, living in trees instead of the ground. William Morton Wheeler assumed this due to its long legs, sharp <b>claws</b> <b>and</b> elongated mandibles. Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations.|$|E
5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs. They analyzed the bio-mechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the <b>claws</b> <b>and</b> into the limbs, using X-ray imaging to create a three-dimensional contour map of a forelimb claw from Velociraptor. For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E
