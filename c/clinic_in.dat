5|$|Birth control {{practices}} were generally adopted earlier in Europe {{than in the}} United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, {{with the goal of}} challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the Malthusian League– the world's first birth control advocacy group– which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus's dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control <b>clinic</b> <b>in</b> the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs. The first birth control <b>clinic</b> <b>in</b> England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.|$|E

5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control <b>clinic</b> <b>in</b> New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville <b>clinic</b> <b>in</b> Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E
