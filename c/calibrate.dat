40|$|Abstract. Binocular stereovision {{system is}} {{regularly}} only <b>calibrated</b> once, that is each camera is <b>calibrated</b> using {{a picture of}} the calibration pattern laid in the cross field. This method’s calibration accuracy is expected to be improved. A twice <b>calibrating</b> method is proposed here. Each camera’s extrinsic and intrinsic parameters are <b>calibrated</b> in different fields. The extrinsic parameters are firstly <b>calibrated</b> in the cross field, then the intrinsic parameters are <b>calibrated</b> in the close-range field. By applying the method to one binocular stereovision system built in our lab, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can improve the calibration accuracy more than 3. 4 dB than the once <b>calibrating</b> method. Its accuracy makes this novel method more suitable for high accurate target tracking application...|$|R

40|$|Excellent ranking power {{along with}} well <b>calibrated</b> {{probability}} estimates {{are needed in}} many classification tasks. In this paper, we introduce a technique, <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest that captures both. This novel technique is an ensemble of gradient boosting machines that can support both continuous and binary labels. While offering superior ranking power over any individual regression or classification model, <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest is able to preserve well <b>calibrated</b> posterior probabilities. Along with these benefits, we provide {{an alternative to the}} tedious step of tuning gradient boosting machines. We demonstrate that tuning <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest can be reduced to a simple hyper-parameter selection. We further establish that increasing this hyper-parameter improves the ranking performance under a diminishing return. We examine the effectiveness of <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest on ligand-based virtual screening where both continuous and binary labels are available and compare the performance of <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest with logistic regression, gradient boosting machine and deep learning. <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest achieved an approximately 48 % improvement compared to a state-of-art deep learning model. Moreover, it achieved around 95 % improvement on probability quality measurement compared to the best individual gradient boosting machine. <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest offers a benchmark demonstration that in the field of ligand-based virtual screening, deep learning is not the universally dominant machine learning model and good <b>calibrated</b> probabilities can better facilitate virtual screening process.

The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to <b>calibrate</b> against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster.

5|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the spacecraft's orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around the spacecraft to <b>calibrate</b> solar direction relative to the orbiter's frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.|$|E

5|$|Testing of the Disney bombs {{began in}} early 1945. Bombs were {{initially}} dropped on a bombing range near Southampton to photographically record their trajectory and <b>calibrate</b> bombsights. This was necessary as the flight-path of a rocket-accelerated bomb differed considerably {{from that of}} a free–falling bomb. Test drops were then conducted on the Watten bunker, German codename Kraftwerk Nord West (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques), a large German concrete bunker near Watten in northern France. This was ideal for the purpose as the area had been captured by Allied forces in September 1944, so damage to the structure could be inspected after bomb tests. Four bombs, carried by two B-17s, were used and two hits scored on the target. The resultant damage was considered satisfactory by Royal Navy observers on the ground.|$|E

A distance of 7,330light-years (2,250parsecs) has been determined from the calibration of O-type star luminosities in Trumpler 16. After determining an abnormal reddening correction to the extinction, the distance to both Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 has been measured at 9,500±1000light-years (2,900±300parsecs).|$|E

5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to <b>calibrate</b> the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E
