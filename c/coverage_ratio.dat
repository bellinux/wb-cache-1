Those without access to piped water supply get water mostly from wells that are often salty and polluted with bacteria.

30|$|Although the {{conductance}} {{properties of}} various rGO configurations are investigated {{in the literature}} as summarized above, the conductance characteristics are estimated using the obtained band gaps and DOS characteristics which show zero-bias behaviour. However, it is recently shown that the conductance characteristics of functionalized graphene structures have to be evaluated by taking the voltage-dependent transmission spectra and voltage-dependent transmission eigenstates into consideration [41] which is missing in the literature for rGO structures. Considering the utilization of rGO in electronic applications, analyses of their voltage-dependent electronic transport characteristics are clearly essential. Therefore, in this study, the voltage-dependent electronic transport behaviours of realistic rGO samples with various <b>coverage</b> <b>ratios</b> are obtained utilizing first-principles simulations. The current–voltage characteristics are interpreted taking the possible application areas of the rGO structures into consideration. Obtained results show that rGO structures with different <b>coverage</b> <b>ratios</b> have peculiar electronic transport characteristics.|$|R

50|$|The footage {{which can}} be built-upon is {{regulated}} according to a system involving two figures: building <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> (kenpeiritsu) and floor area ratio (yōsekiritsu). Building <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio of the}} building footprint compared to the total area of the land. These two figures are often listed in advertisements for plots of land such as 70:400 (where 70 means the building <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> is 70% and 400 is the floor area ratio or 400%). This would mean that a 4 story home could be built using 70% of the land. Thus, for a maximum allowable <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> of 50%, the greatest building footprint allowed for a lot of 100m2 would be 50m2. Floor area ratio is the total floor area of the house (excluding the roof and basement) as compared to the area of land the house is built upon; for a maximum FAR of 150%, the greatest possible total floor area for a house built on a 100m2 lot would be 150m2. Both maximum values vary according to the location of the land and width of facing roadway, with more built-up areas with wider roads generally allowing greater maximum floorspace, and building coverage dictated by factors such as frontage, nearby roads, and construction materials. Additionally, the number of floors in a structure may be restricted, in order to avoid excessive blockage of light to neighboring properties.|$|E

40|$|Measuring {{credit risk}} {{is always a}} primary matter, mainly in the {{institution}} of banking. Several efforts have been adopted by banks to ensure the security of their loans. Accordingly, three objectives are introduced in this study {{as an effort to}} complement banks’ current credit risk management tools. The first objective is to modify the KMV-Merton model according to the assumptions and condition of companies’ extreme cases made in this study. The second objective is to adapt the modified KMV-Merton model to the cases of estimating the probability of default of Malaysian companies, and the results of the adaptation are validated through credit ratings and EBIT interest <b>coverage</b> <b>ratios.</b> It appears that the probability of default estimated by the modified KMV-Merton model is able to react significantly and coincides with the given credit ratings and EBIT interest <b>coverage</b> <b>ratios</b> in a way of measuring the credit risk of Malaysian companies.

The analysis shows that the modified KMV-Merton model is able to predict future default of the companies up to three years in advance. These conclude that the modified KMV-Merton model is a convincing default forecaster model for Malaysian companies.
