500|$|The 110th {{floor of}} One World Trade Center (the North Tower) housed radio and {{television}} transmission equipment. The roof of the North Tower contained {{a vast array of}} transmission antennas, including the [...] center antenna mast, rebuilt by Dielectric Inc. to support DTV in 1999. The <b>center</b> <b>mast</b> contained the television signals for almost all NYC television broadcasters: WCBS-TV2, WNBC-TV4, WNYW5, WABC-TV7, WWOR-TV9 Secaucus, WPIX11, WNET13 Newark, WPXN-TV31 and WNJU47 Linden. It also had four NYC FM broadcasters: WPAT-FM93.1, WNYC93.9, WKCR89.9, and WKTU103.5.

50|$|Ship cards have a new, {{sturdier}} design.

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{practical}} rigs for small proas was invented by Euell Gibbons around 1950 for a small, single handed proa. This rig was a loose footed lateen sail hung from a <b>centered</b> <b>mast.</b> The sail was symmetric across the yard, and to shunt, what was previously the top end of the yard was lowered and became the bottom end, reversing {{the direction of the}} sail. Proa enthusiast Gary Dierking modified this design further, using a curved yard and a boom perpendicular to the yard. This allows a greater control of the sail shape than the traditional Gibbons rig, while retaining the simple shunting method, and {{is often referred to as}} the Gibbons/Dierking rig.|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{application}} of Generalized Parity Relations to two experimental flexible space structures, the NASA Langley Mini-Mast and Marshall Space Flight <b>Center</b> ACES <b>mast.</b> We concentrate on the generation of residuals and make no attempt to implement the Decision Function. It should be clear from the examples that are presented {{whether it would be}} possible to detect the failure of a specific component. We derive the equations from Generalized Parity Relations. Two special cases are treated: namely, Single Sensor Parity Relations (SSPR) and Double Sensor Parity Relations (DSPR). Generalized Parity Relations for actuators are also derived. The NASA Langley Mini-Mast and {{the application of}} SSPR and DSPR to a set of displacement sensors located at the tip of the Mini-Mast are discussed. The performance of a reduced order model that includes the first five models of the mast is compared to a set of parity relations that was identified on a set of input-output data. Both time domain and frequency domain comparisons are made. The effect of the sampling period and model order on the performance of the Residual Generators are also discussed. Failure detection experiments where the sensor set consisted of two gyros and an accelerometer are presented. The effects of model order and sampling frequency are again illustrated. The detection of actuator failures is discussed. We use Generalized Parity Relations to monitor control system component failures on the ACES mast. An overview is given of the Failure Detection Filter and experimental results are discussed. Conclusions and directions for future research are given...|$|R

40|$|Following two {{earlier studies}} of hematopoietic and other {{selected}} cancers near the Sutton Coldfield television (TV) transmitter in England (Sutton Mast), continuing local con-cerns prompted a further {{study in which}} previous analysis was repeated and more timely cancer data were used. The first study by Dolk et al. (1) found significant declines in risk for adult leukemia, skin cancer, and bladder cancer with distance from the TV transmitter. A second study by Dolk et al. (2), in which 20 TV transmitters (including Sutton Mast) in the United Kingdom were investigated, was unable to replicate the pattern {{and the extent of}} the first study. This research letter reports on whether the results of analysis of adult and childhood leukemia around Sutton Mast in which more recent data were used are consistent with the results from these earlier studies. Cancer data from the years 1987 – 1994 were extracted from the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit database (Birmingham, England). The individual cancer sites and can-cer groupings (based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes) selected for the study followed those used in the earli-er national study (2). The total study area was defined as a series of 10 concentric circles <b>centered</b> on Sutton <b>Mast</b> (figure 1). For all cancer sites studied, expected numbers of cases were calculated for each of the 10 bands (persons, male and female adults separately). Expected numbers of all leukemias were also calculated for male and female children (aged 0 – 14 years). These numbers were based on regional observed cases, stratified by 5 -year age bands, sex, and social deprivation. Population data were based on enumeration districts...|$|R
