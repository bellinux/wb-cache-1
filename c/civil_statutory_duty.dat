40|$|The {{conventional}} view {{of corporate}} regulation is that corporations {{are to be}} managed {{for the benefit of}} their shareholders. The general law and <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> of directors and officers reflect this “shareholder primacy norm”, with duties formulated to prevent directors acting otherwise than in the interests of shareholders. However, the general law and <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> are not identical. The remedies and enforcement mechanisms differ considerably, which raises the question as to whether the public enforcement of <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> carries with it a public interest mandate that general law duties do not. This article considers what role the public interest should have in enforcing <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> and whether such a role represents a challenge to the dominant shareholder primacy norm of corporate law. This issue is highly topical as recent decisions have suggested that the <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> of directors and officers are limited in their scope to protecting the interests of shareholders, even {{to the detriment of the}} public interest. We contest that viewpoint and argue that, at least in relation to <b>statutory</b> <b>duties,</b> directors and officers have obligations that extend beyond the narrow conception of the protection of shareholder wealth...|$|R

50|$|Secondly, {{harmonisation}} of {{tort law}} would also need harmonisation of administrative and criminal law. Most legal systems acknowledge {{the possibility to}} be liable for damage caused by the violation of a <b>statutory</b> <b>duty.</b> Hence, if {{there were to be}} harmonisation of the rules for breach of <b>statutory</b> <b>duty,</b> one should also harmonise the statutory rules that can be invoked as a basis for this tort.|$|R
5000|$|Immanuel Kant's 1793 Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone {{argues that}} the New Testament teaches a {{hermeneutic}} strategy in which [...] "not scriptural scholarship but the pure religion of reason must be the law's interpreter."Jesus claims that not the observance of outer <b>civil</b> or <b>statutory</b> churchly <b>duties</b> but the pure moral disposition of the heart alone can make man well-pleasing to God (Mt 5:20-48); … that injury done one’s neighbor can be repaired only through satisfaction rendered to the neighbor himself, not through acts of divine worship (Mt 5:24). Thus, he says, does he intend to do full justice to the Jewish law (Mt 5:17); whence {{it is obvious that}} not scriptural scholarship but the pure religion of reason must be the law’s interpreter, for taken according to the letter, it allowed the very opposite of all this.The Old Testament was interpreted by the Pharisees as a statutory religion. Kant claims that the New Testament intends to replace statutory religion with a [...] "moral religion," [...] which combines all duties into a single universal rule, [...] "Love thy neighbor as thyself."Whatever, over and above good life-conduct, man fancies that he can do to become well-pleasing to God is mere religious delusion.Such delusions, Kant argues, must be abandoned to fulfill the New Testament's demand for a rational religion.|$|R

50|$|However, if the {{promisee}} {{provides more}} than what public duty imposes on him, then this is good consideration. In Ward v Byham a mother was under a <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to look after her child. The ex-husband promised to pay her £1 a week if she ensured {{that the child was}} well looked after and happy. It was held that notwithstanding the <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> imposed on the mother, she could enforce the promise since the act of keeping the baby 'happy' provided additional consideration.|$|R
