40|$|The {{tribological}} {{properties of}} one chrome oxide and one <b>chrome</b> <b>carbide</b> based solid lubricant coating were evaluated in a partial-arc foil bearing at 25 and 500 C. Start/stop bearing operation up to 20, 000 cycles were run under 10 kPa (1. 5 psi) static deadweight load. Bearing friction (torque) was measured during the test. Specimen wear and SEM/EDS surface {{analyses were conducted}} after testing to understand and elucidate the tribological characteristics observed. The chrome oxide coating which contains both (Ag) and (BaF 2 /CaF 2) for low and high temperature lubrication, exhibited low friction in sliding against Al 2 O 3 coated foils at 25 and 500 C. The <b>chrome</b> <b>carbide</b> coating, which lacked a low temperature lubricant but contained BaF 2 /CaF 2 as a high temperature lubricant, exhibited high friction at 25 C and low friction at 500 C against both bare and Al 2 O 3 coated superalloy foil surfaces. Post test surface analyses suggest that improved tribological performance is exhibited when a lubricant film from the coating transfers to the foil surface...|$|E

30|$|The wear {{process of}} the shearer drum helical vane was studied. In poor {{production}} conditions, {{the tail end of}} the shearer drum helical vane was often worn out. After a comparative study of several methods, the chrome SA 1750 CR wear-resistant composite plate was selected. The plate is made as follows: using the heap welding method, a layer of high <b>chrome</b> and <b>carbide</b> material are surfaced on a low alloy steel plate, and form a heap welding layer with high wear property, while the back of the plate has high toughness property; the large difference in the properties of front and back side of the composite plate results in the large improvement in the properties of bending, welding and mechanical processing of composite plate and original low carbon alloy steel plate.|$|R

40|$|The {{tribology}} {{of brush}} seals is of considerable interest to turbine engine designers because bristle wear continues to limit long term seal performance and life. To provide better materials characterization and foster {{the development of}} improved seals, NASA Lewis has developed a brush seal tuft tester. In this test, a 'paintbrush' sample tuft is loaded under constant contact pressure against the outside diameter of a rotating journal. With this configuration a direct measurement of load and friction is made. Accurate wear rate measurements are possible due to the known contact pressure. Previously reported baseline research using this facility showed good data repeatability and wear morphology similar to published seal data. This paper extends and expands the database for candidate brush seal materials. A series of tuft tests were completed to evaluate the performance of five high temperature superalloy wires sliding against plasma sprayed nichrome-bonded <b>chrome</b> <b>carbide.</b> Wire materials were either nickel-chrome or cobalt-chrome based superalloys. Good corroboration of the tuft results with dynamic seal rig tests was observed; giving additional confidence in the tuft test as a screening and development tool...|$|E
40|$|Brush seals {{have been}} {{incorporated}} in the latest turbine engines to reduce leakage and improve efficiency. However, the life of these seals is limited by wear. Studies have shown that optimal sealing characteristics for a brush seal occur before the interference fit between the brush and shaft is excessively worn. Research to develop improved tribopairs (brush and coating) with reduced wear and lower friction has been hindered {{by the lack of}} an accurate, low-cost, efficient test methodology. Estimated costs for evaluating a new material combination in an engine company seal test program are on the order of $ 100, 000. To address this need, the NASA Lewis Research Center designed, built, and validated a unique, innovative brush seal tuft tester that slides a single tuft of brush seal wire against a rotating shaft under controlled loads, speeds, and temperatures comparable to those in turbine engines. As an initial screening tool, the brush seal tuft tester can tribologicaly evaluate candidate seal materials for 1 / 10 th the cost of full-scale seal tests. Previous {{to the development of the}} brush seal tuft tester facility, most relevant tribological data had been obtained from full-scale seal tests conducted primarily to determine seal leakage characteristics. However, from a tribological point of view, these tests included the confounding effects of varying contact pressures, bristle flaring, high-temperature oxidation, and varying bristle contact angles. These confounding effects are overcome in tuft testing. The interface contact pressures can be either constant or varying depending on the tuft mounting device, and bristle wear can be measured optically with inscribed witness marks. In a recent cooperative program with a U. S. turbine engine manufacturer, five metallic wire candidates were tested against a plasma-sprayed Nichrome-bonded <b>chrome</b> <b>carbide.</b> The wire materials used during this collaboration were either nickel-chrome- or cobaltchrome-based superalloys. These tests corroborated full-scale seal test results and provided insight into previously untested combinations. As the cycle temperature for improved efficiency turbine engines increases, new brush seal materials combinations must be considered. Future brush seal tuft testing will include both metallic and ceramic bristles versus commercial and NASA-developed shaft coatings. The ultimate goal of this work is to expand the current data base so that seal designers can tailor brush seal materials to specific applications...|$|E
40|$|The Rotary Combustor {{is a novel}} {{concept for}} burning coal with low SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} emissions. It burns crushed coal in a fluid bed where the bed is {{maintained}} in a rotating drum by centripetal force. Since this force may be varied, the combustor may be very compact, and thus be a direct replacement for a p. c. burner on existing boilers. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate that a typical industrial boiler can be refired with the modified prototype Rotary Combustor to burn Ohio high-sulfur coal with low emissions of SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x}. The primary problem that must be resolved to demonstrate sustained operations with coal is temperature control in the rotating fluid bed. The prototype Rotary Combustor was assembled and installed on the T- 850 P CNB boiler at the CONSOL Energy site in South Park, Pennsylvania. Several design improvements were investigated and implemented during the assembly to improve the prototype Rotary Combustor operations compared to prior tests at Detroit Stoker in Monroe, Michigan. An Operating Manual and Safety Review were completed. The shakedown test phase was initiated. Two major problems were initially encountered: binding of the rotating drum at operating temperatures, and reduced fluid-bed pressure drop after short periods of operation. Plating the brush seal rotary land ring with a <b>chrome</b> <b>carbide</b> plasma spray and lubricating the seal prior to each test sufficiently resolved these problems to permit {{a limited number of}} operations tests. Unlike previous tests at Detroit Stoker, sustained operation of the prototype Rotary Combustor was accomplished burning a high-Btu fuel, metallurgical coke. The prototype Rotary Combustor was operated with coke in gasifier mode on two occasions. Fluid-bed temperature spiking was minimized with manual control of the feeds (coke, air and steam), and no clinker formation problems were encountered in either test. Emission levels of NO{sub x} were measured at about 270 ppmv which were higher those targeted for the device which were 100 ppmv. This was assumed to be because of the aforementioned temperature spiking. The primary operating problem remains control of the fluid-bed temperature. Although improvements were made, steam flow control was manual, and very coarse. To accomplish this will require finer control of the steam flow to the rotary drum air plenum, and development of an algorithm for automatic control using the Moore APACS{trademark}. This is the recommended succeeding step {{in the development of the}} Rotary Combustor for industrial or utility use...|$|E
