The magnetic phe-nomena in the complex non-linear electromagnetic CCVIT system will be studied by using the finite element method in the three-dimensional domain and the original program package FEM- 3 D. The magnetic field analysis will derive the exact CCVIT metrological characteristics. The FEM- 3 D results are basis for further optimal CCVIT design from metrological aspect by using the stochastic method-genetic algorithm introduced in the original program as an <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer</b> design tool. The objective function during the optimization process is a combination of the CCVIT metrological parameters. Higher accuracy class will be achieved with the CCVIT optimal solution.

40|$|Abstract. Electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> {{are used}} in power line for {{electrical}} measurement and protection purposes. Calibration instruments are necessary for the transformation error test of electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers.</b> The operation principles of the direct and difference measurement method based calibration instrument for the medium-voltage electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> are systematically analyzed in this paper. The analysis {{results show that the}} direct measurement method based instrument can be used for the calibration of electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> with air-core coils or resistor-capacitor voltage divider without a built-in integrator, and the difference measurement method based instrument is suitable for the calibration of the electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> with no rated phase offset...|$|R
30|$|First, {{the data}} {{accuracy}} issue primarily derives from measurement equipment and devices, such as <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> and PMUs. Conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> have inherent limitations on high-voltage measurement and isolation; while classic PMUs using discrete-Fourier-transform algorithms {{have a low}} computational burden but their accuracy degrades {{in the presence of}} frequency offsets and dynamic conditions. Accordingly, advanced <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> like electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> [10, 11] and alternative PMUs using sophisticated measurement algorithms [12, 13, 14] have been developed. Those approaches greatly improve the synchrophasor measurement accuracy under both steady-state and dynamic conditions.|$|R

During these years, Arteche also had its first implantation in South America (1976) and North America (1993).|$|R
40|$|<b>Instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> are {{a crucial}} {{component}} of power system protection. They supply the protection system with scaled-down replicas {{of current and}} voltage signals present in a power network to the levels which are safe and practical to op- erate with. The conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> are based on electromagnetic coupling between the power network on the primary side and protective devices on the secondary. Due to such a design, <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> insert distortions in the mentioned signal replicas. Protective devices may be sensitive to these distortions. The inuence of distortions may lead to disastrous misoperations of protective devices. To overcome this problem, a new <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer</b> design has been devised: optical sensing of currents and voltages. In the theory, novel instrument transform- ers promise a distortion-free replication of the primary signals. Since the mentioned novel design has not been widely used in practice so far, its superior performance needs to be evaluated. This poses a question: how can the new technology (design) be evaluated, and compared to the existing <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer</b> technology? The importance of this question lies in its consequence: is there a necessity to upgrade the protection system, i. e. to replace the conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> with the novel ones, which would be quite expensive and time-consuming? The posed question can be answered by comparing inuences of both the novel and the conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> on the protection system. At present, there is no systematic approach to this evaluation. Since the evaluation could lead to an improvement of the overall protection system, this thesis proposes a comprehensive and systematic methodology for the evaluation. The thesis also proposes a complete solution for the evaluation, {{in the form of}} a simulation environment. Finally, the thesis presents results of evaluation, along with their interpretation...|$|R

50|$|<b>Instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> {{are high}} {{accuracy}} class electrical devices used to isolate or transform voltage or current levels. The most common usage of <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> is to operate instruments or metering from high voltage or high current circuits, safely isolating secondary control circuitry {{from the high}} voltages or currents. The primary winding of the transformer {{is connected to the}} high voltage or high current circuit, and the meter or relay is connected to the secondary circuit.|$|R
40|$|A {{power system}} {{protection}} system consists, at least, of an instrument trans- former, a protective device (relay), and a circuit breaker. Conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> bring currents and voltages from power network levels to much lower scaled-down replicas {{that serve as}} input signals to protective relays. The relay's function is to measure input signals (or a relationship among them in some cases) and compare them to defined operating characteristic thresholds (relay settings) to quickly decide whether to operate associated circuit breaker(s). Existing protection systems within a substation {{are based on a}} hardwired interface between <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> and protective relays. Recent development of electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> and the spread of digital relays allow the development of an all-digital protection system, in which the traditional analog interface has been replaced with a digital signal connected to digital relays through a digital communication link (process bus). Due to their design, conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> introduce distortions to the current and voltage signal replicas. These distortions may cause protective relays to misoperate. On the other hand, non-conventional <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> promise distortion-free replicas, which, in turn, should translate into better relay performance. Replacing hardwired signals with a communication bus also reduces the significant cost associated with copper wiring. An all-digital system should provide compatibility and interoperability so that different electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> can be connected to different digital relays (under a multi-vendor connection) Since the novel all-digital system has never been implemented and/or tested in practice so far, its superior performance needs to be evaluated. This thesis proposes a methodology for performance and compatibility evaluation of an all-digital protection system through application testing. The approach defines the performance indices and compatibility indices as well as the evaluation methodology...|$|R

The {{measurement of}} voltages above 1 kV and currents above 100 A is made through <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers.</b> Lately new types of <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> with digital outputs have reached the market. Although the actual sensing element may still be a classical transformer an A/D conversion takes place at some stage, and the secondary signal becomes available only as a digital signal.

This delay and the digital output necessitate a new and different calibration method to prove that the desired accuracy has been achieved. This is particularly important for the measurement of the phase displacement or phase error.

40|$|The {{metrological}} {{characterization of}} <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> {{is a well-known}} process when it is carried out under sinusoidal conditions.

Therefore, the whole process of <b>instrument</b> <b>transformer</b> calibration should be reconsidered in order to take into account their actual behavior also under these operating conditions. In this paper a new setup for the calibration of MV voltage <b>instrument</b> <b>transformers</b> is presented.
