5|$|The {{economy of}} Tripura can be characterised by {{high rate of}} poverty, low <b>capital</b> <b>formation,</b> {{inadequate}} infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood. However agriculture and allied activities to Gross State Domestic Production (GSDP) is only 23%, this is primarily because of low capital base in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resources for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought consistence progress in {{quality of life and}} income of people cutting across all sections of society. The state government through its Tripura Industrial Policy and Tripura Industrial Incentives Scheme, 2012, has offered heavy subsidies in capital investment and transport, preferences in government procurement, waivers in tender processes and fees, yet the impact has been not much significant beyond a few industries being set up in the Bodhjungnagar Industrial Growth Center.|$|E

25|$|During the {{depression}} of 1873–96, most European countries experienced a drastic fall in prices. Still, many corporations {{were able to}} reduce production costs and achieve better productivity rates, and, as a result, industrial production increased by 40% in Britain and by over 100% in Germany. A comparison of <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> rates {{in the two countries}} helps to account for the different industrial growth rates. During {{the depression}} the British ratio of net national <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> to net national product fell from 11.5% to 6.0% while Germany's rose from 10.6% to 15.9%. In essence, {{during the course of the}} depression, Britain took the course of static supply adjustment while Germany stimulated effective demand and expanded industrial supply capacity by increasing and adjusting <b>capital</b> <b>formation.</b> For example, Germany dramatically increased investment with regard to social overhead capital, such as in the management of electric power transmission lines, roads, and railroads, while this input stagnated or decreased in Britain and the investment helped to stimulate industrial demand in Germany. The resulting difference in <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> accounts for the divergent levels of industrial production in the two countries and the different growth rates during and after the depression.|$|E

Competition is generally limited however with a few large <b>capital</b> <b>formations</b> sharing various markets, {{with the exception of}} a few actual monopolies (such as the Bell System at the time). The economic surpluses which result cannot be absorbed through consumers spending more. The concentration of the surplus in the hands of the business elite must therefore be geared towards imperialistic and militaristic government tendencies, which is the easiest and surest way to utilise surplus productive capacity.|$|R

25|$|Profit {{income from}} {{ordinary}} land sales, for example, {{is not included}} in official value-added, since land transactions do not result in additional land (See also gross fixed <b>capital</b> <b>formation,</b> differential and absolute ground rent and land grabbing). Official fixed capital aggregates exclude the value of land, and no very reliable official estimates exist for the value of land, because of problems with credibly valuing land in a standard way for measurement purposes. If the world market prices for farm products rise, profit rates on land sales and commercial land values will increase; even if the number of land sales stays constant, the profit on land sales will increase.|$|E
25|$|There is no precise {{measurement}} {{of the costs of}} regulation balanced against the harms associated with money laundering, and given the evaluation problems involved in assessing such an issue, {{it is unlikely that the}} effectiveness of terror finance and money laundering laws could be determined with any degree of accuracy. The Economist estimated the annual costs of anti-money laundering efforts in Europe and North America at US$5 billion in 2003, an increase from US$700 million in 2000. Government-linked economists have noted the significant negative effects of money laundering on economic development, including undermining domestic <b>capital</b> <b>formation,</b> depressing growth, and diverting capital away from development. Because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the amount of money laundered, changes in the amount of money laundered, and the cost of anti-money laundering systems, it is almost impossible to tell which anti-money laundering systems work and which are more or less cost effective.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers {{in the labor force}} is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E

25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.

2500|$|The {{statistical}} {{indicator of}} estimating Human Development in each nation is Human Development Index (HDI). It {{is the combination}} of [...] "Life Expectancy Index", [...] "Education Index" [...] and [...] "Income Index". The Life expectancy index reveals the standard of health {{of the population in}} the country; education index reveals the educational standard and the literacy ratio of the population; and the income index reveals the standard of living of the population. If all these indices have the rising trend {{over a long period of}} time, it is reflected into rising trend in HDI. The Human Capital is developed by health, education and quality of Standard of living. Therefore, the components of HDI viz, Life Expectancy Index, Education Index and Income Index are directly related to Human <b>Capital</b> <b>formation</b> within the nation. HDI is indicator of positive correlation between human <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> and economic development. If HDI increases, there is higher rate of human <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> in response to higher standard of education and health. Similarly, if HDI increases, per capita income of the nation also increases. Implicitly, HDI reveals that higher the human <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> due to good standard of health and education, higher is the per capita income of the nation. This process of human development is the strong foundation of a continuous process of economic development of the nation for a long period of time. This significance of the concept of Human capital in generating long-term economic development of the nation cannot be neglected. It is expected that the Macroeconomic policies of all the nations are focused towards promotion of human development and subsequently economic development.|$|E

2500|$|Human {{capital is}} {{distinctly}} {{different from the}} tangible monetary capital due to the extraordinary characteristic of human capital to grow cumulatively {{over a long period}} of time. [...] The growth of tangible monetary capital is not always linear due to the shocks of business cycles. During the period of prosperity, monetary capital grows at relatively higher rate while during the period of recession and depression, there is deceleration of monetary capital. On the other hand, human capital has uniformly rising rate of growth {{over a long period of}} time because the foundation of this human capital is laid down by the educational and health inputs. [...] The current generation is qualitatively developed by the effective inputs of education and health. [...] The future generation is more benefited by the advanced research in the field of education and health, undertaken by the current generation. Therefore, the educational and health inputs create more productive impacts upon the future generation and the future generation becomes superior to the current generation. In other words, the productive capacity of future generation increases more than that of current generation. Therefore, rate of human <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> in the future generation happens to be more than the rate of human <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> in the current generation.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} Human capital has {{relatively}} more importance in labour-surplus countries. These countries are naturally endowed {{with more of}} labour due to high birth rate under the given climatic conditions. The surplus labour in these countries is the human resource available in more abundance than the tangible capital resource. This human resource can be transformed into Human capital with effective inputs of education, health and moral values. The transformation of raw human resource into highly productive human resource with these inputs {{is the process of}} human <b>capital</b> <b>formation.</b> The problem of scarcity of tangible capital in the labour surplus countries can be resolved by accelerating the rate of human <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> with both private and public investment in education and health sectors of their National economies. The tangible financial capital is an effective instrument of promoting economic growth of the nation. The intangible human capital, on the other hand, is an instrument of promoting comprehensive development of the nation because human capital is directly related to human development, and when there is human development, the qualitative and quantitative progress of the nation is inevitable. This importance of human capital is explicit in the changed approach of United Nations towards comparative evaluation of economic development of different nations in the World economy.
