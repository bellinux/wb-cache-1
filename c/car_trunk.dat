25|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} woman (Min Hyo-rin) parking a car in a highway at night. After the woman opens her <b>car</b> <b>trunk,</b> the video flashes back to that morning where the woman was driving along a highway. Jieun {{proceeds}} to sing the first verse of the song while playing a piano in an abandoned building. Then Yongguk begins to rap in front a red wall and in a misty rice field while Jieun continues playing the piano in the abandoned building. After the interchanging shots between the three, Jieun proceeds to sing the chorus in the rice field and along with shots where she sings {{in the back seat}} of the car. After the first chorus, the woman stops the car to check her lighter, then continues driving to her destination.|$|E

This class was presided by François Léon Auscher, one of the most prestigious coachbuilders to call upon Goyard to make <b>car</b> <b>trunks.</b> Goyard’s commercial catalogue was testament to the heavy influence of mail coaches on the design of <b>car</b> <b>trunks.</b> Goyard won a grand prix. Examiner Henri Pichot added: [...] "Goyard specializes in trunks and travel goods. It operates two branch stores, one in Monte-Carlo, the other in Biarritz." ...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{long history}} of the use of roof racks and their designs.

25|$|Other {{evidence}} {{supported this}} theory. During {{the investigation of}} Mrs. Muncey's murder, the doctor who performed the autopsy passed the vials to two local law enforcement officers who transported it to the FBI, where further testing occurred. The blood was contained in four vials, evidently with neither preservative nor a proper seal. The vials, in turn, were stored in a foam box, but nothing indicates the box was kept cool. Rather, in violation of proper procedure, the foam box was packed in the same cardboard box as other evidence, including House's pants and other clothing. The cardboard box was carried in the officers' car, and transported while they made the 10-hour journey from Tennessee to the FBI lab. Blood vials in hot conditions (such as a <b>car</b> <b>trunk</b> in the summer) can blow open. By the time the blood reached the FBI it had hemolyzed, or spoiled, due to heat exposure. By the time the blood passed from the FBI to a defense expert, roughly a vial and a half were empty, though the agent who had analyzed it testified he used at most a quarter of one vial. Blood, moreover, {{was found to have}} seeped onto one corner of the foam box and onto packing gauze inside the box below the vials.|$|E
500|$|The house {{used for}} Rita's abode is {{actually}} in [...] Long Beach, California, and is in a residential area known as Los Altos. The Los Altos neighborhood has been used extensively in shooting Dexter. The team used 6 different homes in that area alone in the first season: Dexter's childhood home, Angel's house, {{the house of the}} neighbor with the noisy dog, the Dade City house that Dexter inherits from his biological father, and the house of the old lady across the street. It's also close to the intersection where the [...] "Ice Truck Killer" [...] stopped his car to check on his captive (Debra) in the <b>car</b> <b>trunk.</b>|$|E
500|$|For {{the scenes}} {{involving}} self-defense courses, the supporting cast underwent stunt training {{with the help}} of stunt coordinator Sean Graham. Ron wears a back support belt during the course, which was actor Nick Offerman's idea. Offerman has many fight choreography skills from his past work in the Chicago theater, and he combined those skills with his training in Kabuki dance and theater. Offerman said, [...] "I threw in a couple of Kabuki moves that we all had a hard time keeping a straight face through." [...] It was a reference to the episode [...] "The Stakeout", in which Ron suffered a hernia, and Muharrar said, [...] "The idea [...] that Ron has the belt in his <b>car</b> <b>trunk</b> and is ready to go at a moment's notice." ...|$|E
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as Speedway president, Tony Hulman rode in the pace car nearly every year, {{immediately}} after giving the command to start engines.

500|$|As Perry sits {{in her car}} {{outside of}} her boyfriend's job, she sees her boyfriend (played by actor and model Lucas Kerr) {{interacting}} flirtatiously with a woman. She confronts him in his office, and ends their relationship. The title track begins as she drives to a gas station, where she buys a can of tea. After paying for her items, she sees a moto-sticker on a notice board which reads, [...] "All women are created equal, then some become Marines". The increasingly emotional Perry gathers her possessions from her <b>car</b> <b>trunk,</b> enters a nearby restroom, and begins her change of identity. She cuts her hair short (at this point bursting into tears), removes her bracelets, flattens her breasts, and changes into a hoodie and jeans.|$|E
500|$|A {{scene where}} Sharon and Nick's mother Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) were searching the sewers {{for what they}} {{believed}} was Cameron's dead body became popular with fans of the show. Scott described the sewer shoot as a [...] "horrific day at work" [...] with [...] "20 live f--king rats on the set", while comparing the unlikely duo of Sharon and Nikki to Lucy and Ethel from I Love Lucy. Cameron eventually reveals himself. He had murdered Sharon's ex-boyfriend (and Cassie's biological father) Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), who was visiting town, and hid the body in Sharon's <b>car</b> <b>trunk.</b> Cameron's crimes are revealed; he is jailed, absolving Sharon of wrongdoing. Although Sharon did not actually murder Cameron, Case praised the storyline and called Sharon a heroine. She explained: [...] "Your romantic lead shouldn't just be a simple romantic lead. Sharon was {{that for a long}} time. She was in this love story with Nick and nothing really happened to her. You can only carry that so far." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Eric Goldman {{felt that}} the episode's juggling of {{multiple}} storylines was [...] "satisfying", and that the scene in which Dexter prepares to kill Castillo was [...] "terrific". Though he praised Debra and Doakes' storyline with Tucci, he wrote that [...] "it was a bit disappointing to then see Deb be a bit too quickly vindicated at the end". Paula Paige, writing for TV Guide, said that the episode [...] "will go down in cable history as Dexters finest [...] to date". She was pleased with Debra's character development and the [...] "downright stylish" [...] cinematography, but thought that Jorge and Valerie's final, passionate words to each other were [...] "too much for me". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics believed that the episode [...] "takes the series into a more three-dimensional direction". He described the episode's subplots and themes as what [...] "make Dexter compelling", and wrote that Debra's character reached a more [...] "empathic level" [...] in the episode. TV Squad critic Keith McDuffee praised the increasing complexity of Dexter's relationship with his father through flashbacks, and thought that Dexter's voiceovers were [...] "the best thing about this show". Jeff Lindsay, author of Darkly Dreaming Dexter upon which the show is based, was initially upset with the episode's plot. In an interview, he said that [...] "I {{was about to be}} really unhappy with [...] But the twist at the end", referring to the person watching Dexter from the <b>car</b> <b>trunk,</b> [...] "That was wonderful." ...|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, {{he has been able to}} put them in the back of his mind when {{involved}} in case work. His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a <b>car</b> <b>trunk</b> with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was always happy as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window-washer, Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality.|$|E
500|$|In February 2003, Case {{temporarily}} {{exited the}} show {{as a result of}} lengthy contract negotiations. Instead of having the character depart permanently (or be killed off), executive producer David Shaughnessy chose to have her leave town after issues with her marriage to Nick. While away, Sharon becomes suicidal; Case explained that Sharon's life had fallen apart and she left town to commit suicide, drinking herself into [...] "a complete stupor". Travelling to Denver, she meets (and has an affair with) businessman Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), who physically abuses her. In April, Case signed a new contract with the show. Executive producer and head writer at the time John F. Smith said that upon Sharon's return to Genoa City, she wants to keep where she was a secret. That December, Sharon is horrified when Cameron arrives in town for apparent business with Newman Enterprises. Smith stated that the story with Cameron and Sharon would be one that [...] "builds quickly into a lot of drama". Explaining their relationship, Ashby revealed that Cameron and Sharon were [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and hooked up, but Cameron becomes abusive, with Ashby calling him [...] "really disturbing". Cameron blackmails Sharon into meeting him at a motel. When she arrives they have a physical altercation in which Sharon throws a bottle at him to keep him from raping her, [...] "killing" [...] him (or so she believes). Australian magazine TV Soap noted that [...] "sweet, demure" [...] Sharon had become a murderer. After driving around with his body in her <b>car</b> <b>trunk</b> for days, she dumps it in an alley. Sharon's former friend, Grace, returns to town; she discovers Cameron alive, and nurses him back to health. Detective Weber (Sherman Augustus) is suspicious of Sharon's involvement in Cameron's disappearance. Sharon begins [...] "hallucinating" [...] with visions of Cameron's [...] "ghost" [...] (which is actually him, alive). Case noted that Sharon was getting into deeper trouble by making mistakes [...] "trying to do the right thing".|$|E

She is later attacked by the Gig Harbor Killer and left in a <b>car</b> <b>trunk.</b> After a short time in coma, she succumbs to her injuries. Russell states that she will remain with him wherever he goes.|$|E
5000|$|Lug {{wrenches}} may be L-shaped, or X-shaped. The form {{commonly found}} in <b>car</b> <b>trunks</b> is an L-shaped metal rod with a socket wrench on the bent end and a prying tip on the other end.

2500|$|... "Weekend band" [...] PA {{systems are}} a niche market for small, {{powerful}} touring SR gear. Weekend bands need {{systems that are}} {{small enough to fit}} into a minivan or a <b>car</b> <b>trunk,</b> and yet powerful enough to give adequate and even sound dispersion and vocal intelligibility in a noisy club or bar. As well, the systems need to be easy and quick to set up. Sound reinforcement companies have responded to this demand by offering equipment that fulfills multiple roles, such as powered mixers (a mixer with an integrated power amplifier and effects) and powered subwoofers (a subwoofer with an integrated power amplifier and crossover). These products minimize the amount of wiring connections that bands have to make to set up the system and they take less time to set up. Some subwoofers have metal speaker mount holes built into the top, so that they can double as a base for the stand-mounted full-range PA speaker cabinets.|$|E

Yongguk proceeds to rap in the misty rice field but this time his hands are tied up with ropes while sitting in a chair and blindfolded in the scene where he raps in front of a red wall. The video returns to the present where the woman has parked her car in a road near a rice field at night. When Jieun starts {{to sing the}} second chorus, the woman opens her <b>car</b> <b>trunk</b> in a straight-on view, revealing a captive man (Kim Him Chan) who had been blindfolded and tied up with rope. The woman takes a jug of gasoline in the trunk of her car and kisses the man. She then pours gasoline on the prisoner and backs up a distance from the car.

2500|$|Despite Tarantino's statements, many {{solutions}} to what one scholar calls this [...] "unexplained postmodern puzzle" [...] have been proposed. A strong similarity {{has often been}} observed with the 1955 film noir Kiss Me Deadly. That movie, whose protagonist Tarantino has cited {{as a source for}} Butch, features a glowing briefcase housing an atomic explosive. In their review of Alex Cox's 1984 film Repo Man in the Daily Telegraph, Nick Cowen and Hari Patience suggest that Pulp Fiction may also owe [...] "a debt of inspiration" [...] to the glowing <b>car</b> <b>trunk</b> in that film. In scholar Paul Gormley's view, this connection with Kiss Me Deadly, and a similar one with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), makes it possible to read the eerie glow as symbolic of violence itself. The idea that the briefcase contains Marsellus' soul gained popular currency in the mid-1990s. Analyzing the notion, Roger Ebert dismissed it as [...] "nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net".|$|E
2500|$|Before closing arguments, Judge Perry {{ruled that}} the defense could argue that a {{drowning}} occurred due to reasonable conclusions aided by witness testimony, but that arguing sexual abuse was not allowed since {{there was nothing to}} support the claim that George Anthony sexually abused Casey Anthony. Baez began by contending that there were holes in the prosecution's forensic evidence, saying it was based on a [...] "fantasy". He told the jury that the prosecution wanted them to see stains and insects that did not really exist, that they had not proven that the stains in Anthony's <b>car</b> <b>trunk</b> were caused by Caylee's decomposing body, rather than from a trash bag found there. He added that the prosecutors tried to make his client look like a promiscuous liar because their evidence was weak. He said the drowning is [...] "the only explanation that makes sense" [...] and showed jurors a photograph of Caylee opening the home's sliding glass door by herself. He stressed that there were no child safety locks in the home and that both of Casey Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, testified that Caylee could {{get out of the house}} easily. Although Cindy Anthony testified that Caylee could not put the ladder on the side of the pool and climb up, Baez alleged that Cindy Anthony may have left the ladder up the night before. [...] "She didn't admit to doing so in testimony", he said, [...] "but how much guilt would she have knowing it was her that left the ladder up that day?" ...|$|E
