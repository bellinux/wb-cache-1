40|$|The {{study of}} the history of {{economics}} in Australia has just gone through an existential struggle of the greatest significance. On the surface it was only the most trivial of matters, a proposed <b>clerical</b> <b>change</b> in the classification of the History of Economic Thought by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). But, insignificant as it might at first appear, it was a proposal that had the potential to all but eliminate the history of economics as a legitimate academic study within Australia. The core issue was whether History of Economic Thought and Economic History were to be included as sub-disciplines of economics within the ABS classification system. The ABS proposal was that both groups were to be placed in an entirely separate category under the heading, `History, Archaeology, Religion and Philosophy¿. Neither would any longer be classified in any way as belonging to the study of economics. It was this proposal that commenced a short but ultimately successful campaign to have both areas retain their position within the economics classification. But, short as it was, and as narrow as the issues might seemingly be, into this campaign was brought a national and international array of economists which included presidents of international societies in the history of economic thought, economists from throughout the upper levels of the public service in Australia, historians of economics from across the world and which even included the strong views of the 2006 Nobel prize winner in economic theory [...] ...|$|E

A widely held myth is that one should stay with one's initial answer in a multiple-choice test. However, every empirical investigation thus far has shown that changes result in more gains than losses. None of these investigated reasons for making changes and the relationships of these reasons and other variables. This study with 105 community college students taking introductory psychology as subjects, indicated that having second thoughts about an answer was the most common reason (65 %) for answer changing on multiple-choice examinations. Careless reading of items was the second most common reason (16 %). <b>Changes</b> due to <b>clerical</b> errors (10 %) and changes resulting from finding clues in the test (8 %) were the next most prevalent reasons for answer changing. Subjects had more confidence in <b>clerical</b> <b>changes</b> (certainty level: 82. 2 %) as compared to the other major categories of reasons combined (68. 6 %). They had the least amount of confidence (64. 4 %) in second thoughts changes. Second thoughts changes were associated with more difficult items (pass rate:. 65) as compared to the categories of reading (. 67) and clues (. 70) combined. The consequences of answer changing were beneficial in each of the major reason categories. The gain was largest for <b>clerical</b> <b>changes</b> and smallest for second thoughts changes. Furthermore, confidence (r =. 20), item difficulty (r =. 10) and changing an answer for clerical reasons (r =. 12) were statistically significant predictors of the gain/loss due to answer changing, although these variables explained only 4. 8 % of the variance. Belief in the advisability of changing answers was not significantly correlated with the following: (1) extent of answer changing, (2) proportion of changes made in each of the major categories of reasons, (3) consequences of answer changing, or (4) confidence associated with changing. Based on advice they had heard, subjects believed that, in general, answer changing would {{have a negative impact on}} scores.

40|$|Effects of answer {{changing}} {{on tests}} by 133 fifth- and sixth-grade students were investigated {{to determine the}} degree to which these students changed answers, {{the extent to which they}} gained from changing, and the reasons they advanced for the changes. Students were from a predominantly suburban district (n= 88) and a predominantly rural district (n= 45). Relationships of answer changing behavior with test score, gender, and test-taking strategy were also examined. The majority of changes were wrong-to-right for all subgroups. High-scoring students changed fewer answers but had a higher proportion of changes from wrong-to-right than did other students. Reasons for changing, determined through interviews, were similar to those given by adults in previous studies, but with more <b>clerical</b> <b>changes.</b> For each test-taking strategy, students who changed tended to gain. Students should not be discouraged from changing answers on tests, especially given the preponderance of gain from changing, even for subgroups.

The week {{leading up to the}} vote was marked by courting moderate Republicans and on-the-fence Democrats from rural and coal districts to support the legislation in what was expected to be a close vote. On the day of the vote, Democrats were still working to ensure they had the votes needed to pass the bill. [...] Republicans tried to pull back their proposed amendments, realizing they were giving the Democrats more time to corral votes, however, they were unable to pull their proposed amendments off the floor.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the endogenous {{interaction between the}} rise in female labor force participation and changes in both the method and mode of production {{that occurred during the}} early part of the 20 th century. Within a dynamic general equilibrium framework, an exogenous expansion in the skill level of the population induces an organizational change at the firm level and a redirection of investment towards new technologies that complement the skills of the emerging workforce. In addition to allowing for a change in the method of production in a market with directed technical change, a framework is developed to explicitly examine the transitional dynamics as skilled workers become relatively abundant. The rise in the skill level explains the rise in female labor force participation, the increase in women's wages and the decline of the clerical wage relative to manufacturing. female labor force participation, <b>clerical</b> work, organizational <b>change,</b> technological change...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary draft, {{comments}} welcomed Please do not cite {{without permission}} This paper examines {{changes in the}} occupations of African-American women during the period 1940 - 1980 using U. S. Census samples, {{with an emphasis on}} the breakthrough of black women into clerical work. In contrast with some previous studies, my results indicate that increased educational attainment {{played a significant role in}} opening black opportunities for <b>clerical</b> jobs. But <b>changes</b> in education still explain less than half of the overall increase in probability of a clerical job, suggesting that declining discrimination may also have been important. Employing an illustrative tipping model of endogenous discrimination, the paper argues that a range of historical forces might have tipped the labor market toward an equilibrium with less employment discrimination. Some preliminary evidence suggests a potential role for public employment and the educational qualifications of the black labor pool. Empirical studies of the relative economic progress of African-Americans during the postwar period have focused largely on the experience of men. The case of female workers has been much les...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse a {{displacement}} of the limits between allowable and illicit knowledge in the orthodox, Lutheran discourse of early modern Sweden. Focusing on the debate over astrology, exemplified {{in the works of}} Laurentius Paulinus Gothus (1565 - 1646) and Sigfridus Aronus Forsius (d. 1624), the thesis aims to challenge the view of how the Reformation, regarded as a preliminary stage to the Enlightenment and modern rationalism, contributed to the so-called ‘disenchantment of the world’, thus driving astrology and other ‘occult sciences’ out of the fields of established science. Throughout the sixteenth century, astrology had been fairly accepted. The principles of astral influence were included in physical theory, and astrology was still indispensable in medical practice. In the Reformation debate, astrology had even been used as a prophetic method in apocalyptical tracts and in preaching, and from the 1580 s onwards, Swedish clergymen and intellectuals had issued astrological almanacs and prognostications. However, in {{the first decades of the}} seventeenth century, the clerical approach to astrology seemed to harden. Swedish bishops condemned astrology as a gentile, forbidden practice, and in 1619 the diocese chapter of Uppsala issued a verdict against astrological predictions. To explain this trend, a few central factors are emphasized. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the relationship between worldly and <b>clerical</b> authorities <b>changed.</b> The division of responsibilities became clearer and the cooperation between Crown and Church was intensified. This meant that the clergy reached a new position where apocalypticism lost much of its political applicability. In the meantime, astrological literature had become accessible to the common man through the agency of the book printers. Hereby old arguments against astrology were accentuated among the orthodox in order to thwart the potentially prophetic claims of the astrologers. The main issue was not to reject astrology as such, but to maintain the clerical authority in confessional as well as in epistemological issues...|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{owing to}} the {{research}} he has conducted as a conspiracy theorist, Dale has a thorough knowledge of {{the workings of the}} American government, legal system, the BEAST (computer conspiracy), and bureaucracy. He has used this knowledge to assist his friends, both to help Hank with problems related to renewing his driver's license when a <b>clerical</b> error <b>changes</b> his gender, and to help John Redcorn with his land claim and lawsuit against the American government. Ironically, Dale's help for Hank in that instance came about after he realized the Warren Commission report was accurate and became obnoxiously patriotic, to the point of painting a huge American flag on Hank's house (without enough stars on it) and trying to turn Hank in to the Department of Homeland Security after he tried to remove it. However, he has a habit of horribly misconstruing information, having misunderstood placebo (a fake drug, usually sugar or colored water) for a top secret government research project and Hank for cleaning off the paint he put on Hank's roof as [...] "defacing an American flag" [...] in the aforementioned case. A running gag throughout the series is Dale's attempt (denied 6 times according to Hank) to construct his own guard tower on his front yard. In the episode [...] "Flush with Power" [...] he appealed the zoning board for such permission only to be denied. He was later granted permission by a corrupt politician; to do so if he helped blackmail Hank (who also served on the board) which Hank promptly tore up when Dale confessed. In the episode [...] "Life: A Loser's Manual" [...] Dale ordered aluminum rails to finally build his tower. To avoid county laws, using his knowledge of loopholes, he constructed the tower with reduced dimensions the County had no authority to condemn (Regulations come into effect if the structure exceeds 100 square feet and exceeds 40 feet in height) at 39 feet high. However the lack of a foundation caused it to collapse.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} whole body vibration (WBV) induced helicopter flights and degenerative changes of the cervical and lumbar spine. Methods We examined 186 helicopter pilots {{who were exposed to}} WBV and 94 military clerical workers at a military hospital. Questionnaires and interviews were completed for 164 of the 186 pilots (response rate, 88. 2 %) and 88 of the 94 clerical workers (response rate, 93. 6 %). Radiographic examinations of the cervical and the lumbar spines were performed after obtaining informed consent in both groups. Degenerative changes of the cervical and lumbar spines were determined using four radiographs per subject, and diagnosed by two independent, blinded radiologists. Results There {{was no significant difference in}} general and work-related characteristics except for flight hours and frequency between helicopter pilots and <b>clerical</b> workers. Degenerative <b>changes</b> in the cervical spine were significantly more prevalent in the helicopter pilots compared with control group. In the cervical spine multivariate model, accumulated flight hours (per 100 hours) was associated with degenerative changes. And in the lumbar spine multivariate model, accumulated flight hours (per 100 hours) and age were associated with degenerative changes. Conclusion Accumulated flight hours were associated with degenerative changes of the cervical and lumbar spines in helicopter pilots...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the level and}} distribution of wealth and income in New Zealand between about 1870 and 1939. To do so it draws upon the available aggregate statistics on wealth and income, and it uses a sample of wealth holders especially constructed to alleviate the data deficiencies which have arisen through New Zealand not having a wealth census. The evidence available suggests that New Zealand was correctly portrayed as having {{a high level of}} wealth with an egalitarian distribution. In 1893, the first year in which average wealth could be estimated, New Zealand was definitely wealthier than Victoria. This wealth was not evenly distributed but the gini coefficient of about 0. 75 suggested that New Zealand was an egalitarian economy compared to the United States, Britain, or even Australia. Over the period to 1939 the average level of wealth increased by about 100 percent. Most of this increase took place between 1900 and 1922; the late 1920 's and 1930 's were periods of slow growth. But this increase was not sufficient to maintain New Zealand's high position relative to Australia, and probably to other countries. The growth of real wealth was accompanied by a redistribution of wealth and by the 1930 's, the gini coefficient was only about 0. 73. Most of this decline was due to the declining assets held by the very rich. In 1890 to 1895 the top one percent of wealth holders owned 55 - 60 percent of all assets, but by 1935 to 1939 this had fallen to 25 - 30 percent. The very rich had, in fact, never been rich by international standards. The case studies in the thesis did not include one millionaire. As a rule they were first generation wealthy men who came from a well-to-do background, who had superior education, but who had to achieve being wealthy through their own efforts. There were few women among the top wealth holders, and those who did appear inherited their wealth from their father or or husband. The wealthy did not show signs of being a closed elite. There was a considerable amount of upward mobility in the group, and the Scots especially tended to come from poor backgrounds. The practise of equal inheritance among all the children meant that few families remained very wealthy for more than one generation. The same social and occupational mobility was clear among our sample of estate holders. Only 50 percent of sons had the same social status as their fathers. The remaining sons were fairly evenly divided between those who rose and those who fell in status. The sample, which was constructed from probate valuations and death certificate records, suggests some of the factors which assisted and hindered upward mobility. Being born female at a time when women did not pursue careers, or own family property obviously influenced the wealth holdings of a considerable proportion of the population. For men, the place of their birth proved to be significant. The Scottish showed a marked tendency to be upwardly mobile, while being Irish or New Zealand born was a definite handicap. Those who were born overseas did better if they arrived as young adults between 1860 and 1880. Assisted migrants produced proportionately less probatable estates, but those who did had about the same estates as those not assisted. Wealth was concentrated among those involved in farming, trading and the professions throughout most of our period, but over time agricultural wealth showed signs of being replaced by industrial fortunes. The professions had the advantage of a comparatively high income which enabled people to accumulate fortunes. Lifetime income undoubtedly had the major influence on wealth at death. The level of average income increased probably three-fold in the period. Again most of this rise came between 1900 and 1920. It is probable that the distribution also became more equal, through the reduced incomes to the top earners. There was a strong trend for margins for skill to decline over time, even though they were already small relative to those found in the United States. The exception to this was teachers' salaries, which showed a marked rise as the occupation became more professional. The rise of teachers' wages, shop work and <b>clerical</b> jobs all <b>changed</b> the employment structure for women, which was reflected in a changed attitude towards higher education. The 1930 's saw a reduction in incomes largely through unemployment and short-time. However, the reduction was heaviest among those in the top 10 percent. The depression had mixed effects on production levels, prices and wages, but only one of our three sample industries, butter and cheese making, showed strong evidence of wage overhang. In 1939 New Zealand was still a wealthy nation, though probably she would not have ranked as highly on an international scale as in 1890. The distribution of both wealth and income had changed over our period to being substantially more egalitarian...|$|R
