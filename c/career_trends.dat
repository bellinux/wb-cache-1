40|$|Aim. To explore from a {{personal}} and historical perspective key <b>career</b> <b>trends</b> of UK graduate nurses qualifying between 1970 and 1989. Background. During the 1970 s and 1980 s, graduate nurses qualifying from UK academic institutions with nursing and degree qualifications were a controversial minority. Concerns about their practical ability and role resulted in considerable quantitative research about graduate nurse careers. Whilst such research identified key graduate nurse <b>career</b> <b>trends,</b> these trends {{have yet to be}} explored from a qualitative perspective. Design. This descriptive study used a phased approach: first, a literature review of earlier studies to identify key <b>career</b> <b>trends</b> of UK graduate nurses qualifying between 1970 and 1989, and second, an exploration of these trends from the perspective of six graduate nurses qualifying during this period using semi-structured interviews. Third, archival material was used to set <b>career</b> <b>trends</b> and interview data within their historical context. Findings. The literature indicated that most graduate nurses remained clinically based, especially in community and intensive care, with few in senior posts above charge nurse/health visitor level (G-grade). Analysis of interview data revealed four major themes significantly influencing graduate nurse careers: wanting to be clinical nurses, the effect of organizational structures and systems, being a woman, and careers by accident not design. Conclusion. Graduate nurses interviewed aspired to clinical posts, yet this was not what some in nursing expected of them during the 1970 s and 1980 s. The ability of these graduate nurses to fulfil personal career aspirations and develop their careers depended on many factors, not fully acknowledged in earlier studies. For example, organizational structures and systems often delayed fulfilment of career aspirations. Significantly, gender issues embedded within nursing adversely affected career progression of those interviewed, even in the 1990 s. In particular, although nurses can combine work and family commitments, for those interviewed this was often at the expense of their career development...|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in two consecutive game streak records in baseball, namely, the celebrated 56 -game hitting streak of Joe DiMaggio {{and the less}} famous 84 -games-reaching-base streak of Ted Williams, and how likely these records would be predicted to occur if the history of Major League Baseball were repeated.

I assume that the number of games played by each player in each season is held constant while the batting and on-base averages are estimated from and shrunk towards the <b>career</b> <b>trends</b> of each player to smooth over outlying seasons. These simulation models are then verified against streaks that might be expected to occur, such as all-time streaks ranked 6 through 30, and are allowed to vary over time to reflect the changing distribution of opposing pitching. I find that a validated model for predicting hitting streaks contains no hot hand effect and suggests that the variability of opposing pitching has decreased markedly in the past 140 years. I also find that under this model, the DiMaggio streak can be considered exceptional while validated models for on-base streaks require considerably more complexity, including but not limited to a term that dampens on-base streaks. ...|$|E

40|$|My {{project is}} {{designed}} {{to determine how the}} English major and English Studies exist at OSU, through the collection of perceptions and opinions about English Studies at OSU from students and faculty (both inside and outside of the English department) via email surveys. I used secondary research to determine how the English major and English Studies exist nationally, with a full discussion of the sources of crisis and hope that attend the profession generally. I also researched how English studies exist locally through the collection of relevant statistics concerning university financing, salaries, enrollment, student credit hours, and faculty tenure status, in order to contextualize, explain, and anaylze the opinions presented by my survey respondents. Overall, through my surveys, I found that English studies and students face many of the same situations as English departments nationally. This means that English studies are deeply integral to and appreciated by the OSU community, particularly by English majors, while English majors and faculty face the perceptual and material crises that go along with a lack of publicity and visibility, a disassociation between English studies and research, low faculty pay, rising service course loads, the decline in tenure-track faculty, a lack of outside funding, and negative perceptions about what English majors study and the material benefits of English studies. My conclusion is that the department, along with the OSU administration and students, should focus on continuing tenure track hires; strengthening ties to outside donors in the private sector; creating more visible department events; publicizing its goals, benefits, and research orientation; creating a visible alumni network or advisory board for faculty and student needs; and increasing the awareness of <b>career</b> <b>trends</b> and possibiliti...|$|E

The aim of the research was to investigate the way postgraduate students of a private university in Karachi, Pakistan make their career decisions, as well as to highlight the factors that influence them and explorethe career advice they seek for making their career choices. The qualitative data was collected through a selected sample of postgraduate regular students (N= 4) studying in a private university of the city of Karachi. Semi-structured open-ended interviews were conducted with students during university hours. The findings of the study revealed that all the students make their career decisions in different ways. Mostly the decisionsare made with the influence of male members within families particularly with the influence of the ‘father’ due to which students areunable to pursue the careers they dream of. The other factors that influence the career decisions of postgraduate students are: conditional family support; contextual factors such as lack of career guidance and counselling, lack of knowledge about labour market and emerging <b>career</b> <b>trends.</b> Therefore their main focus remains on finding a job that enables them to get high remuneration rather than focusing towards a strong career. Furthermore, it was also found that thestudents’ career decisions change overtime at various stages of their lives. This indicates a low satisfaction and confidence level of students regarding their future careers. Moreover, difference in ways of making career decisions is found among male and female research participants. Males gain more independence in making career decisions as they start earning and grow professionally, while females remain dependentuponfamily instructions throughout their lives pertaining to their career decisions...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{an account of}} the 'household and social science' course opened at King's College for Women in 1908 and its {{evolution}} up to 1939. The course was a significant departure for women's higher education in England as it was the first attempt to define a special university discipline based upon women's 'domestic' roles. However, historical accounts of women's higher education have either ignored or dismissed it, largely because of the predominance of'separate spheres' analyses in the historiography of women's higher education of the 1970 s and early 1980 s. Such accounts have presented the household science course in a negative light because of its 'domestic' image. This thesis thus offers a reassessment of the household science movement and those who supported it. The 'household science' concept owed its origin to the American 'home economies' movement which originated in the mid-nineteenth century. Chapter 1 provides a history of the home economics movement in America, tracing its evolution in the context of women's higher education until 1914. Initially home economics was seen as a 'vocational homemaking' course aiming to train women for home life. At the turn of the century, however, a 'scientific' model was developed by women scientists in order to promote research into social problems connected with the domestic sphere. These two models~the vocation and the scientific, have developed in tandem in American home economics. Chapters 2 and 3 consider the origins and early evolution of the 'household science' course in England, which was largely influenced by the American 'scientific' model. Chapter 2 first considers the concept of domestic education in the history of women's education and factors that precluded the development of a 'vocational homemaking' course in English higher education. The rest of the chapter analyses the origins of the household science movement in its social and intellectual context, in particular its connection with Edwardian preoccupations with 'physical deterioration' and infant mortality. Like their American counterparts, the founders of the course saw household science as a reform movement which aimed to promote research into domestic problems such as hygiene and nutrition, as well as to create a more useful and relevant university discipline for women's domestic roles, whether as housewife/mother or in 'municipal housekeeping' roles. Chapter 3 discusses the household science course from a disciplinary standpoint, looking at how the syllabus was constructed, the contemporary educational controversies it engendered, and its evolution up to 1920 when the B. Sc. degree was granted. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 examine the main factors which ultimately undermined the success of household science as a discipline. Chapter 4 evaluates <b>career</b> <b>trends</b> amongst KCHSS students from 1910 - 49, analysing to what extent the KCHSS administration was able to create a professional career structure for the household science discipline. The interplay between administrative policy, <b>career</b> <b>trends,</b> and professionalization is analyzed in relation to three career fields-social welfare, laboratory research, and dietetics. Chapters considers the professional conflicts between KCHSS and the domestic subjects teaching profession. Chapter 6 analyses KCHSS's failure to carve out a unique academic 'territory' or expertise and the various factors that affected this. The final chapter assesses how successful KCHSS was as an institution, looking at how students themselves experienced the course, their motivations for taking it, and its impact on their lives. Although household science was unsuccessful as a discipline, the course did give students a wide choice of career options, creating openings in less conventional spheres for women {{who did not want to}} teach and providing opportunities for the less-able student to follow a scientific career. The conclusion considers how the social climate of the interwar period affected the working out of the original household science ideals. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background While several {{articles}} on MD-PhD trainees {{in the basic}} sciences {{have been published in}} the past several years, very little research exists on physician-investigators in the social sciences and humanities. However, the numbers of MD-PhDs training in these fields and the number of programs offering training in these fields are increasing, particularly within the US. In addition, accountability for the public funding for MD-PhD programs requires knowledge about this growing population of trainees and their career trajectories. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the first cohorts of MD-PhDs in the social sciences and humanities, to characterize their training and career paths, and to better understand their experiences of training and subsequent research and practice. Methods This paper utilizes a multi-pronged recruitment method and novel survey instrument to examine an understudied population of MD-PhD trainees in the social sciences and humanities, many of whom completed both degrees without formal programmatic support. The survey instrument was designed to collect demographic, training and career trajectory data, as well as experiences of and perspectives on training and career. It describes their routes to professional development, characterizes obstacles to and predictors of success, and explores <b>career</b> <b>trends.</b> Results The average length of time to complete both degrees was 9 years. The vast majority (90 %) completed a clinical residency, almost all (98 %) were engaged in research, the vast majority (88 %) were employed in academic institutions, and several others (9 %) held leadership positions in national and international health organizations. Very few (4 %) went into private practice. The survey responses supply recommendations for supporting current trainees as well as areas for future research. Conclusions In general, MD-PhDs in the social sciences and humanities have careers that fit the goals of agencies providing public funding for training physician-investigators: they are involved in mutually-informative medical research, clinical practice, and teaching – working to improve our responses to the social, cultural, and political determinants of health and health care. These findings provide strong evidence for continued and improved funding and programmatic support for MD-PhD trainees in the social sciences and humanities...|$|E
40|$|Negative {{attitudes of}} college {{students}} toward older adults can be a barrier for universities that are attempting {{to prepare students for}} future <b>career</b> <b>trends</b> {{to meet the needs of}} an aging society. A growing number of college graduates will be needed to provide health and educational services for this population. Providing intergenerational opportunities through a variety of face-to-face interactions has demonstrated some success at improving attitudes {{of college students}} toward older adults. It is believed that improving the attitudes of college students through intergenerational experiences will expand their consideration of careers that provide support to this growing population. This study explored an intergenerational project that paired undergraduate college students with older adults through a series of e-mail communications rather than face-to-face interactions. With the increase in the use of e-mail by persons of all ages, this virtual meeting place provides a convenient communication tool for exploring ways to build relationships online. It was hypothesized that an intergenerational experience between undergraduate college students (18 - 28 years of age) and older adults (65 years old or older) through e-mail communication would have a positive effect on student attitudes toward older adults as measured by Polizzi's revised version of the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD) survey. Two classes of the same undergraduate course at a midwestern university participated in the project. Both groups were pre-tested using the ASD and then one group was randomly chosen to be the intervention group. Each student in the intervention group was paired with an older adult pen pal to complete six weeks of assigned e-mail exchanges designed to increase in depth of topic. Both groups were then post-tested using the ASD. Results: Although not significantly different at pretest, the attitude of the students in the intervention group was significantly more positive at posttest than the control group. There was a significant difference in the attitudes of the intervention group compared to the control group when post-tested. The students who participated in the intergenerational e-mail pen pal project had a more positive attitude toward older adults following the six-weeks of sharing stories and thoughts with the older generation.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D) -University of Durban-Westville, 2000. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} women's perceptions and choices of different categories of occupations and the reasons for such choices. Since the installation of the first democratic post apartheid government in South Africa, national policy has advanced women's rights. Affirmative action has opened up opportunities previously closed to women, but there is little research documenting changes in <b>career</b> <b>trends.</b> The influence of race, gender, social and political changes on perceptions and choices of occupations of women in the country is not known. This study has focused on African and Indian females in the 15 to 60 age range in the greater Durban area. Women born between 1940 and 1985 have experience of the pre- and post apartheid era, and therefore changes in perceptions and choices could be investigated. A survey questionnaire was administered to 390 female learners in seven former Indian schools. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 African and Indian women; six daughters in non - traditional occupations and six mothers in traditional occupations. The results from the survey and interviews suggest that women have a strong sense of empowerment and do not regard gender as a barrier to occupational choices. A limited number of occupations were categorized as suitable for men only, while the majority were deemed suitable for both men and women. Survey data indicated that African learners were more conservative in their choices than Indian learners. Interviews with the older women however, revealed that African women were more positive about opportunities open to them in the new South Africa. Detailed family profiles suggest that socio - economic factors rather than parental influence, impacted on decision-making patterns. The unique experiences of women in this country, who have been subject to political and social pressures of the apartheid policy and the rapid change of the post apartheid era, must be documented before any theoretical positions can be articulated about the career development of South African women. This study has contributed to research on the career development of women by providing some insight into how a sector of African and Indian women perceive and categorize occupations...|$|E
