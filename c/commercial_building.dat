5|$|In {{addition}} to industrial growth, the 1880s and 1890s were {{a period of}} significant growth in downtown <b>commercial</b> <b>building.</b> The retail district was centered at Fourth Street and Washington Avenue, while banking and business was centered to the south, at Fourth and Olive streets.

Designed by Louis Sullivan in 1891, the Wainwright was the tallest building in the city at the time of its construction and remains an example of early skyscraper design.|$|E

5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local <b>commercial</b> <b>building.</b> After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E

The highway continues northward, intersecting with Richland Court, which provides access to local residential homes. The next intersection is with Joan Place, which serves a similar function to Richland Court. Soon after, Route161 intersects with Saint Andrew's Boulevard, which also serves as the northern terminus of Richfield Terrace and connects the highway with CR609 (Mount Prospect Avenue). Just past Saint Andrew's Boulevard Route161 passes through a largely commercial section of Clifton with a heavy concentration of medical offices before terminating at an intersection with CR614 (Van Houten Avenue).

5|$|Spring Street, {{a typical}} {{commercial}} 19th century corridor, {{is the primary}} roadway within the district. Most buildings along Spring Street are Italianate and eclectic Victorian. The structure vary between two and three stories tall, with brick as the most common building material. The 100 block is the closest to the Ohio River and has seen the most demolition. It contains the Old Strauss Hotel {{at the corner of}} Riverside Drive, a three-story Italianate hostelry with a corbeled cornice and arched windows. The buildings on the 200 block are mostly Italianate style buildings, the most notable being the old Elk's Club structure (a three-story highly decorated glazed brick building) and the Bensinger's Building (a 1920s <b>commercial</b> <b>building</b> of pressed brick and crenelated parapet). There is more diverse architecture on the 300-block, with a 19th-century Masonic Temple, the LaRose Theatre (a 1920s orange glazed brick structure with terra cotta trim), Horner's Novelty (which had to be rebuilt after the worst fire in Jeffersonville's history), and Schimpff's Confectionery, a candy store that opened in 1891 that now also features a small candy museum. More Italianate structures are on the 400 block, but its most important structure is the 1907 Citizens National Bank Building, which is stone Classical Revival with large eagles for adornment. The block also holds the regional office for the local Boy Scouts of America council. Warder Park is located {{on the east side of}} the 500 block and features a Classical Revival Masonic Temple that used for most of the 20th Century.|$|E

40|$|With {{climate change}} and {{increasing}} energy consumption {{there is a need}} for a change from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Norway has adopted both the emissions reduction goals of the Kyoto Protocol and from EU directives, and an EU directive that targets energy use in <b>commercial</b> <b>buildings.</b> Because the energy prices are rising and the costs of PV are decreasing, PV is becoming an interesting alternative to reduce energy consumption in <b>commercial</b> <b>buildings</b> and as means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from <b>commercial</b> <b>buildings.</b> Building certification schemes are also giving the building sector incentives to reduce the environmental impact of buildings. In this thesis building certification using Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is considered. In the thesis, a case study in Oslo is used to quantify the potential for PV on <b>commercial</b> <b>buildings</b> in Norway, the feasibility of PV, emissions reduction by reducing energy demand from <b>commercial</b> <b>buildings</b> using PV, and PV's potential contribution on improving a <b>commercial</b> <b>buildings</b> BREEAM certification. The potential is determined by using a specific load provided to the case study based on the building's requirements to achieve goals of delivered energy based on the EU directive and Norwegian legislation on energy consumption of <b>commercial</b> <b>buildings.</b> The solar resource of Oslo is determined for the different facades and roof according to their azimuthal angles and panel inclination using measured solar resource data. Using the adjusted solar resource values, the size of the PV system and inverters to meet the load for the worst case scenario is determined, an increase of the load by 25...|$|R
