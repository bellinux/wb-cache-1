In the Paleocene, Borneo was a promontory of SE Asia, partially separated by oceanic crust of the proto-South China Sea. [...] There is geologic evidence that suggests Borneo has rotated <b>counter</b> <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> about 45° from its orentation {{at the end of}} the Oligocene while remaining to straddle the equator. This would indicate most of the Paleogene sediment in North Borneo was sourced from Indochina.

In the late Oligocene to Early Miocene, the central mountain ranges of Borneo began to rise. [...] The equatorial perhumid climate provided intense chemical weathering and erosion of the newly uplifted rock and filled the marginal basins of Borneo with sediment. Neogene sediments are up to 9 km thick in sections of some basins. [...] Reconstruction of the sediment volume indicates that at least 6 km of crust was removed from the interior of Borneo in the Neogene.

Igneous activity continued throughout the Cenozoic but was particularly more active in the northern region of Borneo in the Neogene.|$|E

The prosthetic of an amputee which cannot accurately detect the brain signals is a dead investment for him. This paper tries to maximize the classification accuracies of these signals so as to improve prosthetics by comparison between two main algorithms namely using Naïve Bayes and Part rule algorithms. The EEG dataset for the conditions using 27 different subjects with four different hand movements viz., finger open (fopen), finger close (fclose), clock wise wrist rotation (cw) and <b>counter</b> <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> wrist rotation (ccw) {{were obtained from the}} NINAPRO DATABASE, a resource for bio robotics community of hand movements. The introduction of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) as a new signal pre-processing technique along with the different decision trees have provided good classification performance. VMD allows decomposition of the signal into various modes by identifying a compact frequency support around its central frequency, such that adding all the modes reconstructs the original signal. The statistical features were extracted. Out of these the useful features were identified using the J 48 decision tree algorithm and selected features were classified using Naïve Bayes and Part rule algorithms.

The measure χM is zero for triangles with at least one mirror axe, i. e. equilateral or isosceles triangles, and positive or negative for scalane, i. e. left or right handed triangles, respectively. A triangle is a polygon with three vertices A, B,C connected by three sides (line segments) a, b, c. Figure 1 shows the definition of the symbols [1]. Note that A, B,C are labeled in a <b>counter</b> <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> fashion, if we look from the top. It is a two dimensional object since 3 points define a two dimensional plane. Figure 1 : Triangle and the definition of the standard notation (From Ref. [1]).

The isosceles triangles have two sides with equal length, and C 1 v symmetry, i. e. one fold rotational symmetry and 1 mirror axe. All other triangles, where a 6 = b 6 = c 6 = a are scalane and have no mirror symmetry. Since the concept of chirality and mirror symmetry may also be applied to two dimensional objects, scalane triangles are considered to be chiral. In two dimensions, the role of a mirror plane in three dimensional objects is taken by a mirror axis. 1 a...|$|E
40|$|The harsh {{climate of}} the Gulf puts severe {{constraints}} on coral survival and, therewith, on biodiversity by restricting the number of coral species that can survive in the harsh conditions. Despite this and despite being at the western high-latitude edge of Indo-Pacific reef coral distribution, the Gulf’s coral fauna is surprisingly rich. Within the region, the richest Gulf coral fauna has been recorded from Saudi Arabia, around the islands of Jana and Karan (50 species, Basson et al. 1977). Fadlallah et al. (1993) subsequently recorded 23 and 19 species in specific sample sites on these two islands and suggested that species richness may actually be lower than suggested by Basson et al. (1977). This is also supported by data in Vogt (1996). The UAE presently has the second-richest documented coral fauna, with 34 scleractinian species (Riegl 1999). More comprehensive studies in other areas and the region would likely reveal a quite homogeneous fauna with little diversity gradient across the Gulf proper. The Iranian coral fauna is rich due to water circulation pattern and better environmental conditions in the northern Gulf. Due to <b>counter</b> <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> pattern of the water circulation in the Gulf, the northern part and the Iranian coastline has lower temperature, lower salinity, better aragonite saturation, besides also greater depth (see Chap. 2). This results in increasing species richness towards the Straits of Hormuz. In general, coral diversity decreases {{from east to west}} and from north to south. This has been seen in octocorals (Samimi-Namin and van Ofwegen 2009) and the same trend exist for hard corals (Samimi-Namin, unpublished data).

30|$|To {{meet the}} {{scientific}} {{objectives of the}} S-WPIA, the relative time precision between the plasma wave data and particle data must be less than 10 s (Katoh et al. 2018). This precision is maintained by two time-keeping systems: (1) the 64 Hz time index (TI) distributed by the onboard satellite system and (2) the 524, 288 Hz S-WPIA clock distributed by the PWE (Fig.  1). Each cooperative instrument has a 24 bit S-WPIA <b>clock</b> <b>counter,</b> which incrementally advances the distributed S-WPIA clock. As a result, the S-WPIA <b>clock</b> <b>counter</b> has a time precision of 1.9 s. The S-WPIA <b>clock</b> <b>counter</b> is reset by the reset pulse distributed by the PWE.

The Lebanese restraining bend is a 200 km long bend with a left lateral sense of slip located along the Dead Sea fault system (DSFS) between 33. 2 and 34. 6 degrees north latitude. The DSFS is a transform plate boundary fault system accommodating the differential northward movement of Arabian and Sinai plates relative to the Eurasian plate. Within the Lebanese Restraining bend, The DSFS splays into five left-lateral strike-slip faults, forming a positive flower structure. This study combines GPS measurements from Lebanon, where surveys span about 5. 5 years, with sites from the Anti Lebanon Mountains in SW Syria for a more complete view of crustal deformation in the restraining bend. The GPS network includes continuous GPS sites and 27 campaign sites: 14 sites in Lebanon installed in 2002, 8 sites in Lebanon installed in 2005, and 5 sites in southwestern Syria. Preliminary velocities for older campaign sites have uncertainties less than 0. 75 mm/yr, whereas newer sites have around 1. 5 mm/yr uncertainties. The improved spatial coverage and reduced uncertainties allow constructing; 1) elastic fault models that explore strain partitioning between two strike slip faults (Yammouneh and Serghaya faults) and a generalized off-shore thrust fault to accommodate convergence in the restraining bend, and 2) continuum (velocity gradient) models that explore infinitesimal strain and rotation rates. The models suggest a displacement rate of 4. 5 - 5. 5 mm/yr along the Yammouneh fault and a <b>counter</b> <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> rotation of 0. 5 °- 1. 75 °/MA within the bend.

40|$|The {{projected}} acidification of {{the surface}} ocean due to the rising level of atmospheric CO 2 {{is directly related to}} the shift in the equilibrium status of the carbonate system. In this article, simplified models were developed and used to assess the potential impacts of various acidification scenarios on the equilibrium chemistry of the carbonate system in the semi enclosed Arabian Gulf, taking into account the unique water circulation patterns and the spatial and seasonal variations of temperature and salinity in the Gulf. Located between latitudes of 23. 5 o- 30 o N, the Gulf is a strategic body of water that supplies many of the surrounding oilexporting countries with a source of water for desalination. The Gulf is a semi enclosed sea that is exposed to an arid, sub-tropical climate. With limited freshwater input, high evaporation rate, and extensive disposal of concentrated brines, the circulation of water in the Gulf exhibits a seasonal cyclonic overturning circulation in which the entering surface water from the Indian ocean circulates along the northern coast then turns <b>counter</b> <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> and downward towards the southern coast to exit the Gulf below the entering surface water as a dense underflow. The resulting spatial and seasonal distributions of salinity and temperature in the Gulf are profound, ranging in the approximate ranges of 36 - 45 ppt and 19 - 33 oC, respectively. The application of the developed models revealed that for a given acidification scenario resulting from a projected increase in the atmospheric CO 2 level, the entering surface water from the Indian Ocean is subject to CO 2 release, pH variations and loss of alkalinity associated with the precipitation of calcium carbonates, consistent with the seasonal and spatial distribution of temperature and salinity in the Gulf. The results suggested that the changing chemistry of the carbonate system in the Gulf can have significant implications in terms of its potential impact on the desalination industry and the biological and biogeochemical processes in the Gulf...|$|E

The <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> P-T paths concluded from HP mafic and pelitic granulites indicate the closing and collisional process of the belt. This study focuses on the formation of calc-silicate that is closely associated with HP mafic granulite. On the basis of mineral assemblage evolution of the PT peudosention in SACFM system, critical metamorphic reactions, combined with calculation of Grt-Cpx thermometer, the precursor granulite is estimated having experienced at least 780 ∼ 850 °C and 1. 0 - 1. 1 GPa metamorphic conditions, and retrograde to 400 ∼ 650 °C and 0. 6 ∼ 0. 75 GPa.
