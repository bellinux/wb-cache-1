5000|$|Snježana Koren, a {{historian}} at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, has judged the disputed articles as [...] "biased and malicious, partly even illiterate", {{in an interview}} with <b>Croatian</b> <b>news</b> <b>agency</b> HINA. She further added that [...] "These are the types of articles you can find on the pages of fringe organizations and movements, but there should be no place for that on Wikipedia", expressing doubts on the ability of its authors to distinguish good from evil. Koren concludes that the ulterior motive of such writings is to rehabilitate the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi Germany puppet state, and that [...] "there is no other way to characterize such efforts than as Ustashi movement".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} system for {{automatic}} categorization of news items into a standard set of categories. The system has been built specifically for news stories written in Croatian language. It uses the standard set of news categories established by the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC). The algorithm used for categorization transforms each document into a vector of weights corresponding to an automatically chosen set of keywords. This process is performed on a large training set of news items, forming the multi-dimensional space populated by news items of known categories. An unknown news item is also transformed into a vector of keyword weights and then categorized using the k-NN method in this space. The system has been trained on the collection of approx. 2700 manually categorized news items provided by the <b>Croatian</b> <b>News</b> <b>Agency</b> and tested on {{a different set of}} approx. 500 randomly chosen news items from the same source. The automatic categorization gave a correct result for 85 % of tested news items. Subjective evaluation by news professionals concluded that the system is useful enough to be used in news production process. 1...|$|E
40|$|A general {{inhomogenity}} of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> markes {{the discrepancy}} between definions of a <b>news</b> <b>agency,</b> the function of <b>news</b> <b>agencies,</b> and the closeness of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> to other <b>news</b> outlets among the mass media. Different cases give evidence that these differences exist in internationally operating <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> We argue with two claims accessing the contemporary situation: a) we rely on the perspective of classic analysis of the sender and receiver(s) of a message in a communication model and b) special interest groups as connected segments of subnetworks {{in the mass media}} industry. We will examine several worldwide operating <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> with internet presence regarding their self-description, their role in mass media communication, and classic definitions of <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> After examining several cases, we will show the general common roles of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> in the mass media network. The variety of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> results in differentiated forms of these distributors. While major <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> work as contributors of information for other mass media and thus technically fulfill the role of a <b>news</b> <b>agency,</b> smaller agencies have the declared aim to cover ‘special interest’ serving as a conterpoint to mainstream <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> News agencies participate in linear and circular distribution forms we classify here as ‘frames of the news’ and ‘spirals of silence’. Our examination shows that <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> as producing and delivering organizations for the mass media work with high self-reference and reference to other mass media...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a system for feature extraction and classification of <b>news</b> articles from <b>Croatian</b> <b>news</b> sources.
