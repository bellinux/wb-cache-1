These maps plot the component’s pressure ratio versus the <b>corrected</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> for multiple engine rotor speeds. In this experiment, a Boeing T 50 -BO- 8 A converted turbojet engine was operated at {{a wide variety of}} rotor speeds with orifice plates of different sizes to vary the flow rate. The <b>corrected</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> through the turbojet ranged from 1. 32 to 2. 55 lb/s. The pressure ratios for the compressor and turbine ranged from 2. 0 to 4. 3 and from 1. 7 to 4. 3, respectively. The resulting performance maps showed the correct overall trend of increasing flow rate and pressure ratio with higher rotor speeds. However, the individual speed lines were very inconsistent and lacked discernible trends. It was concluded that bench testing the compressor and turbine components is the ideal way to develop the performance maps...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the NASA Energy Efficient Engine program is to identify and verify the technology required to achieve significant reductions in fuel consumption and operating cost for future commercial gas turbine engines. The design and analysis is documented of the high pressure compressor which was tested {{as part of the}} Pratt and Whitney effort under the Energy Efficient Engine program. This compressor was designed to produce a 14 : 1 pressure ratio in ten stages with an adiabatic efficiency of 88. 2 percent in the flight propulsion system. The corresponding expected efficiency for the compressor component test rig is 86. 5 percent. Other performance goals are a surge margin of 20 percent, a <b>corrected</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of 35. 2 kg/sec (77. 5 lb/sec), and a life of 20, 000 missions and 30, 000 hours. Low loss, highly loaded airfoils are used to increase efficiency while reducing the parts count. Active clearance control and case trenches in abradable strips over the blade tips are included in the compressor component design to further increase the efficiency potential. The test rig incorporates variable geometry stator vanes in all stages to permit maximum flexibility in developing stage-to-stage matching. This provision precluded active clearance control on the rear case of the test rig. Both the component and rig designs meet or exceed design requirements with the exception of life goals, which will be achievable with planned advances in materials technology...|$|E
40|$|Calibration data of {{flow meters}} are often {{reported}} using {{the so called}} calibration coefficient, i. e. the ratio between the reference flow rate (or equivalent quantity, e. g. airspeed, accumulated volume etc.) and the corresponding quantity {{as indicated by the}} instrument to be calibrated. The main reasons for this choice are twofold: - First of all, this approach is very practical for the end user of the instrument, who can get the <b>corrected</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> by simple multiplication of the readout times the coefficient; - Second, this representation allows to highlight the non-linearities of the instrument, which usually show up in {{the lower end of the}} range and might be hidden by a direct representation. On the other hand, this approach makes the uncertainty evaluation of the resulting data more complex, because of the correlation between the regression data. In this paper, we will perform an analysis according to such traditional approach and also according to an alternate “direct” approach, i. e., considering the reference flow rate as the dependent variable, instead of the calibration coefficient. In both cases the regression will be performed by a specific software for calibration curves (CCC software, developed at INRIM in the framework of the EMRP NEW 04 Project). Fig. 1 shows, as a case example, the scatter plot and the relevant regression curve for the two data representations. A procedural approach for correctly performing regression and uncertainty evaluation will be derived for both methods, and the results obtained will be compared. Specific attention will be devoted to the non-linear response region of the instrument range, since this part of the range is the more delicate and often the one where the instrument is used for a significant fraction of its operational life...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{can be used}} in vivo in combination with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to derive velocity profiles in space and time and accordingly, pressure drop and wall shear stress distribution in natural or artificial vessel segments. These hemodynamic data are difficult or impossible to acquire directly in vivo. Therefore, research has been performed combining MRI and CFD for flow simulations in flow phantoms, such as bends or anastomoses, and even in human vessels such as the aorta, the carotid, and the abdominal bifurcation. There is, however, no unanimity concerning the use of MRI velocity measurements as input for the inflow boundary condition of a CFD simulation. In this study, different input possibilities for the inflow boundary conditions are compared. MRI measurements of steady and pulsatile flow were performed on a U bend phantom, representing the aorta geometry. PAMFLOW (ESI Software, Krimpen aan den Ussel, The Netherlands), an industrial CFD software package, was used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. Three main parameters were found to influence the choice of an inflow boundary condition type. First, the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> through a vessel should be exact, since it proves to be a determining factor for the accuracy of the velocity profile. The other decisive parameters are the physiology of the flow profile and the required computer processing unit time. Our comparative study indicates {{that the best way to}} handle an inflow boundary condition is to use the velocities measured by MRI at the inflow plane as being fixed velocities. However, before using these MRI velocity data, they first should be corrected for the partial volume effect by filtering and second scaled in order to obtain the <b>correct</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> This implies that a reliable <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> measurement absolutely is needed for CFD calculations based on MRI velocity measurements...|$|R

Mitral Valve Regurgitation (MR) {{is a disease}} in which the valve leaflets fail to fully coapt (close together) allowing blood to flow in the reverse direction. If left untreated, MR progression can lead to serious heart problems including atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. A study of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database for the eight year period spanning 2000 - 2007 found that 47, 126 operations were performed for isolated MR alone [2] with an increase of the surgical valve repair rate (versus total valve replacement) from 51 % to 69 % {{in the same time}} interval [2][3]. The NeoChord DS 1000 is a novel surgical instrument that facilitates mitral valve repair for MR on a beating heart. As the demand for further instrumentation for beating heart mitral valve surgery grows, so too will the demand for mitral valve surgical training simulators. There exists an unmet need for such a simulator that incorporates the beating heart, anatomically correct heart anatomy and leaflet motion, physiologically <b>correct</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> and the ability to interface with surgical devices.

40|$|Abstract. Nonsynchronous {{vibrations}} (NSVs) {{with high}} amplitude {{levels in the}} first rotor blades of a multi-stage axial compressor have been observed. The excitation is aerodynamically caused and associated with a unsteady flow field, including sound field. In order to investigate the characteristics of sound field in the axial compressor, the noise inner compressor casing are measured simultaneously with the vibration of the rotor blades on a high pressure compressor component rig testing. The results show that noise with specific frequency structures appear in the axial compressor under a pre-arranged structure adjustment and the specific operating conditions, and the noise spectrum characteristics are analyzed detailedly. Some influence factors such as rotating speed and <b>corrected</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> on noise characteristics are discussed emphatically.

40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{a range of}} issues {{relating}} to the use of a vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment as a passive stall control technique in a multistage axial-flow compressor. The focus of the research was to determine whether such a treatment could delay the initiation of stall at lower mass <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> as well as providing the most beneficial improvement in flow characteristics without sacrificing compressor efficiencies. Specific objectives of this study were to examine possible improvements or deterioration in the flow characteristics including stall margin, peak pressure rise coefficients and maximum efficiency in a multistage axial flow compressor. A casing treatment in addition to several spacer rings was developed from two initial designs and tested on the first stage of a low speed three-stage axial-flow compressor with a (0. 7) hub to tip diameter ratio. The treatment configuration consisted of three parts: an outer casing ring, with a tubular shaped passage on the inside diameter, a set of 120 evenly spaced curved vanes, and a shroud or inner ring. The casing treatment was positioned following the inlet guide vanes upstream and partly covering the tip of the rotor blades. The main parts of the casing treatment including the recessed vanes in addition to some of the spacer rings were manufactured from high quality acrylic. Eight additional spacer rings of various shapes and geometry were added. The first ring held and partly covered the IGVs, in front of the casing treatment. The rotor tip exposure ratio was thought to {{have a significant impact on}} the effectiveness of the casing treatment. Therefore the other seven rings were used to provide the desired uncovered region of the rotor tip axial chord of about 10 % in order to provide a range of exposures of (23. 2 %, 33. 3 %, 43. 4 %, 53. 5 %, 63. 6 %, 73. 7 %, and 83. 8 %). The results showed significant improvements in stall margin in all treated casing configurations along with insignificant efficiency sacrifices in some compressor builds. About (28. 56 %) of stall margin improvement in terms of <b>corrected</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> was achieved using a casing treatment with a (33. 3 %) rotor tip exposure. The compressor build with (0. 535) rotor exposure ratios was the best configuration in terms of efficiency gain and loss characteristics. This build was able to provide the highest values of the maximum efficiencies in comparison with the performance achieved from the solid casing. An improvement of (1. 81 %) in the maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 54 %) stall margin improvement in terms of the <b>corrected</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were achieved by the application of this treatment configuration. The improvement in the peak pressure rise coefficients in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (2. 33 %). The compressor configuration using a casing treatment with a (0. 636) rotor exposure ratio was the best build in terms of the pressure rise coefficients. This configuration was able to provide highest value of the peak pressure rise in comparison with the characteristics achieved from the datum build. An improvement of (2. 65 %) in the peak pressure rise coefficient in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 49 %) improvement in stall margin in terms of the <b>corrected</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> was achieved from this casing treatment build. The improvement in maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (1. 03 %). The results suggest that the vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment designed as part of this investigation achieved the objectives, which were established for the research. In the majority of instances it not only produced gains in flow range, pressure rise coefficients and efficiencies, but also enabled the rotating stall, which developed at much lower mass <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in the compressor, to become progressive rather than abrupt...|$|R

This paper presents a neural network based approach that {{has been applied to}} Coriolis flowmeters to measure both the liquid <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and the gas void fraction of a two-phase flow. Experimental tests were conducted on a purpose-built two-phase flow test rig on both horizontal and vertical pipelines.

Two neural networks are established through training with experimental data obtained from the flow rig on horizontal and vertical pipelines, respectively. The performance of both neural networks is assessed in comparison with the reference readings. Experimental results suggest that the relative errors of the <b>corrected</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of liquid for the vertical and horizontal installations are no greater than ± 1. 5 % and ± 2. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|The extreme {{blunting}} of velocity profiles {{for human}} blood, reported from double-slit photometric measurements, {{has been shown}} to be an artifact of the measuring technique. The velocities measured are actually an average of velocities throughout the tube. An equation developed to model this averaging predicts profiles which agree with experimental results. This model explains the increase in blunting with decreasing tube diameter previously reported even if the true profiles remain parabolic. A trial and error method was chosen to extract information about the actual velocity distributions from double-slit measurements. Trial profiles were calculated using a &# 964; versus γ. relationship derived from bulk rheological measurements. The data of Barbee for &# 964; W versus &# 10818; and for tube relative hematocrit were used. When these trial profiles were averaged with the model for double-slit averaging, they were consistent with double-slit measurements. Neither the calculated nor measured profiles gave any evidence of substantial blunting except for &# 10818;&# 60; 2 sec - 1 where yield stress becomes important. Although the continuum approach was used to calculate trial profiles, limitations in the continuum representation were evident from hematocrit considerations.

In the current work, a variable {{distribution of}} flow open area along a horizontal well, {{with or without}} sand control, is proposed, to <b>correct</b> the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> profile along it. An uniform flow profile is achieved by means of unevenly spaced slots or perforations along the liner or sand control device. An analytical model was developed for flow inside and around the horizontal well with unevenly spaced slots or perforations along the liner or along the sand control device. The model couples flows in well and in the reservoir in well vicinity. The analytical model provides an explicit formula for slot/hole density along liners or screens in injection/production horizontal wells. Applications of the model to design horizontal well in cases of injection and production, with or without sand control, with inflow control device are discussed. The technology has been successfully applied in some oilfields onshore and offshore Brazil, where horizontal producer wells were equipped with specially perforated and slotted liners. The purpose is to homogenize flow along horizontal producer or injector wells, in order to delay gas and water coning and improve the sweep.

40|$|Effects of flow (hydrodynamic) {{properties}} on {{limiting conditions}} for soot-free laminar non-premixed hydrocarbon/air flames (called laminar soot-point conditions) were studied, emphasizing non-buoyant laminar coflowing jet diffusion flames. Effects of air/fuel-stream velocity ratios were of particular interest; therefore, the experiments {{were carried out}} at reduced pressures to minimize effects of flow acceleration due to the intrusion of buoyancy. Test conditions included reactant temperatures of 300 K; ambient pressures of 3. 7 - 49 8 kPa; methane-, acetylene-, ethylene-, propane-, and methane-fueled flames burning in coflowing air with fuel-port diameters of 1. 7, 3. 2, and 6. 4 mm, fuel jet Reynolds numbers of 18 - 121; air coflow velocities of 0 - 6 m/s; and air/fuel-stream velocity ratios of 0. 003 - 70. Measurements included laminar soot-point flame lengths, laminar soot-point fuel <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> and laminar liftoff conditions. The measurements show that laminar soot-point flame lengths and fuel <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> can be increased, broadening the range of fuel <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> where the flames remain soot free, by increasing air/fuel-stream velocity ratios. The mechanism of this effect involves the magnitude and direction of flow velocities relative to the flame sheet where increased air/fuel-stream velocity ratios cause progressive reduction of flame residence times in the fuel-rich soot-formation region. The range of soot-free conditions is limited by both liftoff, particularly at low pressures, and the intrusion of effects of buoyancy on effective air/fuel-stream velocity ratios, particularly at high pressures. Effective correlations of laminar soot- and smoke-point flame lengths were also found {{in terms of a}} <b>corrected</b> fuel <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> parameter, based on simplified analysis of laminar jet diffusion flame structure. The results show that laminar smoke-point flame lengths in coflowing air environments are roughly twice as long as soot-free (blue) flames under comparable conditions due to the presence of luminous soot particles under fuel-lean conditions when smoke-point conditions are approached. This is very similar to earlier findings concerning differences between laminar smoke- and sootpoint flame lengths in still environments...|$|R

We have tried to develop a new method to predict the actual uroflow rate by adding power Doppler information during transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in patients who do not have an interpretable voiding volume. Patients and MethodsFifty-five patients with complete uroflowmetry and TRUS with power Doppler study were enrolled. Analyses of the uroflowmetry and power Doppler parameters were performed.

We {{investigated}} {{the applicability of}} the available nomograms in our local population. Materials and Methods : Raw data of our previous study on variation in Q with voiding position (standing, sitting, and squatting) in healthy adult men was reanalyzed. Additionally, the departmental urodynamic database of the last four years was searched for uroflow data of men with voiding symptoms (International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) > 7 and global quality of life score > 2). These results were projected on the Liverpool and Siroky nomograms for men. The Q-VV relations were statistically analyzed using curve-estimation regression method to examine the current definition of <b>corrected</b> maximum <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> (Qmax).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to investigate the flow development inside an APU-style inlet {{and its effect on}} centrifugal compressor performance. The motivation arises from the increased applications of gas turbine engines installed with APU-style inlets such as unmanned aerial vehicles, auxiliary power units, and helicopters. The inlet swirl distortion created from these complicated inlet systems has become a major performance and operability concern. To improve the integration between the APU-style inlet and gas turbine engines, better understanding of the flow field in the APU-style inlet and its effect on gas turbine is necessary. ^ A research facility for the purpose of performing an experimental investigation of the flow field inside an APU-style inlet was developed. A subcritical air ejector is used to continuously flow the inlet at desired <b>corrected</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> The facility is capable of flowing the APU inlet over a wide range of <b>corrected</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> that matches the same Mach numbers as engine operating conditions. Additionally, improvement in the system operational steadiness was achieved by tuning the pressure controller using a PID control method and utilizing multi-layer screens downstream of the APU inlet. Less than 1 % relative unsteadiness was achieved for full range operation. ^ The flow field inside the rectangular-sectioned 90 ? bend of the APU-style inlet was measured using a 3 -Component LDV system. The structures for both primary flow and the secondary flow inside the bend were resolved. Additionally, the effect of upstream geometry on the flow development in the downstream bend was also investigated. ^ Furthermore, a Single Stage Centrifugal Compressor research facility was developed at Purdue University in collaboration with Honeywell to operate the APU-style inlet at engine conditions with a compressor. To operate the facility, extensive infrastructure for facility health monitoring and performance control (including lubrication systems, secondary air systems, a throttle system, and different inlet configurations) were built. Additionally, three Labview programs were developed for acquiring the compressor health monitoring, steady and unsteady pressure and strain data. ^ The baseline, steady aerodynamic performance map was established. Additionally, the unsteady pressure field in the compressor was investigated. Steady performance data have been acquired from choke to near surge at three different corrected speeds from 90 % to 100 % corrected speed in 5 % increments. The performance of the compressor stage was characterized using total pressure ratio (TPR), total temperature ratio (TTR), and isentropic efficiency. The impeller alone and diffuser along performance were also investigated, and the high loss regions in the compressor were identified. ^ At last, the compressor unsteady shroud pressure was investigated at 100 % corrected speed in both the time domain and frequency domain. Results show strong pressure components in relation to the shaft frequency (SF). The impeller has 17 main blades and 17 splitter blades, and introduces pressure fluctuations at 17 SF and its harmonics. Additionally, the diffuser has a vane count of 25 and results in pressure spectra of 59 SF (17 + 17 + 25) due to the interactions between the impeller and diffuser. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple method}} for the {{preparation}} of monodisperse protein-loaded polymer microspheres is presented in this paper. The method {{is based on the}} co-extrusion of an internal phase of an aqueous protein solution and an external phase of an organic polymer solution through a 200 -micron-sized hole. Controlled in the <b>correct</b> <b>flow</b> region, this process produces a core–shell-structured laminar liquid jet, which breaks to form monodisperse compound liquid droplets. Stabilized in a dilute aqueous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution, the droplets are converted into solid protein-loaded polymer microspheres through evaporation of the organic solvent. Results show that preparation parameters such as polymer concentration, total <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> ratio of the aqueous to organic phase have significant effects on the mean particle size, particle morphology and protein encapsulation efficiency (EE).

40|$|Compressed air {{and steam}} {{are perhaps the}} most {{significant}} industrial utilities after electricity, gas and water, and are re-sponsible for a significant proportion of global energy consump-tion. Microturbine technology, {{in the form of a}} Gas Turbine Air Compressor (GTAC), offers a promising alternative to tra-ditional, electrically driven air compressors providing low vi-bration, a compact size, reduced electrical consumption and po-tentially reduced greenhouse gas emissions. With high exhaust temperatures, gas turbines are well suited to the cogeneration of steam. The compressed air performance can be further increased by injecting some of that cogenerated steam or by conventional recuperation. This paper presents a thermodynamic analysis of various forms of the GTAC cycle incorporating steam cogeneration, steam injection (STIGTAC) and recuperation. The addition of cogeneration leads to improved energy utilisation, while steam injection leads to a significant boost in both the compressed air delivery and efficiency. As expected, for a low pressure ratio device, recuperating the GTAC leads to a significant increase in efficiency. The combination of steam injection and recuper-ation forms a recuperated STIGTAC with increased compressed air performance over the unrecuperated STIGTAC at the expense of reduced steam production. Finally, an analysis using a simpli-∗Address all correspondence to this author fied model of the STIGTAC demonstrates a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions, when compared to an equivalent air compres-sor driven by primarily coal-based electricity and a natural gas fired boiler.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{viscosity}} and surface tension are well {{documented in the}} case of roll-to-roll slot die systems. However their influence in combination with process parameters for batch scale coaters are less often discussed. Lack of coating uniformity attained using a bespoke slot die coater at the CPI National Printable Electronics Centre led to the requirement for an investigation to identify the sources of error. This project outlines a method used {{to determine the effects of}} material and process parameters on coating quality without the requirement for modification of equipment. It also describes the development of a series of versatile formulations containing polyethylene oxide that can be used to mimic similar polymer formulations for cost-effective initial process development of new materials. Various dilute polymer systems were developed whereby solids loading, viscosity and surface tension were all fully controlled. Design of Experiments techniques were employed to determine relationships between parameters and fluid properties. Chosen parameters included coating velocity, coating acceleration, coating gap (gap between slot die lips and substrate), volume infuse (volume of material initially infused) and <b>flow</b> infuse (<b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of material initially infused). Their effects on coating thickness and thickness uniformity were quantified for the bulk region of the coating, resulting in the development of a statistical model to aid optimisation of parameters for new materials. Surface tension had a minimal effect on coating thickness and uniformity during the screening study so this was not included in the final model. Coating acceleration and flow infuse exhibited a proportional relationship relating to coating thickness uniformity. Volume infuse did not have a significant effect on coating thickness or uniformity. Particular focus was placed on viscosity and coating velocity; {{in the case of}} this bespoke tool they were found to be inversely proportional in relation to coating thickness and uniformity. They strongly influenced the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and the resultant coating thickness due to the effects of fluid resistance, though the wet coat thickness parameter was held at a constant value. This suggested that the system does not work by a feedback loop to <b>correct</b> the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> for fluid resistance and internal pressure effects. Regardless of this, an operating window was found in which coating thickness and uniformity can be controlled for polymer solutions with a range of viscosities...|$|R

Under ERA the task for a High Pressure Ratio Core Technology program calls for a higher overall pressure ratio of 60 to 70. This mean that the HPC would have to almost double in pressure ratio and keep its high level of efficiency. The challenge is how to match the <b>corrected</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of the front two supersonic high reaction and high corrected tip speed stages with a total pressure ratio of 3. 5. NASA and GE teamed to address this challenge by using the initial geometry of an advanced GE compressor design {{to meet the requirements}} of the first 2 stages of the very high pressure ratio core compressor. The rig was configured to run as a 2 stage machine, with Strut and IGV, Rotor 1 and Stator 1 run as independent tests which were then followed by adding the second stage. The goal is to fully understand the stage performances under isolated and multi-stage conditions and fully understand any differences and provide a detailed aerodynamic data set for CFD validation. Full use was made of steady and unsteady measurement methods to isolate fluid dynamics loss source mechanisms due to interaction and endwalls. The paper will present the description of the compressor test article, its predicted performance and operability, and the experimental results for both the single stage and two stage configurations. We focus the detailed measurements on 97 and 100 of design speed at 3 vane setting angles...|$|R
40|$|The RSRM 10 % Scaled Model under design {{will make}} use of drilled hole liners to provide mass {{addition}} along the axial length of the model. The model will have two sets of liners in use at a time. The outer most liner is a flow distribution tube, the purpose {{of which is to}} help distribute the flow evenly over each model segment. The inner most liner will simulate the propellant burning surface at a burn time of 80 seconds. This liner will replicate as closely as possible the actual geometry of the full scale RSRM at the 80 second burn time. In order to obtain the <b>correct</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> for the burn time selected, it is necessary to determine the porosity of the holes drilled in each liner and the performance of those holes. The pressure drop across the liners directly effects the uniformity of the flow in the axial direction for a given model section. It is desired to have a pressure drop across the liners which is greater than the axial pressure drop in a given section. However, the pressure drop across the liner also has a bearing on the structural soundness of the model. The performance of the model was determined analytically, but there was some uncertainty as to the value of the discharge coefficient used. This uncertainty was the impetus for these drilled hole plate tests. Experimentally obtaining the discharge coefficients for sample plates of the porosity {{to be used in the}} model would increase the fidelity of the model design. These tests were developed in order to provide the required information with the least amount of testing time and hardware...|$|R

40|$|The laminar smoke-point {{properties}} of nonbuoyant round laminar jet diffusion flames were studied emphasizing results from long duration (100 - 230 s) experiments at microgravity carried -out on- orbit in the Space Shuttle Columbia. Experimental conditions included ethylene-and propane-fueled flames burning in still air at an ambient temperature of 300 K, initial jet exit diameters of 1. 6 and 2. 7 mm, jet exit velocities of 170 - 1630 mm/s, jet exit Reynolds numbers of 46 - 172, characteristic flame residence times of 40 - 302 ms, and luminous flame lengths of 15 - 63 mm. The onset of laminar smoke-point conditions involved two flame configurations: closed-tip flames with first soot emissions along the flame axis and open-tip flames with first soot emissions from an annular ring about the flame axis. Open-tip flames were observed at large characteristic flame residence {{times with the}} onset of soot emissions associated with radiative quenching near the flame tip; nevertheless, unified correlations of laminar smoke-point properties were obtained that included both flame configurations. Flame lengths at laminar smoke-point conditions were well-correlated in terms of a <b>corrected</b> fuel <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> suggested by a simplified analysis of flame shape. The present steady and nonbuoyant flames emitted soot more readily than earlier tests of nonbuoyant flames at microgravity using ground-based facilities and of buoyant flames at normal gravity due to reduced effects of unsteadiness, flame disturbances and buoyant motion. For example, laminar smoke-point flame lengths from ground-based microgravity measurements were up to 2. 3 times longer and from buoyant flame measurements were up to 6. 4 times longer than the present measurements at comparable conditions. Finally, present laminar smoke-point flame lengths were roughly inversely proportional to pressure, which is a somewhat slower variation than observed during earlier tests both at microgravity using ground-based facilities and at normal gravity...|$|R
