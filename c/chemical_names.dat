25|$|In 1998, Dave Yost {{suggested}} that chemists use medial capitals to aid readability of long <b>chemical</b> <b>names,</b> e.g. write AmidoPhosphoRibosylTransferase instead of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. This usage was not widely adopted.|$|E
25|$|Standard <b>{{chemical}}</b> <b>names</b> specify {{exactly the}} chemical {{structure of the}} molecule. The Cy3 and Cy5 nomenclature was first proposed by Ernst, et al. in 1989, and is non-standard, since it gives no hint of their chemical structures. In the original paper the number designated the count of the methines (as shown), and the side chains were unspecified. Thus various structures are designated Cy3 and Cy5 in the literature.|$|E

2500|$|The {{corresponding}} Chinese {{names are}} qīngqì (light gas), yángqì (nourishing gas), and dànqì (diluting gas). A scheme for translating <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> into Chinese {{was developed by}} John Fryer and Xu Shou in 1871. Where traditional names were well established, they kept them; otherwise, a single character for a name was compounded {{out of one of}} the five xing (phases) [...] metal, wood, water, fire, and earth [...] and a sound from the English name of the element.|$|E
2500|$|Another legend, often {{mentioned}} {{together with}} the [...] "holes in the brain" [...] myth discussed above, is that MDMA causes Parkinson's disease, possibly with even one night of exposure. [...] This was partially based on an animal study that found neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons after administering the drug to monkeys. [...] However, the study has been retracted by the researchers who conducted it because they had accidentally given methamphetamine instead of MDMA to the animals, given the similar <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> (MDMA stands for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). [...] Ironically, it is now being investigated as a possible treatment for Parkinson's disease.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, trivial {{names are}} not useful in {{describing}} the essential properties of the thing being named. Properties such as the molecular structure of a chemical compound are not indicated. And, in some cases, trivial names can be ambiguous or will carry different meanings in different industries or in different geographic regions. (For example, a trivial name such as white metal can mean various things.) On the other hand, systematic names can be so convoluted and difficult to parse that their trivial names are preferred. [...] As a result, {{a limited number of}} trivial <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> are retained names, an accepted part of the nomenclature.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{function}} of chemical nomenclature {{is to ensure}} that a spoken or written <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> leaves no ambiguity concerning which <b>chemical</b> compound the <b>name</b> refers to: each <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> should refer to a single substance. A less important aim {{is to ensure that}} each substance has a single name, although a limited number of alternative names is acceptable in some cases.|$|R

2500|$|It's {{generally}} {{understood that}} the aims of lexicography versus chemical nomenclature vary and are to an extent at odds. Dictionaries of words, whether in traditional print or on the web, collect and report the meanings of words as their uses appear and change over time. For web dictionaries with limited or no formal editorial process, definitions—in this case, definitions of <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> and terms—can change rapidly without concern for the formal or historical meanings. Chemical nomenclature {{on the other hand}} (with IUPAC nomenclature as the best example) is necessarily more restrictive: It aims to standardize communication and practice so that, when a chemical term is used it has a fixed meaning relating to chemical structure, thereby giving insights into chemical properties and derived molecular functions. These differing aims can have profound effects on valid understanding in chemistry, especially with regard to chemical classes that have achieved mass attention. Examples of the impact of these can be seen in considering the examples of: ...|$|E
60|$|There {{have been}} those who assert that {{one end of}} staying at the seaside is bathing; but {{it is easy to}} show that this is not so. Your proper bathing-place is up the river, where the trees bend to the green and brown shadows of the water. There the bath is sweet, fresh out of the sky, or but just {{filtered}} through the blue hills of the distant water-shed; and it is set about with flowers. But the sea--the sea has stood there since the beginning of things, and with small prospect of change, says Mr. Kipling, to all eternity. The water in the sea, geologists tell us, has not been changed for fifty million years! The same chemist who sets me against all my food with his <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> speaks of the sea as a weak solution of drowned men. Be that as it may, it leaves the skin harsh with salt, and the hair sticky. Moreover, it is such a promiscuous bathing-place. However, we need scarcely depreciate the sea as a bath, for what need is there of that when the river is clearly better? No one can deny that the river is better. People who bathe in the sea bathe by mistake, because they have come {{to the side of the}} sea, and know not how else to use it.|$|E
60|$|The {{waters of}} the Dead Sea are thus in the {{condition}} of having already deposited almost all their gypsum, {{as well as the}} greater part of the salt they originally contained. They are, in fact, much like sea water which has been boiled down till it has reached the state of a thick salty liquid; and though most of the salt is now already deposited in a deep layer on the bottom, enough still remains in solution to make the Dead Sea infinitely salter than the general ocean. At the same time, there are a good many other things in solution in sea water besides gypsum and common salt; such as chloride of magnesia sulphate of potassium, and other interesting substances with pretty <b>chemical</b> <b>names,</b> well calculated to endear them at first sight to the sentimental affections of the general public. These other by-contents of the water are often still longer in getting deposited than common salt; and, owing to their intermixture in a very concentrated form with the mother liquid of the Dead Sea, the water of that evaporating lake is not only salt but also slimy and fetid to the last degree, its taste being accurately described as half brine, half rancid oil. Indeed, the salt has been so far precipitated already that there is now five times as much chloride of magnesium left in the water as there is common salt. By the way, it is a lucky thing for us that these various soluble minerals are of such constitution as to be thrown down separately at different stages of concentration in the evaporating liquid; for, if it were otherwise, they would all get deposited together, and we should find on all old salt lake beds only a mixed layer of gypsum, salt, and other chlorides and sulphates, absolutely useless for any practical human purpose. In that case, we should be entirely dependent upon marine salt pans and artificial processes for our entire salt supply. As it is, we find the materials deposited one above another in regular layers; first, the gypsum at the bottom; then the rock-salt; and last of all, on top, the more soluble mineral constituents.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, Oxpheneridine is {{specifically}} {{excluded from the}} illegal drugs list on the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act schedules, presumably {{on the basis of}} the lack of addictive potential found by the UNODC.
