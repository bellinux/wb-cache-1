The fine particle (&lt; 1 μm) chemical composition {{of most of}} the plumes was dominated by sulphate that ranged from 1 – 5 μg m&minus; 3 as measured with a Quadrapole Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (Q-AMS). <b>Coarse</b> <b>particles</b> (&gt; 1 μm) were enhanced in all sulphate plumes. Fine particle organic mass concentrations were relatively low in most plumes and anti-correlated with the increases in the <b>coarse</b> <b>particles.</b> The chemistry of <b>coarse</b> <b>particles</b> sampled at Whistler Peak was dominated by calcium, sodium, nitrate, sulphate and formate. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy of <b>coarse</b> <b>particles</b> sampled from the NCAR C- 130 aircraft relatively close to Whistler indicated carbonate, potassium and organic functional groups, in particular the carboxyl group. Asian plumes reaching Whistler, BC during the INTEX-B study were not only significantly reduced of fine particle organic material, but organic compounds were attached to <b>coarse</b> <b>particles</b> in significant quantities. Scavenging of organic aerosol precursors by dust near source regions is suggested, and any formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) during transport from Asian source regions across the Pacific was principally associated with the <b>coarse</b> <b>particles.</b> An average of profiles indicates that trans-Pacific transport between 2 and 5 km during this period increased ozone by about 10 ppbv and fine particle sulphate by 0. 2 – 0. 5 μg m&minus; 3 . The mean sizes of the fine particles in the sulphate plumes were larger when dust particles were present and smaller when the fine particle organic mass concentration was larger and dust was absent.

Similarly, livestock are consuming grains as the main feed or as additional nutrient to the forage based feed. Processing grains for feed is aimed to get the easiest digestible grains to maximize starch availability, thus increasing the energy supply.|$|E
50|$|Sensor-based {{ore sorting}} is the {{terminology}} used for sensor-based sorting in the mining industry. It is a coarse physical <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> separation technology usually {{applied in the}} size range for 25 - 100 mm. Aim is either to create a lumpy product in ferrous metals, coal or industrial minerals applications or to reject waste before it enters production bottlenecks and more expensive comminution and concentration steps in the process. In the majority of all mining processes, particles of sub-economic grade enter the traditional comminution, classification and concentration steps. If the amount of sub-economic material in the above-mentioned fraction is roughly 25% or more, there is good potential that sensor-based ore sorting is a technically and financially viable option. High added value can be achieved with relatively low capital expenditure, especially when increasing the productivity through downstream processing of higher grade feed and through increased overal recovery when rejecting deleterious waste.|$|E

A risk-assessment scheme modified from an existing risk model was developed to consider the cancer risk contributed from both fine ultrafine and <b>coarse</b> <b>particles.</b> Exposure assessment was conducted based on particle concentration data measured in 16 Hong Kong homes.

Use of grease extractor cannot completely contain the particles, and a significant portion of particles can be transported from kitchens to other regions of the homes.

5000|$|Sensor-based sorting is a <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> {{separation}} technology {{applied in}} mining for the dry separation of bulk materials. The functional principle does not limit {{the technology to}} any kind of segment or mineral application but makes the technical viability mainly depend on the liberation characteristics at the size range 25 - 100 mm, which is usually sorted. If physical liberation is present there is a good potential that one of the sensors available on industrial scale sorting machines can differentiate between valuable and non-valuable particles. The separation is based on features measured with a detection technology that are used to derive a yes/no decision for actuation of usually pneumatic impulses. Sensor-based sorting is a disruptive technology in the mining industry which is universally applicable for all commodities. A comprehensive study examines both the technology's potential and its limitations, whilst providing a framework for application development and evaluation.

5000|$|Researchers have {{concluded}} that smaller particle-sized feed will improve digestion due to the increasing surface area for acid and enzyme digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. However, some researchers recently brought into the attention the necessity of <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> for poultry feed to complement the natural design and function of gastrointestinal tract (GIT). [...] and [...] discussed that the GIT retention time decreased {{due to lack of}} gizzard function that eventually gave negative impact on live performance. , compared the performance of 21 day old broilers fed with different feed particle size; 0.716 mm and 1.196 mm.

[...] however argued that the development of broiler was influenced by changing particle sizes. However variation in particle size between 0.5-1 mm usually did not have any effect on the broilers. Very fine particles (<0.5 mm) may impair the broilers performance due to presence of dust that cause respiratory problems, increase water intake, feed presence in the drinkers and increase litter moisture. , in their recent study concluded that although fine particle sizes (0.27 mm) enhanced broilers live performance, the pelleted feed did not.|$|E
50|$|Sensor-based {{ore sorting}} is in {{comparison}} to other <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> separation technologies relatively cheap. While the costs for the equipment itself are relatively high in capital expenditure and operating costs, the absence of extensive infrastructure in a system results in operating costs {{that are to be}} compared to jigging. The specific costs are very much depending on the average particle size of the feed and on the ease of the separation. Coarser particles imply higher capacity and thus less costs. Detailed costing can be conducted after the mini-bulk stage in the technical feasibility evaluation.Prejudice against waste rejection with sensor-based sorting widely spread, that the loss of valuables, thus the recovery penalty of this process, supersedes the potential downstream cost savings and is therefore economically not viable. It must be noted that for waste rejection the aim for the separation with sensor-based ore sorting must be put onto maximum recovery, which means that only low grade or barren waste is rejected because the financial feasibility is very much sensitive to that factor. Nevertheless, through the rejection of waste before comminution and concentration steps, recovery can be often increased in the downstream process, meaning that the overall recovery is equal or even higher than the one in the base case, meaning that instead of losing product, additional product can be produced, which adds the additional revenue to the cost savings on the positive side in the cash flow.If the rejected material is replaced with additional higher grade material, the main economic benefit unfolds through the additional production. It implies, that in conjunction with sensor-based ore sorting, the capacity of the crushing station is increased, to allow for the additional mass-flow that is subsequently taken out by the sensor-based ore sorters as waste.|$|E

40|$|The flow of {{thickened}} {{mine tailings}} within a tailings storage facility {{is a complex}} interaction between unconstrained viscoplastic free surface flow and possible <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> settling within the flow depth. The broad focus of this work is developing a robust framework for modelling tailings beach flows. Modelling tailings flow evolution in three dimensions within a storage facility will ultimately provide greater understanding of beach slope formation, {{as well as the}} ability to optimize deposition sequencing. This thesis focuses on the first step of developing a tailings model considering the transport and settling of mono-sized coarse particles within two dimensional (length and depth) laminar viscoplastic carrier fluid sheet flow. The 2 D model consists of a semi-implicit finite difference shallow water sheet flow model for predicting the viscoplastic flow depth and discharge down the beach. The <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> transport and hindered settling within the flow are predicted using a scalar transport model. The scalar transport and shallow water flow model are coupled together using <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> rheology augmentation. Two key novel advancements were made through the model development. The first is coupling the <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> rheology augmentation within the free surface flow to the <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> hindered settling behavior with depth. This coupling allows for the rheology augmentation due to the coarse solid fraction to be incorporated seamlessly into both the fluid flow solver and the particle settling model. The second advancement is expanding the rheology augmentation and hindered settling coupling to particle flows beyond the Stoke’s flow regime. Ultimately, the 2 D model results are compared against Spelay’s (2007) laminar settling experimental measurements for oil sand thickened tailings (TT) and composite tailings (CT) slurries, along with Spelay’s 1 D settling model. The 2 D model provides improved prediction of the particle concentration profiles within the fluid flow compared to the 1 D model. The 2 D model is also able to predict the increase in flow depth due to the particle accumulation on the bed, as well as the downslope particle transport and settling behavior...|$|E
