40|$|Eleven {{bacterial}} and two yeast strains, four {{of which}} were previously identified as having activity on a lightly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (CLD- 2) found in one type of superabsorbent tampon, were grown {{on a variety of}} substrates, most containing cellulosics.

None of these 13 strains nor 3 commercially obtained beta-glucosidase preparations could hydrolyze CLD- 2, although a commercial cellulase and two other bacterial preparations known to produce cellulases could. Based on these results, it appears that previous work suggesting that the degradation of CLD- 2 by vaginal microbes and beta-glucosidase is implicated in the production by Staphylococcus aureus of toxin causing toxic shock syndrome must be reevaluated...|$|E

Hyaluronic acid is currently the most widely used dermal filler for the treatment of facial wrinkles. However, new products with interesting features are being introduced into the market. Cross-linked carboxymethylcellulose is one of these and represents a new alternative for the correction of wrinkles and facial defects. Patients and methods: The retrospective, multicenter, open-label study on nasolabial folds reported here was carried out between January 2010 and April 2014 on 350 subjects between 22 and 67 years of age for a 36 -month follow-up period in order to consistently and extensively assess the safety and performance of this treatment. Results: The study revealed effective and durable correction of nasolabial wrinkles for periods of 9 – 12 months. Product reapplication over a 36 -month period did not lead to an increase in adverse effects, which always remained rare and of little clinical significance, usually consisting of bruising and redness. Conclusion: <b>Cross-linked</b> <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> {{has been shown to be}} a safe and effective alternative to the resorbable products currently on the market.

This is the first report in which sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) has been chemically treated by the cross-linking process and thus used as a hydrogel for soft-tissue augmentation through injection with thin needles. The study evaluates, from a clinical point of view, the behavior of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> hydrogel used in the aesthetic field and its side effects so as to check the safety and performance of the polymer following intradermal injections. Patients and methods: This work shows the preliminary results of an ongoing clinical study conducted between 2006 and 2009, performed on 84 healthy volunteers (62 females, 22 males) aged between 18 and 72 years, for the treatment of 168 nasolabial folds, 45 perioral wrinkles, and 39 lip volume. Results: Study results show an excellent correction of facial defects. Tolerance and aesthetic quality of the correction obtained indicate considerable safety features and absence of side effects. From a clinical point of view, hydrogel is gradually absorbed into the injection site without migration issues. Conclusion: Cross-linked CMC hydrogel proves to be an ideal agent for soft tissue augmentation with regard to safety and ease of application. It did not cause infection, extrusion, migration, or adverse reactions in the patients who have been followed for two years. Delayed aesthetic results on facial wrinkles were very satisfactory.

Different proportions of β-CD, CMC, AA and MBA were blended with each other to fabricate hydrogels via free radical polymerization technique. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed successful grafting of components into the polymeric network. Thermal and morphological characterization confirmed the formation of thermodynamically stable hydrogels having porous structure. The pH-responsive behaviour of hydrogels has been documented by swelling dynamics and drug release behaviour in simulated gastrointestinal fluids.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, a {{hydrophobic}} material, ethylcellulose, {{which was}} used as its aqueous suspension Surelease®, was combined with a swelling agent as the swelling layer to prepare delayed-release pellets for Danshensu, which is a hydrophilic drug with low MW. A rupturable, delayed-release pellet consists of a drug core, a swelling layer containing a swelling agent (<b>cross-linked</b> sodium <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose)</b> with a hydrophobic agent (Surelease®), and a controlled layer composed by an insoluble, water-permeable polymeric coating (aqueous ethylcellulose dispersions) was developed in a fluidised bed. Results showed that blending Surelease® into the swelling layer could effectively extend the release of Danshensu from the pellets, which {{may be attributed to}} the slowed swelling rate by reduction of water penetration and improvement of mechanical integrity of the swelling layer. Drug in the delayed pellets showed sustained release in beagle dogs after oral administration with comparable in-vivo exposure to the uncoated drug pellets. In conclusion, blends of hydrophobic and swelling agents in the swelling layer in double-membrane pellets could achieve a delayed drug-release profile in vitro, as well as delayed and sustained absorption in vivo for highly soluble, low-MW drug. The present study highlighted the potential use of a delayed-release system for other hydrophilic, low-MW drugs to meet the formulation requirements for chronopharmacological diseases...|$|R

During heating, the gelatinization rate became similar to dough with <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose.</b> Moreover, peak complex viscosity was decreased by 0. 4. 10 (5) Pa s. Additionally, hydrocolloid supplements impacted bread crumb characteristics. An open structure was found in crumb with added calcium caseinate, <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> as well as xanthan gum. The hardness of rice buckwheat crumb without hydrocolloids (12. 2 N) was decreased by calcium caseinate (4. 3 N), xanthan gum (9. 1 N) and <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (9. 3 N), however, no significant effect of sodium caseinate was recorded (11. 5 N). The overall sensory acceptability of rice-buckwheat bread (7. 1) was increased by sodium caseinate (7. 5), calcium caseinate (7. 7) and <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (7. 8). The acceptability of bread with xanthan gum (5. 9) was negatively impacted by dry, coarse crust and extremely sticky crumb.

The other series contained <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>cellulose,</b> 9 S polyriboinosinic and polyribocytidylic acids, and poly-L-lysine, whose molecular weights ranged from 2, 000 to 27, 000.

The effects of NaOH, H 2 O, temperature, ethanol, sodium mono chloro acetate, sodium tripolyphosphate, citric acid, epichlorohydrin and extruder screw configuration on the degree of substitution of carboxymethyl starch were studied. ^ The physical, chemical and morphological properties of sodium starch glycolate (<b>cross-linked</b> <b>carboxymethyl</b> starch) prepared using reactive extrusion were characterized and compared with those of VIVASTAR®P. The liquid (water and 0. 1 N HCl) uptakes by sodium starch glycolate prepared using reactive extrusion were lower than those by VIVASTAR®P. This may have been because of gelatinization of starch and insufficient cross-linking in sodium starch glycolate prepared using reactive extrusion. Carboxymethyl starches with high degrees of substitutions also were prepared using reactive extrusion. The effects of SMCA:starch ratio, aqueous ethanol:(starch+SMCA) and the extruder screw configuration on the degree of substitution and reaction efficiency were studied. ^ Further, the use of reactive extrusion for the chemical modification of a non-thermoplastic material like cellulose was demonstrated.
