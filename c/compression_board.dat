By ways of study the cardiac <b>compression</b> <b>board</b> (CPR board) design, the aim of this research is to finding some useful suggestion for the future design about user communication in order to improve design. The design of cardiac <b>compression</b> <b>board</b> was used in turn to be the embodiment of the possible design proposal. Based on the background research of the theory, medicine and product, research first explored and defined several key words; the combination of user-centered design, activity-centered design and genius design theory were applied in this project. Furthermore base on these three basic design theories, four modes of research methods were utilized in this project: ‘learn’, ‘look’, ‘ask’ and ‘try’. Each of these four modes has several specific methods. Those methods relative to the user communication and the particular product, CPR board, were picked out for this project and utilized in. All the process of applying those methods was documented in this thesis using as the evidence of the user communication for the design. The information from user communication formed the basic of the CPR board design; the activity analysis and the capacity of designer also play a very important place to make full use of the favorable factors to form an integrated design method. The CPR board design was based on the information collected from those four modes of research methods. All the details were tested and determined with user communication and base on the requirement from user communication. An evaluation was made to show the result of the design. It shows that the design proposal generally meet the requirements and further proof that the design methods was appropriate for this project. In the last chapter, the findings from the research process were listed and argued hoping to help the future research on user communication. The suggestion for future research was also list in this chapte...|$|E

50|$|These {{graphics}} are a port of the Indigo²'s XZ (Elan) graphics into Indy. They offer {{very good}} non-textured 3D {{performance at the}} time, sacrificing a bit of 2D performance in return. The XZ graphics option has not been popular in Indy models that used the R5000 microprocessor. This is mostly due to the R5000's MIPS IV architecture, which enhanced MIPS' floating-point arithmetic capabilities, allowing coordinate transformations to be performed faster than the XZ graphics board. However, using XZ to perform coordinate transforms does free the CPU to perform other rendering-related calculations. If the application is not transform-limited (i.e. limited by the speed of coordinate transformation), then the XZ option can provide significant rasterization performance advantages over the XL boards.These graphics {{take the form of}} two boards, {{one on top of the}} other, and block both GIO option slots, making them less favorable since options such as 10/100 Ethernet and JPEG <b>compression</b> <b>boards</b> cannot be installed.|$|R

Graphics processing units (GPUs) represent a very attractive opportunity, offering the possibility to dramatically increase the computation speed in applications that are data and task parallel. An algorithm for the lossy compression of hyperspectral images is implemented on a GPU using Nvidia computer unified device architecture (CUDA) parallel computing architecture. The parallelization strategy is explained, with emphasis on the entropy coding and bit packing phases, for which a more sophisticated strategy is necessary due to the existing data dependencies. Experimental results are obtained by comparing the performance of the GPU implementation with a single-threaded CPU implementation, showing high speedups of up to 15. 41. A profiling of the algorithm is provided, demonstrating the high performance of the designed parallel entropy coding phase. The accuracy of the GPU implementation is presented, as well as the effect of the configuration parameters on performance. The convenience of using GPUs for on-board processing is demonstrated, and solutions to the potential difficulties encountered when accelerating hyperspectral compression algorithms are proposed, if space-qualified GPUs become a reality in the near futur...|$|R
40|$|The coding and {{transmission}} of the massive datasets captured by Earth Observation (EO) satellites is a critical issue in current missions. The conventional approach is to use <b>compression</b> on <b>board</b> the satellite {{to reduce the size}} of the captured images. This strategy exploits spatial and/or spectral redundancy to achieve compression. Another type of redundancy found in such data is the temporal redundancy between images of the same area that are captured at different instants of time. This type of redundancy is commonly not exploited because the required data and computing power are not available on board the satellite. This paper introduces a coding scheme for EO satellites able to exploit this redundancy. Contrary to traditional approaches, the proposed scheme employs both the downlink and the uplink of the satellite. Its main insight is to compute and code the temporal redundancy on the ground and transmit it to the satellite via the uplink. The satellite then uses this information to compress more efficiently the captured image. Experimental results for Landsat 8 images indicate that the proposed dual link image coding scheme can achieve higher coding performance than traditional systems for both lossless and lossy regimes...|$|R

40|$|For {{production}} of <b>compression</b> moulded <b>boards</b> from whole coconut husk the auto-adhesive properties {{are derived from}} the intrinsic high lignin content. Since the properties of manufactured boards for a large part {{will depend on the}} input husk material these properties are studied here. Husks of different varieties and maturity have been investigated for their contents of fibre and pith. Relevant physical properties and chemical composition were determined. For accurate determination of tensile strength and stiffness of coir fibre, its density (¿coir = 1. 2 ¿ 1. 3 g/cm 3) and cross-sectional area were determined. Both thickness and longitudinal swelling of the fibre were measured to assess the effects of water absorption. The constituent fibre and pith fractions of coconut husk have been chemically analysed for polysaccharide (cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose) and lignin contents. Detailed carbohydrate analysis of the fibre indicated a glucose (cellulose) content of approximately 33 % in the cell wall, together with 12 % xylose as the major component of the hemicellulose fraction. Coir pith only contains 16 % glucose. The effects of maturing on the chemical composition of the husk is analysed and a significant increase in glucose (cellulose) is observed, while for other sugars no dramatic change in relative amounts can be measured. It was concluded that only slight differences can be observed between mature coconut husks of different origin, and all are suitable as input feedstock for boards production. More effects can be expected from the age of the nuts...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a video <b>compression</b> development <b>board</b> as a standalone embedded system. The board can capture images, encode them and stream out a video to a destination over a wireless link. This project was done to allow users to test and develop video compression encoders that are designed for UAV applications. The board was designed to use an ADSP-BF 533 Blackfin DSP from Analog Devices {{with the purpose of}} encoding images, which were captured by a camera module and then streamed out a video through a WiFi module. Moreover, an FPGA that has an interface to a logic analyzer, the DSP, the camera and the WiFi module, was added to accommodate other future uses, and to allow for the debugging of the board. The board was tested by loading a H. 264 BP/MP encoder from Analog Devices to the DSP, where the DSP was integrated with the camera and the WiFi module. The test was successful and the board was able to encode a 2 MegaPixel picture at about 2 frames per second with a data rate of 186 Kbps. However, as the frame rate was only 2 frames per second, the video was somewhat jerky. It was found that the encoding time is a system limitation and {{that it has to be}} improved in order to increase the frame rate. A proposed solution involves dividing the captured picture into smaller segments and encoding each segment in parallel. Thereafter, the segments can be packed and streamed out. Further performance issues about the proposed structure are presented in the thesis...|$|R

40|$|The Nuclear Weapons Identification System (NWIS) is {{a system}} that {{performs}} radiation signature measurements on objects such as nuclear weapons components. NWIS consists of a {sup 252 }Cf fission source, radiation detectors and associated analog electronics, data acquisition boards, and a computer running Windows NT and the application software. NWIS uses signal processing techniques to produce a radiation signature from the radiation emitted from the object. This signature can be stored and later compared to another signature to determine whether two objects are similar. A library of such signatures can be used to identify objects in closed containers as well as determine attributes such as fissile mass and in some cases enrichment. NWIS uses a {sup 252 }Cf source {{on one side of the}} object to produce radiation that its detectors measure on the other side of the target (active mode). If the object naturally emits enough radiation, the {sup 252 }Cf source is not required (passive mode). The NWIS data acquisition hardware has five detector channels. Each channel receives shaped detector pulses and times those pulses with 1 nanosecond resolution. In active mode measurements one of these channels receives pulses from a detector measuring the {sup 252 }Cf source fissions. Thus, for active mode measurements, NWIS has the time of each {sup 252 }Cf fission and the subsequent injection of neutrons and gamma rays into the object. The remaining channels receive pulses from the detectors measuring radiation from the object. These detectors record the amount and time of radiation exiting the object. By correlating the radiation events among the source and the other detectors, and among the detectors themselves, a characteristic response of the object to {sup 252 }Cf radiation or its own internal radiation is measured. The data acquisition hardware consists of two custom-made boards. The Data Capture and <b>Compression</b> (DCC) <b>board</b> is built around a Gallium Arsine (GaAs) chip designed at ORNL. This chip assigns a time to each pulse received on the five detector channels and passes five compressed streams of time stamp data to the Data Acquisition (DA) board. The DA board performs additional data compression, consolidates the five data streams into one, formats the data, and passes it across the computer&#x 27;s PCI bus into computer memory. The computer processor performs the signal processing required to calculate the signatures and saves the result to disk.

40|$|Flax fibers {{are often}} used as {{reinforcement}} for thermoset and thermoplastic to produce biocomposite products. These products exhibit numerous advantages such as good mechanical properties, low density, and biodegradability. Thermoplastics are usually reinforced with flax fiber using injection molding technology and limited {{research has been done}} on compression molded thermoplastic biocomposite. Therefore, commercial thermoplastic high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were selected for developing compression molded flax reinforced biocomposites in this research project. The main goal of this research was to develop <b>compression</b> molded biocomposite <b>board</b> using Saskatchewan flax fiber and investigate the effect of flax fiber and processing parameters (molding temperature and molding pressure) on the properties of biocomposite. The fiber was cleaned and chemically treated with alkaline and silane solution that modified the fiber surface. Chemical treatments significantly increased the mechanical properties due to better fiber-polymer interfacial adhesion and also reduced the water absorption characteristics. The silane treatment showed better results than alkaline treatment. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test were performed to study the thermal and morphological properties of the untreated and chemically treated flax fiber. Flax fiber and thermoplastic resin was mixed using a single-screw extruder to ensure homogenous mixing. HDPE- and PP-based biocomposites were developed through compression molding with three different pretreated flax fiber (untreated, alkaline, silane treated fiber), three levels of fiber content, two levels of molding temperature and two levels of molding pressure. Increase in fiber content increased composite color index, density, water absorption, tensile strength, Young’s modulus, bending strength, and flexural modulus. However for the HDPE composites, tensile and bending strength decreased after 20 % flax fiber loading. For the PP composites the, tensile and bending strength decreased after 10 % flax fiber loading. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to quantitatively show the significant effects of the process variables (molding temperature, pressure, and fiber content) and their interactions on the response variables (physical and mechanical properties of biocomposites).
