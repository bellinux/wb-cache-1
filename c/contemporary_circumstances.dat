So long as they remain [...] "unencumbered" [...] they can subsist on a comparatively small income and find freedom and leisure to watch for and follow opportunities of self-advancement; they can travel, get knowledge and experience, make experiments, succeed. One might almost say the conditions of success and self-development in the modern world are to defer marriage as long as possible, and after that to defer parentage as long as possible. And even when there is a family there is the strongest temptation to limit it to three or four children at the outside. Parents who can give three children any opportunity in life prefer to do that than turn out, let us say, eight ill-trained children at a disadvantage, to become the servants and unsuccessful competitors of the offspring of the restrained. That fact bites us all; it does not require a search. It is all very well to rant about [...] "race-suicide," [...] but there are the clear, hard conditions of <b>contemporary</b> <b>circumstances</b> for all but the really rich, and so patent are they that I doubt if all the eloquence of Mr. Roosevelt and its myriad echoes has added a thousand babies to the eugenic wealth of the English-speaking world.|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} in capacity and {{the improvement of}} quality remain the paramount tasks for the nursing research endeavour. Recent {{attempts have been made}} to scope the shape of nursing research and to track any movement in these respects, over time. This paper will briefly report on the construction of a national database and the development of a methodological model to illustrate selected features of the <b>contemporary</b> <b>circumstance</b> of nursing research in the United Kingdom. The present study, funded by the National Health Executive (West Midlands), made scholarly use of the content of 1, 084 abstracts submitted to three consecutive Royal College of Nursing Annual International Research Conferences, to create a database capable of being interrogated for a variety of purposes. These data were linked to a Geographical Information System and outputs from the analyses were mapped against a background of 1999 National Health Service Regional boundaries. Substantive findings have the potential to help uncover their relationship with other policy agendas and with priority areas for investigation. The present study has built the infrastructure to establish a unique UK nursing research data archive and further interrogation of the database could help to frame second-generation studies, using appropriately different approaches...|$|R

5000|$|Brecht thought, the [...] "old" [...] {{forms of}} European theatre based on Aristotle, which, {{in the face}} of {{changing}} <b>contemporary</b> <b>circumstances</b> were inadequate to represent social reality. Therefore, he came up with the concept of “epic theatre”. This direction of theatre was inspired by Brecht’s Marxist political beliefs. It was something of a political platform for his ideologies. Epic theatre is the assimilation of education through entertainment and is the antithesis of Stanislavsky’s Realism and also Expressionism. Brecht believed that, unlike epic theatre, Expressionism and Realism were incapable of exposing human nature and so had no educational value. He conjectured that his form of theatre was capable of provoking a change in society. Brecht’s intention was to encourage the audience to ponder, with critical detachment, the moral dilemmas presented before them.|$|E

The main consequences of the Battle of Novšiće were strengthening of {{the positions of the}} League of Prizren and losing any chance for Montenegrins to soon capture Plav and Gusinje. The battle cast a certain shadow on the exceptional Montenegrin military reputation, gave some confidence to Albanians and significantly affected the position of prince Nicholas and his government. Both parties claimed victory after this battle, underestimating own casualties and overestimating enemy casualties. The Montenegrin government tried to conceal the military defeat and published information about 85 killed and 107 wounded Montenegrins as opposed to 1,000 killed and wounded enemy soldiers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated {{model of the}} determinants of adult health combining lifecourse factors and <b>contemporary</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Using the 1958 British Birth Cohort, it operationalises lifecourse influences in terms of factors from birth to age 33, which might act through latent, pathway, or cumulative effects. <b>Contemporary</b> <b>circumstances</b> are represented by variables {{at different levels of}} social aggregation: macro (socio-economic circumstances); meso (involvement in civil society functions); micro (personal social support); and intersecting (job insecurity and life control). Multiple regression models were fitted, using self-rated health at age 33 as the health outcome. To allow for temporal ordering of events, early life factors were entered first in the final model, followed by later childhood factors and, finally current factors. Self-rated health was predicted by variables representing both early and later stage of the lifecourse and also contemporary societal-level factors. The effects of childhood factors were not removed by including contemporary factors, and conversely, contemporary factors contributed to the prediction of self-rated health over and above lifecourse factors. The factors were not collinear; supporting the notion that each dimension was distinct from the others. Although the model accounted for only 9 % of the variance in self-rated health, the general conclusion is that both lifecourse and <b>contemporary</b> <b>circumstances</b> should be considered together in explaining adult health.

40|$|Various {{institutional}} legacies and <b>contemporary</b> social <b>circumstances</b> {{often work}} to constrain the voices and cultural expressions {{of gender and}} sexually diverse young people. However, gender and sexually diverse youth can also respond critically and creatively, generating their own sites of cultural participation and meaning.

Second, drawing on participant observations and survey data collected at the festival, this article provides a 'snapshot' of the various identities, attitudes and cultural styles that circulate within Brisbane's queer youth communities. Finally, it argues that the spectacle, celebration and diverse articulations of youth sexualities which underpinned Queeriosity provided participants with opportunities for sexual self-making.

40|$|The tourism specialists of Western {{countries}} {{pointed out}} that dark tourism {{is becoming more and}} more massive because of the new political approaches, <b>contemporary</b> economic <b>circumstances,</b> and psychosocial state of postmodern society. This paper examines the situation of dark heritage in Lithuania: the official ideological background, the exploitation of dark sites for educational purposes and the satisfaction of dark tourists’ needs and expectations. The theoretical insights of foreign authors are compared with actual practice of dark heritage management in Lithuania. The case study of Kaunas fortress adaptation for tourism complements the theoretical research. Only two of nine forts are appropriate for visiting, others are in the state of emergency, what also indicates the authorities’ approach to the atrocity heritage. The main difference of two fort museums is determined by different owners: the Ninth fort is a state museum; the Seventh fort is a private museum. This determines the different dimensions of ideological and educational content and the difference in management strategies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis maps the public, {{collective}} memory {{of slavery in}} Liverpool {{from the beginning of}} the nineteenth century to the present day. Using a discourse-analytic approach, the study draws on a wide range of ‘source genres’ to interrogate processes of {{collective memory}} across written histories, guidebooks, commemorative occasions and anniversaries, newspapers, internet forums, black history organisations and events, tours, museums, galleries and the built environment. By drawing on a range of material across a longue durée, the study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how this former ‘slaving capital of the world’ has remembered its exceptional involvement in transatlantic slavery across a two hundred year period. This thesis demonstrates how Liverpool’s memory of slavery has evolved through a chronological mapping (Chapter Two) which places memory in local, national and global context(s). The mapping of memory across source areas is reflected within the structure of the thesis, beginning with ‘Mapping the Discursive Terrain’ (Part One), which demonstrates the influence and intertextuality of identity narratives, anecdotes, metaphors and debates over time and genre; ‘Moments of Memory’ (Part Two), where public commemorative occasions, anniversaries and moments of ‘remembrance’ accentuate issues of ‘performing’ identity and the negotiation of a dissonant past; and ‘Sites of Memory’ (Part Three), where debate and discourse around particular places in Liverpool’s contested urban terrain have forged multiple lieux de memoire (sites of memory) through ‘myths’ of slave bodies and contestations over race and representation. Through its approach, structure and methods of analysis, this thesis argues that Liverpool’s memory of slavery has been complicated by varying uses of the past alongside <b>contemporary</b> <b>circumstance</b> and context. However, and as the long durée approach has demonstrated, ongoing engagements with this history continue to impact and influence subsequent commemorations, creating mnemonic legacies across time. Additionally, the memory of slavery in Liverpool has been further complicated by the ongoing memory of context; the place of other significant moments in the city’s social, economic, political, and, especially racial history. The discourse-analytic approach, moreover, demonstrates memory’s active and interactive dynamics, which incorporate broader societal discourses, and reveal the social processes of collective memory. ...|$|R
