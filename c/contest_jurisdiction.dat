50|$|An {{approach}} {{increasingly common}} in Canadian courts is to <b>contest</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> or publication, as {{the courts have}} consistently required affidavits of proof of publication within the province where the libel is alleged. In Éditions Écosociété Inc. v. Banro Corp., interveners made extensive argument against assuming jurisdiction even when there were very clearly copies distributed and read, {{on the grounds that}} this imposed too much of a defense burden.|$|E
50|$|In {{that court}} case, the {{defendant}} {{had argued that}} the court lacked personal jurisdiction over it but refused {{a court order to}} produce evidence of this lack of jurisdiction. The defendant argued that, because the court lacked jurisdiction, the court had no authority to issue an order to show proof of the lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court rejected that argument and determined that the defendant's refusal to comply waived the right to <b>contest</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> just as if it had never contested jurisdiction at all.|$|E
50|$|In past times, an {{appearance}} {{de bene esse}} was a special appearance made solely to <b>contest</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> The procedure has long been abolished in {{most if not all}} jurisdictions in favor of allowing jurisdictional objections to be made either by motion or set out as an affirmative defense in a responsive pleading (an answer to the complaint): in the Federal courts, the procedure was superannuated by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and, in Pennsylvania, by a 1965 amendment to the state rules of civil procedure. The procedure has been referred to by sovereign citizens.|$|E

50|$|Article 24 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 26(1)) defines another {{ground for}} a {{national}} court to stay or decline proceedings by setting forth that a court of a Member State before which a defendant enters an appearance shall have jurisdiction. This deals with the hypothesis of a plaintiff suing the defendant in a Member State that inititally does not have jurisdiction; if the defendant shows up and does not plead that the court has no jurisdiction, the court will have jurisdiction from then on. The main rationality behind this provision is legal certainty, for it acts as an implicit choice of forum clause: the plaintiff gives his consent to the choice of new forum by initiating the procedure, while the defendant consents by appearing and not pleading lack of jurisdiction. Apart from {{the situation in which}} the defendant explicitly <b>contests</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> Article 24 furthermore states that the rule of jurisdiction by appearance is not applicable whenever the exclusivity of the above-mentioned Article 22 comes into picture.|$|R

5000|$|A special {{appearance}} {{is a term}} used in the American law of civil procedure to describe a civil defendant's appearance {{in the court of}} another state solely to dispute the personal jurisdiction of the court over that defendant. Prior to the advent of this procedure, defendants had to either appear in the other state's court to defend the case on the merits, or not show up in court at all, and then mount a collateral attack on any judgment rendered against them, when the plaintiff came to the defendant's state to collect on the judgment. In a legal catch-22, if the defendant appeared solely to <b>contest</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> the court would then be permitted to assert jurisdiction based on the defendant's presence.|$|E

40|$|The article draws {{together}} some preliminary observations that suggest social {{work is being}} re-cast {{in the form of}} an actuarial programme of low-level functional tasks. The overall effect of this may turn out to be a de-skilling of the social work task. Actuarialism attempts to predict where and who in society poses the greatest risk, such that they are targeted in advance and acted against. A distinctive re-territorialisation of social work is at work involving professional claims and <b>contests</b> of <b>jurisdiction</b> over new tasks, problems, treatments, interventions and academic research. This entails strategies seeking to provide legitimation by formal knowledge and is rooted in particular values about what counts as relevant in social work. It is projected that new forms of technical expertise such as actuarial science come to play a dominant role in defining social work, especially with the neo-liberal political context. In establishing a foundation for this argument, various 'technologies of care' - such as evidence-based practice - are identified as emerging via the tutelary complex in social work. The fantasy of actuarialism is that experts - in social work, mental health and criminal justice - can be like weather forecasters, predicting the risk of anything from the next outbreak of child molestation to organised community drug dealing in advance...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years the nobilities of early modern Europe have become a subject of major {{interest}} for historians working on the social history of the period. This increase in attention has resulted in the development of new approaches to what is a very productive topic of research, in the course of which some established conceptions on the European nobilities have been revised. This paper draws on a number of these new approaches and revisions to suggest ways in which they might illuminate similar research on the Maltese nobility during the Hospitaller period. Through a discussion of the existing research on early modern Maltese society, this paper highlights two broad sets of questions that arise from the study of the Maltese nobility. These questions concern the disintegration of Maltese elites following the arrival of the Order of St John in 1530, and the formation of a new titled elite in the eighteenth century. In the course of addressing the second set of questions, this paper puts forward the hypothesis that {{the increase in the number}} of titleholders in the eighteenth century was connected to the <b>contest</b> over <b>jurisdictions</b> and privileges between the magistracy and the inquisition. This paper offers a tour d'horizon of the existing historiography on these topics and draws on some examples from the copious source material that is available for further research. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s and early 1960 s, the elite world of {{institutional}} British science attempted {{to take control}} of the BBC’s management of science broadcasting. Delegations of scientists met BBC managers to propose an increased role for scientists in planning science broadcasts to a degree that threatened to compromise the BBC’s authority and autonomy. The culmination was a set of proposals to the Pilkington Committee in 1960, principally from the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science, under which a scientist-manager was to be appointed head of a unified science division in the BBC. BBC managers resisted these proposals. The outcome, in 1964, was a compromise giving the scientists little of what they wanted, and proving practically and strategically useful for the BBC. The article frames the story as a <b>contest</b> of <b>jurisdiction</b> between elite science and the BBC, and draws on scholarship relating to the social nature of authority and professions, and to the popularization of science. It shows the fundamentally different beliefs held by the scientists and the BBC about the purpose of science broadcasts and about the nature of the audience. The historical narrative is based on unpublished archive documents, and it contributes to the small but growing body of work on the historical background to the presentation of science in the broadcast media...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between mental disorder and criminality in Canada from the colonial period to the landmark 1992 Mental Disorder Amendments that followed the passing of Bill C- 30. The history of this relationship has been shaped by longstanding formal and informal systems of social regulation, by the <b>contests</b> of federal–provincial <b>jurisdiction,</b> by changing trends in the legal and psychiatric professions, and by amendments to the federal Criminal Code. A study of these longer-term features demonstrates {{that there has been}} no linear path of progress in Canada's response to mentally unwell offenders. Those caught in the web of crime and mental disorder have been cast and recast over the past 150 years by the changing dynamics of criminal law, psychiatry, and politics. A long historical perspective suggests how earlier and more contemporary struggles over mental disorder and criminality are connected, how these struggles are bound by historical circumstance, and how a few relatively progressive historical moments emerging from these struggles might be recovered, and theorized to advantage...|$|R

Ova Konvencija, poznata pod nazivom Rotterdamska pravila, sadržava, između ostalog, i odredbe o sudskoj nadležnosti za odlučivanje u postupcima protiv prijevoznika i pomorskog izvršitelja za naknadu štete nastale tijekom prijevoza robe. Radi se o iznimno važnom pitanju za međunarodni prijevoz i međunarodnu trgovinu uopće, o čemu svjedoči i činjenica da je upravo u pogledu odredaba o sudskoj nadležnosti bilo ponajviše prijepora tijekom stručnog rada na izradi konačnog teksta Rotterdamskih pravila. U ovome radu te se odredbe kritički analiziraju i uspoređuju s uređenjem istog pitanja u pravu Europske unije (osobito Uredbom 44 / 2001) kao i s općeprihvaćenim rješenjima sadržanima u formularnim ugovorima o prijevozu robe morem. U zaključku se daje ocjena uspjelosti uređenja pitanja sudske nadležnosti u Rotterdamskim pravilima te iznosi stajalište o utjecaju sadržaja tih odredaba na odluku pojedinih država da postanu stranka toga međunarodnog ugovora. For many years, the {{international}} maritime community has sought uniformity and harmonization of law regulating {{carriage of goods}} by sea. Historically, {{there have been several}} well known attempts at establishing uniform international law in this field, including: the Hague Rules (1924); the Hague/Visby Rules (1968); the Hamburg Rules (1978); and the International Multimodal Transportation Convention (1980), but none of these attempts has managed to achieve the global level of acceptance necessary for international uniformity. On 23 September 2009, sixteen countries signed new Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, known as “the Rotterdam Rules“. The Convention is designed to legislate not only for international maritime carriage of goods but also for international multimodal carriage of goods, where a maritime leg is provided for in the contract of carriage. It is best described as a “maritime plus” instrument. If entered into force, the Convention will significantly change the market position of maritime stakeholders, including shippers, carriers, freight forwarders and marine insurers. The Hague and Hague-Visby Rules do not deal with jurisdiction. The provisions of the Rotterdam Rules on this issue are based upon the corresponding provisions in the Hamburg Rules. These chapters were the subject of focused discussion, contrasting those in favour of including such provisions with those who preferred to leave the areas to domestic or other rules. The situation was further complicated by the European Commission 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the negotiations, since the EU have exclusive competence to negotiate on behalf of its Member State in respect of jurisdiction. A compromise solution was found, whereby the chapter on jurisdiction was made subject to an “opt-in” reservation: only those States that specifically make a declaration that they are to be bound by those chapters will be bound by them. Under the Rotterdam Rules, actions against the carrier may be brought in the following places situated in a Contracting State: the domicile of the carrier; the place of receipt agreed in the contract of carriage; the place of delivery agreed in the contract of carriage; the port where the goods are initially loaded on a ship; or the port where the goods are finally discharged from a ship. Alternatively, the new Convention permits proceedings to be brought in a court designated by an agreement between the shipper and the carrier. However, such a court will be exclusive only exceptionally. In fact, the exclusive choice of court agreement is effective only if contained in a volume contract. Should the claimant wish to file suit against the maritime performing party, the action must be filed in a competent court situated within the domicile of the maritime performing party, or the port where the goods were received or delivered by the maritime performing party or the port in which the maritime performing party performs its activities with respect to the goods. After a dispute has arisen, the parties to the dispute may agree to resolve it in any competent court (means a court in a Contracting State). A competent court, before which a defendant appears without <b>contesting</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in accordance with the rules of that court, has jurisdiction...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} concerns HIV/AIDS {{prevention and}} control in contemporary Vietnam, as {{an assemblage of}} Vietnamese Socialist governance, international NGO and US government mechanisms, and new biomedical regimes based on expert knowledges and international "best practices. " It maps the emergence of HIV/AIDS in Vietnam, {{the rise of the}} complex of state practices, spaces and discourses created to deal with it, the unfortunate entanglement of this apparatus with that set against "social evils," and the rendering of HIV/AIDS a biological marker of socio-moral contagion. It examines the deadly consequences of this entanglement, the authorities' subsequent attempts at disentanglement following shifting epidemiological, political and economic conditions and Vietnam's internationally acclaimed success against SARS. It marks the new forms of exclusions and inequalities in health this generated. Broadly, I argue there was a shift from an emphasis on "The People" to one on "The Human" as the object {{at the center of this}} HIV/AIDS prevention and control apparatus, along with a shift from external enforcement (by authorities) to internal adherence (by oneself, to techno-scientific and expert discourses and practices). With the shift from enforcement (a present and past-oriented mode) to adherence (a mode that moves from the present forward), the near future has now become a target of and problem for government. As new and massively increased resources for HIV/AIDS prevention and control become available new <b>contests</b> over <b>jurisdiction</b> and precedence are breaking out between sectors of this apparatus dedicated to public security and health and human services, as well as central and local health authorities. Under these conditions new life-saving and harm-reduction programs effected and protected through and under interpersonal and political arrangements often classified in the foreign and domestic press as "corruption" are forcing reexamination of the ethical status of these practices. I argue that following my informants' stress on the "uses" of corruption, rather than their naming, a more nuanced portrait of contemporary power relations and constraints emerges, one that sheds light on the transformation, in these milieu, of the emerging ethical terrain of HIV/AIDS prevention and control in Vietnam. Third, I examine PEPFAR (US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), investigating the friction at the meeting points between a pair of incongruous bureaucracies, their effect on local financial, facility and human resource management, and the promotion of a certain regime of accounting and audit practices. These new technologies represent a curious marriage of neoliberal rationalities and humanitarian ethics that operate by refiguring political problems in other domains as non-ideological and non-political health problems, within the framework of what I term an "ethics of an economy of virtue. " Here I track the penetration of neoliberal logics and calculations into the domain of humanitarian intervention. Truth games effected through the deployment of statistics, images, anecdotes and narratives collapse a broad range of meanings upon the subjected bodies of the ill, bodies and stories meant to stand in not only for those innumerable "others like them," but the exchangeable, comparable virtue of the deployer. The final chapter is a fleshing out of the framework I present in the preceding chapters, using the parallel stories of two exemplary figures; a famous and controversial Saigon social worker, and a relatively unknown young woman, a homeless heroin addict and "graduate" of the Vietnamese carceral regime. These stories highlight the benefits, constraints and vulnerabilities actors working on HIV/AIDS in Vietnam within an economy of virtue face, as well as enable us to trace certain turning points in their lives against the background of the minor history of HIV/AIDS in Vietnam that I have set out...|$|R
40|$|The World Wide Web {{technology}} {{was developed in}} the early nineties. Since then it has had a great impact on society, and its use has expanded beyond the research communities where it was first adopted. The theme for this thesis is the skills and professional knowledge necessary to create web sites. Three established professions have different approaches to the task: computer professionals, graphic designers and information professions. Some new job titles have also emerged for occupational groups creating web sites: web designers, webmasters and information architects. Discussions in newspapers and on Internet newsgroups show that there is no consensus on how web sites should be designed. This thesis explores how the task of creating web sites is interpreted in Norwegian educational institutions in 1999 / 2000. 12 case studies are conducted. In Norway, professional higher education is located in the university colleges. Established study programmes in computer science, graphic arts engineering, visual communication and information science are included in the study. Emerging private courses in web design, webmaster and information design are also included. Andrew Abbott's (1988) theory of the system of professions is used to analyse the rhetoric and strategies among the educational institutions. The central term in Abbott's theory is jurisdiction, which means the link between an occupation and its work. Each profession is bound to a set of tasks by ties of jurisdiction. Web technology is viewed as an external disturbance to the system of professions, opening new task areas of jurisdiction. According to the theory, environing professions and new groups <b>contest</b> for achieving <b>jurisdiction</b> over the new tasks. In this study, the environing professions are computer professions, graphic professions and information professions. New groups are web designers, webmasters and information designers. The tasks of professions are human problems amenable to expert service. Professional practice has three parts: (1) To diagnose, i. e. to classify the problem, (2) to infer, i. e. to reason about the problem, and (3) to treat, i. e. to take action on the problem. Each profession has a unique abstract knowledge system being taught in colleges and used in professional inference. A conclusion {{is that there is no}} unifying definition of the term web designer in the different courses being taught. A webmaster is easier to define, but the courses are nearly identical to traditional computer studies. Five different diagnoses to the problem of creating web sites have been identified in the case studies from the university colleges. The diagnosis reduces the new problem to a version of a profession's already secure jurisdiction. The different diagnoses are linked to very different abstract knowledge systems being taught, as can be seen in the curricula at the colleges. There are two main areas where the different study programmes differ: 1. Is the skill and knowledge of HTML and mark-up languages commodified in computer tools? 2. What is the best analogy to the web user interface...|$|R
