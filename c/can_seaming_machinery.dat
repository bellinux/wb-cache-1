40|$|In {{this work}} a machine vision system for {{inspection}} (VSI) is presented whose capabilities {{are able to}} detect seaming defects in metal cans for fishing food. Conventional method for quality inspection of <b>seaming</b> for <b>cans,</b> and their main dimensional features, are firstly shown. Then, the structure and algorithms for VSI are proposed for this application. This VSI is currently mounted over a conveyor belt for onlinelin-process inspection of metal cans, in order to assure their conformance to the given seaming requirements by detecting malfunctions of closing machines and logistic process failures. 1. 1 <b>Can</b> <b>Seaming</b> Process In the <b>can</b> <b>seaming</b> process (Fig. I), a lid is mounted on the can body filled with ingredient, then body and lid are hel...|$|R

During the <b>can</b> <b>seaming</b> process, the seamer chuck holds the can while the rolls rotate around it.

5000|$|Since {{there are}} several {{parameters}} {{that can be used}} to judge seam quality, the FDA regulation specifies the most critical parameters: [...] "The most critical attributes to consider in judging the quality of the double seam are overlap and tightness (wrinkle). If one of the <b>can</b> <b>seam</b> measurements (i.e., body hook) is slightly beyond the specified guidelines but the rest of the seam is evaluated and the overlap and tightness (wrinkle) are within specified guidelines, then adjustments to the seamer can be made at the next scheduled shut-down. In this instance, the manufacturer should identify the out-of-guideline measurement and document they have evaluated the rest of the double seam, but did not find immediate corrective action necessary. However, if overlap measurement or tightness rating evaluation are below the minimum guidelines a resample from the questionable seaming station should be made. If the resample continues to show out-of-guideline measurements in overlap and/or wrinkle the machine should be stopped and adjusted." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Weld seam {{tracking}} {{is the key}} technology of industrial robot. It satisfies accuracy and real-time demand. This paper presents a robust recognition algorithm for weld seam images based on mathematical morphology. This algorithm used the morphological filtering for image enhancement at first, and then applied Otsu threshold segmentation in local. Besides, it implemented region filling and morphological thinning operation to get the segmented weld seam. Finally, the Hough transform was adopted to detect the straight lines from the weld image. The results prove that this method not only <b>can</b> detect the <b>seam</b> tracking in real-time, but also <b>can</b> identify weld <b>seam</b> automatically...|$|R

Although it is not imperative the investigator carry this equipment to each LACF inspection, {{it is very important that}} they know how to operate this equipment and read measurements from the micrometer, seam projector or seam scope. It is also important that the investigator know how to determine the tightness or wrinkle rating of the cover hook. Knowledge of the procedures used to perform double seam teardown examination are essential to evaluating the firm's knowledge and ability to do this examination.
