The copper plating technology reduced and simplified the process steps for fabricating through silicon vias (TSVs) and TSHs. The highly selectivity of <b>copper</b> <b>fill</b> in the TSHs also reduced the manufacture cost of 3 D chip stacking packaging, because the copper plating technology reduced the loading of a post-copper chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) {{and did not}} need a post-thermal annealing treatment.

This study determined the optimal DB concentration for achieving the best filling performance. The electrochemical behavior of DB and its interaction with other additives, such as a suppressor and an accelerator were characterized using galvanostatic measurements. These electrochemical analyses helped explaining the filling mechanism of the plating formula containing the DB. Various surface morphologies and the crystalline orientation of the plated copper films caused by different DB concentrations were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The corresponding chemical activity of the surface atoms of the plated copper films caused by different DB concentrations was characterized using a test of etching rate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In the {{semiconductor}} industry, electroless processes have been researched for various applications {{over the last}} decade. Examples of these applications include electroless CoWP as a copper-capping layer, electroless NiP/Au or NiP/Pd as bond bad capping layers, and electroless nickel and <b>copper</b> <b>fill</b> for through-silicon vias (TSVs) [1, 2, 3]. This paper discusses the use of NiP/Pd as bond pad copper-capping layers. Because the electroless process is relatively new to this application, it has a steep learning curve. One issue with copper and nickel films is corrosion during electroless processes, which {{is not only a}} yield detractor but also a reliability concern. Two types of corrosion mechanisms have been identified during electroless processes: (1) corrosion of copper substrate and (2) corrosion of electroless nickel. Fig. 1 shows the copper film corrosion while nickel film is intact. Fig 2 shows the electroless nickel corrosion while copper substrate is intact. In both cases, corrosion byproducts accumulate at the top of bond pad surface, as shown in Fig. 3. The corrosion residue causes wire bond no-stick fails in subsequent processes. Fig. 4 shows a wafer map of die that failed wire bonding. This paper discusses film surface analysis, mechanisms of both corrosion types and impact on wire bonding...|$|E
40|$|The {{outlined}} investigations {{represent a}} new systematic approach for {{the characterization of}} the copper annealing behavior in TSVs. In the center of interest are the changes in material behavior caused by bath chemistry compositions and deposition parameters during the ECD <b>copper</b> <b>fill.</b> In addition the effects on annealing behavior with or without Cu overburden are evaluated. Therefore, two bath chemistries {{were used for the}} Cu fill of one TSV test die layout. Moreover, half of the die samples underwent overburden CMP. The resulting four test die groups underwent annealing at identical conditions. The subsequent characterization featured protrusion, warpage and EBSD measurements. Results show a direct link of crystallographic defect reductions towards the tendency of developing Cu protrusion. Also deviations in warpage and crystal structure development for annealing with or without Cu overburden are presented. In conclusion the outlined investigation gains information how the Cu crystal structure develops in TSVs during annealing and links this behavior to thermo-mechanical effects like protrusion and warpage. This paper demonstrates that this behavior is dependent on the applied bath chemistry and that the presence of an overburden layer also has an influence. Deductions for an improved TSV manufacturing process can be derived from the achieved results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. New {{copper plating}} bath chemisties are being {{developed}} to meet the emerging need of plating copper into sub-micron features on semiconductor wafers. These chemistries are {{designed to provide a}} fast, efficient, fill for even the most challenging wafer terrain. It has been found that maintaining the concentration of the additives in these plating baths at certain levels is critical to the performance of the bath. Plating technology for semiconductor applications requires rigid bath control and disciplined methodology. Establishing correlations between what is found in the plated film and bath chemistry control parameters is fundamental in producing interconnects that are consistent and reliable. To establish these correlations, {{it is important to have}} a clear understanding of the chemical composition of the bath. It is theorized that the "suppressor " bath components help moderate the deposition rate of the <b>copper</b> <b>fill</b> and the "leveler " additives improve the topology of the copper overfill. Too much or too little of these components in the bath can be detrimental to the quality of the copper deposition and may result in "fill failure " leading to a higher than necessary scrap rate for the wafers. Indirect bath measurements, such as Cyclic Voltammetric Stripping (CVS), tell an incomplete story as these techniques only measures the combined effect of the additives and by-products on the plating quality. High Performance Liquid (HPLC) and Ion Chromatography are analytical techniques which provide important information on the concentration, chemical balance and trend measurement of major constituents such as additives, brighteners, boosters, stabilizers, carriers, levelers, inhibitors, accelerators, transition metals, metal complexes and contaminants in the plating bath. This information provides for improved device quality, reduced scrap rate and reduced costs of bath maintenance. This, however, is not the end of the story. In addition to additives, copper plating baths also contain process byproducts. This paper will cover the development of analytical methods using metal free liquid chromatography to quantify the components and any related by-products found in copper plating baths used for small-featured semiconductors. ...|$|E

In this paper, we present a method of fabricating aligned CNT/copper composites on the silicon substrates and in the silicon dioxide vias. Electrical measurement of the CNT/copper composite vias demonstrates much lower electrical resistance than that of vias with CNT only. Thermal characterization shows the thermal resistance decreased by increasing copper loading into the CNT films. The electroplated <b>copper</b> <b>fills</b> the voids between the neighboring nanotubes. The improvement of the electrical and thermal conductance is resulted from the decreased porosity of the asgrown CNTs.

[1 ~ 4] Defects such as voids or seams are found frequently in high-aspect ratio vias when the experimental parameters were not optimized.

40|$|Semiconductor {{integration}} {{technology has}} been widely spread in two-dimensional applicationsover the past three decades. This wide application has been employed {{not only in the}} field of theelectronics industries but also in a lot of related industries such as optoelectronics, bioelectronics,medical systems, electronics analysis, computer systems, military systems, satellite systems,submarine systems, and so on. From the consumer area to ultra-high-end products and militaryusage, almost all industrial products incorporate semiconductor devices. One significant reason forthis rapid progress is the good scalability of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. However,the scale of materials is limited. Right now, the process capability has arrived at 22 nm using copperinterconnects. Therefore, the development of MOS devices may not follow the Moore law, becausethe Moore law is based on the consideration of 2 -dimensional packaging of IC chip. In order to bring out high performance from VLSI chips while restricting their powerconsumption, there are two approaches. One is to reconsider circuits and system architecture fromview point of power consumption. Another is to construct three-dimensional VLSI structure. Inrecent devices, the signal propagation delay is mainly determined by wiring length and pincapacitance. Three-dimensional very large-scale integration (3 D-VLSI) is the one solution toimprove performance without increase of power consumption. One of the key issues to realize 3 D-VLSI is the method of information transfer and the supply of electric power among stackedchips. There are many methods to connect interchip, such as wire-bonding, edge connect, capacitiveor inductive coupling method, and direct contact using through-silicon via (TSV). According to the current reports, TSV seems to be a good candidate to solve the requirement ofmultifunction, high memory capacity, low power consumption and so on. This process technologyneeds absolutely professional electrochemical deposition (ECD) technique. In this work, wepropose three professional ECD techniques, including three specific copper plating formulas, whichcan meet the current demand for TSV metallization. These three copper ECD formulas can result inbottom-up filling of TSV in a flat plane mode, highly selective <b>copper</b> <b>fill,</b> and direct filling ofthrough silicon hole (TSH). Once these copper ECD techniques are successfully developed, thesteps and cost of the TSV process can be significantly reduced. This plan will take two years tocome true, in which electrochemical analyses, in situ electrochemical scanning tunnelingmicroscopy (EC-STM), electrode kinetics, formulation of copper plating, and processesdevelopment of TSV will be employed in this plan.

40|$|As the {{semiconductor}} industries are moving beyond 22 nm node technology, the currently used stacked Ta/TaN diffusion barrier including a copper seed {{will be unable}} to fulfill the requirements for the future technologies. Due to its low resistivity and ability to perform galvanic <b>copper</b> <b>fill</b> without a seed layer, ruthenium (Ru) has emerged as a potential copper diffusion barrier. However, its crystallization and columnar nanostructure have been the main cause of barrier failures even at low processing temperatures (300 oC - 350 oC). In this study, we have proposed and evaluated three different strategies to improve the performance of the ultrathin Ru film as a diffusion barrier for copper. The first study focused on shallow surface plasma irradiation/amorphization and nitridation of 5 nm Ru films. Systematic studies of amorphization and nitrogen incorporation versus sample bias were performed. XPS, XRD and RBS were used to determine the physico-chemical, crystallization and barrier efficiency of the plasma modified Ru barrier. The nitrogen plasma surface irradiation of Ru films at substrate bias voltage of - 350 V showed an improved barrier performance up to 400 oC annealing temperatures. The barrier barely started failing at 450 oC due mainly to nitrogen instability. The second study involved only amorphization of the Ru thin film without any nitrogen incorporation. A low energy ion beam irradiation/amorphization on Ru thin film was carried out by using 60 KeV carbon ions with different irradiation doses. The irradiation energy was chosen high enough so that the irradiation ions pass through the whole Ru thin film and stop in the SiO 2 /Si support substrate. The C-ion fluence of 5 × 1016 atoms/cm 2 at 60 KeV made the Ru film near amorphous without changing its composition. XRD and RBS were used to determine the relationship between crystallization and barrier efficiency of the carbon irradiated Ru barrier. The amorphized Ru film showed an improved barrier performance up to 400 oC annealing temperatures similar to the plasma nitrided Ru films. The barrier barely began to fail at 450 oC due mainly to crystallization. The third study focused on a study of Al doping of nitrided Ru thin films and their crystallinity with the aim of obtaining a completely amorphous Ru based barrier and stable nitridation. The addition of 4 % Al and 14 % of nitrogen in Ru produced a near amorphous film. Nitrogen in the film remained stable until the annealing temperature of 450 oC for 10 min in N 2 atmosphere. Crystallization growth of the film was inhibited until 450 oC. At 500 oC, the crystallization of the Ru films barely started, but the degree of its crystallization is minimal. The Ru-Al-N film was demonstrated to be an effective diffusion barrier for copper until the annealing temperature of 450 oC and began to fail at 500 oC. The Al doping was shown to stabilize the nitrogen in the Ru thin film barrier inhibiting its crystallization and leading to improved diffusion barrier performance and a gain in processing temperatures of 150 oC - 200 oC over the as prepared pure Ru thin film barriers...|$|E

As interposer backside metallization, appropriate I/O terminals and seal ring structures were deposited by semi-additive Au and Au+Sn electro plating.

Subsequently, the I/O terminal pads of the interposer were stud bumped and finally more than 5000 quartz resonator components were assembled onto each interposer wafer by Au-Au direct metal bonding.

Aluminum and steel rods as thermal enhancer were inserted {{in the middle of}} paraffin wax of each tube for configurations three and four respectively. Second configuration provided useful heat for about 1. 5 hours after the sunset compared to first configuration. Configurations three and four provided useful heat for about 2 hours after the sunset. The maximum efficiency of about 96 % was achieved using configuration three (i. e. using Aluminum rods in the middle of <b>copper</b> tubes <b>filled</b> with paraffin wax) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an {{analytical}} procedure is presented, how {{to predict the}} AC resistance of litz-wire windings considering air gap fringing fields. For this purpose, an equivalent complex permeability model is derived for hexagonally packed wires. It is shown, how the real- {{as well as the}} imaginary part of the complex permeability can be determined with the <b>copper</b> <b>filling</b> factor as a parameter. An analytical 2 D model is deduced to describe the air gap fringing fields of gapped inductors. Accordingly, the proximity losses of the litz-wire winding are determined correctly and the AC resistance of practical inductors can be predicted over a wide frequency range with high accuracy. This offers the opportunity to optimize such components. Finally, the influence of various parameters on the copper losses is investigated and verified by means of experimental data drawn from impedanc...|$|R
40|$|Part 11 : Electrical MachinesInternational audienceThe {{first step}} in {{transformer}} design optimization is to solve a non-linear optimization task. Here, not only the physical and technological requirements, but the economic aspects are also considered. Large number of optimization algorithms {{have been developed to}} solve this task. These methods result the optimal electrical parameters and the shape of the core and winding geometry. Most of them model the windings by their <b>copper</b> <b>filling</b> factors. Therefore the transformer designer’s next task, to find out the detailed winding arrangement, which fits to the optimization results. However, in the case of large power transformers, the calculation of some parameters like: winding gradients, short-circuit stresses etc., needs the knowledge of the exact wire dimensions and winding arrangement. Therefore, an other optimization task should be solved. This paper shows how this sub-problem can be formulated and solved as a generalized geometric program...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The reflow {{characteristics}} of copper, {{which is expected}} to be used as interconnection materials in the next generation semiconductor devices, were investigated. Copper films were deposited on a hole and trench pattern by metal organic chemical vapor deposition(MOCVD) and annealed in oxygen ambient with the annealing temperatures ranging from 350 and 550. Copper films were reflowed into the pattern upon the annealing temperature higher than 450 in oxygen ambient. It is considered that the reflow takes place as the heat generated by the oxidation of copper liquefies the copper film partly and the liquid state of <b>copper</b> <b>fills</b> the patterns for minimizing the surface energy and the potential energy. Copper oxide layer formed on the surface copper films were removed to some extent by the reduction effect of hydrogen gas. The resistivity of copper films rapidly increased at an annealing temperature of 550 due to the copper agglomeration...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{magnetron}} sputtering {{is not able}} to fill trenches and vias with aluminum or copper completely. This is due to the broad angle distribution of the incoming particles. Strong self-shadowing and noncoformal film growth lead to void creation in trenches and vias with aspect ratios even below one. A narrow angle distribution can be reached, when the particles are fully ionized. The High Current pulsed Arc (HCA) technique, developed at the IWS was succesfully used for void free trench and via <b>filling</b> in <b>copper</b> and aluminium based metallization systems. The structure is scaled down to 0. 5 5 m and the aspect ratio is coming up to about 2. 5. The promising development of this deposition method in the last years opens the way for ist application in microelectronics. <b>Copper</b> <b>filling</b> of trenches with aspect ratio of about three and a highly conformal thin film growth will be demonstrated...|$|R
5000|$|One {{challenge}} for high density interconnect board development, is to fabricate reliable microvias, especially for stacked microvias, without resulting in incomplete filling, dimples, or voids in the copper plating process. The authors of [...] have been investigating {{the risk of}} microvias in terms of voids and other defects using both experimental testing and finite element analysis. They found that incomplete <b>copper</b> <b>filling</b> increases the stress levels in microvias and hence decreases microvia fatigue life. As for voids, different voiding conditions, such as different void sizes, shapes, and locations result in different effects on microvia reliability. Small voids of a spherical shape lightly increase the microvia fatigue life, but extreme voiding conditions greatly reduce the duration of microvias. This team is currently developing a qualification method that the electronics industry can use to assess the risks with using an HDI circuit board that employs microvias.|$|R
