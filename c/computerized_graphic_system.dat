This paper briefly discusses the importance of computer graphics in research; the central <b>graphics</b> <b>system</b> in terms of systems, software, and hardware requirements; the application of computer graphics to graphic arts, {{discussed in terms of}} the requirements for a graphic arts workstation; and the problems encountered in applying computer graphics to the graphic arts.

40|$|<b>Graphics</b> <b>Systems</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} complex over the last years. Computer Graphics standards provide the means to implement portable graphics applications. However, the goals aimed {{by the use of}} graphics standards cannot be achieved, unless these standards are not themselves lent to certification. Methods and tools for testing <b>graphics</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed, such as the GKS conformance testing package. Current test tools rely heavily on operator judgement of pictorial output produced by implementations being tested. Current <b>graphics</b> <b>systems</b> are becoming richer in functionality, thus rendering the test task increasingly more difficult, especially when specifying test pictures. Automated test methods should be devised, to provide results more precise than human judgement in a more efficient way. On the other hand, <b>graphics</b> <b>systems</b> should provide functions to assist in automatic testing, in order to prevent the need for special devices such as cameras and image processing equi pment. This paper focuses on the issues raised by automatic testing of <b>graphics</b> <b>systems.</b> Standard components are studied with regard to their ability to being tested. Recent technologies and their application to automatic testing are discussed. The paper attempts to highlight the extent to which current systems can be tested automatically. (AGD...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{object-oriented}} {{design for a}} general-purpose interactive <b>graphics</b> <b>system.</b> By analysing features provided by many <b>graphics</b> <b>systems,</b> we identify object-oriented mechanisms best suited to implementing them, thus identifying mechanisms best suited to building <b>graphics</b> <b>systems</b> and applications. These mechanisms include dynamic, per object inheritance and multiple dispatch of methods. We claim the design is more general, simpler and more flexible than existing <b>graphics</b> <b>systems</b> since it uses fewer, simpler mechanisms to provide greater functionality. 1 Why Isn't Graphics Object-Oriented? One of the first examples used in teaching object-oriented programming is a MacDraw-like drawing program.
