Williams was inspired by Winters's ingenuity, realizing, he said, [...] "that anything is possible, that anything is funny He gave me {{the idea that it}} can be free-form, that you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of things pretty easily." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard A. Russell, Deputy Assistant Director of National Intelligence for Information Sharing Customer Outreach (ISCO) said it {{was created}} so [...] "analysts in {{different}} agencies that work X or Y <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> see what other people are doing on subject X or Y and actually add in their two cents worth ... or documents that they have. ... What we're after here is 'decision superiority', not 'information superiority'. â€¦We have to get inside the decision cycle of the enemy.

2500|$|Rick Santorum, who {{was enjoying}} {{a surge in}} the polls {{following}} his narrow second-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses, clashed with Mitt Romney over comments he had made that the country didn't need a CEO or manager as President. Santorum said, [...] "We need a leader... someone who, has the experience {{to go out and}} be the commander-in-chief... The commander-in-chief of this country isn't a CEO. It's someone who has to lead... being the president is not a CEO... You've got to lead and inspire." [...] Romney responded, [...] "I think people who spend their life in Washington don't understand what happens out in the real economy. They think that people who start businesses are just managers. The chance to lead in free enterprise is extraordinarily critical to also being able to lead a state, like I led in Massachusetts and, by the way, lead the Olympics. My experience is in leadership." [...] Newt Gingrich then criticised Romney's record at Bain Capital, saying [...] "I'm very much for free enterprise... I'm not nearly as enamored of a Wall Street model where you can flip companies, you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> have leveraged buyouts, you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers." [...] Romney replied, [...] "I'm not surprised to have The New York Times try and put free enterprise on trial. I'm not surprised to have the Obama administration do that, either. It's a little surprising from my colleagues on this stage." ...|$|E

The two {{officers}} can have the tent that Le Boeuf gave up yesterday. You can put a sentry there, but they <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out as they like. There is no fear of their trying to escape; for, if they once went outside the lines of the regulars, the Indians and Canadians would make short work of them." ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{never could}} settle it before, because always when I called at the Foreign Office in Vienna {{to talk about}} it, there wasn't anybody at home, {{and that is not}} a place where you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> see for {{yourself}} whether it is a mistake or not, because the person who takes care of the front door there is of a size that discourages liberty of action and the free spirit of investigation.

There is a very close watch kept over the prisoners, but friends of the guards <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out without trouble, except that on leaving they have to be accompanied by the guard at the door, so as to be sure that no one is passing out in disguise. She says her brother is good-natured but very fond of money. He is always talking of retiring and settling down in a farm in Brittany, where he comes from, and she thinks that if he thought he could gain enough to do this he would be ready to run some risk, for he hates the terrible things that are being done now." ...|$|E

What do you know about money? What is poverty to you, is splendour to the hardy son of the humble apothecary. You can't live without an establishment, and your houses in town and country. A snug little house somewhere off Belgravia, a brougham for my wife, a decent cook, and a fair bottle of wine for my friends at home sometimes; these simple necessaries suffice for me, my Foker." [...] And here Pendennis began to look more serious. Without bantering further, Pen continued, [...] "I've rather serious thoughts of settling and marrying. No man can get on in the world without some money at his back. You must have a certain stake to begin with, before you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> play the great game. Who knows that I'm not going to try, old fellow? Worse men than I have won at it. And as I have not got enough capital from my fathers, I must get some by my wife--that's all." ...|$|E
60|$|At first, {{the other}} {{partners}} had not objected to this ticketing, as {{the practice is}} now common, and there is at first sight an apparent honesty about it which has its seduction. A lady seeing 21s. 7d. marked on a mantle in the window, is able to contemplate the desired piece of goods and to compare it, in silent leisure, with her finances. She can use all her power of eye, but, as a compensation to the shopkeeper, is debarred from the power of touch; and then, having satisfied herself as {{to the value of}} the thing inspected, she <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> buy without delay or trouble to the vendor. But it has been found by practice that so true are the eyes of ladies that it is useless to expose in shop-windows articles which are not good of their kind, and cheap at the price named. To attract customers in this way, real bargains must be exhibited; and when this is done, ladies take advantage of the unwary tradesman, and unintended sacrifices are made. George Robinson soon perceived this, and suggested that the ticketing should be abandoned. Jones, however, persevered, observing that he knew how to remedy the evil inherent in the system. Hence difficulties arose, and, ultimately, disgrace, which was very injurious to the Firm, and went near to break the heart of Mr. Brown.|$|E
6000|$|Forgive the {{constant}} pressure which has delayed {{the expression of}} my gratitude for your charming, vivid, pictorial report of--well, of everything. It was most kind of you to paddle again over to Rye to minister to my anxieties. You both assuage and encourage them--but with {{the right thing for}} each. I am content enough with the bathroom--but hopeless about the garden, which I don't know what to do with, and shall never, never know. I am densely ignorant--only just barely know dahlias from mignonette--and shall never be able to work it in any way. So I shan't try--but remain gardenless--only go in for a lawn; which requires mere brute force--no intellect! For the rest I shall do decently, perhaps--so far as one can do for two-and-ninepence. I shall have nothing really [...] "good"--only the humblest old fifth-hand, 50th hand, mahogany and brass. I have collected a handful of feeble relics--but I fear the small desert will too cruelly interspace them. Well, speriamo. I'm very sorry to say that getting down before Saturday has proved only the fondest of many delusions. The whole place has to be mattinged before the rickety mahogany <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> the end of that--or, for aught I know, the beginning--is not yet. I have but just received the [...] "estimate" [...] for the (humblest) window-curtains (two tiers, on the windows, instead of blinds: white for downstairs etc., greeny-blue for up, if you like details,) and the [...] "figure" [...] leaves me prostrate. Oh, what a tangled web we weave!--Still, I hope you, dear lady, have a nice tangled one of some sort to occupy you such a day as this. I think of you, on the high style of your castled steep, with tender compassion. I scarce flatter myself you will in the hereafter again haunt the neighbourhood; but if you ever do, I gloat over the idea of making up for the shame of your having gone forth tea-less and toast-less from any door of mine. I wish that, within it--my door--we might discuss still weightier things. Of an ordinary--a normal--year, I hope always to be there in May.|$|E
5000|$|He {{specifically}} criticized Mayor Bill de Blasio's municipal ID {{program as}} a major contributing factor. [...] "He gave out ID cards, de Blasio. That's {{in lieu of a}} driver's license, but you can use it for anything. But they didn't vet people to see who they really are. Anybody <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there <b>and</b> say, 'I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card.' It's absurd. There is a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud ... This is why I get more conservative as I get older", Schulkin said in the tape.|$|R
