40|$|Combined petrographic, {{structural}} and geochronological {{study of the}} Malashan dome, one of the North Himalayan gneiss domes, reveals that it is cored by a Miocene granite, the Malashan granite, that intruded into the Jurassic sedimentary rocks of Tethys Himalaya. Two other granites {{in the area are}} referred to as the Paiku and Cuobu granites. New zircon SHRIMP U-Pb and muscovite and biotite 40 Ar- 39 Ar dating show that the Paiku granite was emplaced during 22. 2 – 16. 2 Ma (average 19. 3 ± 3. 9 Ma) and cooled rapidly to 350 – 400 °C at around 15. 9 Ma. Whole-rock granite chemistry suggests the original granitic magma may have formed by muscovite dehydration melting of a protolith chemically similar to the High Himalayan Crystalline Sequence. Abundant calcareous metasedimentary rocks and minor garnet-staurolite-biotite-muscovite ± andalusite schists record contact metamorphism by three granites that intruded intermittently into the Jurassic sediments between 18. 5 and 15. 3 Ma. Two stages of widespread penetrative ductile deformation, D 1 and D 2, can be defined. Microstructural studies of metapelites combined with geothermobarometry and pseudosection analyses yield P–T conditions of 4. 8 ± 0. 8 kbar at 550 ± 50 °C during a non-deformational stage between D 1 and D 2, and 3. 1 – 4. 1 kbar at 530 – 575 °C during syn- to post-D 2. The pressure estimates for the syn- to post-D 2 growth of andalusite suggest relatively shallow (depth of ∼ 15. 2 km) extensional ductile deformation that took place within a shear zone of the South Tibetan Detachment System. Close temporal association between intrusion of the Malashan granite and onset of D 2 suggests extension may have been triggered by the intrusion of the Malashan granite.
