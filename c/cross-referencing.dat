Four years later, she persuaded the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council to {{establish}} the Nuclear Data Project (NDP), an organization with special responsibility for gathering and disseminating nuclear data, under her leadership. The NDP moved to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1964, but Way remained its head until 1968. Beginning in 1964, the NDP published a journal, Nuclear Data Sheets, to disseminate the information that the NDP had gathered. This was joined the following year by a second journal, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables. She also persuaded the editors of Nuclear Physics to add keywords to the subject headings of articles to facilitate <b>cross-referencing.</b>|$|E

40|$|State {{and federal}} law often <b>cross-reference</b> {{each other to}} provide a rule of decision. The {{difficulties}} attendant to these <b>cross-referenced</b> schemes are brought to the fore most clearly when a federal court must determine whether such bodies of law create federal question jurisdiction. Indeed, the federal courts have issued scores of seemingly inconsistent opinions on these cross-referential cases. In this Article, I offer an ordering principle for these apparently varied, cross-referential jurisdictional cases. I argue that the federal courts only take federal question jurisdiction over <b>cross-referenced</b> claims when they, from a departmental perspective, maintain declaratory authority over the <b>cross-referenced</b> law. I defend this thesis by extensively exploring <b>cross-referenced</b> regimes in numerous modes. I also contend that this cross-referential ordering principle offers significant insights {{into the nature of}} federal question claims more generally. Namely, I assert that, contrary to the predominant view, the federal courts do no...|$|R

25|$|West Yorkshire Police were criticised {{for being}} inadequately {{prepared}} {{for an investigation}} on this scale. It {{was one of the}} largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making <b>cross-referencing</b> difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.|$|E

These were addressed to the universities by papal letters {{at the beginning of}} each collection, and these texts became textbooks for aspiring canon lawyers. In 1582 a compilation was made of the Decretum, Extra, the Sext, the Clementines and the Extravagantes (that is, the decretals of the popes from Pope John XXII to Pope Sixtus IV).|$|E

500|$|John Eliot Gardiner, who {{conducted}} the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir in 2000, evaluated the work, connected to Bach's first cantata for Leipzig: this cantata is clearly {{more than just a}} sequel to the previous Sunday's ...together they form a diptych revealing a thematic continuity extended over two weeks, with plentiful <b>cross-referencing</b> between the two set Gospels and Epistles beyond the obvious parallels between the injunction to give charitably to the hungry (BWV 75) and of brotherly love manifested in action (BWV 76). He described the works as featuring [...] "a characteristically Lutheran interpretation" [...] of the First Epistle of John. He also noted the depth of metaphorical uses of [...] "eating and drinking", highlighting [...] "the rich man's table, from which Lazarus tried to gather fallen crumbs (BWV 75), standing in opposition to the [...] "great supper" [...] and God's invitation through Christ to the banquet of eternal life (BWV 76)". Summarising both pieces, Gardiner wrote: evidently a lot of thought and pre-planning had gone on while Bach was still in Köthen, as well as discussions with his unknown librettist and possibly with representatives of the Leipzig clergy, before he could set the style, tone and narrative shaping of these two impressive works.|$|E

[...] Complete references for these two bibliographies may be found below in the Bibliography section. [...] The Schilpp numbers are used for <b>cross-referencing</b> in the Notes (the final column of each table), since they cover a greater time period of Einstein's life at present.

Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter also praised the film's look, and felt [...] "A well-matched ensemble rises {{to the challenge of}} launching a heroic origin film with distinctive style, abundant thrills and no shortage of humor." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin said, [...] "A brand new summer family blockbuster this may be, but it plays by old, half-forgotten rules; trimming out the clutter and <b>cross-referencing</b> for snappy, streamlined, Saturday-cartoon fun". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind, in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes this side of the Mos Eisley Cantina." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "While Guardians takes you down one after another crazy narrative turn, it also pulls you into – and, for the most part, keeps you in – a fully realized other world." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "Guardians of the Galaxy is a late summer treat — a mostly lighthearted and self-referential comic-book movie with loads of whiz-bang action, some laugh-out-loud moments and a couple of surprisingly beautiful and touching scenes as well," [...] calling it [...] "a refreshing confection of entertainment."

500|$|William III's {{birthday}} fell on 4November, and for orthodox Whigs the {{two days}} therefore became an important double anniversary. [...] William ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5November be amended to include thanks for his [...] "happy arrival" [...] and [...] "the Deliverance of our Church and Nation". In the 1690s he re-established Protestant rule in Ireland, and the Fifth, occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners, was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations. [...] From the 19th century, 5November celebrations there became sectarian in nature. [...] Its celebration in Northern Ireland remains controversial, unlike in Scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities. [...] In England though, as one of 49official holidays, for the ruling class 5November became overshadowed by {{events such as the}} birthdays of Admiral Edward Vernon, or John Wilkes, and under George II and George III, {{with the exception of the}} Jacobite Rising of 1745, it was largely [...] "a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving". [...] For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. At some point, for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope. [...] Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day became Guy Fawkes Day. [...] In 1790 The Times reported instances of children [...] "...begging for money for Guy Faux", and a report of 4November 1802 described how [...] "a set of idle fellows... with some horrid figure dressed up as a Guy Faux" [...] were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as [...] "idle and disorderly persons". The Fifth became [...] "a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent <b>cross-referencing,</b> meaning all things to all men". [...] Lower class rioting continued, with reports in Lewes of annual rioting, intimidation of [...] "respectable householders" [...] and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels. [...] In Guildford, gangs of revellers who called themselves [...] "guys" [...] terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences. [...] Similar problems arose in Exeter, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations. [...] In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter Henry Phillpotts, a High Church Anglican and High Tory who opposed Parliamentary reform, and who was also suspected of being involved in [...] "creeping popery". [...] A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables.|$|E
