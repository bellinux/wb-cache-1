In this metric, five types of <b>coupling</b> that may exist between classes: control <b>coupling,</b> global data <b>coupling,</b> internal data <b>coupling,</b> data <b>coupling</b> and lexical content <b>coupling</b> are consider in computing CWCBO...|$|R

40|$|<b>Couple</b> {{relationship}} education (RE) {{usually is}} {{conceived of as}} relationship enhancement for currently satisfied <b>couples,</b> with a goal of helping <b>couples</b> sustain satisfaction. However, RE also might be useful as a brief, accessible intervention for <b>couples</b> with low satisfaction. Two studies were conducted that tested whether <b>couples</b> with low relationship satisfaction show meaningful gains after RE. Study 1 was a three-condition randomized controlled trial in which 182 <b>couples</b> {{were randomly assigned to}} RELATE with <b>Couple</b> CARE (RCC), a flexible delivery education program for <b>couples,</b> or one of two control conditions. <b>Couples</b> with initially low satisfaction receiving RCC showed a moderate increase in relationship satisfaction (d= 0. 50) relative to the control.

Study 2 was an uncontrolled trial of the <b>Couple</b> Coping Enhancement Training (CCET) administered to 119 <b>couples.</b> <b>Couples</b> receiving CCET that had initially low satisfaction showed a moderate increase in satisfaction (g=. 44), whereas initially highly satisfied <b>couples</b> showed no change.
