5|$|The brush <b>cuckoo</b> (Cacomantis variolosus), pallid <b>cuckoo</b> (C. pallidus), Horsfield's bronze <b>cuckoo</b> (Chrysococcyx basalis), and black-eared <b>cuckoo</b> (C.osculans) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites of the red-capped robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. Red-capped robins have been observed to be particularly aggressive in driving Horsfield's bronze cuckoos from their territories in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found parasitised there.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{left the}} <b>Cuckoo</b> Line at Hellingly Station. Although the railway joined the <b>Cuckoo</b> Line {{at both the}} {{northern}} and southern ends of the platform, virtually no through trains ran. Due to the arrangement of the lines at the junction with the <b>Cuckoo</b> Line, passenger trains to and from the hospital reversed south of Hellingly station.|$|E

5000|$|The nests of <b>cuckoos</b> vary in {{the same}} way as the {{breeding}} systems. The nests of malkohas and Asian ground <b>cuckoos</b> are shallow platforms of twigs, but those of coucals are globular or domed nests of grasses. The New World <b>cuckoos</b> build saucers or bowls in the case of the New World ground <b>cuckoos.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cercococcyx is a genus of <b>cuckoos</b> in the Cuculidae family, {{known as}} the long-tailed <b>cuckoos.</b> It {{contains}} the following species: ...|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} parasitic cuckoos, such as the common <b>cuckoo</b> (Cuculus canorus), but this is minimal because the common blackbird recognizes the adult of the parasitic species and its non-mimetic eggs. In the UK, only three nests of 59,770 examined (0.005%) contained <b>cuckoo</b> eggs. The introduced merula blackbird in New Zealand, where the <b>cuckoo</b> does not occur, has, over the past 130 years, {{lost the ability to}} recognize the adult common <b>cuckoo</b> but still rejects non-mimetic eggs.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{are known}} to be predated by green tree ants, which attack the newly hatched nestlings, and the pied currawong, which takes young from the nest. Nests are parasitized by the brush <b>cuckoo,</b> pallid <b>cuckoo,</b> and Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cuckoo</b> Line closed {{shortly after}} the Hospital Railway. Hellingly station closed to {{passengers}} on 14June 1965, and the line closed for goods traffic on 26April 1968. The station building complete with platform is now a private residence, and the <b>Cuckoo</b> Line trackbed was converted to the <b>Cuckoo</b> Trail long-distance footpath in 1990. Much of {{the route of the}} Hospital Railway is also now a footpath.|$|E
50|$|The genera Saurothera (the lizard <b>cuckoos)</b> and Hyetornis (chestnut-bellied and bay-breasted <b>cuckoos)</b> were lumped with Coccyzus by the American Ornithologists' Union in 2006.|$|R

40|$|Being an obligate parasite, {{juvenile}} common <b>cuckoos</b> Cuculus canorus {{are thought}} to reach their African wintering grounds from Palearctic breeding grounds without guidance from experienced conspecifics but {{this has not been}} documented. We used satellite tracking to study naïve migrating common <b>cuckoos.</b> Juvenile <b>cuckoos</b> left breeding sites in Finland moving slowly and less consistently directed than adult <b>cuckoos.</b> Migration of the juveniles (N = 5) was initiated later than adults (N = 20), was directed toward the southwest-significantly different from the initial southeast direction of adults-and included strikingly long Baltic Sea crossings (N = 3). After initial migration of juvenile <b>cuckoos</b> toward Poland, the migration direction changed and proceeded due south, directly toward the winter grounds, as revealed by a single tag transmitting until arrival in Northwest Angola where northern adult <b>cuckoos</b> regularly winter. Compared to adults, the juvenile travelled straighter and faster, potentially correcting for wind drift along the route. That both migration route and timing differed from adults indicates that juvenile <b>cuckoos</b> are able to reach proper wintering grounds independently, guided only by their innate migration programme...|$|R
5|$|The fan-tailed <b>cuckoo</b> (Cacomantis flabelliformis) and pallid <b>cuckoo</b> (C.pallidus) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites of the flame robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. One fan-tailed <b>cuckoo</b> was recorded ejecting baby robins before being raised by its foster parents. Other nest predators recorded include the grey shrikethrush (Colluricincla harmonica), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), and eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis).|$|E
5|$|The female pallid <b>cuckoo</b> (Cuculus pallidus) {{will lay}} {{eggs in a}} willie wagtail nest, {{although}} the hosts often recognise and eject the foreign eggs, so successful brood parasitism is rare. Parasitism by the fan-tailed (Cacomantis flabelliformis), brush, (C. variolosus), Horsfield's bronze (Chrysococcyx basalis), and shining bronze <b>cuckoo</b> (C. lucidus) has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} is {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} parasitic cuckoos, such as the common <b>cuckoo,</b> but this is very rare because the thrush recognizes the cuckoo's non-mimetic eggs. However, the song thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult <b>cuckoo</b> that is shown by the blackbird. The introduced birds in New Zealand, where the <b>cuckoo</b> does not occur, have, over the past 130years, retained the ability to recognise and reject non-mimetic eggs.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is known}} for its clay <b>cuckoos</b> — a special kind of ocarina. This is however a dying {{tradition}} as there is now only one producer of clay <b>cuckoos,</b> Sofia Nilsson. Ängelholm has the only orchestra of clay <b>cuckoos</b> in the whole world with which performed at the [...] "Allsång på Skansen" [...] in 2007.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cuckoos</b> have various {{strategies}} for getting their egg into a host nest. Different species use different strategies based on host defensive strategies. Female <b>cuckoos</b> have secretive and fast laying behaviors, {{but in some}} cases, males {{have been shown to}} lure host adults away from their nests so that the female can lay her egg in the nest. Some host species may directly try to prevent <b>cuckoos</b> laying eggs in their nest in the first place - birds whose nests are at high risk of cuckoo-contamination are known to 'mob' <b>cuckoos</b> to drive them out of the area. Parasitic <b>cuckoos</b> are grouped into gentes, with each gens specializing in a particular host. There is some evidence that the gentes are genetically different from one another.|$|R

5|$|The channel-billed <b>cuckoo</b> (Scythrops novaehollandiae) parasitizes pied currawong nests, laying eggs {{which are}} then raised by the unsuspecting foster parents. The eggs closely {{resemble}} those of the currawong hosts. Pied currawongs {{have been known to}} desert nests once cuckoos have visited, abandoning the existing currawong young, which die, and a channel-billed <b>cuckoo</b> has been recorded decapitating a currawong nestling. The brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus) and lace monitor (Varanus varius) have also been recorded taking nestlings.|$|E

50|$|Northern {{species such}} as yellow-billed and black-billed <b>cuckoos</b> are strong migrants, {{wintering}} in Central or South America, and occasionally wander to western Europe as rare vagrants, but the tropical Coccyzus <b>cuckoos</b> are mainly sedentary.|$|R

5|$|The common <b>cuckoo,</b> a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female <b>cuckoo</b> then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E
