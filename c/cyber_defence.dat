2500|$|Estonia–Russia {{relations}} remain tense. According to the Estonian Internal Security Service, Russian influence {{operations in}} Estonia form a complex system of financial, political, economic and espionage {{activities in the}} Republic of Estonia {{for the purposes of}} influencing Estonia's political and economic decisions in ways considered favourable to the Russian Federation and conducted under the sphere-of-influence doctrine known as near abroad. According to the Centre for Geopolitical Studies, the Russian information campaign, which the centre characterises as a [...] "real mud-throwing" [...] exercise, had provoked a split in Estonian society amongst Russian speakers, inciting some to riot over the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, a cenotaph commemorating the soldiers killed in World War II. Estonia regarded the 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia as an information operation intended to influence the decisions and actions of the Estonian government. While Russia denied any direct involvement in the attacks, hostile rhetoric in the media from the political elite influenced people to attack. Following the 2007 cyber-attacks, the NATO Cooperative <b>Cyber</b> <b>Defence</b> Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) was established in Tallinn.|$|E

40|$|Linked to the SCIPS {{tabletop}} gameSenior {{executives of}} critical national infrastructure facilities face competing requirements for investment budgets. Whilst {{the impact of}} a cyber attack upon such utilities is potentially catastrophic, the risks to continued operations from failing to upgrade ageing infrastructure, or not meeting mandated regulatory regimes, are considered higher given the demonstrable impact of such circumstances. As cyber attacks on critical national infrastructure remain low-frequency events, there is little to motivate business leaders to increase their investment in <b>cyber</b> <b>defences</b> to comparable levels.

40|$|With various views being posed on cybersecurity, {{this paper}} {{examines}} {{the proposition that}} cybersecurity risks are inflated. Due {{to the complexity of}} the cybersecurity environment, the risks will be dichotomised into two distinct categories—those posed by cybercrime, and those classified as cyber-warfare. In relation to cyber-crime, the paper examines the rise of cyber-crime, its costs, and the views of these factors by “alarmists” and “sceptics. ” In relation to cyber-war, the paper sets aside the emotive issue of the consequences and focuses on the likelihood of a catastrophic attack. The paper concludes that the risk of cyber-crime is real, but the sometimes mooted existential threat poses by cyber-war is inflated. The paper argues that it is important for <b>cyber</b> <b>defences</b> to improve in line with the risks, and to do this, researchers need to work across both categories of cybersecurity...|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Information Systems Security (MSc. ISS) at Strathmore UniversityCyber-attacks are continuously evolving {{to a great extent}} faster than <b>cyber</b> <b>defences.</b> The result is an ever-increasing frequency of attacks and the probability of success over time. To ensure employees are able to avoid or counter information security attacks directed at them and the organisation, it is necessary to carry out continuous security awareness and training, and, ensure this training is relevant to employees. Existing tools to assess information security skills among employees generally require the expertise of technical persons and are often not well tailored to an organisations’ specific needs. This study aims at developing a prototype which organisations can use to create information security skills assessments for their employees. Employees can then log in to the prototype at their convenient time and take the assessment. At the end of the assessment, each employee receives a percentage mark of their performance. Based on this percentage the employee is ranked as either beginner, intermediate or advanced and is also given a list of their weak areas based on questions they got wrong. The weak areas can be used to identify gaps and this information used to customise security awareness and training programs to meet employees’ needs. The research study adopted agile development methodology to design and develop a prototype to address identified gaps. The prototype was tested and validated to ensure it meets the intended goals and recorded impressive results...|$|R

40|$|Acquiring and {{exploiting}} {{information is}} key to remaining competitive in cyberspace. Security seesaws between informational advantage and vulnerability and America, as all other cyber-powers, must consistently tip the seesaw towards the former. Optimally managing the short term vulnerabilities of a cyber advantage will best produce a long-term net gain in security for the US. The Internet’s lax architecture favours offensive over defensive information seeking. Finding and buying zero-days supplements America’s security innovations to maintain a deployable cyber arsenal. Cyber deterrence is problematic so America relies on resilience to manage <b>cyber</b> attacks. <b>Defence</b> through attack absorption offers a better strategy than deterrence per se. Strategically sharing capabilities enables the United States to influence Five Eyes intelligence priorities while enabling its global cyber operations.

40|$|Unfortunately, cyber-attacks, {{which are}} the {{consequence}} of our increasing dependence on digital technology, is a phenomenon {{that we have to}} live with today. As technology becomes more advanced and complex, so have the types of malware that are used in these cyber-attacks. Currently, targeted cyber-attacks directed at CIIs such as financial institutions and telecom companies are on the rise. A particular group of malware known as APTs, which are used for targeted attacks, are very difficult to detect and prevent due to their sophisticated and stealthy nature. These malwares are able to attack and wreak havoc (in the targeted system) within a matter of seconds; this is very worrying because traditional <b>cyber</b> security <b>defence</b> systems cannot handle these attacks. The solution, as proposed by some in the industry, is the use of BDA systems. However, whilst it appears that BDA has achieved greater success at large companies, little is known about success at smaller companies. Also, there is scarcity of research addressing how BDA is deployed for the purpose of detecting and preventing cyber-attacks on CII. This research examines and discusses the effectiveness of the use of BDA for detecting cyber-attacks and also describes how such a system is deployed. To establish the effectiveness of using a BDA, a survey by questionnaire was conducted. The target audience of the survey were large corporations that were likely to use such systems for cyber security. The research concludes that a BDA system is indeed a powerful and effective tool, and currently the best method for protecting CIIs against the range of stealthy cyber-attacks. Also, a description of how such a system is deployed is abstracted into a model of meaningful practice...|$|R
