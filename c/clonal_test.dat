All tests were planted in 1996 at the Regional Forest Research Centre, Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, India. Height, stem straightness and axis persistence were measured in the family tests at 6 and 12 months of age. The height of the <b>clonal</b> <b>test</b> was measured at 12 months of age. Heritability estimates obtained were ca. 0. 3, 0. 2 and 0. 1 for height, stem straightness and axis persistence, respectively. Heritability estimates for height were reasonably consistent across the three tests; however, estimates for stem straightness and axis persistence were generally higher in the small test of locally selected families. Height and the other two traits are most probably either weakly correlated or uncorrelated, while stem straightness and axis persistence are positively correlated. Provenances spread across the range of natural- and land-race populations tested demonstrated good growth potential at Rajahmundry. However, natural provenances from Malaysia and Thailand generally showed superior growth, while the land-race populations often demonstrated superior stem straightness. Based on these results some aspects of a breeding strategy are outlined: (a) the establishment of three unrelated sublines; (b) an initial <b>clonal</b> <b>test</b> of all parents; and (c) wind-pollinated mating within clonal breeding orchards...|$|E

40|$|Risks, {{other than}} those {{associated}} with genetic uniformity and reduced genetic diversity, in implementing clonal forestry with Pinus radiata D. Don are often relatively predictable. They include technical and logistical difficulties in large-scale clonal propagation and clonal storage, and difficulties in accurate evaluation of clones. These problems not only impede capture of genetic gain, {{but they can also}} compromise the genetic diversity of deployed clonal material. Clones can be lost through failure in propagation and clonal storage systems. Such failure can occur early on, or it can occur through maturation in clonal storage during the <b>clonal</b> <b>testing</b> phase. As well as outright failure of clonal genotypes in clonal propagation and storage systems, general decline in clonal performance and unwanted intra-clonal variability can cause problems. The latter problem, which includes epigenetic effects and possible somaclonal variation, is sparsely reported but very insidious. Careful management of clonal material in large-scale propagation is therefore crucial, control of maturation being a key factor. <b>Clonal</b> <b>testing,</b> though costly, is important not only for testing the performance of individual genotypes, but also for <b>testing</b> <b>clonal</b> uniformity and the quality of clonal planting stock. <b>Clonal</b> <b>testing</b> can be complicated by genotype-environment interaction, and lack of clonal uniformity due to epigenetic effects, with imprecise evaluations compromising genetic gains.

Fusarium infected bulb lots have lower yields and cause significant problems for bulb export and cut flower production. Besides cultivation practices and chemical protection, resistant cultivars {{can play an important}} role in preventing this disease. To breed Fusarium resistant cultivars, screening and selection tests have to be developed and genetic variation in the host and in the pathogen determined. Information about the inheritance can be helpful in selecting the parents with the best breeding value for Fusarium resistance. <b>Clonal</b> screening <b>tests</b> under standardized conditions (e. g., concerning temperature, inoculum concentration and duration of the test) are developed for lily, narcissus, gladiolus and tulip using artificially infested soil or bulbs. By using a clone of a genotype, levels of resistance can be determined accurately. Severity of the disease is mainly observed by using disease ratings or the percentage of diseased bulbs. Partial resistance to Fusarium is present in all four crops. In Narcissus and Gladiolus even species with absolute resistance were identified. Resistant species are used in interspecific breeding programmes with commercial cultivars. Variation in virulence of Fusarium was investigated for f. sp. lilii, f. sp. gladioli and f. sp. narcissi.

Growth and wood properties had coefficients of additive genetic variation (CVA) and genotypic variation (CVG) ranging from 5 - 12 %. High age-age correlations for most studied traits were found, suggesting that there would be more gain per unit time by selecting trees at 3 to 4 years old than at greater ages. Growth traits showed consistent positive genetic correlations with stem straightness, but non-significant correlations with wood properties, except for a significant negative correlation between diameter and stiffness. Genotype by environment interaction was important for growth and stem straightness in clone trials across southern, central-north and northern Vietnam, but not important for a number of improved and unimproved seedlots compared in genetic gain trials across northern, central-north and central Vietnam. Predicted and realised gains for growth were substantial for seed orchard seedlots produced by the current breeding program, compared with natural-provenance and local commercial control seedlots. Good gains in growth and form traits and wood properties could be obtained from clonal selection, although the absence of strong, favourable correlations between growth and wood properties indicates that gains for individual traits would be reduced if a multi-trait improvement approach was adopted.

40|$|The use {{of forests}} of Eucalyptus {{has become more}} {{expressive}} in Brazil, mostly because of the excellent production in volumetric terms reached by them and the good characteristics of the obtained wood. The present work was developed to search the best plantations spacings for clonal forests of a interspecific hybrid of Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla, to maximize {{the production of the}} stem biomass per hectare. The data were made available by the company ‘Duratex Florestal’ and are proceeding from a <b>clonal</b> <b>test</b> at the age of 72 months. The used statistician delineation was the systematic one with continuous quantitative factor, 16 treatments and 40 repetitions, considering that the variation between the treatments was the spacing between the trees and the space between rows was constant with three meters. Along with this arrangement, the vital area per tree was 1, 50 m 2 (6. 667 trees per hectare) to 15, 75 m 2 (635 trees per hectare). The highest production volume and stem biomass per hectare occurred in spacing treatments with dense planting - 3 x 0, 50 m, in large spacings (from 9. 00 m² per plant life), it was on volume and biomass per tree stem. In this study, it was observed an increase in the weighted basic density of timber to the vital area of 4. 95 m² per tree. From this vital area, the basic density remained virtually unchanged...|$|E
40|$|Vegetative {{propagation}} of forest trees offers advantages to both tree breeders {{and the forest}} industry. In larch vegetative propagation has chronologically followed three major developments: (i) clonal propagation by cuttings; (ii) ‘bulk’ vegetative propagation by cuttings and (iii) somatic embryogenesis. The latter has potentially numerous applications such as {{the production of a}} large number of genetically improved plants and the amenability of embryogenic cultures to be stored in liquid nitrogen. In Larix sp. several improvements of the somatic embryogenesis protocol have been developed. Maturation conditions are now well enough refined to regenerate high quality somatic embryos that are highly similar to zygotic embryos in their anatomy, physiology and protein content. Among conifer species, somatic embryogenesis of Larix has become a model for its multiple uses; its integration in a breeding program is now undertaken for clonal {{propagation of}} improved material of hybrid larch Larix x eurolepis. Indeed, somatic embryogenesis assists breeding strategies by offering an alternative tool for at the same time accelerated production of plants for <b>clonal</b> <b>testing</b> and then for mass production; in addition, cryoconservation allows keeping material in a juvenile state and allows mass production of stored material at any time. This review describes the different methods of vegetative propagation of larch sp., in particular the advances in somatic embryogenesis and requirements for its integration into a breeding program...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the genetic control and genotype-by-environment interaction in wood weight of Eucalyptus clones in four environments located {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, aiming to select superior genotypes. In 2007, a network of <b>clonal</b> <b>tests</b> was established with 864 clones of Eucalyptus. At three years of age, diameter at breast height and total height were measured, as was depth of Pilodyn penetration, for indirect inference of wood basic density. The mean annual increment of dry weight (MAIweight) was calculated. Individual heritability of 0. 148 and of 0. 48 was found for MAIweight and Pilodyn penetration depth, respectively. The genetic correlation between environments ranged from 0. 503 to 0. 926 for all traits. The genotype-by-environment interaction was significant for the MAIweight index (0. 533). From the environment interaction analysis, 3 "improvement areas" were defined for the trait MAIweight. The grouping of the traits wood density and volume to create a wood weight index was essential for a more accurate selection, since there was a change of 37 % compared to the ranking of clones for volume. The simultaneous selection for stability and adaptability provided higher gains when compared to selection based on predicted genotypic values between environments. Moreover, MHPRVG allowed an increase in gains compared to the control. Thus, the five best clones were selected based on these criteria: 39912 (E. urophylla), 39659 (E. urophylla), 6808 (E. grandis), 36190 (E. saligna), 39407 (E. grandis x E. urophylla) ...|$|R
40|$|Tulip {{breaking}} virus (TBV) threatens bulb {{and flower}} production of tulips seriously. Breeding for resistance {{as a tool}} to prevent this disease resulted already in a screening <b>test</b> at <b>clonal</b> level and different levels of resistance were detected. <b>Clonal</b> <b>tests</b> are performed under greenhouse conditions after inoculation by viruliferous aphids. By using several bulbs of a genotype an accurate level of resistance can be determined. All cultivars of T. gesneriana tested were susceptible, but partial and even absolute resistance was found in T. fosteriana cultivars. To introduce resistance from T. fosteriana in the T. gesneriana assortment interspecific crosses were made. To select TBV resistant hybrids efficiently, a screening test, applicable at individual seedlings, is described. To test individual seedling selection, an incomplete diallel was made between the susceptible T. gesneriana cultivars ‘Christmas Marvel’, ‘Kees Nelis’ and ‘Lustige Witwe’, the partial resistant T. fosteriana cultivars ‘Juan’ and ‘Madame Lefeber’ and the absolute resistant T. fosteriana cultivars ‘Cantata’ and ‘Princeps’. Individual seedlings were inoculated using viruliferous aphids in the first, third or fifth year after sowing. Six weeks after inoculation, leaves were tested for TBV by ELISA. All seedlings were grown till maturity and the occurrence of breaking symptoms in the flower was monitored. Individual resistant seedlings could be selected. However, susceptible plants can occur (escapes) between the selected plants and also resistant plants can be discarded (missings). The efficiency of this seedling test will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{species of}} Eucalyptus genus present {{high levels of}} growth stress. These {{stresses}} are mechanical efforts generated during the tree growth to help maintaining {{the balance of the}} cup, in response to environmental (light, wind and inclination of the land) and silvicultural agents (pruning, thinning and planting density). The growth stresses are responsible for the cracks of tops, in logs and boards, and for the warp after the breaking down. This research evaluated the level of growth stress, measured by the longitudinal residual and tangential strain (DRL and DRT), around the circumference of the trunks of alive trees of six clones of Eucalyptus spp., at the age of 10. 5 years, and verified the effect of the planting parcel. The clones belong to VMM-AGRO, and they are coming from a <b>clonal</b> <b>test</b> area implanted in the Bom Sucesso farm, located in Vazante-MG. For evaluating the experiment, the model adopted was the completely randomized one disposed in factorial outline with two factors (clone and portion) in three repetitions. The results indicated that the average LRS was 0. 093 mm and that the average LRT was 0. 025 mm. It was verified that, for LRS, the clone effects and planting parcel were significant, while the interaction effect was not significant. For LRT the parcel and interaction effect were significant, while clone effect was not significant. Clones 44, 58 and 47 presented the smallest levels and better distributions of LRS, while, the clones 27, 44 and 58 presented the highest LRS levels. The clones 44 and 58 presented the best distribution and the smallest level of growth stress and may be considered potentially apt for producing sawn wood or solid wood...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to compare analyses of experiment strategies {{when there is a}} large number of clones and a reduced number of seedlings to be evaluated. Data from girth at breast height of two seasons of evaluation, 30 and 90 months, from a <b>clonal</b> <b>test</b> of Eucalyptus were analyzed in three locations. The experiments were carried out in the augmented block design with 400 regular clones distributed in 20 blocks and with four common clones (controls). Each plot consisted of five plants spaced 3 x 3 meters. The individual statistic analyses were carried out by season and local, a combined one by local at each season and a combined one involving the three locals and the two seasons. Each analysis was carried out according to two models: augmented design (AD) and one way classification (OWC). The variance components, the heritability, the Speaman’s rank correlation and the coincidence indexes in the clone selection at the two models were estimated. It was found that the augmented block design and the one way classification provide similar results in eucalypt clone evaluation. The coincidence indexes between the two models in the clone selection, in general, were high, showing values of 100 % in the local combined analyses at 90 months. The Spearman’s rank correlation showed estimates in accordance with the coincidence indexes. It was also checked that the clones by seasons interaction was expressive and the coincidence indexes in clones selection at 30 months with selection at 90 months in the combined by local analyses were from 42 % in the OWC and 47 % in AD, when a selection intensity of 5 % was applied...|$|E
40|$|Association studies aim at linking {{phenotypic}} variation with allelic {{variation in}} candidate genes {{and benefit from}} several generations of recombination in natural populations to identify causative polymorphisms. Such association studies are under development on Populus nigra L., with emphasis on nucleotide polymorphism associated to quantitative resistance to Melampsora larici-populina Kleb (Mlp), the causal agent of leaf rust. Populus nigra, the natural host of Mlp, is widely represented in European riparian ecosystems, where the occurrence and impact of the fungus are highly variable. Geographical patterns of nucleotide diversity in genes involved in the host-pathogen interaction is expected from local co-evolution. As a first step, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) {{have been identified in}} a discovery panel of twenty-one P. nigra genotypes covering French natural range. Sequencing was done on both functional and positional candidate resistance genes (closeness to mapped QTLs and resistance genes). An automated procedure for primer design allowed us to obtain successful amplification in P. nigra for 90 % of gene fragments. Average nucleotide variation in P. nigra is high (1 SNP/ 97 pb). A collection of more than 1100 P. nigra genotypes collected in different natural populations mainly in France but also in Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Spain was evaluated for rust resistance under natural inoculation in a <b>clonal</b> <b>test</b> in France and under artificial inoculations with different strains in leaf-disk bioassays. Even if most of the genetic variation for rust resistant could be observed at the individual (genotype) level, significant differentiation between natural populations was detected. The high level of genetic diversity observed at both gene and phenotypic levels, the rapid linkage disequilibrium decay between SNP is offering a favourable situation to identify interesting resistance alleles and to avoid false positive associations...|$|E
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería Forestal) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería Forestal, 2016. Pilón (Hieronyma alchorneoides) {{is one of}} {{the native}} species that {{presents}} greater adaptation to plantations (Delgado, Marcelino, Murillo & Castillo, 2003), due to its growth characteristics, multiple uses, high ecological value, is a strategic native species of the country (Piotto, 2001; Chowdhury & Chang, 2005; Gause, 2005). The vegetative propagation becomes an efficient method of reproduction of the pylon given its limitations for its sexual reproduction; Due to the difficulties in locating seed sources, the sex of the tree is not clearly differentiated, fruit production is very variable over time and among trees, being recalcitrant seeds, their germination capacity is lost in a few days After harvest (Abdelnour, Aguilar & Valverde, 2011). This paper evaluated the growth in diameter, commercial value and commercial volume of 2 <b>clonal</b> <b>tests</b> of Hieronyma alchorneoides, established in September 2012 in the northern zone of Costa Rica, with the objective of certifying the first seed source in Costa Rica. We reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that establishes the existence of significant differences among the evaluated genotypes. The genetic values show an elite population conformed by the 10 best clones, whose use will generate a genetic gain of 3. 2 % in diameter that means a potential reduction of 0. 7 years in the cultivation of this species. The environmental genotype interaction is low (c 2 int ≤ 0. 01), so the clonal collection of “pilón” presents a similar growth behavior in the northern zone of Costa Rica...|$|R
40|$|Several factors {{affecting}} somatic embryogenesis (SE) in Pinus sylvestris from self- and cross-pollinated seed families were studied {{with the aim}} of producing large quantities of clonal plants. Somatic embryogenesis initiation from zygotic embryos was improved on a medium with lower than standard concentrations of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2. 2 vs. 9. 5 mu M) and 6 -benzyladenine (2. 2 vs. 4. 5 mu M). On this medium, initiation rates of four controlled crosses, including one self-cross, varied from 3 % to 25 %. Among the maturation factors tested, the concentration of abscisic acid (ABA 80, 120 mu M) had no significant effect on the production of mature somatic embryos when the medium contained 0. 1 M sucrose. When sucrose concentration was 0. 2 M, however, 1. 4 times more mature somatic embryos were produced on medium with 80 mu M compared with 120 mu M ABA. Under our best maturation conditions, mature somatic embryos accumulated amounts of storage proteins that were similar to the amounts in mature zygotic embryos. Activated charcoal exerted a beneficial effect on mature somatic embryo production of 24 -week-old cultures; {{there was no evidence of}} such an effect in 8 -week-old cultures. Thirty-seven embryogenic lines from a self-cross and an out-cross were chosen for clonal plant production. Highly embryogenic lines produced mature somatic embryos that were more likely to convert to plants than those from less embryogenic lines. After 4 months of growth in a shade house, plantlet survival rates exceeded 70 % for 31 lines out of 35.
