Although voluntary certification has recently gained importance in the agricultural industry, information asymmetry is not always completely addressed.

40|$|Abstract—Telephony over IP has {{undergone}} a large-scale deployment thanks {{to the development of}} high-speed broadband access and the standardization of signalling protocols. A particular attention is currently given to P 2 PSIP networks which are exposed to many security threats. The RELOAD protocol defines a peer-to-peer signalling overlay designed to support these networks. It introduces a security framework based on <b>certification</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> but P 2 PSIP networks are still exposed to residual attacks, such as refusals of service. We propose in this work to address these residual attacks by integrating into the RELOAD architecture a dedicated trust model coupled with prevention countermeasures. We mathematically defines this trust-based strategy, and describe the considered prevention mechanisms implemented by safeguards and watchmen. We quantify the benefits and limits of our solution through an extensive set of experiments. I...|$|R

Our first model explores how firms voluntarily commit themselves to industry-wide or global codes of conduct and reporting initiatives. Then we analyze <b>certification</b> <b>mechanisms</b> through which firms can credibly signal their commitment to self-regulation schemes in the absence of government enforced regulatory standards and use the theoretical results to analyze the logic of current decision making in this area at the European level.

The classic security techniques like client-server {{networks are}} not enough for Peer-to-Peer networks because of its centralized nature. BloomCast is a full-text revival scheme which is used in unstructured P 2 P networks. It duplicates Bloom Filters rather than duplicating the documents among the network. BloomCast greatly minimizes the communication cost needed for duplication. But the main disadvantage {{is that it is}} vulnerable to malicious peers. In the proposed method self certification technique is used. Self-certification removes the need of a centralized system for sending the identities.

40|$|There is {{inconclusive}} evidence {{regarding the}} economic value of certification {{in the context}} of IPOs in developed markets. Using a natural experiment of regulator mandated IPO grading requirement, we examine the effects of third-party certification in the Indian IPO market. We summarize our empirical results below. First, underpricing is unaffected by the grading process. Second, stock price informativeness as proxied by idiosyncratic volatility increases significantly due to IPO grading process. Third, retail and institutional subscription levels are significantly positively associated with IPO grades after controlling for other <b>certification</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as underwriter reputation, group affiliation, analyst recommendation and venture capital backing. Finally, using a pseudo grading process we conclude that IPO grades are not mechanically derivable from publicly available information.

40|$|International audienceTrust {{is one of}} {{key factors}} which {{influence}} the development of mobile P 2 P networks. However, current trust evaluation models are not applicable to mobile P 2 P networks properly due to some of its characteristics such as heterogeneous nature of the peers, limited-range as well as unreliability of wireless links. In the paper main factors that influence the trust in mobile P 2 P networks are identified. Based on the analyzed result, we propose a novel trust evaluation model, which helps the networks to operate normally with high probability. Our model does not employ cryptographic approaches or <b>certification</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> so it is light enough to fit well with mobile P 2 P networks without great overheads. In addition, it also effectively solves the trust problem when no prior interaction history exists, {{an issue that has}} not been addressed in many models.

However, the main source of information for decision-makers remain the accounting information relaxed from synthesis financial reporting, because the legal framework prescribes mandatory minimum information and a set of quality <b>certification</b> <b>mechanisms</b> thereof.

40|$|Voluntary {{sustainability}} {{standards and}} certification offer a promising mechanism {{to mitigate the}} severe negative impacts of agricultural expansion and intensification on tropical biodiversity. From a conservation standpoint, certification of tropical agroforestry crops, especially coffee and cocoa, {{is of particular interest}} given the potentially high biodiversity value of agroforestry systems and the substantial market penetration of coffee and cocoa certification in recent years. Here, we review experience with coffee and cocoa certification, summarize evidence on conservation impacts, and explore future needs. While there is much evidence that environmental criteria behind certification support biodiversity conservation, it is less clear to what extent certification is the cause of improved conservation outcomes. Additionally, the farm-scale focus of current certification models may limit delivery of biodiversity conservation benefits, as maintenance of biodiversity depends on processes at larger landscape scales. To address this scale mismatch, we suggest that investment and innovation in certification over the next decade prioritize landscape conservation outcomes. This may be achieved by (1) linking existing <b>certification</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with broader landscape and ecosystem service management approaches and/or (2) expanding current certification models to consider the landscape itself as the certified unit.

The environmental impacts of programs that encourage biofuel production, farmland land requirements and the impacts on food production are also discussed, considering the life cycle analysis (LCA) as a tool.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>certification</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and incentives that enable lending markets to match demand and supply despite {{the absence of}} financial intermediaries with skin in the game. Our analysis of the online social lending market, {{in which there is no}} financial intermediary but in which members can create self-organized groups, shows that allowing group leader rewards, similar to origination fees in securitization, is detrimental. We are able to take advantage of a change imposed on group leaders in which group rewards are eliminated to examine in a difference-in-difference approach how the same groups behave once these origination fees are removed. In general, group leaders signal borrower quality to other lenders by endorsing and submitting bids for listings in their groups. When group leaders receive an origination fee for successful loan listings, it creates adverse incentives so despite bids and endorsements, loans originated by such group leaders have higher default rates. Group leaders become more careful in screening after the elimination of these rewards, and if their loan participation is high, i. e. when they have skin in the game and are thus severely hurt by a borrower default. The results from this experiment provide important implications for the question of how retai...|$|R
