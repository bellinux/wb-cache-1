5|$|Nest {{sites are}} varied, though {{cavities}} are preferred. Nests {{are most frequently}} built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> banks, or tree hollows, are also used. A sparrow sometimes excavates its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches, but more frequently uses the nests of other birds {{such as those of}} swallows in banks and <b>cliffs,</b> <b>and</b> old tree cavity nests. It usually uses deserted nests, though sometimes it usurps active ones. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe, putting the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters, and thereby contributing to their population declines.|$|E

Star of 'The Stud'films, Oliver Tobias, co-starred as the captain of the spaceship.|$|R
30|$|The Indian Ocean {{coastline}} of South Africa {{is home to}} {{many species}} of shark, {{and some of these}} have the reputation of being dangerous to humans (<b>Cliff</b> <b>and</b> Dudley 1992; <b>Cliff</b> <b>and</b> Wilson 1986). As a direct result of shark attack the Natal Sharks Board (NSB), later KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB), was established to protect people utilizing the surf zone. The main mechanism employed to reduce the incidence of shark attack was the placing of nets off the coastline to catch large sharks (<b>Cliff</b> <b>and</b> Dudley 1992; <b>Cliff</b> <b>and</b> Wilson 1986). This practice has {{led to the development of}} a large database of the sharks most commonly found off the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast (egs. Allen <b>and</b> <b>Cliff</b> 2000; Cliff 1995; De Bruyn et al. 2005; Dudley <b>and</b> <b>Cliff</b> 1993), <b>and</b> at the same time, allowed for the collection of research materials from sharks caught in the nets.|$|R

5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the <b>cliffs,</b> <b>and</b> continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E
5|$|North of that, {{the coast}} forms Weston Bay and Sand Bay whose {{northern}} tip, Sand Point, marks the lower {{limit of the}} Severn Estuary. In the mid and north of the county the coastline is low as the level wetlands of the levels meet the sea. In the west, the coastline is high and dramatic where the plateau of Exmoor meets the sea, with high <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> waterfalls.|$|E
5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's <b>cliffs,</b> <b>and</b> a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as {{it was easier to}} shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E

5|$|Conservation of A.viridimontanum is {{primarily}} limited by its restricted habitat on serpentine <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> talus slopes. However, these sites are also of little value to humans. The most likely {{threat to the}} species is expansion of asbestos mining, which often occurs near populations of the fern, or other reuse of abandoned asbestos mines. Road construction might also threaten some sites, although this is mitigated by the fern's ability to flourish on disturbed serpentine. None of the sites are as yet known to be invaded by non-native plants. The species is considered more difficult to cultivate than either of its parent species.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E

5|$|From {{this point}} east the freeway is routed across a flat {{area between the}} Book <b>Cliffs</b> <b>and</b> the Colorado River, called Sagers Flat. Along the way it passes by the towns of Crescent Junction, Thompson Springs and Cisco. Natural {{features}} visible from this portion include Arches National Park and Castle Valley. Other listed attractions along the byway near this section include Canyonlands National Park and various areas with Morrison Formation, a layer of rock where dinosaur remains are common. I-70, US-6, and US-50 all enter Colorado concurrently. Where I-70 follows the Book Cliffs, it was built parallel to or on top of US-6/50.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son, George Herbert, {{maintained}} the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public {{walks around the}} castle, dug into the surrounding <b>cliffs,</b> <b>and</b> planted trees around the grounds to improve the castle's appearance. The castle walls and towers were given superficial repairs and tidied up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, and {{the interior of the}} inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money. The landscape also required expensive maintenance and repairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1761 John Griffin {{published}} {{a letter in}} the London Chronicle recommending methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing and described the bolts and rings he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour. Mooring rings were still there in 1824, and around 1830, three capstans {{at the base of}} the <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> bollards along the cliffs, by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed.|$|E

5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis {{is found}} {{throughout}} the highly limited range of the Lundy cabbage, including sheer sea <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> further inland at Millcombe House.

It had been hypothesised that P. luridipennis and Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes may help pollinate the Lundy cabbage, but observations of the taxa indicate that neither visit flowers. While there are no honey bees on Lundy, other species of winged insects are present. The plant may rely primarily upon pollen beetles of the genus Meligethes and the wind for pollination.|$|E

5|$|The Jurassic Coast {{is subject}} to severe weather {{conditions}} at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the <b>cliffs</b> <b>and</b> caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The coast is largely an eroding landscape {{and management of the}} site aims to allow the natural processes of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other places, where the coastline remains in a natural state, the management policy is to take no action and allow erosion to take its course.|$|E
5|$|The Snowdon Massif {{includes}} {{a number of}} <b>cliffs,</b> <b>and</b> holds an important place {{in the history of}} rock climbing in the United Kingdom. Clogwyn Du'r Arddu is often colloquially known as 'Cloggy' among climbers, and was the site of the first recorded climb in Britain, in 1798. It was carried out by Peter Bailey Williams and William Bingley, while searching for rare plants. It is now considered {{to be one of the}} best cliffs in Britain for rock climbing.|$|E
