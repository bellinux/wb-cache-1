5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the <b>centre</b> <b>frequency</b> as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStereo {{thresholds}} for 84 % correct {{detection of}} sinusoidal disparity corrugations depicted by narrow-band-filtered random dot stereograms were determined for surfaces {{as a function}} of (i) luminance <b>centre</b> spatial <b>frequency</b> and (ii) disparity modulation frequency. In addition, supra-threshold depth matching functions for two amplitudes of peak-to-trough depth were determined using similar stimuli. Disparity thresholds followed a U-shaped function when plotted against luminance <b>centre</b> spatial <b>frequency</b> from 1 to 8 c/deg. The threshold functions for the three highest corrugation frequencies (ranging from 0. 25 to 1 c/deg) formed a single family with a similar bandpass shape and a peak sensitivity atca 4 c/deg. At the lowest frequency of depth modulation (0. 125 c/deg) the shape of the luminance spatial frequency threshold function showed a reduced sensitivity to depth modulations when portrayed by patterns with high luminance <b>centre</b> <b>frequencies</b> (8 c/deg). The similarity of the threshold functions reveals luminance and corrugation frequency to be largely independent dimensions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study was to find out what spatial {{frequency}} information human observers use in the recognition of face images. Signal-to-noise ratio thresholds for the recognition of facial images were measured as a function of the <b>centre</b> spatial <b>frequency</b> of narrow-band additive spatial noise. The relative sensitivity of recognition to different spatial frequencies was derived from these results. The maximum sensitivity was found at 8 – 13 c/face width and the bandwidth was just under two octaves. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with stimuli in which Fourier phase was randomised within a narrow band of different <b>centre</b> spatial <b>frequencies.</b> This resulted in a considerable increase of energy threshold around 8 c/face width and less elsewhere. Further, contrast energy thresholds were measured as a function of the <b>centre</b> spatial <b>frequency</b> of band-pass filtered face images. As a function of object spatial frequency (c/face width), energy threshold first decreased and then increased. The lowest energy thresholds found around 10 c/face width were lower than the energy threshold for unfiltered images. This is what one would expect if face recognition is narrow-band, since band-pass filtered images of optimal <b>centre</b> spatial <b>frequency</b> do not contain unused contrast energy at low and high spatial frequencies. In conclusion, the results suggest that the recognition of facial images is tuned to a relatively narrow band (< 2 octaves) of mid object spatial frequencies...|$|R
