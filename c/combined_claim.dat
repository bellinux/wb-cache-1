40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{stochastic}} model for claims reserving that allows to <b>combine</b> <b>claims</b> payments and incurred losses information. The main {{idea is to}} <b>combine</b> two <b>claims</b> reserving models (Hertig’s model [11] and Gogol’s model [8]) leading to a log-normal paid-incurred chain (PIC) model. Using a Bayesian point of view for the parameter modelling we derive in this Bayesian PIC model the full predictive distribution of the outstanding loss liabilities. On the one hand this allows for an analytical calculation of the claims reserves and the corresponding conditional mean square error of prediction. On the other hand simulation algorithms provide any other statistics and risk measure on these claims reserves...|$|R

40|$|Our article {{considers}} {{the class of}} recently developed stochastic models that <b>combine</b> <b>claims</b> payments and incurred losses information into a coherent reserving methodology. In particular, we develop a family of Heirarchical Bayesian Paid-Incurred-Claims models, <b>combining</b> the <b>claims</b> reserving models of Hertig et al. (1985) and Gogol et al. (1993). In the process we extend the independent log-normal model of Merz et al. (2010) by incorporating different dependence structures using a Data-Augmented mixture Copula Paid-Incurred claims model. The utility and influence of incorporating both payment and incurred losses into estimating of the full predictive distribution of the outstanding loss liabilities and the resulting reserves is demonstrated in the following cases: (i) an independent payment (P) data model; (ii) the independent Payment-Incurred Claims (PIC) data model of Merz et al. (2010); (iii) a novel dependent lag-year telescoping block diagonal Gaussian Copula PIC data model incorporating conjugacy via transformation; (iv) a novel data-augmented mixture Archimedean copula dependent PIC data model. Inference in such models is developed via a class of adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. These incorporate a data-augmentation framework utilized to efficiently evaluate the likelihood for the copula based PIC model in the loss reserving triangles. The adaptation strategy is based on representing a positive definite covariance matrix by the exponential of a symmetric matrix as proposed by Leonard et al. (1992) ...|$|R

Participants were Aetna members ages between 52 and 80 years from 32 primary care practices in Florida and Georgia participating in the Communicating Health Options through Informa-tion and Cancer Education study. Main outcomes were the proportion of average-risk patients who were up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening based on claims data and the estimated additional yield of survey data for patients with no evidence of screening in their claims history. Of 4, 020 average-risk members identi-fied, claims data indicated that 1, 066 (27 %) had recent colorectal cancer screening.

40|$|AbstractOur article {{considers}} {{the class of}} recently developed stochastic models that <b>combine</b> <b>claims</b> payments and incurred losses information into a coherent reserving methodology. In particular, we develop a family of hierarchical Bayesian paid–incurred <b>claims</b> models, <b>combining</b> the <b>claims</b> reserving models of Hertig (1985) and Gogol (1993). In the process we extend the independent log-normal model of Merz and Wüthrich (2010) by incorporating different dependence structures using a Data-Augmented mixture Copula paid–incurred claims model. In this way the paper makes two main contributions: firstly we develop an extended class of model structures for the paid–incurred chain ladder models where we develop precisely the Bayesian formulation of such models; secondly we explain how to develop advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms to make inference under these copula dependence PIC models accurately and efficiently, making such models accessible to practitioners to explore their suitability in practice. In this regard {{the focus of the}} paper should be considered in two parts, firstly development of Bayesian PIC models for general dependence structures with specialised properties relating to conjugacy and consistency of tail dependence across the development years and accident years and between Payment and incurred loss data are developed. The second main contribution is the development of techniques that allow general audiences to efficiently work with such Bayesian models to make inference. The focus of the paper is not so much to illustrate that the PIC paper is a good class of models for a particular data set, the suitability of such PIC type models is discussed in Merz and Wüthrich (2010) and Happ and Wüthrich (2013). Instead we develop generalised model classes for the PIC family of Bayesian models and in addition provide advanced Monte Carlo methods for inference that practitioners may utilise with confidence in their efficiency and validity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{emergence}} of ‘controlled tipping’ as the dominant method of municipal waste disposal in Britain between 1920 and 1960. The triumph of controlled tipping, despite the availability of alternative disposal technologies, needs to be understood {{in the context of}} the contested meanings of ‘waste’ and ‘wasteland’, which helped to determine attitudes and approaches to disposal. Following the conclusion of the First World War there was an urgent requirement for a cheap means of disposing of increasing amounts of urban municipal waste. The obvious choice was tipping. Before the war, however, refuse tipping had been rejected as insanitary by the emerging waste disposal profession. Public cleansing professionals therefore had to recuperate tipping as a medically and environmentally benign mode of disposal that was reconcilable with the needs of sanitary science and landscape preservation. Controlled tipping, with its <b>combined</b> <b>claims</b> to scientific progress and the revalorization of refuse, enabled dumping to be successfully re-produced as the dominant mode of municipal refuse disposal in Britain. However, tipping faced further challenges after 1945 from changing popular understandings of the value of ‘derelict’ landscapes and from the politics of amenity. The ‘refuse revolution’ was a work in progress. ...|$|R

The data do not include public sector claims for Western Australia, which did not report its claims data for 2010 - 11 to 2012 - 13. Claims arise from allegations of negligence or breach of duty of care by health-care practitioners during the delivery of health services. A new claim is created when a reserve amount is placed against the costs expected to arise in closing the claim. A claim is closed after being finalised through a court decision, a negotiated settlement between claimant and insurer, or discontinuation (either by the insurer, or the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s withdrawing the claim). Claim numbers The number of new public sector claims was less in 2012 - 13 (about 950) {{than any of the}} previous 4 years (1, 200 - 1, 400) while the number of closed public sector claims was higher (about 1, 500) compared with the previous 4 years (1, 100 - 1, 400). The number of new private sector claims remained steady at 3, 200 to 3, 300 per year from 2010 - 11 to 2012 - 13. This was higher than the 2, 300 - 2, 500 new private sector claims in 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10. Yet the number of closed private sector claims increased each year, from 2, 400 to 3, 800. There were about 14, 000 public and private sector claims open at some stage during the year for the 2010 - 11 to 2012 - 13 years, compared with 12, 500 for 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10.
