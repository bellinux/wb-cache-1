50|$|<b>A</b> <b>headlamp</b> is {{designed}} to be worn on the head, often having separate lamp and battery components. The battery pack may be attached {{at the back of the}} head or in a pocket to improve balance. Headlamps leave the user's hands free. <b>A</b> <b>headlamp</b> can be clipped to the brim of a hat, or built to mount on a hard hat, instead of using straps; other types resemble eyeglass frames. Similar to the <b>headlamp,</b> <b>an</b> angle-head flashlight emits light perpendicular to the length of the battery tube; it can be clipped to a headband, belt, or webbing or set on a flat surface. Some types allow the user to adjust the angle of the head. The Fulton MX991/U Flashlight was an angle-head flashlight issued to US military personnel; similar style lights remain popular.|$|R
25|$|HID lamps emit {{infrared}} energy that can defrost {{snow and ice}} from the front lens of <b>a</b> <b>headlamp,</b> while LEDs do not, and need to cycle heat from the heat-sink {{to the front of}} the panel to de-ice and de-fog the lens.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>headlamp</b> or {{headlight}} (known {{as a head}} torch in the UK) is a {{light source}} affixed to the head for outdoor activities at night or in dark conditions such as caving, orienteering, hiking, skiing, backpacking, camping, mountaineering or mountain biking.

50|$|<b>A</b> {{motorcycle}} <b>headlamp</b> modulator (or simply <b>headlamp</b> modulator) is <b>an</b> {{accessory device}} that oscillates {{the intensity of}} <b>a</b> motorcycle <b>headlamp</b> at 240 ±40 cycles per minute (~4 Hz) between approximately 20% and 100% of full intensity. The headlight operates at full intensity 50-70% of the time. United States and Canadian regulations require headlight modulators to include a light sensor that disables modulation when the ambient light level drops below a certain point. When this happens, the headlamps burn steadily.|$|R

Also make a choosing mode for driver to choose auto mode or manual mode operation. In auto mode operation, all input device is use sensor such as ultrasonic and potentiometer to control the alignment system of headlamp; all are automatically control the alignment system without used any switch. While in manual mode operation, all are using toggle switch to control the headlamp alignment system and need to turns on the switch manually...|$|R
