50|$|Even when {{a mother}} who is {{residing}} in Saudi Arabia is granted physical <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> children, <b>the</b> father maintains legal custody and {{has the right to}} determine where the children live and travel. In many cases, the father has been able to assume legal <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> children against <b>the</b> wishes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother when she is unable or unwilling to meet certain conditions set by law for her to maintain her custodial rights. For example, if the mother moves to another country, the father is entitled to have custody. A court can sever a mother's custody if it determines that the mother is incapable <b>of</b> safeguarding <b>the</b> child or <b>of</b> bringing <b>the</b> child up in accordance with the appropriate religious standards. The mother can lose custody by remarrying a non-Muslim, or by residing in a home with non-relatives. Sharia law allows <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> children to be awarded to the closest male relative of a Saudi father in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> death or imprisonment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> father, even if the Saudi father has made clear his wish that the children's mother have full custody.|$|R
