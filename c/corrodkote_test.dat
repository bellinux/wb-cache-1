40|$|HVOF-sprayed {{coatings}} (WC- 17 Co, WC- 10 Co- 4 Cr, Co- 28 Mo- 17 Cr- 3 Si) and electrolytic {{hard chrome}} (EHC) coatings corrosion resistances have been compared through electrochemical polarization tests (0. 1 N HCl, 0. 1 N HNO 3) and <b>Corrodkote</b> <b>test.</b> EHC coatings passivate in HNO 3, but undergo pitting corrosion in HCl and in <b>Corrodkote</b> <b>test</b> too. HVOF coatings do not passivate, but possess more noble corrosion potentials. Both in HNO 3 and HCl, they undergo more generalized corrosion, with similar i(corr); crevice corrosion along splat boundaries is sometimes detected after the HCl test. Their i(corr) in 0. 1 N HCl solution {{is lower than}} in several of EHC coatings. No visible damage in the HVOF coatings has occurred after the <b>Corrodkote</b> <b>test.</b> (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{corrosion}} resistance of one Co–based alloy coating, namely Co– 28 Mo– 17 Cr– 3 Si (similar to Tribaloy- 800), four Ni-based alloy coatings, namely Ni– 17 Cr– 4 Fe– 4 Si– 3. 5 B– 1 C (Diamalloy- 2001), Ni– 20 Cr– 10 W– 9 Mo– 4 Cu– 1 C– 1 B– 1 Fe (Diamalloy- 4006), Ni– 22 Cr– 9 Mo– 4 Nb– 5 Fe (similar to Inconel- 625), Ni– 32 Mo– 16 Cr– 3 Si– 2 Co (similar to Tribaloy- 700), and a (WC- 12 Co) – 33 Ni– 9 Cr– 3. 5 Fe– 2 Si– 2 B– 0. 5 C cermet–Ni alloy blend coating. They were produced by liquid-fuelled HVOF spraying onto AISI 1040 steel plates. Electrolytic hard chrome (EHC) plating was characterised {{as a reference}} material, to verify whether some HVOF coatings are suitable as an EHC replacement. The microstructure of the coatings was examined by SEM and XRD. Electrochemical polarization tests and free corrosion tests were performed in 0. 1 M HCl aqueous solution; the <b>corrodkote</b> <b>test</b> (ASTM B 380 - 97 R 02) was also performed, to rank coatings qualitatively. The lowest corrosion current densities (Icorr) were recorded for EHC and Tribaloy- 700. The latter coating contained few secondary phases and little porosity; the damage was mainly due to corrosion activation along lamellae boundaries. Diamalloy- 2001 exhibited the highest Icorr and was significantly damaged after the polarization test, as its multi-phase microstructure had triggered severe galvanic corrosion. During free corrosion in 0. 1 M HCl, Tribaloy- 700 and Diamalloy- 4006 retained rather stable polarization resistance (Rp), whereas the Rp of EHC decreased significantly. Tribaloy- 700 survived 40 h of <b>corrodkote</b> <b>test</b> with no apparent damage and EHC underwent limited pitting corrosion. All other coatings had visible corrosion. The Inconel- 625 coating failed to protect the substrate after 20 h of testing, due to inadequate processing conditions...|$|E
40|$|Cold {{spraying}} {{has shown}} {{its potential to}} produce metallic and composite coatings with high quality and performance. For instance, the impermeability of the coatings is the criterion for the corrosion resistance and thus, fully dense coatings can act as real corrosion barrier coatings. Our previous study has demonstrated the good corrosion properties of high-pressure cold-sprayed (HPCS) Ni and NiCu coatings whereas the present study focuses on the analysis of structural characteristics behind the dense coatings. Microstructures of as-sprayed and heat-treated HPCS Ni, Ni 20 Cu and Ni 20 Cu + Al 2 O 3 coatings have been evaluated with FESEM from top-view direction. This revealed clearly particle deformation and particle boundaries whereas particle bonding was evaluated with cavitation–erosion test. Density was proven with <b>Corrodkote</b> <b>test</b> and impermeable HPCS NiCu + Al 2 O 3 coating structures were achieved. Furthermore, cavitation–erosion resistance of NiCu coating was improved by heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|Various {{types of}} {{decorative}} copperr-nickel-chromium electrodeposits were produced on mild steel substrates and their corrosion resistance evaluated {{by means of}} CASS and <b>Corrodkote</b> accelerated <b>tests</b> and also by exposure tests at Mandapam Camp, a locality with a tropical marine atmosphere. The behavio. f the electrodeposits was examined by anodic polarisation in CASS and Corrodkote media. The results of all the above investigations are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{effects of}} {{anticipated}} heat treatment on the {{electroless nickel plating}} coated on magnesium alloys AZ 91 D were investigated by using heat treatments of solution (T 4) and solution + aging (T 6) before electroless nickel plating. The influence of anticipated heat treatment on the structure, composition and anti-corrosion property of electroless coating were studied by using Scanning Electrical Microscope (SEM), EDS and <b>Corrodkote</b> corrosion <b>test.</b> It is shown that compared with the as-casted magnesium alloys and samples treated with T 4, the deposition rate of Ni, the P contained in the coating and the anti-corrosion property of samples treated with T 6 are the highest for the given system studied, and T 6 treatment can promote the anti-corrosion property of the coating effectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates {{the effects of}} a 600  °C, 1  h heat {{treatment}} on the corrosion resistance of three High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) flame-sprayed alloy coatings: a Co- 28 Mo- 17 Cr- 3 Si (similar to Tribaloy- 800) coating, a Ni- 20 Cr- 10 W- 9 Mo- 4 Cu- 1 C- 1 B- 1 Fe (Diamalloy- 4006) coating and a Ni- 32 Mo- 16 Cr- 3 Si- 2 Co (similar to Tribaloy- 700) coating. Electrochemical polarization tests and free corrosion tests were performed in 0. 1  M HCl aqueous solution. The <b>corrodkote</b> <b>test</b> (ASTM B 380 - 97 R 02) was also performed, to evaluate the coatings qualitatively. The heat treatment improves the corrosion resistance of the Co- 28 Mo- 17 Cr- 3 Si coating and of the Ni- 20 Cr- 10 W- 9 Mo- 4 Cu- 1 C- 1 B- 1 Fe coating by enhancing their passivation ability. The precipitation of sub-micron sized secondary phases after the treatment may produce galvanic microcells at intralamellar scale, but the beneficial contribution provided by the healing of the very small but dangerous interlamellar defects (normally present in thermal spray coatings but not detectable using ordinary scanning electron microscopy) prevails. The effect on Ni- 32 Mo- 16 Cr- 3 Si- 2 Co coatings is more ambiguous: its sensitivity to crevice corrosion is worsened by the heat treatment. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
