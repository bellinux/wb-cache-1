25|$|The NTSC and PAL TV norms {{call for}} a {{compliant}} TV screen to display an electrically black and white signal (minimal <b>color</b> <b>saturation)</b> at a color temperature of 6500K. On many consumer-grade televisions, {{there is a very}} noticeable deviation from this requirement. However, higher-end consumer-grade televisions can have their color temperatures adjusted to 6500K by using a preprogrammed setting or a custom calibration. Current versions of ATSC explicitly call for the color temperature data {{to be included in the}} data stream, but old versions of ATSC allowed this data to be omitted. In this case, current versions of ATSC cite default colorimetry standards depending on the format. Both of the cited standards specify a 6500K color temperature.|$|E

A t-edge colored graph G is (C, t) -saturated if G does not contain any graph in C but the {{addition}} of any edge in any color in [t] creates a copy of some graph in C. Similarly to classical saturation functions, define sat_t(n, C) to be the minimum number of edges in a (C,t) saturated graph. Let C_r(H) be the family consisting of every edge-colored copy of H which uses exactly r colors. In this paper we consider a variety of <b>colored</b> <b>saturation</b> problems. We determine the order of magnitude for sat_t(n, C_r(K_k)) for all r, showing a sharp change in behavior when r≥k- 12 + 2. A particular case of this theorem proves a conjecture of Barrus, Ferrara, Vandenbussche, and Wenger. We determine sat_t(n, C_ 2 (K_ 3)) exactly and determine the extremal graphs.

That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction. Apple's new user interface design, using deep <b>color</b> <b>saturation,</b> text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013. With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged. The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse.|$|E
500|$|The game's art {{director}} was Fumitaka Yano of Atlus. The main aesthetic {{chosen for the}} game revolved around bright colors, a noted shift from the majority of Atlus' previous games. The bright colors were designed to emulate {{the focus on the}} entertainment industry, with various shades and effects portraying a colorful world. In contrast, the dungeons were designed around fantasy motifs and meant to embody the Mirages having been robbed of [...] "expression". The game's dungeons were based around real-world locations within Tokyo, and had gimmicks inspired by a chosen location: for instance, one dungeon inspired by Shibuya 109 was themed around fashion. The main characters were designed by toi8, a Japanese artist noted for his work on [...]hack//The Movie. When he was approached, he was finishing work on the cover of a light novel and wondering what he would be doing next. While his previous work used a low <b>color</b> <b>saturation,</b> for Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE he used high <b>color</b> <b>saturation</b> suited to its setting. According to Takada, the team asked toi8 to design the world in this way to create [...] "a feeling of both friendliness and splendor". The Mirage characters were designed by Hideo Minaba of Japanese design company CyDesignation, and were based on characters from Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Awakening. They were designed to contrast with toi8's character designs with the deliberate exception of Tiki, having a machine-like appearance. This was due to the long battle the characters had been facing: their armor reflected the dark events they had faced, and parts of themselves unneeded for survival have degenerated. Minaba had been a fan of the Fire Emblem series, and encountered difficulties designing the characters. His main aim was to remain true to the original characters while emulating the sharp and dark character style of Atlus games.|$|E

West had previously been the cinematographer on staff for both Deep Space Nine and The Next Generation, as well as directing several episodes of the franchise.

[...] Visual effects supervisor Dan Curry directed some of the second-unit sequences, and together with West and cinematographer Kris Krossgrove worked to rectify these issues.

[...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and <b>color</b> <b>saturation.</b> The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E

500|$|Described as an [...] "interactive Beatles experience", {{the game}} was {{considered}} to bring players closer to the band through both technical and emotional means. By playing each song's respective note chart, players {{were said to have}} a better appreciation for the structure and complexity of the compositions and performances by the Beatles. Emotionally, critics commented on the sentimental values of the game's career mode, recalling the history of the band. Critics were mostly positive concerning the visual and aural elements of the game; G4's Abbie Heppe considered it a preferable package to the newly remastered albums, citing song-specific animations as a strong feature. The dreamscape sequences in particular were likened to live performances, praised as [...] "dazzling" [...] and [...] "evocative". However, Schiesel remarked that due to the players' concentration on the note tracks, the animations [...] "serve mostly to entertain onlookers rather than the players themselves". Heppe observed that the <b>color</b> <b>saturation</b> of the background elements as well as the [...] "Beatlemania" [...] visual effects can sometimes contrast poorly with the scrolling notes, making it difficult to play. After the game's release, Harmonix lead designer Chris Foster acknowledged that the visuals can be [...] "too overwhelming for [...] at moments".

Light fastness of inkjet prints under high intensity level of illumination is studied in this research. Ten different brands of papers were exploited to print a special design test target by EPSON inkjet printer and the printing test samples were irradiated under high level of illumination so that the aging process can be accelerated. After being irradiated for different time intervals, then color differences were measured by using spectrophotometer. The results show: the color differences of prints printed by using the brands Kodak and Xiongguan papers changed greatly after prolonged exposure to light. These conclusions are very useful for the correct choosing of inkjet materials under suitable inkjet printing condition...|$|R
