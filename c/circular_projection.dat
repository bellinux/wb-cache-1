Creating panoramic views in stereo, where one panorama is generated for the left eye, and another panorama is generated for the right eye is more problematic. Earlier attempts to mosaic images from a rotating pair of stereo cameras faced severe problems of parallax and of scale changes. A new family of multiple viewpoint image <b>projections,</b> the <b>Circular</b> <b>Projections,</b> is developed.

Traditionally created by rotating a regular camera around an axis that passes through its center of projection, projecting the images onto a cylinder and blending them together (see figure 1 on slide 3) Traditional techniques require that all images are taken through the same viewpoint (center of projection) Stereo panoramic video requires information for all directions, for each eye, at every time instant.

40|$|Echinococcus granulosus is a {{parasitic}} platyhelminth that {{is responsible}} for cystic hydatid disease. From the inner, germinal layer of hydatid cysts protoscoleces are generated, which are are the infective forms to the dog. Systematic studies on the cell biology of E. granulosus protoscolex formation in natural infections are scarce and incomplete. In the present report we describe seven steps in the development of protoscoleces. Cellular buds formed by a clustering of cells emerge from the germinal layer of hydatid cysts. The buds elongate and the cells at their bases seem to diminish in number. Very early on a furrow appears in the elongated buds, delimiting anterior (scolex) and caudal (body) regions. Hooks are the first fully-differentiated structures formed at the apical region of the nascent scolex. In a more advanced stage, the scolex shows <b>circular</b> <b>projections</b> and depressions that develop into suckers. A cone can later be seen {{at the center of the}} hooks, the body is expanded and a structured neck is evident between the scolex and the body. During protoscolex development this parasitic form remains attached to the germinative layer through a stalk. When fully differentiated, the stalk is cut off and the infective protoscolex is now free in the hydatid flui...|$|R

40|$|The {{species of}} the genus Notopygos Grube, 1855 are {{characterized}} by an ovate body, a prominent caruncle with three lobes, dendritic branchiae, and double dorsal cirri. Twenty-two species belonging to Notopygos have been described, mostly from the Indo-Pacific region. In America, few species are frequently recorded: N. crinita Grube, 1855 from St. Helena Island (Atlantic) and N. ornata Grube and Ørsted in Grube 1857 from Costa Rica (Pacific). Notopygos crinita is a widely distributed species in the Western Atlantic with additional reports in the Mediterranean Sea (as a questionable alien species) and in the Pacific Ocean. However, only the genus features have been considered, consequently some records could be misidentifications. During a revision of materials from collections and the barcode project, ‘Mexican Barcode of Life, MEXBOL’, we found specimens of N. megalops and an undescribed species from reef zones in the Caribbean; the former had been considered a junior synonym of N. crinita. Herein, N. megalops is reestablished and N. caribea sp. n. is described. A morphological and DNA barcode approach was used to explain the records of N. ornata in the Atlantic and to show the differences with the new species, since both species share features such as complex pigmentation patterns, and <b>circular</b> <b>projections</b> in the median lobe of the caruncle...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{assessing}} the intrinsic 3 D shape of prestellar cores from molecular column densities. We have employed hydrodynamic simulations of contracting, isothermal cores considering three intrinsic geometries: spherical, cylindrical/filamentary and disk-like. We have coupled our hydrodynamic simulations with non-equilibrium chemistry. We find that a) when cores are observed very elongated (i. e. for aspect ratios < 0. 15) the intrinsic 3 D geometry can be probed by their 2 D molecular emission maps, since these exhibit significant qualitative morphological differences between cylindrical and disk-like cores. Specifically, if a disk-like core is observed as a filamentary object in dust emission, {{then it will be}} observed as two parallel filaments in N_ 2 H^+; b) for cores with higher aspect ratios (i. e. 0. 15 ∼ 0. 9) we define a metric Δ that quantifies whether a molecular column density profile is centrally peaked, depressed or flat. We have identified one molecule (CN) for which Δ {{as a function of the}} aspect ratio probes the 3 D geometry of the core; and c) for cores with almost <b>circular</b> <b>projections</b> (i. e. for aspect ratios ∼ 1), we have identified three molecules (OH, CO and H_ 2 CO) that can be used to probe the intrinsic 3 D shape by close inspection of their molecular column density radial profiles.

40|$|Abstract: Automatic road {{extraction}} {{from the}} high resolution remote sensing images is of great importance in intelligent transportation and image processing. Hence, in this paper, an effective road extraction algorithm for high resolution remote sensing images based on the <b>circular</b> <b>projection</b> transformation is proposed. The main idea of the proposed algorithm lies in that the road extraction results are obtained by selecting a suitable initial template, and then search the matched templates through moving the initial template in two directions. Firstly, the <b>circular</b> <b>projection</b> vector of the initial template is achieved by calculating the <b>circular</b> <b>projection</b> value at a specific radius. Secondly, the optimal radius of the circle in <b>circular</b> <b>projection</b> transformation {{and the length of}} the seeking step and the seeking angle are determined. Thirdly, for each seeking step the similarity between the target template and the initial template is computed, and the template with the highest similarity is chosen. Finally, roads can be detected by the correct direction by exchanging the first two detected points. To make performance evaluation, the IKONOS dataset is utilized and DMES and AUA algorithm are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can automatic the roads from high resolution remote sensing images effectively and efficiently...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} several interesting {{configurations of}} omnidirectional stereo (omnistereo) - binocular omnistereo, N-ocular omnistereo, <b>circular</b> <b>projection</b> omnistereo and dynamic omni-stereo. An omnidirectional image {{can be either}} obtained by an omnidirectional camera or generated by image mosaicing. Usually an omnidirectional image has a 360 -degree view around a viewpoint, and in its most common form, can be presented in a cylindrical surface around the viewpoint. This paper shows that an omnidirectional image for stereo vision can either have a single viewpoint or multiple viewpoints, and can be either viewer-centered or object-centered. With these generalizations, omnidirectional stereo vision can be extended from a viewer-centered binocular / N-ocular omnistereo with a few fixed viewpoints to more interesting omnistereo configurations – <b>circular</b> <b>projection</b> omnistereo with many viewpoints in a small region, dynamic omnistereo with a few reconfigurable viewpoints in a large region, and object-centered omnistereo with many viewpoints distributed in a large region.

40|$|Musical genre is {{probably}} the most popular music descriptor. In the context of large musical databases and Electronic Music Distribution, genre is therefore a crucial metadata for the description of music content.

An analogous identity for hyperbolic capacity, conjectured by P. Duren and J. Pfaltzgraff, is also established. We show that elliptic capacity is always smaller than hyperbolic capacity, thus answering a question of P. Duren and R. Kühnau. We prove some geometric estimates for elliptic capacity.
