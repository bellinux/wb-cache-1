5|$|The {{most heavily}} trafficked station is Jernbanetorget, which is {{adjacent}} to Oslo Central Station, closely followed by Majorstuen, the main transfer station between lines {{west of the}} <b>city</b> <b>center</b> and to several lines of the Oslo Tramway, and Nationaltheatret, {{which is in the}} heart of the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> and provides direct transfer to trains on the Drammen Line. All three stations are in the Common Tunnel. The least-used station is Lillevann, which serves the recreational area of Nordmarka. At a distance of , Kolsås is the farthest from the <b>city</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

5|$|From June 1967, Line 9, {{that ran}} along the Lilleaker Line via the Skøyen Line to the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> and onwards along the Østensjø Line, was {{truncated}} to Jernbanetorget, as the Østensjø was converted to a metro line. Calculations showed that if the Lilleaker Line or the Skøyen Line and the Ekeberg Line were connected, between them one tram less would be needed, and the Ekeberg Line would have a service through the <b>city</b> <b>center.</b> After trial runs, the new service to Skøyen was taken into use on 4 May 1969.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of the neighborhoods varies significantly {{from one to another}} and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments.

Many neighborhoods away from the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are {{the focal point of the}} neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen to the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements {{between the city}} and the company, in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> to connect to the suburban tramways east of the <b>city</b> <b>center.</b> Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E
5|$|The station {{functions}} as a major bus terminal for Søndre Nordstrand. Ruter operates feeder bus services to Dal, Brenna, Kantarellen (all no.72) and Bjørndal (no.71).

5|$|The third planned {{expansion}} {{runs from}} the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> southwards, east of the Center–Nesttun Line, serving Haukeland University Hospital. It then heads west, intersecting with the first line at Kronstad, runs through a tunnel before serving the areas of Fyllingsdalen. The line can use parts of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's right of way from the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> to Kronstad, and would feature a station under the hospital, which is Western Norway's largest work place. It is not planned an extension to Loddefjord and Storavatnet from Fyllingsdalen at this time because the time of travel will be {{much higher than the}} direct bus line using the highway to the <b>city</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, plans {{had existed}} for an {{extensive}} rapid transit system, with an underground {{section in the}} <b>city</b> <b>center.</b> Inspired by the successful Oslo Metro that had opened in 1966, similar plans were developed. The proposed network {{was close to the}} current long-term plans for the light rail system, and consisted of three branches from the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> to Flaktveit, Olsvik and the airport. Four-car trains would operate at ten-minute headways. The suggestion was discussed by the city council in 1973, but no decision was taken. As an alternative, expansion of the railway from Bergen to Eidsvåg, Åsane and Nesttun was proposed. Fast commuter trains could then be supplemented with buses.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered {{too far away from}} the <b>city</b> <b>center</b> (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the {{municipal}} bus company Bergen Sporvei made {{a proposal to}} establish {{what they called the}} Lightning Tram, from Varden in Fyllingsdalen via a tunnel to Møhlenpris and the <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> then make a 120° turn and return along the route of the Bergen trolleybus to Birkelundstoppen. The same year, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature proposed a more extensive system, the Environmental Tram, which more closely resembles the current proposals. From the <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> it would run northwards via Åsane to Flaktveit and southwards via Rådal to the airport (not via Nesttun). The southern section would have branches from Hop to Nesttun and Midttun, and from Minde westwards to Fyllingsdalen and Loddefjord. Later, Bergen Sporvei's successor, Gaia Trafikk, proposed building a bus rapid transit.|$|E
