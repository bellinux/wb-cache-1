30|$|Introduction Septic shock {{remains a}} major health issue {{even in our}} industrialized countries, with {{described}} mortality rates between 11.4 and 24.3  % {{in the most recent}} European studies. Several international pediatric therapeutic guidelines have been published and widely diffused. As for epinephrine, they recommend its use as a first-line drug in <b>cold</b> shocks <b>resistant</b> to a well-conducted fluid resuscitation or as a second-line drug in “cold” shocks resistant to dopamine or “warm” shocks resistant to norepinephrine. However, those recommendations are only based on adult or neonatal references that can hardly be applied to children as the physiopathology of children’s septic shock is different on several aspects. Thus, our study constitutes the first specifically pediatric work on epinephrine use in septic shock.|$|R

5000|$|The HMGF {{process is}} {{compatible}} with almost any metal. The most significant benefit of HMGF is that <b>cold</b> form <b>resistant</b> materials become viable for complex forming. Often, alloys are enhanced with expensive materials to enable cold forming and increase machinability, however with HMFG a less expensive alloy can be used, which reduces piece prices. One example {{is the use of}} ferritic stainless steels, like the 1.4512 alloy for exhaust components. Typically, the more expensive austenitic stainless is chosen, like the 1.4301 alloy, for parts requiring complex forming due to its 40% advantage in ambient formability (38.5% vs. 27.4% typical A%).Hardenable metal alloys (e.g. boron steels) can be used in HMGF. In this case the die can be used not only as a shaping tool, but also as a tempering tool, so that the final hardness of the formed tube after forming and cooling is increased.

40|$|A serum-free {{culture of}} dissociated neurons from {{embryonic}} rat hippocampus {{has been established}} as a rapid and quantitative in vitro test system for neurotrophic signals in the mammalian brain. By means of this cell culture bioassay, a novel low molecular weight neurotrophic factor (NTF) could be identified. NTF is essential for in vitro brain neuron development, promoting survival and neurite outgrowth. The diffusible factor is synthesized and secreted into serum-free defined medium by cultured astrocytes from rat cerebral hemispheres. The number of viable neurons responding to NTF by neurite outgrowth {{is dependent on the}} concentration of the factor. Fractionation of astroglial conditioned medium by gel filtration on columns of Sephadex G- 10 recovered biological activity of NTF in a single sharp peak corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of approximately equal to 500.

40|$|Background: The {{fruit of}} Terminalia chebula (Combretaceae) {{has been used}} as {{traditional}} medicine against various human ailments, and has been extensively used in Ayurved, Uanai and Homeopathic medicine. The fruit was one of the Ayurvedic herbs used for the adaptogenic/anti-stress potential. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate anti-stress activity of ethanolic extract of T. chebula fruits. Methods: Anti-stress activity was evaluated in various animal models, namely anoxia stress tolerance and forced swimming test in mice, as well as <b>cold</b> <b>resistant</b> stress and immobilization test in rats. Adult male Wistar rats (200 - 250 g) and Swiss albino mice (25 - 30 g) were used in the study. Withania somnifera powder was taken as reference drug. The vehicle (1 ml/ 100 g), W. somnifera (100 mg/kg) and T. chebula (200 and 500 mg/kg, respectively) were administered orally 1 hour prior to study. Results: The ethanolic extracts of T. chebula significantly increased the swim endurance and anoxia stress tolerance time. <b>Cold</b> <b>resistant</b> stress and immobilization stress altered the various biochemical parameters like glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), plasma corticosterone, blood cell count (RBC and WBC) and weight of organs like liver, spleen, testis, and adrenal glands. The extract reduced stress-induced elevated levels of serum biochemical parameters, blood cell count, prevented alterations in the weight of the liver, adrenal gland and increased the weight of the spleen.

40|$|Insulin and leptin {{act in the}} hypothalamus, {{providing}} robust anorexigenic signals. The {{exposure of}} homeothermic animals to a cold environment leads to increased feeding, accompanied by sustained low levels of insulin and leptin. In the present study, the initial and intermediate steps of the insulin-signaling cascade were evaluated in the hypothalamus of cold-exposed Wistar rats. By immunohistochemistry, most insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate- 2 (IRS- 2) immunoreactivity localized to the arcuate nucleus. Basal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS- 2 were increased in cold-exposed rats compared with rats maintained at room temperature. However, after an acute, peripheral infusion of exogenous insulin, significantly lower increases of IR and IRS- 2 tyrosine phosphorylation were detected in the hypothalamus of cold-exposed rats. Insulin-induced association of p 85 /phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase with IRS- 2, Ser(473) phosphorylation of Akt, and tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK was significantly reduced in the hypothalamus of cold-exposed rats. To test the hypothesis of functional impairment of insulin signaling in the hypothalamus, intracerebroventricularly cannulated rats were acutely treated with insulin, and food ingestion was measured {{over a period of}} 12 h. Cold-exposed animals presented a significantly lower insulin-induced reduction in food consumption compared with animals maintained at room temperature. Hence, the present studies reveal that animals exposed to <b>cold</b> are <b>resistant,</b> both at the molecular and the functional level, to the actions of insulin in the hypothalamus...|$|R
40|$|Although {{international}} {{guidelines for}} hemodynamic support of pediatric septic shock suggest considering the potent calcium sensitizer inodilator levosimendan as a second-line inotropic agent to treat <b>cold</b> hypodynamic shock <b>resistant</b> to catecholamines, clinical experience in septic infants is lacking. We report the beneficial effects of levosimendan infusion in 2 infants (39 and 64 days old) with low cardiac output septic shock (ejection fraction, 29 % and 33 %; fractional shortening, 10 % and 16 % respectively) refractory to volume replacement {{and to the}} catecholamines dopamine and dobutamine. Levosimendan infusion (0. 15 µg/kg/min) promptly increased both patients' myocardial contractility and improved tissue perfusion, thereby reducing lactate levels and increasing urine output. The only adverse effect was moderate hypotension in one infant, who reversed by adding norepinephrine to levosimendan. This clinical experience confirms the potential beneficial effects of levosimendan infusion to restore hemodynamics in infants with low cardiac output septic shock resistant to catecholamines...|$|R
40|$|The {{complement}} is a {{soluble component}} of the innate immunity, with C 3 playing a central role. C 3 covalently bind to any activating surface resulting in its permanent labelling. The C 3 tag is then recognised by multiple cells {{of the immune system}} to ensure increased uptake and co-stimulation of the adaptive immunity. The measles virus (MeV) fusion F protein activates the alternative. The original observation of <b>cold</b> detergent <b>resistant</b> membranes sedimenting at a higher density than the membrane rafts lead us to analyse the respective distribution of F, CD 46 and C 55 molecules in what we call heavy rafts (HR) and in the classical low density membrane rafts (R). The correlation of F proteins association with HR fraction and the C 3 b deposition argue for HR-type microdomains to be a site highly favourable for the uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway in the absence of CD 46 and CD 55 in close vicinity. A new heterozygous C 3 deficit (OMIM 120700) was identified in a 2 -year-old male suffering from pyogenic infections with undetectable CH 50 and C 3 values. The molecular abnormality associate a paternal allele with the missense mutation c. 1648 T>C (p. Ser 550 Pro) and an apparently null maternal allele. This C 3 deficit is associated with the following defects: low maturation of dendritic cells, lack of circulating memory B cells and inability of CD 4 + T cells to differentiate into cTreg type 1 LYON 1 -BU.

40|$|Nucleolin {{is present}} in diverse {{cellular}} compartments and {{is involved in a}} variety of cellular processes from nucleolar structure and function to intracellular trafficking, cell adhesion and migration. Recently, nucleolin has been localized at the mature centriole where it is involved in microtubule nucleation and anchoring. Although this new function of nucleolin linked to microtubule regulation has been identified, the global effects of nucleolin on microtubule dynamics have not been addressed yet. In the present study, we analyzed the roles of nucleolin protein levels on global microtubule dynamics by tracking the EB 3 microtubule plus end binding protein in live cells. We have found that during microtubule growth phases, nucleolin affects both the speed and life time of polymerization and by analyzing catastrophe events, we showed that nucleolin reduces catastrophe frequency. This new property of nucleolin was then confirmed in a cold induced microtubule depolymerization experiment in which we have found that <b>cold</b> <b>resistant</b> microtubules were totally destabilized in nucleolin depleted cells. Altogether, our data demonstrate a new function of nucleolin on microtubule stabilization, thus bringing novel insights into understanding the multifunctional properties of nucleolin in healthy and cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae, SKUSE), is an {{important}} threat to public health due to its rapid spread and its potential as a vector. The eggs of Ae. albopictus are the most <b>cold</b> <b>resistant</b> life stage and thus, the cold hardiness of eggs is used {{to predict the future}} occurrence of the species in distribution models. However, the mechanism of cold hardiness has yet to be revealed. To address this question, we analyzed the layers of diapausing and cold acclimatized eggs of a temperate population of Ae. albopictus in a full factorial test design using transmission electron microscopy. We reviewed the hypotheses that a thickened wax layer or chorion is the cause of cold hardiness but found no evidence. As a result of the induced diapause, the thickness of the dark endochorion as a layer of high electron density and thus an assumed location for waxes was decreasing. We therefore hypothesized a qualitative alteration of the wax layer due to compaction. Cold acclimation was causing an increase in the thickness of the middle serosa cuticle indicating a detachment of serosa membrane from the endochorion as a potential adaptation strategy to isolate inoculating ice formations in the inter-membranous space...|$|E
40|$|The early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo {{contains}} abundant transcripts for two �- and two �-tubulins, {{raising the}} question of whether each isoform performs specialized functions or simply contributes to total tubulin levels. Our identification of two recessive, complementing alleles of a �-tubulin that disrupt nuclear-centrosome centration and rotation in the early embryo originally suggested that this tubulin, tbb- 2, has specialized functions. However, embryos from tbb- 2 deletion worms do not have defects in nuclear-centrosome centration and rotation suggesting that the complementing alleles are not null mutations. Both complementing alleles have distinct effects on microtubule dynamics and show allele-specific interactions with the two embryonically expressed �-tubulins: One of the alleles causes microtubules to be <b>cold</b> stable and <b>resistant</b> to the microtubule-depolymerizing drug benomyl, whereas the other causes cell cycle-specific defects in microtubule polymerization. Gene-specific RNA interference targeting all four embryonically expressed tubulin genes singly and in all double combinations showed that the tubulin isoforms in the early embryo are largely functionally redundant with the exception of tbb- 2. tbb- 2 is required for centrosome stabilization during anaphase of the first cell division, suggesting that tbb- 2 may be specialized for interactions with the cell cortex...|$|R
40|$|A cell-suspension culture {{obtained}} from the hybrid Eucalyptus gunnii/Eucalyptus globulus was hardened by exposure to lower temperatures, whereas in the same conditions cells from a hybrid with a more frost-sensitive genotype, Eucalyptus cypellocarpa/Eucalyptus globulus, {{were not able to}} acclimate. During the <b>cold</b> exposure the <b>resistant</b> cells accumulated soluble sugars, in particular fructose and sucrose, with a limited increase in cell osmolality. In contrast, the cell suspension that was unable to acclimate did not accumulate soluble sugars in response to the same cold treatment. To an extent similar to that induced after a cold acclimation, frost-hardiness of the cells increased after a 14 -h incubation with specific soluble sugars such as sucrose, raffinose, fructose, and mannitol. Such hardening was also observed for long-term cultures in mannitol-enriched medium. This cryoprotective effect of sugars without exposure to lower temperatures was observed in both the resistant and the sensitive genotypes. Mannitol {{was one of the most}} efficient carbohydrates for the cryoprotection of eucalyptus. The best hardiness (a 2. 7 -fold increase in relative freezing tolerance) was obtained for the resistant cells by the cumulative effect of cold-induced acclimation and mannitol treatment. This positive effect of certain sugars on eucalyptus freezing tolerance was not colligative, since it was independent of osmolality and total sugar content...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{improvement}} for enhanced {{disease resistance}} in fish is an increasingly utilized approach to mitigate endemic infectious disease in aquaculture. In domesticated salmonid populations, large phenotypic variation in disease resistance {{has been identified}} but the genetic basis for altered responsiveness remains unclear. We previously reported three generations of selection and phenotypic validation of a bacterial <b>cold</b> water disease <b>resistant</b> line of rainbow trout, designated ARS-Fp-R. This line has higher survival after infection by either standardized laboratory challenge or natural challenge as compared to two reference lines, designated ARS-Fp-C (control) and ARS-Fp-S (susceptible). In this study, we utilized 1. 1 g fry from the three genetic lines and performed RNA-seq to measure transcript abundance from the whole body of naive and Flavobacterium psychrophilum infected fish at day 1 (early time-point) and at day 5 post-challenge (onset of mortality). Sequences from twenty-four libraries were mapped onto the rainbow trout genome reference transcriptome of 46, 585 predicted protein coding mRNAs that included 2, 633 putative immune-relevant gene transcripts. A total of 1, 884 genes (4. 0 % genome) exhibited differential transcript abundance between infected and mock-challenged fish (FDR< 0. 05) that included chemokines, complement components, tnf receptor superfamily members, interleukins, nod-like receptor family members, and genes involved in metabolism and wound healing. The largest number of differentially expressed genes occurred on day 5 post-infection between naive and challenged ARS-Fp-S line fish correlating with high bacterial load. After excluding the effect of infection, we identified twenty-one differentially expressed genes between the three genetic lines. In summary, these data indicate global transcriptome differences between genetic lines of naive animals as well as differentially regulated transcriptional responses to infection...|$|R
