25|$|Due to {{anatomical}} {{and physiological}} differences, injuries in {{children need to}} be approached differently from those in adults. Accidents are {{the leading cause of}} death in children between 1 and 14 years old. In the United States, approximately sixteen million <b>children</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> an emergency department due to some form of injury every year, with boys being more frequently injured than girls by a ratio of 2:1. The world's five most common unintentional injuries in children as of 2008 are road crashes, drowning, burns, falls, and poisoning.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} runs {{a number}} of public elementary and secondary-level schools, as youth in Guatemala do not fully participate in education. These schools are free, though the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and transportation makes them less accessible to the poorer segments of society and significant numbers of poor children do not attend school. Many middle and upper-class <b>children</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> private schools. Guatemala has one public university (USAC or Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala), and fourteen private ones (see List of universities in Guatemala). USAC was the first university in Guatemala {{and one of the}} first Universities of America.|$|E

Only one in two <b>children</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school, and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine and electricity remain in short supply. Less than 2% of the population has electricity in its homes. Burundi's GDP grew around 4% annually in 2006–12. Political stability {{and the end of the}} civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has increased, but underlying weaknesses – a high poverty rate, poor education rates, a weak legal system, a poor transport network, overburdened utilities and low administrative capacity – risk undermining planned economic reforms.|$|E
25|$|The Infant and Junior schools {{today have}} over 750 pupils, until as {{recently}} as 1955 there were no schools in Dorridge, with pupils travelling to Bentley Heath, Hockley Heath, Knowle or Packwood to get an education. In 1955 Dorridge Junior School was built and by 1963 an Infant School was built. These were joined by the Catholic School of St. George and Teresa. The secondary education is mainly provided by Arden School in nearby Knowle, which now also has a sixth form centre. The sixth form buildings were completed in 2007 with additions being made every year. A considerable number of <b>children</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> private schools in Solihull, Warwick or Birmingham or to grammar schools in Birmingham or Stratford.|$|E
25|$|Currently Nigerian {{women are}} making many advancements within their society. In recent years, three male {{dominated}} professions, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Nigerian Bar Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, have been led by female presidents. The subsequent {{creation of the}} National Commission for Women and a ministerial portfolio for Women Affairs provide additional avenues {{for the promotion of}} women's educational issues and the enhancement of {{the role of women in}} national development by way of a statutory body and a Ministry. Today, more <b>children</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school and learn to read and write than in previous decades. As a result, younger persons are much more likely to be literate than older persons. In a survey done by the International Education Statistics measured Nigerian literacy across different 5-year age groups. Among persons aged 15 to 19 years - those who were of primary school age in the 1990s - the literacy rate is 70%. Among persons 80 years or older, only 13% are literate. Additionally, the gap between boys and girls aged 15 to 19 is only 11%.|$|E

With assistance from her fellow babies, following a complicated plan, she succeeds and wildly distributes pacifiers to all the small children. Homer retrieves her, {{and he and his}} <b>children</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> attend the musical. Homer immediately falls into boredom, but he perks up when Marge appears on stage. While Homer slowly learns the show's plot, he appears sad. [...] At the end of the musical, Marge receives a warm reaction from the crowd, but she misinterprets Homer's sadness for boredom. She confronts him with frustration and hostility, but Homer is able to explain that he was genuinely moved by the play. He feels for Blanche's situation, and he realizes Marge's feelings along with it. He expresses his intentions to be the husband that she deserves—someone to have in her life who loves her—not like Stanley who neglects and mistreats his wife. Marge realizes that Homer really did watch the musical, and the two happily leave the theater.|$|E
500|$|Whenever {{there is}} talk about new {{policies}} regarding new work time policies, there is often the argument for longer work hours {{in exchange for a}} shorter work week. For example, many are in favor of longer work hours such as [...] "three ten-hour days or four eight-hour days". However, this is often not the best work hours for people who take care of children, because <b>children</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school for perhaps six hours a day, not eight or ten. Caretakers would prefer the opposite - shorter hours and longer weeks, such as six hour work days for six times a week, with limits on evening work and overtime, as well as flexible schedules. In order to lessen the burden of taking care of children and domestic duties as well as working in the paid sector, workplaces should consider policies that take into account the preferred work hours of caretakers. In addition, it is often the case now that many workers juggle domestic work and paid work. In order to get the most effective workers, companies should consider changing their policies in order to attract the best people in the field.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "black flight" [...] {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} African-American parents in some cities moving their children from public schools to charter schools or suburban schools featuring open enrollment. This {{has taken place in}} a variety of places, including the Twin Cities and the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Other issues in the city proper of Dallas include an increase in immigration of Latinos. In the 1980s and 1990s, the school district had a majority of black students. Today it has a preponderance of Latino students, in a kind of ethnic succession that reflects residential changes in the city. Latinos constitute 68 percent of students, while blacks are 26 percent, and whites are 5 percent. In addition, 87 percent of the Latino students qualify as [...] "economically disadvantaged," [...] and many are just learning English. Middle-class blacks are moving to suburbs in a repetition of earlier migration of middle-class whites. The issues of schools and residential patterns are strongly related to economic class, as well as parents' preferring that their <b>children</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> schools with native speakers of English.|$|E
