5000|$|Reliance's company slogan {{for many}} years was [...] "Quality is our policy." [...] Yet {{for the most part}} the company engaged in {{relatively}} little advertising directed at the general public since most of its business was placed through independent insurance agents and brokers. As a consequence the company was not as widely known as some other insurers of comparable size who undertook more mass marketing. One Reliance ad, however, that ran in trade publications in the 1970s, was so outright sexist by today's standards as to be humorous in retrospect. This full-page ad (as seen here https://docs.google.com/View?docid=d9jbs8t_180fxrv9nhq&pageview=1&hgd=1&hl=en), aimed at insurance agents, featured the catch phrase, [...] "Have we got a girl for you!" [...] and depicts an attractive young female, who is identified as [...] "The <b>Claim</b> <b>Service</b> Representative." [...] The ad then directs the reader to various parts of the woman's anatomy and asserts how it will aid the agent in handling claims. The caption to the line drawn to woman's forehead reads, [...] "Brains. Our girls are a lot more than just a pretty face. They're all well educated." [...] The caption to the line drawn to her ankle reads, [...] "Well-turned ankle. No use to you, but it's pretty to look at." [...] The ad goes on to encourage the targeted insurance agent to [...] "Think about it, if you had an accident, wouldn't you appreciate a chat with a pretty girl? Of course you would." [...] What the ad doesn't say but which was not only true of Reliance but most every insurer at the time, their employees in the often hectic and stressful work environment of handling insurance claims were largely staffed by young women. This not only gave the agent [...] "an extra pair" [...] of hands but also kept salary costs comparatively low.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to explore individuals' insurance purchasing behaviour and their attitude towards purchase of probabilistic insurance. Primary {{data collected from}} questionnaires {{with a sample of}} 123 university students in the UK were used to conduct the research. Empirical results revealed that the most influential element for consumers' decisions making on the choice of insurer is service quality. <b>Claim</b> <b>service</b> is {{a vital part of the}} insurance service, as consumers actually buy the commitment from their insurers. Probabilistic insurance is a topical issue in the insurance industry, as there is a possibility that insurance companies would not pay claims due to insolvency or other reasons. The findings of this study show that individuals behave in accordance with the predictions of both expected utility theory and prospect theory, that some respondents prefer standard insurance to probabilistic insurance policy while some others prefer probabilistic insurance to standard insurance policy. This study also finds that individual's risk aversion is not static when facing different level of risks and they require more than 1 % reduction in premium for a compensation of 1 % increase in risk...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a methodology}} for establishing reserves for {{the portion of}} loss adjustment expense as-sociated {{with the cost of}} claim adjusters. The actuar-ial literature contains very little material on how to estimate unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) reserves. The literature briefly mentions “transaction-based ” methods that require claim department time studies. However, many feel that the improvement in estimating ULAE reserves does not justify the high cost of performing such a study. Fortunately, most claim departments of major insurance carriers and third party administrators now utilize sophisticated automated work measurement tools that may capture the type of data {{that can be used to}} perform an automated time study. The first section describes a process that can be used to perform the work-study, including a discus-sion of the technical and practical issues in conduct-ing such a study. The second section shows how the results of the study can be utilized to determine claim adjuster expense reserves. Other potential applications of the claim standards will be discussed, including pric-ing unbundled <b>claim</b> <b>service,</b> allocating claim depart-ment expense to line of business for statutory and man-agement reporting purposes, and monitoring claim de-partment expenses.

40|$|Productivity and {{variation}} is strongly connected. There {{are a number}} of reasons why variation occurs and it is present in both arrivals and processes. In common for all types of {{variation is}} that it will reduce the ability to achieve productivity and therefore is a main reason for long throughput times in production flows. In the service industry humans are the main producers, which contributes to a higher overall variation compared to the production industry. The variations are therefore important to manage. A service process that will gain from short throughput times is the insurance claim process, since throughput times in these processes are important for both economic and customer satisfaction related reasons. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore how insurance <b>claim</b> <b>service</b> processes can be organised in order to minimize variation and gain shorter throughput times. The study is performed as a case study at the Swedish insurance company Folksam’s flow of insurance claims regarding injury in accidents. In a production flow, measurements are important for gaining a perception of the reality and how well it is performing regarding to expectations. The insurance claim process flow was found to be of high complexity and therefore this study has used computer simulations combined with numeric calculations. This has shown that variations in arrivals together with variations in process times create a situation where some processes will have an ever-increasing queue, while others are starving. The process variation is mainly natural, since it’s dependent on personal circumstances of the administrator. The insurance claims nature and complexity also strongly influence the service time of the processes. It could be said that the service times of processes is not constant nor the same between administrators. Waste in the process flow mainly occurs because of set rules for distribution of cases between administrators, which is inflexible. This is the main reason for an uneven distribution regarding capacity. This variation is an example of artificial variation, which could be eliminated. Every administrator got a unique queue that it serves. The waiting time is highly fluctuating depending on the mentioned variation in both arrivals and processes. The principle first come - first served is therefore non-existent for this particular flow, which is the reason for highly fluctuating throughput times. An imbalanced flow is therefore created. In addition the process flow are divided between two offices where variations in capacity between these offices highly influence waiting and throughput times. The conclusion from this study is that an increase of flexibility in the process flow is needed in order to be able to respond to variations. The study has shown that the number of queues is effecting the throughput times. A smaller number of queues are connected to faster throughput times. This can be linked to gained flexibility since the oldest case will be served first. An organisation along minimal number of queues is therefore desirable. Administrators can also be more flexible, which will better respond to the variations in arrivals. The number of steps in the process can therefore also be said to have an effect on throughput times. The conclusion indicates that an effective process flow in the service industry is dependent on continuous measurements and follow-ups of inflow, queue-status and throughput times. For an effective flow Folksam are in need of new measurements. To measure the inflow is a condition for production planning. Queue-status facilitates prioritizing and indicates under or over capacity, which is a condition for a proactive process flow. Throughput time is the measurement that will tell most about the total function of the process and is therefore a critical measure to continuously evaluate.

40|$|Globalization {{phenomenon}} {{is not only}} effected organisations and shape of managements it is also effected expectation ofcustomers and labourforce by changing and shaping these factors. Anyway organisations are more aware, know what they want,allocate good and bad service and also we are vis a vis to customer structure of giving reaction if it is necessary against to badservice. Therefore all studies in organisation focused on customer. Organisations neglecting customer focused service have gotdifficulties for their life and competition. Customer focused services can secure with employees which are motiveted and has got work satisfaction. Consequently inestablishments with best organized, best facilities but negative employee attitude would be getting reason of bad perception oncustomers, but avarage organization with positive attitude of employee it would be getting customer pleasure. Regarding to enterprises it is occured o concept “Key Efficiency Scale”. This {{is not enough for}} measuring all phisical output. Otherwise it is measuring product or services which are big part of company profession. For example some insuarance companiesefficiency of <b>claim</b> <b>service</b> is measuring with number of claims to whom study duration. Hospitals are kind of organisations which have got interaction with public authority and social domination groups. From thisspeciality the management of hospitals also complex and difficult. Althogh speedy population increase, extension of average livingduration, rising of health aware, changing of patients demand, incresing necessity of medical practicing, excessive competition,high technology become widespread of medical area. All these things are reason of that hospital manage importance with effectiveand productive shape. Therefore it is necessitate to secure productivity increasing. It must be firstly doing increasing thelabourforce efficiency. This research realized the aim of determinig which demografic factors effected to hospital employees lobour forceproductivity. Main weight of this research is Afyonkarahisar Kocatepe University Hospital health employees. Total personel are 720 but it is reached 457 personel sampling of total personel for this study. It is more difficult to measure labor productivity in service organizations than organizations which produce goods. Researchhas two main variable groups as depended and independed variables. Independed variables of research includes age, sex, marital status, education level, work experience at hospital. Dependedvariables of research includes 30 judgment. Survey form was used at research in order to collect data. Master thesis of Ozkoc (2007) was used as a main source forpreparing survey form. Confidence analysis of survey was determined, and value of Cronbach alpha constant was found 91, 3. In addition to frequency distruption of taken variables, performing aims of these tests were written at analysis. Discriminantanalysis, ANOVA and pearlsons correlation methods were used at analysis of collected data. Labor of hospital was seperated to four main gropus in detail for research. First group includes nurses. Second groupincludes technicians. Radiology technicians and laboratory workers were included at this group. Third group includes secretaries. At this group labour includes information workers, patient reservation workers and santral workers. Fourth group includespatient keepers and cleaning personnel. In the frame of sex of workers, canonical discriminant function has no significant value as a resultt of Wilk’s Lambda analysis. This shows there is no difference between behaviour of hospital workers in the view of organizational factors affecting laborproductivity at different sex. We can say that both male and female groups have similar working and labor ideas in anorganization. In this view culture of organization is also an important variable effecting ideas of different sex groups. In the frame of marital status of workers, canonical discriminant function has no significant value as a resultt of Wilk’sLambda analysis. This shows there is no difference between behaviour of hospital workers in the view of organizational factorsaffecting labor productivity at different marital status. In the frame of age groups, age and labor productivity has significant relation in only “labor productivity reduces if managersignore view and ideas of workers” judgement (p=, 036). This result shows that different age groups think different in the view ofattempting to management. We can say that workers having more experience give more importance to their ideas in anorganization. Ignorance of workers ideas may reduce job satisfiction also. This situation also decreases labor productivity. Multi-comparing analysises were performed in order to determine in which age group there is a difference and direction ofthis difference. As a result of this analysis, this difference was found betweeen 19 - 24 age group and 35 - 44 age group. All agegroups agree that lack evaluation of performance causes low productivity and motivation. On the other hand, workers at 19 - 24 age group and 35 - 44 age group showed same idea more strongly. This result is also seen at positive sign of mean difference. Having been looked to demographic properties, there is significant difference between workers in the view of age andeducation status, whether there is not a significant relation in the view of sex and marital status. This results show that new laborhas an intellectual idea of productivity than traditional views. Namely, both male and female workers have the same idea, and theirideas show difference with only education and age status. As known age means experience as well as education. Conclusion is that organisational structure in Afyonkarahisar Kocatepe University employees it is seen directly relationsbetween personel situations and their productivity. In developed world, it is important for an organization to find out its problems and its ways of productivity increasing itself. Especially hospitals are important organizations for social health and environmental health. Thus, this kind of researches in thefield of health management directed to labor at health sector may increase living standarts of people. In future researches,judgements of this research may increased, survey may be applied to more workers, and perspectives of this research may beextended to other components of hospital and health sector. This reaserch also may be seen as a data source for furtherresearches. It must be noticed that attempting to management is {{the most important part of}} increasing of productivity atorganizations. For this reason, further researches may be directed towards to this directio...|$|E
