40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of different fracture criteria on the chip formation process. focusing on the formation of segmented chips and what happens around the cutting edge. Furthermore, it is investigated how well the finite element model is able to capture the transition from continuous <b>to</b> segmented <b>chip</b> formation in alloy 718. Machining alloy 718 at lower cutting speeds (below 50 m/min) the chip produced is long and continuous. At higher cutting speeds (above 100 m/min) the chip produced is segmented. The conclusion from this study is that the transition from continuous <b>chip</b> <b>to</b> segmented <b>chip</b> is caused by both thermal softening and material damage. Furthermore it is concluded that a fracture criterion with a hydrostatic dependency shall be used for accurate modelling of chip segmentation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
