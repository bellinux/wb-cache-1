25|$|The {{materials}} used in sculpture are diverse, changing throughout history. The classic materials, with outstanding durability, are metal, especially bronze, stone and pottery, with wood, bone and antler less durable but cheaper options. Precious materials such as gold, silver, jade, and ivory are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in chryselephantine statues. More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including hardwoods (such as oak, box/boxwood, and lime/linden); terracotta and other ceramics, wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the impressions of cylinder seals and engraved gems), and <b>cast</b> <b>metals</b> such as pewter and zinc (spelter). But {{a vast number of}} other materials have been used as part of sculptures, in ethnographic and ancient works as much as modern ones.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinction}} between the decorative and the fine arts has essentially arisen from the post-Renaissance art of the West, where the distinction is {{for the most part}} meaningful. This distinction is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most highly regarded works– or even all works– include those in decorative media. [...] For example, Islamic art in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, often using geometric and plant forms, as does the art of many traditional cultures. The {{distinction between}} decorative and fine arts is not very useful for appreciating Chinese art, and neither is it for understanding Early Medieval art in Europe. In that period in Europe, fine arts such as manuscript illumination and monumental sculpture existed, but the most prestigious works tended to be in goldsmith work, in <b>cast</b> <b>metals</b> such as bronze, or in other techniques such as ivory carving. Large-scale wall-paintings were much less regarded, crudely executed, and rarely mentioned in contemporary sources. They were probably seen as an inferior substitute for mosaic, which for this period must be viewed as a fine art, though in recent centuries mosaics have tended to be seen as decorative. The term [...] "ars sacra" [...] ("sacred arts") is sometimes used for medieval Christian art done in metal, ivory, textiles, and other high-value materials but not for rarer secular works from that period.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the core {{survival}} rates (CSRs) of <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> versus resin core restorations luted with adhesive resin cement, as well as to determine the risk factors for core failure. Materials and Methods: Nine hundred ninety-one patients (2, 124 cores) who received either <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> or resin cores luted with adhesive resin cement at the Fixed Prosthodontic Clinic of Okayama University Dental Hospital between April 1988 and December 1991 and whose structured clinical core record was filled appropriately comprised the study subjects. The clinical core record included information regarding patient age, sex, core restoration type, tooth location, tooth type, remaining coronal dentin, and root canal form. CSRs, as well as causes for failure, were analyzed 15 years postinsertion. Since 381 patients lacked data regarding predictors for core failure, a subsample of 610 patients (1, 053 cores) was used for the subsequent risk factor analysis. Results: The cumulative CSR of resin cores (78. 7 %) was significantly higher than that of <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> cores (55. 4 %; log-rank test, P<. 0001). The Cox proportional hazards test revealed that sex (male, P<. 0001), absence of remaining coronal dentin (P=. 0057), core restoration type (<b>cast</b> <b>metal,</b> P=. 0186), and higher age at core insertion (P=. 0380) were significant predictors for core failure. The incidence of complications, such as core loosening (P=. 0016) and tooth extraction (P<. 0001), was significantly higher in <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> cores. Conclusions: <b>Cast</b> <b>metal</b> cores were associated with a significantly lower CSR than resin cores, and significant risk factors for core failure were sex (male), absence of remaining coronal dentin, core restoration type (<b>cast</b> <b>metal),</b> and higher age at core insertion.

50|$|Hydrogen is {{a common}} {{contaminant}} for most <b>cast</b> <b>metals.</b> It forms {{as a result of}} material reactions or from water vapor or machine lubricants.

50|$|In other cases, such as {{mixed metals}} in piping (for example, copper, cast iron and other <b>cast</b> <b>metals),</b> {{galvanic}} corrosion {{will contribute to}} accelerated corrosion of parts of the system. Corrosion inhibitors such as sodium nitrite or sodium molybdate can be injected into these systems to reduce the galvanic potential. However, the application of these corrosion inhibitors must be monitored closely. If the application of corrosion inhibitors increases the conductivity of the water within the system, the galvanic corrosion potential can be greatly increased.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Endodontically treated {{teeth with}} {{extensive}} coronary destruction require posts and cores to enable prosthetic restoration. Despite the {{increasing use of}} prefabricated posts, <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> posts and cores are still widely used. The quality of the latter is important for the longevity of restorative treatment, and failure can occur if the fundamental principles are not followed. Objective To radiographically evaluate the prosthetic principles of 1000 <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> post-and-core restorations performed in single-rooted teeth and their coherence with the principles used for their confection. Material and method Digital periapical radiographs of 1000 endodontically treated, single-rooted teeth with <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> posts and cores were selected from the collection of a radiology clinic (Centro de Imagem, Aracaju/SE, Brazil). The images were analyzed using a measurement software (ImageJ, USA) in accordance with the fundamental prosthetic principles: length and diameter of the post, ratio between post and bone crest, contiguity of post to the root canal, gap between post and the remaining root canal filling, amount of remaining root canal filling, and absence of periapical lesion. The data were qualitatively analyzed, classified into ideal and not ideal, and submitted to the chi-square test (α= 0. 05). Result Only 6. 7 % of the <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> posts analyzed were satisfactorily fabricated. Conclusion Many prosthetic criteria are neglected during the manufacturing of <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> post and cores, resulting in inadequate work that may compromise the longevity of restorative treatments...|$|R
