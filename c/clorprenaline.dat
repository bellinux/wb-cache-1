40|$|The title {{molecular}} salt, C 11 H 17 ClNO+&# 183;C 7 H 5 O 3 &# 8722;, {{was obtained}} by the reaction of racemic <b>clorprenaline</b> and 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid. In the crystal, the components are connected by O&# 8212;H [...] . O and N&# 8212;H [...] . O hydrogen bonds, resulting in a two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} is described for separating seven beta-adrenergic blocking agents (atenolol, celiprolol, <b>clorprenaline,</b> fenoterol, metoprolol, propranolol, terbutaline) and clenbuterol (sympathomimetic beta- 2 receptor stimulating agonist, decongestant and bronchodilator, illicit anabolic used in athletics) by CE with UV detection. In order to simultaneously separate all analytes, Tris-H 3 PO 4 solution was applied containing titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) as BGEs. The effects of important factors, such as concentration of TiO 2. NPs, optimum pH, run buffer concentration, and separation voltage, were investigated {{so as to}} achieve best CE separation. The eight analytes could be well separated applying a separation voltage of 15 kV in 75 mM Tris-H 3 PO 4 buffer at a pH of 2. 40, containing 6. 0 x 10 (- 6) g/mL TiO 2 NPs. Under these optimal conditions, the RSDs for peak areas and for migration times were less than 2. 7 and 2. 3 %, respectively. The detection limits were 0. 1 mu g/mL for celiprolol, 0. 1 mu g/mL for propranolol, 0. 2 mu g/mL for fenoterol, 1. 0 mu g/mL for atenolol, 1. 0 mu g/mL, for clenbuterol, 1. 0 mu g/mL for <b>clorprenaline,</b> 1. 0 mu g/mL for metoprolol, and 1. 0 mu g/mL for terbutaline. The proposed method was successfully applied for the rapid CE determination of the frequently applied antihypertensive P-blocking compounds atenolol, metoprolol, terbutaline, and propranolol in pharmaceutical tablets...|$|E
30|$|A novel {{modified}} {{ion selective electrode}} {{based on}} Fe 2 O 3 -clorprenaline/tetraphenylborate nanospheres (Fe 2 O 3 -CLPT NSs) as electroactive materials for the determination of <b>clorprenaline</b> hydrochloride (CLP) is described. The α-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis, then self-assembled on CLP/tetraphenylborate (TPB) to form Fe 2 O 3 -CLPT NSs, which were used as a potentiometric electrode for analyte determination innovatively. The Fe 2 O 3 -CLPT NSs modified electrode exhibited a wider concentration range from 1.0 [*]×[*] 10 − 7 to 1.0 [*]×[*] 10 − 1  mol/L and a lower detection limit of 3.7 [*]×[*] 10 − 8  mol/L compared with unmodified electrodes. The selectivity of the modified electrode was evaluated by fixed interference method. The good performance of the modified electrode such as wide pH range (2.4 – 6.7), fast response time (15  s), and adequate lifetime (14  weeks) indicate {{the utility of the}} modified electrode for evaluation of CLP content in various real samples. Finally, the modified electrode was successfully employed to detect CLP in pork samples with satisfactory results. These results demonstrated the Fe 2 O 3 -CLPT NSs modified electrode to be a functional and convenient method to the field of potentiometry determination of CLP in real samples.|$|E
