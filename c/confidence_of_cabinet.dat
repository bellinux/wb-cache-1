5000|$|In Queensland in 1987, {{during a}} tense period of {{leadership}} succession, the Governor of Queensland, Sir Walter Campbell, exercised reserve power in declining to exercise vice-regal {{authority on the}} advice of the Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Campbell initially refused to redistribute ministerial portfolios on the sole advice of the premier, who lacked the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> his <b>cabinet.</b> Subsequently, during a period when Queensland had a [...] "Premier who is not leader" [...] and the governing party had a [...] "Leader who is not Premier", there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by Campbell, in dismissing the premier {{in the absence of a}} parliamentary motion <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> Ultimately, Campbell was praised for his handling of the undesirable situation.|$|R
5000|$|The prime {{minister}} can also submit a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> their <b>cabinet</b> to the Sejm. A vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the <b>cabinet</b> can be granted {{by at least}} half of all of the Sejm's deputies. Similarly, if the council of ministers loses its majority support within the Sejm, the cabinet can be forced to resign in a constructive vote <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> The motion must be approved by at least 46 deputies, and then passed by a majority vote. In such an event, a new {{prime minister}} must be simultaneously appointed. [...] Additionally, the premier must submit the resignation <b>of</b> their <b>cabinet</b> at the first sitting of a newly elected parliament, as well as after a vote <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> has been successfully passed against the council of ministers or upon their own individual resignation. In the event of the prime minister's resignation or death, the president can either accept or refuse the <b>cabinet's</b> resignation <b>of</b> office.|$|R
25|$|All parties {{within the}} Swedish {{opposition}} {{have opened up}} for a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> against <b>cabinet</b> ministers Anna Johansson, Anders Ygeman and Peter Hultqvist in order to remove them from office, with some parties calling for vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> against Löfven as Prime Minister. Such a vote would, if supported by several parties, result in a removal <b>of</b> the Löfven <b>cabinet.</b> In a press conference on 27 July Löfven announced a government reshuffling with Ygeman and Johansson resigning. He also stated that he would not resign himself over the incident.|$|R
50|$|This {{tradition}} of controversy involving Campbell {{and the government}} came to crisis in 1987 when there was internal strife within the National Party between Bjelke-Petersen and his cabinet which almost caused a constitutional crisis in Queensland governance. There had already been murmurs in early 1987 of a vice-regal intervention in Queensland politics when The Australian newspaper in March featured a front page article detailing the threat by State Opposition leader Nev Warburton to ask Governor Campbell to dismiss the Bjelke-Petersen ministry over allegations of illegal conduct by the Government. These suggestions came to nothing. However, {{later in the year}} when Bjelke-Petersen lost the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> his <b>cabinet,</b> the question was again raised as to what role Campbell as governor would play {{in the event of a}} constitutional crisis.|$|R
50|$|The National Assembly has {{the power}} to impeach and remove these officers. The prime {{minister}} can only be removed by the house in a vote <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> Members <b>of</b> the <b>Cabinet</b> are not appointed by the National Assembly, but they can be removed by the National Assembly in a similar process. This time the vote <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> is allowed by both or individual houses. Judges and independent government officers can also be removed by both houses of the National Assembly.|$|R
50|$|In {{the tsunami}} {{disaster}} on Boxing Day 2004, thousands of Swedish tourists in Thailand {{and other parts}} of south-east Asia were affected - Sweden was the western country hardest struck by the catastrophe. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs was unmanned due to the holidays, and the lack of government action caused a political scandal which shook the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> Persson's <b>cabinet,</b> not least foreign minister Laila Freivalds. She resigned after another scandal, where she had been informed in advance of a Swedish Security Service shutdown of the Sweden Democrats' web site featuring the infamous Muhammad cartoons. Swedish press noted that this was the first case of Swedish government censorship due to foreign threat since World War II. Sweden is one of few western countries where these cartoons have not been published in any mainstream mass media, but was still affected though the proximity to Denmark - Swedish-Danish dairy producer Arla suffered from middle-eastern boycotts, and when Minister for International Development Cooperation Carin Jämtin went to Sudan to investigate the Darfur genocide, the governor of Darfur used the cartoons as a pretext not to receive her.|$|R
50|$|For instance, {{under the}} new Constitution, the President of the Council {{was the leader of}} the {{executive}} branch (Prime Minister of France). The President of the French Republic, elected by the Parliament (the National Assembly and the Council of the Republic), played a symbolic role. His main power was to propose a Prime Minister, who was subject to election by the National Assembly before forming a Cabinet. Only the Prime Minister could invoke a parliamentary vote on legitimacy <b>of</b> the <b>Cabinet.</b> The Prime Minister was also {{the only member of the}} executive able to demand a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> from the National Assembly (in the Third Republic any minister could call for a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence).</b> The <b>Cabinet</b> could be dismissed if an absolute majority of the National Assembly's members voted against the Cabinet. Finally, the National Assembly could be dissolved after two ministerial crises in the legislature.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, while the Prime Minister {{does not have}} to ask for vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> after <b>cabinet's</b> {{formation}} and they can depend their legitimacy on the President's assignment as Prime Minister and approval <b>of</b> the <b>cabinet,</b> because the National Assembly does have the power to force the resignation <b>of</b> the <b>cabinet</b> by motion <b>of</b> no <b>confidence,</b> the choice <b>of</b> Prime Minister must reflect the will of the majority in the Assembly. For example, right after the legislative election of 1986, President François Mitterrand had to appoint Jacques Chirac Prime Minister although Chirac {{was a member of the}} RPR (Rally for the Republic) and therefore a political opponent of Mitterrand. Despite the fact that Mitterrand's own Socialist Party was the largest party in the Assembly, it did not have an absolute majority. The RPR had an alliance with the UDF, which gave them a majority. Such a situation, where the President is forced to work with a Prime Minister who is an opponent, is called a cohabitation.|$|R
5000|$|By Article 56 (2), the Prime Minister and his/her Cabinet, {{with the}} {{limitation}} that the Prime Minister {{must be a}} parliamentarian who holds the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> {{the majority of the}} House. The President can also dismiss a member <b>of</b> <b>Cabinet</b> upon the request of the Prime Minister.|$|R
50|$|The Prime Minister is {{appointed}} by the Governor-General, but to ensure the continuity of a stable government, this person must have the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> the House of Representatives to lead the Government. In practice, the position usually goes to {{the leader of the}} largest political party in Parliament. Major responsibilities of the Prime Minister include appointing ministers and chairing weekly meetings <b>of</b> <b>Cabinet.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first Clark-led {{minority}} government, {{following the}} 1999 general election, linked Labour with the left-wing Alliance Party. Alliance leader Jim Anderton served as Deputy Prime Minister under Clark until 2002. The coalition parties pioneered [...] "agree to disagree" [...] procedures to manage policy differences. Such procedures lessened the chances <b>of</b> <b>Cabinet</b> becoming publicly divided {{and running the}} risk <b>of</b> losing the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> the House of Representatives.|$|R
50|$|The {{president}} {{is a member of}} and head <b>of</b> the <b>cabinet.</b> The president appoints as prime minister a Member of Parliament who has the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> parliament. Other ministers <b>of</b> the <b>cabinet</b> are appointed by the president in consultation with the prime minister. The president may appoint himself to any ministry he chooses. According to the constitution the president must be the Minister of Defence. The President also appoints, in consultation with the Prime Minister, ministers who are not a member <b>of</b> the <b>Cabinet</b> (Non-Cabinet Ministers, Project Ministers, Deputy Ministers). The cabinet meets several times a week to discuss vital issues.|$|R
50|$|Sections 101 through 106 {{set out the}} {{responsibilities}} and functions <b>of</b> <b>Cabinet</b> ministers. Ministers may have whatever functions, titles, and responsibilities the Prime Minister may determine, and are responsible for one or more branches of government. Any part of government business not specifically assigned to a particular minister {{is the responsibility of}} the Prime Minister. All ministers are individually and collectively responsible to, and must hold the <b>confidence</b> <b>of,</b> the House of Representatives.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{fourteen}} days of its appointment, the cabinet, {{headed by}} the prime minister, is obligated to submit an agenda to the Sejm together with a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> Should the vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> fail, the process of government formation passes to the Sejm, which will then nominate a prime minister within fourteen days, who will then again propose the composition <b>of</b> the <b>cabinet.</b> An absolute majority of votes {{in the presence of}} at least half of all Sejm deputies is required to approve <b>of</b> the <b>cabinet,</b> which the president will then accept and administer their oaths of office. Should a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> fail again, the process of nomination is handed back to the presidency, who must again appoint a prime minister, who will then nominate other members <b>of</b> the <b>cabinet.</b> If the vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> fails a third time, the president is obliged to shorten the Sejm's term of office and order new elections. [...] However, since the adoption of the Constitution <b>of</b> 1997, all <b>cabinets</b> have successfully received a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> for their mandates, and have never required all of the reserve protocols of government formation to take place.|$|R
