5|$|Sahajanand Swami {{was later}} known as Swaminarayan after the mantra he taught at a gathering, in Faneni, a {{fortnight}} {{after the death}} of Ramanand Swami. He gave his followers a new mantra, known as the Swaminarayan mantra, to repeat in their rituals: Swaminarayan. When chanting this mantra, some devotees went into samadhi (a form of meditation) This act is also called maha-samadhi ("great samadhi") and claimed that they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> personal gods, even though they had no knowledge of Astanga Yoga. Swaminarayan also became known by the names Ghanshyam Maharaj, Shreeji Maharaj, Hari Krishna Maharaj and Shri Hari. As early as 1804, Swaminarayan, who was reported to have performed miracles, was described as a manifestation of God in the first work written by a disciple and paramhansa, Nishkulanand Swami. This work, the Yama Danda, was the first piece of literature written within the Swaminarayan sect.|$|E
25|$|Two hundred {{prisoners were}} sent, loaded with chains, to the Bardo palace, despite having bring promised amnesty. Condemned to the bastinado, they were beaten under the {{balconies}} of the Bey, {{in front of}} the steps leading up to the Hall of Justice, so that all <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> punishment and hear their pleas for mercy. For ten days the tribal sheikhs, their wrists and ankles bound and their faces to the ground, were savagely beaten, receiving up to 2,000 blows. Sixteen of them died quickly, and most of the rest did not long survive the dungeons.|$|E
25|$|The {{communist}} rule in Romania, {{unlike most}} of the other countries of the Eastern bloc permanently repudiated the Romanians who had left their country and labelled them as traitors to the motherland. So, neither Mircea Eliade, nor Eugène Ionesco, nor Emil Cioran, whose works would be published in this country sporadically after 1960, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> native land again. It was only after 1989 that the process of regaining the values of the diaspora and of reintegrating its personalities into this country's culture could be started seriously, a process marked in its turn by tension and disagreements.|$|E

60|$|As {{soon as they}} {{rounded the}} point they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by <b>their</b> glasses {{that there was a}} sudden commotion {{on the deck of the}} merchantman.|$|R
50|$|The use of 'smokeless powder' - nitrocellulose, {{nitroglycerine}} or cordite - {{which created}} far less smoke than gunpowder, meaning that gun crews <b>could</b> still <b>see</b> <b>their</b> target.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{got that}} gun and I started {{shooting}} at Jap planes," [...] Finn {{said in a}} 2009 interview. [...] "I was out there shooting the Jap planes and just every so often I was a target for some," [...] he said, [...] "In some cases, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> [...] faces." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the end of}} term approaches, Rook begins getting strange emails about Isabella's death, {{and begins}} seeing shinigami figures. Upset by these occurrences, when Akira's mother asks {{to speak to him}} {{concerning}} misuses of Amie, he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students' conversations. When he meets her, he finds that Isabella is alive and had simply moved away; the students made it look like she was dead via Amie as a prank that got out of control. Furthermore, they already knew that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> messages; Akira's mother explains that the students have no idea of online privacy, having always had technology like Amie, and assumed that anything they put online—even [...] "private" [...] messages—might be read by anyone. The game ends with Rook having a casual lunch with the students, a date with Arianna, or neither, depending on the choices made during the game by the player.|$|E
500|$|At 02.30 on 26 March, the {{regiment}} {{set out in}} thick fog for {{the assault on the}} town of Gaza. By 08:00 they had crossed the Wadi Ghuzze and reached Sheikh Abbas, confronted only by enemy aircraft and some Turkish camel patrols. Two hours later they were about [...] to the east of Gaza, providing a guard force against any reinforcements that might approach from Hareira. The British assault did not go according to plan, and at 14:00 the ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered to attack the town from the north. The regiment galloped forward together {{with the rest of the}} New Zealand brigade, and occupied Meshahera Ridge north-east of Gaza at 16:00. Dismounting, {{the regiment}} moved into Gaza, with the 6th Squadron leading, followed by the 2nd Squadron, and the 9th Squadron bringing up the rear. At 16:25 they captured a Turkish field ambulance; four officers, 125 other ranks and twenty vehicles. Continuing the assault through artillery and small arms fire, the 2nd and 9th Squadrons reached a cactus hedge. Cutting through it with their bayonets, they engaged the Turkish defenders behind it in hand-to-hand fighting. Two troops then charged across a lagoon, about [...] deep, to capture a Turkish trench. To their right they sighted a Turkish artillery emplacement, and Meldrum ordered the position taken without delay. Two troops from the 2nd and one from the 9th Squadron carried out a bayonet charge and captured the guns intact. Back in the regiment's centre they were held up by a strong Turkish defensive position at a cemetery. Instead of trying to attack the position, they held their line while the captured guns were recovered. The regiment was now some distance in front of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to their left, and in danger of a flanking counter-attack. To assist the defence of their position, they turned one of the captured guns onto the Turkish strong points, the inexperienced gun crew sighting by peering down the barrel until they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> target.|$|E
50|$|In this {{position}} the Black Flags were almost invisible. The French <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>their</b> large bamboo straw hats. They were firing from cover, with admirable discipline and stubbornness. Casualties began to mount in the French ranks.|$|R
50|$|Since {{crews of}} the mortars <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>their</b> targets, they were {{especially}} {{dependent on the}} overall fire control system, with its base end stations and plotting room, to locate and pinpoint targets for them to hit.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't true, and {{you know}} it!" [...] whined Brassy. And now the lads who were {{listening}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>their</b> fellow-cadet was very much upset. [...] "I'm not guilty, and I never have been guilty of any wrongdoing!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Kane {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "visionary" [...] of infantry tactics. [...] He taught his men what would become known as [...] "skirmisher tactics." [...] They learned to scatter under fire and to make use of whatever cover the ground offered, and to fire only when they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> targets. He stressed individual responsibility in his soldiers, a contradiction to the military thinking of the time. He held target practice, which was also an innovative idea, and drilled them in long-range firing, developing his men into fine sharpshooters.|$|E
2500|$|... "The choices {{before the}} socialist leaders were {{unconditional}} surrender, a glorious {{fight to the}} finish in Finland ending in almost certain martyrdom, or a prudent withdrawal {{with a view to}} a future return. It was not a difficult choice to make, and did not mean, as their detractors had always claimed, that they were weak and cowardly men who betrayed their faithful but deluded followers. They were Marxists, and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> defeat as only an episode in the class war, which always continued, and their duty was not to indulge in glorious gestures of defiance, but to persevere in the struggle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon legions XIII and XIV {{joined the}} fight. [...] Caesar does not detail their actions, [...] but they {{probably}} cleared the camp (as {{it was their}} nearest target) {{and went to the}} right to relieve the pressure on legions XII and VII. This, coupled with the return of legion X, transformed the situation. [...] Seeing the position begin to stabilise, cavalry and skirmishers took heart and, keen to wipe out their earlier shame, started to fight in earnest. The camp followers joined in now that they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> enemy’s dismay. [...] The entire Roman force was now fully committed.|$|E
60|$|Matt {{did as he}} had intimated, and the two found {{themselves}} in a darkness that was simply intense to the last degree. They <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>their</b> hands before their faces, and had to literally feel their way along.|$|R

5000|$|Many Matsqui {{homes were}} flooded during the 1948 Fraser River flood. Matsqui member Joan Silver {{remember}}s the dyke breaking: [...] "I remember seeing my Aunt Helen's house ... I don't {{know how many}} days it was. All you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was ... <b>their</b> chimney." ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} the Prince had {{softened}} his stance {{in recent years and}} stated that his children <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> mother sometime after they turned eighteen, Pascarl did not see her children again until 2006 when her twenty-year-old daughter Shahirah (now known simply as Shah) visited her in Melbourne. In August 2006, her son Iddin, now 23, returned to Australia to visit his mother after fourteen years of separation.." [...] Upon the return of his wife's abducted daughter Shah in 2006, her husband Bill was the spokesperson for his wife to the media pack that had formed outside of their house. Jacqueline is now in contact with her children most days.|$|E
2500|$|Max Payne 3 was Rockstar's [...] "biggest and boldest {{marketing}} effort thus far". Highlights {{of the campaign}} included prominent TV spots during the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final and other mainstream programming, as well as outdoor campaigns. Rockstar Games ran a competition where its Twitter followers who tweet using the #MaxPayne3 hashtag through January 13, 2012, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> likeness featured in the title's multiplayer. Rockstar also ran another competition to win a trip from New York City to São Paulo to attend at Sonar São Paulo, get a one-off Max Payne 3 Xbox 360 console, and play the game a week before its official release.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Sweeney was {{the cousin}} of Joel Sweeney, {{the person that}} popularized the five-string American banjo. In the 1840s the Sweeney clan lived on the stagecoach road {{northeast}} of Clover Hill, {{the name of the}} village now known as the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. John Sweeney, a wheelwright and Charles' brother, lived in the old family home on the north bank of the Appomattox river with his wife and four children. [...] When Joel was not touring the country entertaining he would stay at John's cabin. Just up the road the four children of John's, being nephews and nieces of Charles, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> uncle's small cabin. Charles lived in the tiny cabin {{with his wife and two}} remaining children. Charles Sweeney's older son Robert, a left-handed fiddle player, lived in even a smaller cabin with his wife and baby daughter downhill from John. Charles Sweeney was born in 1794 as was his wife, Mary.|$|E
60|$|They {{came forward}} warily, peering {{cautiously}} into every bush and halting often. At {{the body of}} the lion, they paused, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>their</b> gesticulations and the higher pitch of their voices that they were much excited over my kill.|$|R
5000|$|The Festival Internacional de Música Clássica de João Pessoa in João Pessoa, Brazil.

50|$|That night, Farragut's fleet {{ran past}} the {{batteries}} at Vicksburg {{and attempted to}} destroy Arkansas while doing so.

2500|$|Guatemoc then {{attacked}} {{all three}} Spanish camps simultaneously with his entire army on the feast day of St. John. On the Tacuba Causeway across Lake Texcoco connecting Tenochtitlan {{to the mainland}} along a street now known as Puente de Alvarado (Alvarado's Bridge) in Mexico City, Pedro de Alvarado made a mad cavalry charge across {{a gap in the}} Causeway. As Alvardo and his cavalry emerged {{on the other side of}} the gap with the infantry behind, Aztec canoes filled the gap. Pedro de Alvarado was wounded along with eight men in his camp. Alvarado escaped from the ambush, but five of his men were captured and taken off to the Great Temple to be sacrificed. Much to their horror, the Spanish from their positions <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> captured comrades being sacrificed on the Great Pyramid, which increased their hatred of the Aztecs. At the end of each day, the Spanish gave a prayer: [...] "Oh, thanks be to God that they did not carry me off today to be sacrificed." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee {{was selling}} surplus {{assets in the}} early 1960s, the Isle of Man Railway {{were looking for a}} cheap {{alternative}} to their ageing steam locomotive fleet and purchased these two railcars. [...] They had already been allocated fleet numbers which were retained by the new owners but it was only when the ex-contractors' engine No. 18 Ailsa was officially numbered in 2005 that the fleet had ever been in correct sequence. [...] These railcars {{have been the subject of}} much controversy in the late 1990s when their over-budget rebuild was brought to a halt by incoming management and since this time no work has been done on them. [...] The preservationist group Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association have campaigned for their completion, especially in conjunction with a potential commuter train services between Port Erin, Castletown and Douglas, which would extend the service that is laid on annually by the railway in connection with the T.T.. [...] The TT Commuter service is currently run using a steam locomotive and hauled stock, which leads to high operating costs. [...] A shift in management attitude <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> return to service in the future, but for the time being, they remain in store at Douglas station awaiting completion and return to service.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these exceptions, Number 10 {{has been}} known as the Prime Minister's {{official}} home for over one hundred years. By {{the turn of the}} 20th century, photography and the penny press had linked Number 10 in the public mind with the premiership. The introduction of films and television would strengthen this association. Pictures of prime ministers with distinguished guests at the door became commonplace. With or without the Prime Minister present, visitors had their picture taken. Suffragettes posed {{in front of the door}} when they petitioned H. H. Asquith for women's rights in 1913, a picture that became famous and was circulated around the world. In 1931, Mohandas Gandhi, wearing the traditional homespun dhoti, posed leaving Number 10 after meeting with Ramsay MacDonald to discuss India's independence. This picture, too, became famous especially in India. The freedom fighters <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> leader had been received in the Prime Minister's home. Couse's elegant, understated door—stark black, framed in cream white with a bold white [...] "10" [...] clearly visible—was the perfect backdrop to record such events. Prime Ministers made historic announcements from the front step. Waving the Anglo-German Agreement of Friendship, Neville Chamberlain proclaimed [...] "Peace with honour" [...] in 1938 from Number 10 after his meeting with Adolf Hitler in Munich. During World War II, Churchill was photographed many times emerging confidently from Number 10 holding up two fingers in the sign for [...] "Victory".|$|E
60|$|Without an open scandal {{which they}} <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>their</b> way to recommending, it was {{difficult}} to <b>see</b> what steps <b>could</b> be taken. In this impasse, the only thing was to say nothing to Soames, and nothing to each other; in fact, to pass it over.|$|R
5000|$|The two Serbs {{were wearing}} black masks that covered their head and hair; you <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>their</b> eyes and mouth. It was ninja style. They had dark blue police uniforms with loose red stripes {{on the arm}} just below the shoulder, I believe on the right arm ...|$|R

2500|$|In style, Buffalo Bill {{established}} a fourteen-acre swath of land near {{the main entrance}} of the fair for [...] "Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World" [...] where he erected stands around an arena large enough to seat 18,000 spectators. Seventy-four [...] "Wild Westers" [...] from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, who had recently returned from a tour of Europe, were contracted to perform in the show. Cody also brought in an additional one hundred Wild Westers directly from Pine Ridge, Standing Rock and Rosebud reservations, who visited the Exposition at his expense and participated in the opening ceremonies. Over two million patrons saw Buffalo Bill's Wild West outside the Columbian Exposition, often mistaking the show {{as an integral part}} to the World's Fair. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, known as the St. Louis World's Fair, was the last of the great fairs in the United States before World War I. Organizers wanted their exotic people to be interpreted by anthropologists in a modern scientific manner portraying contrasting images of Native Americans. A Congress of Indian Educators was convened and Oglala Lakota Chief Red Cloud and Chief Blue Horse, both eighty-three years old, and the best-known Native America orators at the St. Louis World's Fair, spoke to audiences. A model Indian School was placed on top on a hill so Indians below <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> future as portrayed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. On one side of the school, [...] "blanket Indians", men or women who refused to relinquish their native dress and customs, demonstrated their artistry inside the school {{on one side of the}} hall. On the other side, Indian boarding school students displayed their achievements in reading, writing, music, dancing, trades and arts. The Carlisle Indian Band performed at the Pennsylvania state pavilion, and the Haskell Indian Band performed a mixture of classical, popular music and Dennison Wheelock's [...] "Aboriginal Suite" [...] which included Native dances and war whoops by band members.|$|E

Now we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> faces peering {{over the tops of}} their mottled shields, and now we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>their</b> fierce and rolling eyes.|$|E
60|$|On {{taking his}} place when Sunday came, he {{observed}} that the family were present, seated, however, in such a position that he <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>their</b> backs.
