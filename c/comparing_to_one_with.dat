This can {{be discussed in}} the context of a resource-limited system <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> ample biomass (Krawchuk 2011). For example, in semiarid rangelands, soil moisture exerts strong control on site characteristics such as vegetation community structure as well as current conditions of fire susceptibility like fuel load and moisture status. In very cold rangeland systems where permafrost controls soil drainage (e.g., Alaskan tundra), temperature can influence effective soil depth and subsequent soil moisture conditions. Spatial and temporal soil moisture conditions are also affected by a suite of soil properties including texture, rock fragments, and organic matter. Therefore, long-term projections of fire likelihood can be tied to soil types or key properties affecting soil moisture. The interaction of soil with climate is an important element of both short- and long-term projections of fire.|$|R

The output data is used as a reliable forecast so an optimal power flow model can devise optimal charging scenarios of EVs in a local electrical network. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated by presenting a multi-day case study in an urban area.

40|$|Abstract This paper proposes fuzzy {{regression}} analysis with non-symmetric fuzzy coefficients. By as-suming non-symmetric triangular fuzzy coefficients and applying the quadratic programming formulation, {{the center of}} the obtained fuzzy regression model attains more central tendency <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the <b>one</b> <b>with</b> symmetric triangular fuzzy coefficients. For a data set composed of crisp inputs-fuzzy outputs, two ap-proximation models called an upper approximation model and a lower approximation model are considered as regression models. Thus, we also propose an integrated quadratic programming problem by which the upper approximation model always includes the lower approximation model at any threshold level under the assumption of the same centers in the two approximation models. Since non-symmetric fuzzy coefficients are assumed, we can obtain models with more reduced spreads as well as with more central tendency, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> symmetric triangular fuzzy coefficients. Sensitivities of weight coefficients in the proposed quadratic programming approaches are investigated through real data. 1...|$|R

The comparison oil various code-specified slenderness ratios or provisions, which {{used in the}} AISC-ASD, AISC-LRFD, AS- 4100, and CSA S 16 - 01, are presented. The 0. 75 rule, which states that the slenderness ratio of component element of built-up member should not exceed three-fourths times the governing slenderness ratio of built-up member, seems justified according to the tests. The governing slenderness ratio of built-up member could be either the modified or the unmodified one-as specified in the AISC Specifications. The test {{results indicate that the}} built-up members with component slenderness ratio of 0. 75 to 1. 0 times the governing slenderness ratio (modified or unmodified) could also furnish a quite encouraging design outcome.

Establishing a sender's identity does not guarantee its adherence to best practices. To maintain a history of sender activity, in our prior work, we had proposed RepuScore: a collaborative sender reputation framework and demonstrated its effectiveness using simulated logs. In this paper, we share our initial experience in deploying RepuScore along with its SpamAssassin plug-in that we recently developed. From the deployed RepuScore, we learned that {{a variation in the}} received email volume disguises the real reputation of the sender. To solve this problem, we propose Volume-Enhanced RepuScore that, in addition to spam rate, considers the received email volume.
