25|$|The {{pelerine}} was {{a popular}} name for wide, capelike collars that extended over the shoulders and covered the upper chest. Sometimes they had layers of tiered fabric, long front panels hanging down from <b>center</b> <b>front,</b> or were also belted at the natural waistline.|$|E

25|$|This type of pole, usually 20 to 40 {{feet tall}} {{is the most}} decorative. Its carvings {{tell the story of}} the family, clan or village who own them. These poles are also known as heraldic, crest, or family poles. Poles of this type are placed outside the clan house of the most {{important}} village leaders. Often, watchman figures are carved at the top of the pole to protect the pole owner’s family and the village. Another type of house frontal pole is the entrance or doorway pole, which is attached to the <b>center</b> <b>front</b> of the home and includes an oval-shaped opening through the base that serves as the entrance to the clan house.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{reasoned}} that Tarleton {{would be highly}} confident and attack him head on. He arranged his troops to encourage this. He set up three lines of soldiers: one of skirmishers (sharpshooters); one of militia; and a main one. The first was 150 select skirmishers from North Carolina (Major McDowell) and Georgia (Major Cunningham). The second line, behind the skirmishers but {{in front of the}} third line of Continentals, consisted of 300 militiamen under the command of Col. Andrew Pickens. The effect was the conspicuous placement of weak militia in the <b>center</b> <b>front,</b> to encourage the British to attack there. The skirmishers and militia would screen the strongest Continental troops, while inflicting damage as the British advanced.|$|E

500|$|The Dening Hall is {{the main}} hall of the temple, and was built in 1270 during the Yuan Dynasty. The hall is fronted by a massive {{platform}} known as a yuetai (月台, literally moon platform), which measures 25 by 20 meters. Built on a very high platform itself, the Dening Hall can be accessed by either a <b>center</b> <b>front</b> staircases or one of two side staircases attached to the yuetai. Enclosing {{the perimeter of the}} platform is a white marble balustrade capped by lions. The hall itself measures seven by four bays and is surrounded by a covered arcade. According to the Yingzao Fashi, a Song Dynasty architectural treatise, the Dening Hall has 6th puzuo type column bracketing to support its roof. [...] This type of bracketing has three transverse and three horizontal bracket arms. The 6th puzuo brackets are the most complex that survive from the Yuan Dynasty. Based on the complex bracketing, the marble balustrade and the height of the platform, Steinhardt identifies the Dening Hall as one of the two most eminent and important extant wooden halls that date from the Yuan period. These characteristics also closely match descriptions of the architecture at the capital, meaning that Dening Hall is representative of the architecture at the Yuan dynasty capital of Dadu (currently Beijing).|$|E
500|$|The ship's {{constant}} movement also impacted character animation. Once the ship's movement reached a certain angle, Hansen {{and any other}} characters on deck start to slide, and have to compensate in whatever direction was necessary relative to their position. According to Levastre, this meant Hansen required nine times the animations usually seen in third-person games (<b>center,</b> <b>front,</b> back, left, right and four intermediary positions). Ultimately, Hansen had {{two hundred and fifty}} separate animations, and most of the non-player characters had one hundred and fifty. According to Antonin Delboy, lead animator on the game, [...] "all the technical decisions were taken in favor of animation, both in terms of quality and quantity, which is very rare on this kind of project." [...] Basic animation was produced with 3D Studio Max software. Inverse kinematics were then used to create the nine directional animations, with the engine calculating the level of character compensation depending on the angle of the ship. Each character movement is composed of basic animation and compensation animation, and Delboy says that in total, the game contains more than nine hundred animations, allowing for over five thousand possible movements. Levastre stated [...] "The interaction between the storm and the characters that are on the deck sometimes creates some really breathtaking moments. And on top of that, we managed to offer some really intense action sequences featuring far more enemies than in most horror games." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not {{unlike other}} Harley-Davidson engines, the unit {{construction}} {{left and right}} engine cases split vertically, and formed four cavities: a <b>center</b> <b>front</b> crankcase, a center rear gearbox, a right side cavity gearcase [...] for the timing train, where the four camshafts are housed, and a left cavity for the three row primary drive chain. A row of four camshafts had also been used on the KR racers, inherited from the sidevalve Model WL, and even earlier Model D of 1929. While the single camshaft of other Harley-Davidson designs was cheaper to manufacture, and quieter, four cams allowed better performance, such as greater flexibility in adjusting the cam timing, and the short single camshafts are durable, and give the pushrods a straighter path to the rocker arms.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, {{concurrent}} {{with a major}} remodeling of the team's Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum home, {{the colors}} were changed to a simpler blue and white. The new helmet horns were white, wider, and separated at the helmet <b>center</b> <b>front.</b> The blue jersey had white numerals with two white sleeve stripes. The white jersey featured blue numerals and a wide blue crescent shoulder stripe. A 1964 league rule allowed teams to wear white jerseys for home games and the Rams were among several teams to do so (the Dallas Cowboys, who introduced their blue-white-silverblue uniform that season, have worn white at home ever since), as owner Dan Reeves felt {{it would be more}} enjoyable for fans to see the various colors {{of the rest of the}} league as opposed to always having the Rams in blue and the visiting team in white. The pants were white with a thick blue stripe. In 1970, in keeping with the standards of the fully merged NFL and AFL, names appeared on the jersey backs for the first time. The sleeve [...] "TV numbers", quite large compared to those of other teams, were made smaller in 1965. From 1964 to early 1972 the Rams wore white jerseys for every home league game and exhibition, at one point not wearing their blue jerseys at all from the 10th game of 1967 through the 1971 opener, a stretch of 48 games; it was a tradition that continued under coaches Harland Svare, George Allen, and Tommy Prothro. But new owner Carroll Rosenbloom did not particularly like the Rams' uniforms, so in pursuit of a new look the team wore its seldom-used blue jerseys for most home games in 1972. During that season Rosenbloom's Rams also announced an intention to revive the old blue and gold colors for 1973, and asked fans to send in design ideas.|$|E
