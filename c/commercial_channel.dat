5|$|Nasha strana was {{the major}} Russian-newspaper in Israel during the 1970s, when it competed with Tribuna for the {{immigrant}} reader. In 1989, {{there was only one}} daily in Russian, and 6 in 1996. Since the 2000s, the number of Russian-language newspapers started to decline due to the increasing number of television and online media. Israeli television provides daily translation in Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian. In 2002, the Israeli Russian-speaking <b>commercial</b> <b>Channel</b> 9 was launched. It is also known as Israel Plus. In November 2007, a typical digital package included 45 channels in foreign languages, with 5 in Russian. Today, there are four dailies, 11 weeklies, five monthlies and over 50 local newspapers published in Russian in Israel, with a total circulation of about 250,000 during weekends. Daily radio services in Russian are also available throughout Israel.|$|E

50|$|Public and <b>commercial</b> TV <b>channels</b> {{have converged}} lately: the lighter {{approach}} of <b>commercial</b> <b>channels</b> (with movies, soap operas, games and entertainment) has been increasingly matched by state-owned <b>channels,</b> while <b>commercial</b> <b>channels</b> themselves have improved their {{news and information}} programmes, denting the HTV earlier monopoly.

50|$|In {{anticipation}} of the launch of new <b>commercial</b> <b>channels</b> broadcast by satellite, a third television network, Nederland 3 launched in April 1988. Luxembourg-based RTL-Véronique began broadcasting in October 1989. In 1992, {{the government of the}} Netherlands legalised commercial television, and a number of new <b>commercial</b> <b>channels</b> were established resulting in a reduction in the market share of the public networks.|$|R
25|$|Radio and {{television}} early became widespread in Sweden, but government {{struggled to keep}} the monopoly of licence-funded Sveriges television until the late 1980s, as satellite and cable TV became popular, and the <b>commercial</b> <b>channel</b> TV4 was permitted to broadcast terrestrially.|$|E

25|$|Norkring {{was awarded}} a ten-year {{concession}} to operate Multiplex B (Mux B) in Slovenia by the Agency for Post and Electronic Communications on 19 December 2008. Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV) operated Multiplex A (Mux A). The permit stipulated that Mux A would only be used for RTV's own <b>channels</b> and that <b>commercial</b> operators would have to use Mux B. Because Mux A became operational before Mux B, RTV was permitted to temporarily provide channels in their multiplex. Regular operations with Mux B started on 1 September 2010 and the analog turn-off took place on 1 December. Initially Pink SI was the only channel to switch to Mux B, although TV3 followed in October. Pink SI switched back to Mux A in 2011, which also hosted the <b>commercial</b> <b>channels</b> Pop TV and Kanal A. Norkring issued a criminal complaint to the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, claiming RTV was violating regulatory decisions through hosting <b>commercial</b> <b>channels,</b> arguing that European Union law prohibits <b>commercial</b> <b>channels</b> from being broadcast on national multiplexes. RTV stated that they were obliged to charge the <b>commercial</b> <b>channels</b> {{for the use of}} their multiplex.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} changes for regional television in Australia began in the 1990s with the introduction of aggregation. Instead of being covered by a single <b>commercial</b> <b>channel,</b> regional license areas would combine to provide two or three stations in line with metropolitan areas. As a result, most regional areas went from one to three channels, although some, particularly outside eastern states New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, remained with two or even only one commercial station.|$|E
25|$|Kdam Eurovision {{was used}} by the IBA to select the song that will be {{performed}} for Israel at Moscow. Due to financial difficulties, the <b>commercial</b> <b>channel</b> Channel 2 was not able to co-produce Kdam Eurovision as in last year's contest.

2500|$|In January 2014, {{a year-long}} {{academic}} study by Dr John Robertson at the University of the West of Scotland found that coverage by the BBC and the Scottish <b>commercial</b> <b>channel</b> STV had favoured the No campaign, although Robertson conceded {{that this was}} partly due to there being more major political parties in favour of No. In March 2014, BBC Scotland chiefs appeared before a Scottish Parliament committee to face questions from MSPs about the broadcaster's coverage. During that session, BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie disputed the findings of Dr Robertson's study, saying that its conclusions were largely based upon [...] "flawed analysis" [...] and had contained factual errors.|$|E
