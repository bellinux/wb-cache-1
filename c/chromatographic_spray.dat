40|$|Hexoses and pentoses can be {{measured}} either sing-ly or in combination, with an o-anisidine reagent. It has the advantages of a fastreactionrateand rela-tivelylittleinterference from hexoses (Amax = 660 nm) in the measurement of pentoses. A simple sub-traction of absorbance attributable to glucose at the maximum for pentoses (465 nm) is sufficient for sat-isfactory pentose estimation in urine. The method has been automated, and resultscompare favorably with those from an automated procedure for the measurement of serum glucose inwhich hexokinase isused, and alsowiththose from a colorimetricani-line method for measurement of pentoses in urine. Interferences and procedural variables are dis-cussed. Urinary pentose and hexose values for nor-mal infants are reported. AddItional Keyphrases: AutoAnalyzer #{ 149 }values for car-bohydrate in urine from infants #{ 149 }pentoses in urine Several substituted aniline compounds react with monosaccharides in acid media to produce chromo-gens with maximum absorption at or near 480 and 630 nm (1 - 4). The latter wavelength is commonly used for quantification of hexoses. The pentose-amine reaction products usually exhibit maxima at lower wavelengths. The compound in which a methoxy group is sub-stituted at the ortho position of the benzene ring of aniline is o-anisidine. Heretofore, in carbohydrate identification this compound and its para analog have been used extensively in various formulations of <b>chromatographic</b> <b>sprays</b> (5). The reaction product of o-anisidine with hexoses produces a green solution similar to that produced with o-toluidine. However, {{the color of the}} o-anisidine-hexose reaction product tends to decrease in intensity with an increase of temperature and heating time, and its absorption maximum is at a slightly higher wavelength...|$|R
