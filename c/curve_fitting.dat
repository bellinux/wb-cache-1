25|$|The {{problem with}} the methods {{described}} above is that errors will accumulate and the series will tend to diverge from the true function. A solution which guarantees a constant maximum error is to use <b>curve</b> <b>fitting.</b> A minimum of N values are calculated evenly spaced along {{the range of the}} desired calculations. Using a <b>curve</b> <b>fitting</b> technique like Gaussian reduction an N1th degree polynomial interpolation of the function is found.

EBDA performs the initial analysis, which converts measured radioactivity into molar concentrations and creates Hill slopes and Scatchard transformations from the data. The analysis made by EBDA can then be used by LIGAND to estimate a specified model for the binding.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacokinetics {{is often}} studied using mass {{spectrometry}} {{because of the}} complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) {{and the need for}} high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however {{it is not uncommon to}} use <b>curve</b> <b>fitting</b> with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.|$|E

There is no objective mathematical way of evaluating the rules or overall risk other than comparison with empirical test results.
