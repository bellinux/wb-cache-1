50|$|Legal common-law {{marriage}} was, {{for practical}} purposes, abolished under the 1753 Marriage Act, {{also known as}} Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act. This was aimed at suppressing clandestine marriages by introducing more stringent <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>validity,</b> and thereafter only marriages conducted by the Church of England, Quakers, or under Jewish law, were recognised in England and Wales. This effectively ended earlier practices. Any other form of marriage was abolished; children born into unions which were not valid under the Act would not automatically inherit the property or titles of their parents. For historical reasons, the Act did not apply in Scotland.|$|E

5000|$|Handfasting {{remained}} an acceptable way of marrying in England throughout the Middle Ages but {{declined in the}} early modern period. In some circumstances handfasting was open to abuse, with persons who had undergone [...] "troth-plight" [...] occasionally refusing to proceed to a church wedding, creating ambiguity about their former betrothed's marital status.After {{the beginning of the}} 17th century, gradual changes in English law meant the presence of an officiating priest or magistrate became necessary for a marriage to be legal.Finally the 1753 Marriage Act, aimed at suppressing clandestine marriages by introducing more stringent <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>validity,</b> effectively ended the handfasting custom in England.Shakespeare negotiated and witnessed a handfasting in 1604, and was called as a witness in a suit about the dowry in 1612 and historians speculate that his own marriage to Anne Hathaway was so conducted {{when he was a young}} man in 1582, as the practice still had credence in Warwickshire at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Kmenta {{has written}} {{extensively}} on econometric model building as well as econometric methods. He has edited two books with James B. Ramsey: Evaluation of Econometric Models and Large Scale Macro-Econometric Models: Theory and Practice {{and is the author of}} at least 34 [...] published econometrics papers. A wide-ranging econometrician, his papers analyze topics as disparate as small sample properties of estimators, missing observations, estimation of production function parameters, and ridge regression among many others. [...] Much of his published research is focused on econometric issues that are relevant in areas far beyond economics. As a result, his work is referenced in publications in medicine, political science, insurance underwriting, antitrust litigation, and energy issues, to list but a few. For example, the early (1966) “Specification and Estimation of Cobb-Douglas Production Function Models” with Arnold Zellner and Jacques Drèze has been cited by research as different as family involvement effects on firm productivity and devising fishing gears with reduced environmental effects.Kmenta’s “General Procedure for Obtaining Maximum Likelihood Estimates in Generalized Regression Models” (with W. Oberhofer) formally established <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>validity</b> of the iterative estimation method most widely used in econometrics today, while his simplified estimation of the constant elasticity of substitution constant elasticity of substitution production function both gave “the nascent field of industrial organization a new set of powerful tools for studying firm efficiency” and has been used to analyze the cost of network infrastructure, among many other applications.Kmenta has made multiple other contributions incorporated into the core of econometrics.|$|E
