Frattini's responsibilities were handed to Barrot (who held them {{in addition to his}} existing transport duties) until a replacement for Frattini could be found. In light of Parliament's opposition in 2004 when Buttiglione was deemed inappropriate for the justice portfolio, when Antonio Tajani MEP (another right wing candidate) was put forward to replace Frattini, president Barroso handed him Barrot's transport portfolio, leaving Barrot to continue with the justice portfolio for continuity and to ensure Parliament would back Tajani in such as non-sensitive position as Transport (but one still of interest to Italy due to problems with Alitalia). Parliament approved Tajani on 18 June 2008 with a vote of 507 to 53 (64 abstentions). Peter Mandelson then left in October 2008 to return to national politics as Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, being replaced by Baroness Ashton. Following the 2009 election two commissioners stood down to accept seats in the European Parliament: Danuta Hübner (Poland) and Louis Michel (Belgium) who were replaced by Paweł Samecki (4 July) and Karel De Gucht (17 July) respectively. Dalia Grybauskaitė (Lithuania) was replaced by Algirdas Šemeta on 1 July 2009) after becoming President of Lithuania.

50|$|The American Solidarity Party {{adheres to}} the {{ideology}} of Christian democracy, which is historically influenced by Catholic Social Teaching and Neo-Calvinist theology. As such, the ASP looks to the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>movements</b> in Europe and the Americas, and to American religious populists such as Martin Luther King. As the name indicates, the American Solidarity Party draws its inspiration from Solidarity (Polish Trade Union), founded by Lech Wałęsa in 1980. In addition, the ASP shares the socially conservative positions of the Netherlands' Anti-Revolutionary Party, founded by Dutch prime minister and Calvinist theologian Abraham Kuyper in 1879.|$|R

50|$|The Dominican Republic has a multi-party {{political}} system with national elections every four years. In {{two rounds of}} presidential elections in 1996, nearly 80% of eligible Dominican voters went to the polls. The leading parties in 1994 were the PRSC, linked to the International <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> political <b>movement,</b> whose candidate was President Joaquín Balaguer; the PRD, affiliated with the Socialist International, whose candidate was José Francisco Peña Gómez; and the PLD, whose candidate was former President Juan Bosch.|$|R
50|$|The ideologists of {{this new}} party, principally lawyers Abraham Rodriguez and Roberto Lara Velado, saw Christian {{democracy}} as the path they were seeking. The roots of <b>Christian</b> <b>democratic</b> ideology extended {{back as far as}} Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum novarum (1891), which called on Christians to work for social and economic reform. Its more immediate influences, however, were found in the works of Pope John XXIII and the French philosopher Jacques Maritain. The <b>Christian</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>movements</b> in Chile and Venezuela also served as role models. The founders of the PDC, including the civil engineer José Napoleón Duarte Fuentes, emphasized the ideological basis of the party—its support for reform, its call for the application of moral principles to political and economic life, and its rejection of extremist solutions such as those advocated by Marxism—as a new development in Salvadoran politics. This was true, but {{only to the extent that}} party members accepted that ideology and acted upon it. Duarte himself came to the PDC without a strong ideological grounding, but his belief in the possibility of peaceful democratic change, as well as his personal magnetism, made up for that initial shortcoming.|$|R
