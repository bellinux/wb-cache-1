5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made when a bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration 'chatter' <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> given when a bird sighted a human near the enclosure.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the alarm calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the press briefings, DCS Gull stated that over 300 police {{officers}} were involved in the investigation, and some 400–450 <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> being received daily by detectives.|$|E
5000|$|... 999 is the {{official}} emergency number for the United Kingdom, but <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> also accepted on the European Union emergency number, 112. All <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> answered by 999 operators. <b>Calls</b> <b>are</b> always free.|$|R
50|$|The Interconnection Exchange (ICX) {{will receive}} all {{calls from the}} mobile and fixed {{operators}} whenever the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> made to other network and will pass it to the destination network if the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> local, and will pass to the IGWs if the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> international. ICX will also deliver calls received from IGWs where the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> destined.|$|R

5|$|In August 2006, Varitalk {{launched}} an advertising campaign in which fans could send a semi-personalized message in Samuel Jackson's voice to telephone numbers of their choosing. Within the first week, over 1.5 million <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> sent to participants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calls</b> <b>were</b> made in New York for {{legislation}} {{to prevent the}} growth of skyscrapers, citing their effect on the city skylines, but these attempts faced legal obstacles. The United States Constitution did not give local government authority to prevent the buildings {{on the grounds of}} aesthetics alone, and any such law in New York was considered likely to face judicial challenge.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - {{it was becoming}} increasingly impractical to maintain the castle, and <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made for the State {{to take over the}} property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992.|$|E

50|$|Domestic collect <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> {{placed by}} dialing 19 from any {{landline}} or payphone; the caller then states their name, which is announced {{with a message}} stating that a collect <b>call</b> has <b>been</b> requested when the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> answered. If the called party accepts the reverse charges, the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> connected.|$|R

5|$|Metrolink {{has also}} {{featured}} in television drama. On 6 December 2010, the popular soap opera Coronation Street featured a storyline with an explosion which caused a crash on the Metrolink system at Weatherfield. The episode was written {{to celebrate the}} soap opera's 50th anniversary. Although a fictitious event, at least six <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made to GMPTE asking if services had been affected.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Internet and {{international}} telephone service in Ürümqi remained limited {{for nearly a}} year after the riots. As late as November, most of the Internet was still inaccessible to residents and international phone <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained off-limits to all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 hours away to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and regional government websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would then place the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and delayed recovery, whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down communications for the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away from the Internet even improved their quality of life.|$|E
5|$|One of Bart's early {{hallmarks}} was his prank {{calls to}} Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe {{and asks for}} a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> apparently based {{on a series of}} prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings, though Groening has denied any causal connection.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common high quality duck <b>call</b> {{materials}} <b>are</b> wood and acrylic. The key difference between wood and acrylic duck <b>calls</b> <b>is</b> that acrylic <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> much louder and carry much further than wood duck <b>calls.</b> This <b>is</b> important for {{different types of}} duck hunting. Acrylic <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> preferred in large, open spaces for a call {{to reach out and}} find the ducks. When hunting in timber or swampy area, a wood <b>call</b> <b>is</b> preferable. Another key difference is that acrylic is known to show less sound variance over the temperature ranges expected in a duck blind.|$|R
50|$|The <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a querulous kiew, kiew. Less frequently, various {{whistling}} or trilling <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> uttered. In {{the breeding}} season, other more modulated <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> made, {{and a pair}} may call in duet. Various yelping, chattering or barking sounds {{are made in the}} vicinity of the nest.|$|R
50|$|The Himalayan flameback’s <b>call</b> <b>is</b> {{a series}} of rapidly {{repeated}} klak-klak-klak-klak-klak. The <b>call</b> <b>is</b> slower and softer than the Greater Goldenback.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Washington, Mulder is admonished by Assistant Director Walter Skinner and the Smoking Man for his actions. Mulder claims he still had enough {{evidence}} with the days missed to prosecute {{the subject of his}} assigned wiretap, and that his own phone <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> being monitored. Skinner then demands that the Smoking Man leave the room, and decides to not discipline Mulder. Investigating the tape reel, Mulder finds it blank due to a power surge during the storm, but vows to continue his work regardless.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the ground station between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with these calls could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of these signals can {{be considered in the}} analysis with the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E
5|$|Amalfi {{immediately}} began listing to port and, after initial damage control efforts proved fruitless, her commander ordered the ship evacuated. The cruiser sank less than 30 minutes {{after she was}} torpedoed. Distress <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> answered by other ships of the division which rescued {{a large number of}} the ship's complement. The loss of men was reported as about 200 at the time, but later reports list only 67 fatalities. Amalfi was among the largest ships sunk by U-boats during the war. As a result of Amalfis sinking, sister ship Pisa and the other pair of armored cruisers at Venice rarely ventured out of port for most of the next year, and were eventually transferred to Valona in April 1916.|$|E

5000|$|Hog calling, or pig <b>calling,</b> <b>is</b> the art {{of making}} a call to {{encourage}} pigs to approach the caller. The skill is mainly used by pig farmers, {{and to a lesser}} extent by hunters. Competitions in hog <b>calling</b> <b>are</b> held. [...] Mechanical or electronic pig <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> available for hunting.|$|R
5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, fans mistook {{random numbers}} that were placed by Cawthon into the source {{code of the}} game's {{official}} website to be coordinates that pointed to a location significant to the games. Fans entered these numbers into Google Maps and consequently discovered a pizzeria in Virginia. Mass phone <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made to the pizzeria by fans, attempting to discover if the company had {{a connection to the}} upcoming installment, Five Nights at Freddy's 4. It was later confirmed by Cawthon that this pizzeria had no connection with the Five Nights at Freddy's series.|$|E
5|$|Numerous <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made {{to police}} in the United States Virgin Islands about downed power lines {{throughout}} {{the passage of the}} depression. High winds, gusting up to 40mph (65km/h) left roughly 500 people without telephone service on St. Croix. No major damage was reported on any of the affected islands in the wake of Christine. Residents in the drought-stricken regions of Florida were hoping for increased rainfall from the remnant wave of Christine; however, the system did not reach the United States before dissipating. The storm's remnants only produced squally weather in Florida on September7 and 8.|$|E

5|$|On 21 November 2008, the {{two ships}} left Portsmouth {{for the last}} time for Aliağa, Turkey under tow. Scrapping took place in the same yard which was {{scrapping}} the Tuxedo Princess, a former ferry and floating nightclub that had been berthed underneath the Tyne Bridge. Following a decommissioning ceremony at Cardiff city hall, her bell was removed and is now mounted in the north aisle of St John's Parish Church in Cardiff. <b>Calls</b> <b>were</b> made for the conversion of the ship into a Cardiff tourist attraction by a Member of the National Assembly for Wales and former naval servicemen.|$|E
5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} telephone calls {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone {{it appeared that the}} <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of the}} bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border had a {{substantial}} economic and social impact on both halves of Germany. Cross-border transport links were largely severed; 10 main railway lines, 24secondary lines, 23autobahns or national roads, 140regional roads and thousands of smaller roads, paths and waterways were blocked or otherwise interrupted. The tightest level of closure came in 1966, by which time only six railway lines, three autobahns, one regional road and two waterways were left open. When {{relations between the two}} states eased in the 1970s, the GDR agreed to open more crossing points in exchange for economic assistance. Telephone and mail communications operated throughout the Cold War, although packages and letters were routinely opened and telephone <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> monitored by the East German secret police.|$|E

50|$|After {{a channel}} is {{initially}} seized, each device must indicate {{the progress of}} a call. The progress indicators include whether a <b>call</b> <b>is</b> answered or remains unanswered, and when a <b>call</b> <b>is</b> answered, which party disconnects first. These <b>call</b> progress states <b>are</b> important as Telephony systems need to know when the <b>call</b> <b>was</b> attempted, answered, and cleared, hence the term Answer and Disconnect Supervision.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{important issues}} in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in Japan and examines what language teachers should {{take into consideration}} when introducing CALL in their classrooms. First, a summary of shifting trend in <b>CALL</b> <b>is</b> presented as a demonstration of how broad the concept of <b>CALL</b> <b>is</b> {{in terms of its}} forms and activities. Second, <b>CALL</b> <b>is</b> evaluated under such research areas as brain-imaging, motivation, self-achievement, and physical movement. Third, concerns of language teachers toward <b>CALL</b> <b>are</b> discussed briefly. This literature review concludes that <b>CALL</b> <b>is</b> not error-free and thus requires a great amount of attention and modification by language teachers, leaving a further discussion of teachers' roles in CALL to subsequent papers...|$|R
