It consists of three <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> storage tanks, each with a capacity of 410,000 barrels.

The plant has a production capacity of 14,770 barrels per day with a total investment of over US$1billion as of the year 2010.

The aim was to estimate the organic geochemical similarity of the <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> from the Drmno (Kostolac) depression oil fields.

The similar origin of the investigated Drmno depression <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> was corroborated, characterized by a significant participation of terrestrial precursor biomass. They were shown to be of relatively low maturity and to have been formed during the earlier stages of the diagenet- ic-catagenetic sequence of processes leading to the formation of <b>crude</b> <b>oils,</b> most probably in source rocks ofTertiary age, corresponding to vitrinite reflectances between Ro = 0. 70 % and Ro = 0. 80 %.

5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> (petroleum). <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

40|$|Experimental data {{gathered}} {{over the past}} several years show that the interactions of microorganisms with <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> are variable and depend on the microbial species and the chemical composition of <b>crude</b> <b>oils.</b> The variations can be observed in terms of the extent of emulsification, changes in the hydrocarbon composition of <b>crude</b> <b>oils,</b> and duration of biotreatment. All of these factors indicate that the interaction of microbes with <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> involves multiple chemical reactions resulting from the biochemical interactions between microbes and oils. Different interactions may influence the efficiency of processes in which single or mixed microbial species are used for the oil treatment and may also suggest possible combinations of biological and chemical technologies.

5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E
40|$|Biochemical {{conversion}} of <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> is a multi-step process proceeding {{through a series}} of biochemical reactions. These reactions can be characterized by a set of chemical markers which are associated with the chemical composition of <b>crude</b> <b>oils.</b> Reactions with heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> indicate that there is an overall decrease in the concentration and chemical speciation of organic sulfur compounds, and a redistribution of hydrocarbons and organometallic species. The contents of trace metals in the <b>crude</b> <b>oils,</b> such as nickel and vanadium, also decrease. Further, heavy ends of crudes, containing the asphaltenes and the polar nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen containing fractions, as well as the organometallic compounds and complexes, are biochemically converted to lower molecular weight chemical species. In the studies reported in this paper, microorganisms used to mediate such reactions were thermophilic (> 60 {degrees}C) and pressure tolerant (up to 2500 psi). These organisms are also capable of biochemical {{conversion of}} bituminous and lignite coals in an analogous manner to their action on <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> and follow similar trends characterized by chemical markers...|$|R

30|$|<b>Crude</b> <b>oils</b> are {{composed}} of complex hydrocarbons and nonhydrocarbons. Traditionally, column chromatography is used to separate the aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes. Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons are then analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), GC–MS, and GC along with coupled tandem mass spectrometry. However, for nonhydrocarbons and bitumen with strong polarity and high molecular weights, {{it is difficult to}} analyze them systematically and comprehensively using these traditional methods. Although nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen (NSO) compounds are not predominant in <b>crude</b> <b>oils,</b> their distribution and composition greatly affect the characteristic of <b>crude</b> <b>oils.</b> For example, the amount of sulfur directly determines the quality of <b>crude</b> <b>oils.</b> Considering that the distribution and characteristics of NSO compounds are related to the source material, depositional environment and other factors thus the analysis of NSO compounds can help determine the formation, generation and evolution of petroleum (Wang 2002; Wang et al. 2004; Li et al. 2001).|$|R
