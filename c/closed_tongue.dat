30|$|To {{circumvent}} the edge discontinuity problem, we used fast marching over the 2 D Gabor magnitude domain method {{to connect the}} discontinuous contour segments into a <b>closed</b> <b>tongue</b> body contour. First, several stable segments were selected based on the edge enhancement result. Then, the contour initialization problem was modeled as the minimal geodesic paths over the 2 D Gabor magnitude domain. Finally, the fast marching algorithm was used to obtain a <b>closed</b> <b>tongue</b> body contour for initialization.|$|E
30|$|Although the 2 D Gabor magnitude-based {{detector}} is effective, false {{detection of}} the tongue body boundary cannot be completely avoided. Moreover, it is also difficult to detect the entire <b>closed</b> <b>tongue</b> body contour by only using the 2 D Gabor magnitude-based detector. Fortunately, the location and shape {{of the tongue}} body are useful in distinguishing a true boundary from a false boundary. Thus, to suppress the adverse influence of false detection, we used the strategy of selecting stable segments of the tongue body contour.|$|E

40|$|In a {{traditional}} pipe organ the pipe ranks {{are composed of}} labial (flue) and lingual (reed) pipes. Both kinds of ranks are tuned and voiced to a nominal windchest pressure. Changing this pressure not only affects {{the volume of the}} radiated sound but both the pitch and the timbre of the pipes. This means a strict limitation to the dynamic range of these pipe ranks. In this contribution a new construction is examined that can possibly have an extended dynamic range: organ pipes with blown open tongues. These pipes have three main parts. From the windchest air is first conveyed into a small pressure tank which functions as the pipe foot. On the inner side of the pressure a blown open tongue is mounted. The other side of the tongue faces the resonator that can have various shapes. Contrary to traditional lingual pipes which have blown <b>closed</b> <b>tongues,</b> the blown open tongue can operate in a very wide range of driving pressures. The paper focuses on experimental investigations and discusses the results of laboratory measurements performed on experimental pipes. In addition, a simplified model of the new construction is established explaining the observed phenomena...|$|R

We evaluated tongue histology after myoblast transplantation under the hy-pothesis that myoblast transplantation will promote muscle regeneration and result in minimal scar tissue formation. Methods. Sterile solutions of 1 : 10 India ink, 1 % methylene blue, and 1 % crystal violet were applied to the inner lining of a left-sided mucosa-sparing hemiglossectomy pocket.

5000|$|The {{feeding pattern}} of the wood frog, {{basically}} {{similar to that of}} other ranids, is triggered by prey movement and consists of a bodily lunge that terminates with the mouth opening and an extension of the tongue onto the prey. The ranid tongue is attached {{to the floor of the}} mouth near the tip of the jaw, and when the mouth is <b>closed,</b> the <b>tongue</b> lies flat, extended posteriorly from its point of attachment. In the feeding strike, the tongue is swung forward as though on a hinge, so some portion of the normally dorsal and posterior tongue surface makes contact with the prey. At this point in the feeding strike, the wood frog differs markedly from more aquatic Lithobates species, such as the green frog, leopard frog, and bullfrog. The wood frog makes contact with the prey with just the tip of its tongue, much like a toad. [...] A more extensive amount of tongue surface is applied in the feeding strikes of these other frog species, with the result that usually the prey is engulfed by the fleshy tongue and considerable tongue surface contacts the surrounding substrate.|$|R

5000|$|Plosive versus {{fricative}} versus glide. Producing turbulence in {{the vocal}} tract requires a very careful adjustment: the minimum constriction cross-section must be typically less than 1.5mm, but greater than 0mm. If the <b>tongue</b> (for example) <b>closes</b> {{all the way}} against the palate, then releases again, {{the result is a}} plosive (as in [...] "tip"). If the <b>tongue</b> <b>closes</b> most of the way, but doesn't pass the magic 1.5mm boundary, the result is a glide (as in [...] "yip"). If the tongue reaches a minimum constriction width between 0 and 1.5mm, the resulting sound is a fricative (as in [...] "ship"). Despite the high degree of control required, most languages maintain a three-way contrast between glides, fricatives, and plosives, because of the large acoustic difference so achieved.|$|R

5000|$|One use of {{the word}} semivowel, {{sometimes}} called a glide, is a type of approximant, pronounced like a vowel but with the <b>tongue</b> <b>closer</b> to the roof of the mouth, so that there is slight turbulence. In English, /w/ is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel /u/, and /j/ (spelled [...] "y") is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel /i/ in this usage. Other descriptions use semivowel for vowel-like sounds that are not syllabic, but do not have the increased stricture of approximants. These are found as elements in diphthongs. The word may also be used to cover both concepts. The term glide is newer than semivowel, being used to indicate an essential quality of sounds such as /w/ and /j/, which is the movement (or glide) from their initial position (/u/ and /i/, respectively) to a following vowel.|$|R
