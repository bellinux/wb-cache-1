5|$|Some {{plants are}} thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of {{unpalatable}} chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns. Many insects, such as <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillars, acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants. Among mammals, skunks and zorillas advertise their foul-smelling chemical defences with sharply contrasting black-and-white patterns on their fur, while the similarly-patterned badger and honey badger advertise their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and aggressive natures. Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with contrasting patterns may also be aposematic, at least in females; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection, and their colouration is not correlated with edibility, {{it is unclear whether}} aposematism is significant.|$|E

25|$|The {{pathogen}} rust fungus or Puccinia lagenophorae and the <b>Cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> Tyria jacobaeae {{have both}} been used and studied {{in an attempt to}} control infestation of Senecio vulgaris.

The <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> eats groundsel between June and August, but the seeds germinate and the plant grows as soon as the ground is warm enough (and after a warm rain), making this an insufficient control almost everywhere groundsel can be found.|$|E

2500|$|Scramble {{completion}} {{can lead}} to unstable population dynamics, the equal division of resources can result in {{very few of the}} organisms obtaining enough to survive and reproduce and this can cause population crashes. [...] This phenomenon is called overcompensation. For instance, the caterpillars of <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moths</b> feed via scramble competition, and when there are too many caterpillars competing very few are able to pupate and there is a large population crash. Subsequently, very few <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moths</b> are competing intraspecifically in the next generation so the population grows rapidly before crashing again.|$|R
25|$|Some Lepidoptera species eat {{many of the}} Senecio genus; {{additional}} studies via electrophysiological recordings {{have shown that the}} taste sensilla of the <b>Cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> larvae respond (get excited) specifically to the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which all Senecio are known to contain.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the fact}} that ragwort is very {{attractive}} to such {{a vast array of}} insects, some of these are very rare indeed. Of the 30 species that specifically feed on ragwort alone, seven are officially deemed Nationally Scarce. A further three species are on the IUCN Red List. In short, ragwort is an exclusive food source for ten rare or threatened insect species, including the <b>Cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> (Tyria jacobaeae), the Picture Winged Fly (Campiglossa malaris), the Scarce Clouded Knot Horn moth (Homoeosoma nimbella), and the Sussex Emerald moth (Thalera fimbrialis). The Sussex Emerald has been labelled a Priority Species in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan. A Priority Species is one which is scarce, threatened and declining The remainder of the ten threatened species include three species of Leaf Beetle, another Picture-Winged Fly, and three micro moths. All of these species are Nationally Scarce B, with one Leaf Beetle categorised as Nationally Scarce A.|$|E

50|$|The <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> (Tyria jacobaeae) is {{a brightly}} {{coloured}} arctiid moth found in Europe and western and central Asia. It {{has been introduced}} into New Zealand, Australia and North America to control poisonous ragwort, on which its larvae feed. The moth is named after the red mineral cinnabar because of the red patches on its predominantly black wings. Cinnabar moths are about 20mm long and have a wingspan of 32 - 42 mm.|$|E
50|$|The magpie moth’s ‘woolly bear’ {{caterpillars}} {{are around}} 35-38 mm when fully grown and predominantly black with lines of red down its sides and back, blue spots and tufts of hair on each segment. Its liking for the introduced ragwort causes its caterpillars to be sometimes misidentified {{as those of}} the <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> which was introduced as a biological control for ragwort. By contrast cinnabar caterpillars have smooth bodies with alternating yellow and black rings.|$|E
50|$|Haccou and Hemerik {{studied the}} effects of the <b>Cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> larvae (Tyria jacobaeae) {{distribution}} on predation by F. polyctena. They found that the ants preyed more on larvae when they were on the ground than on plants. The ants also preyed more often on larvae that were concentrated in clusters over ones that were evenly dispersed. This is most likely due to communication between the ants, where when one worker discovers food such as a group of larvae, she alerts fellow workers.|$|E

The red and black, day-flying adult moth is also distasteful to many potential predators. The moth is used as a control for ragwort in countries in which it has been introduced and become a problem, like New Zealand and the western United States. As both larvae and adults are distinctly colored and marked, identification of cinnabars is easy outside of their natural range, and grounds and range keepers can quickly recognize them. In both countries, the tansy ragwort flea beetle (Longitarsus jacobaeae) has been introduced to combat the plant. Another beetle, Longitarsus ganglbaueri, also feeds on ragwort, but will feed on other plants as well, making it an unsuitable biological control.|$|E
5000|$|Aposematism is {{widespread}} in insects, but less so in vertebrates, being mostly {{confined to a}} smaller number of reptile, amphibian, and fish species, and some foul-smelling or aggressive mammals. Pitohuis, red and black birds whose toxic feathers and skin apparently comes from the poisonous beetles they ingest, could be included. [...] Perhaps the most numerous aposematic vertebrates are the poison dart frogs.Some plants are thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of unpalatable chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns. Many insects, such as <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillars, acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants.

50|$|This {{species is}} so named {{due to the}} colour of the hindwings and the {{markings}} on the forewings which make it unmistakable. There is little variation although on rare occasions the pinkish markings are replaced with yellow, or the forewing is red with a black border or the wings are completely black. Easily disturbed by day and flies in sunshine. Also flies after dark.Cinnabar moths are day-flying insects. Like many other brightly coloured moths, it is unpalatable; the larvae use members of the genus Senecio as foodplants. Many members of the genus have been recorded as foodplants, but for long-term population success, {{the presence of the}} larger species such as ragwort is needed. Smaller plant species, such as groundsel, are sometimes used, but since the species lays its eggs in large batches, survival tends to be reduced. Newly hatched larvae feed from the underneath of ragwort leaves within the area of their old eggs. The larvae absorb toxic and bitter tasting alkaloid substances from the foodplants, and assimilate them, becoming unpalatable themselves. The bright colours of both the larvae and the moths act as warning signs, so they are seldom eaten by predators. An exception is among different species of Cuckoo which eat hairy and poisonous caterpillars including <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> larvae.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 I {{conducted}} {{field and}} laboratory studies {{to determine the}} impact of the <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth,</b> Tvria jacobaeae L., on the native perennial herb, Senecio triangularis Hook. The <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> was introduced into Oregon in 1960 to control the noxious weed Senecio jacobaea L. and is now well established on both the native plant and the weed in Oregon. My objectives were to determine the suitability of S. triangularis as a diet for the <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth,</b> to estimate the frequency with which the moths colonize the native plant in the field, and to estimate the impact of larval feeding on the plant's survivorship and reproduction. Larvae successfully completed development on S. triangularis, but development time was longer, growth was slower, and pupae were lighter compared to performance on S. jacobaea. <b>Cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> colonization and feeding damage were concentrated at one of the four study sites observed. <b>Cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation results in a 3. 9 % reduction in seed viability and is inversely related to damage to seeds by native insects. I conclude that cinnabar moths commonly discover this native plant in the field, can establish and develop on it, and cause a small reduction in plant reproductive success...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> (Tyria jacobaeae (L.), Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) is an icon in {{population}} ecology and biological control that has recently lost its shine {{based on evidence}} that (1) it is less effective than alternatives (such as the ragwort flea beetle Longitarsus jacobaeae (Waterhouse) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) for controlling ragwort Senecio jacobaea L. (Asteraceae), (2) it eats nontarget plant species (including arrowleaf ragwort Senecio triangularis Hook. (Asteraceae), a native North American wildflower), and potentially harms the animals that depend on these native plant species, and (3) it carries a disease (caused by a host-specific microsporidian Nosema tyriae). This presents us {{with an opportunity to}} study whether poor nutrition and disease might constrain colonization of new hosts by this phytophagous insect and thereby mitigate risk of biological control to nontarget plant species. We evaluated the interactions within a tritrophic system composed of the <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> (herbivorous insect), its Old and New World Host plant species, and its entomopathogen (Nosema tyriae) both at the individual and population levels in a controlled environment. Chapter one concentrates on the two trophic (herbivore-host plant) interactions, addresses the importance of the preference and performance relationship, and the reasons why we might observe a weak relationship between preference and performance. Performance was measured both by vital rates and by population dynamic parameters, and we conclude that the projected population growth rate of the <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> population is the best indicator of host suitability. We found a positive correlation between preference and performance in the <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> (Tyria jacobaea) on Old World and New World host plants. The second chapter incorporates the third trophic level, the pathogen Nosema tyriae, and measures the individual and interacting effects of pathogen dose and host plant species on the performance of the <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth.</b> It concludes that all <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> vital rates (rates of growth, development, survival, and reproduction) decrease with the increasing dose of pathogen (Nosema) spores. Vital rates generally were lower on the New World host S. triangularis compared to Old World host S. jacobaea. The projected population growth rates of <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> populations were more sensitive to low infection dose in <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> populations on the New World host S. triangularis compared to the Old World host S. jacobaea. At high pathogen doses, the effect of the pathogen was so overwhelming that no effect of host could be expressed. In conclusion, we observed a strong positive correlation between preference and performance of the <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> on the New World and Old World test plants. In the most successful new host-herbivore association, the <b>cinnabar</b> <b>moth</b> was more vulnerable to the impact of the natural enemy on New compared to Old host plant species...|$|E
