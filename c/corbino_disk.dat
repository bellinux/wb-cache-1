40|$|We solve Dirac-Bogoliubov-De-Gennes (DBdG) {{equation}} in a superconductor-normal graphene superconductor (SGS) junction with <b>Corbino</b> <b>disk</b> {{structure to}} investigate the Josephson current through this junction. We find that the critical current I_c has a nonzero value at Dirac point in which the concentration of the carriers is zero. We show this nonzero critical current depends on the system geometry and it decreases monotonically to zero by increasing {{the ratio of the}} outer to inner radii of the <b>Corbino</b> <b>disk</b> (R_ 2 /R_ 1), while in the limit of R_ 2 /R_ 1 → 1 it scales like a diffusive <b>Corbino</b> <b>disk.</b> The product of the critical current and the normal-state resistance I_cR_N attains the same value for the planar structure at zero doping.

A pump and probe measurement demonstrates that DNP emerges near the critical voltage of the QHE breakdown.

40|$|The Kroemer {{model for}} the Gunn effect in a {{circular}} geometry (<b>Corbino</b> <b>disks)</b> has been numerically solved. The results have been interpreted by means of asymptotic calculations. Above a certain onset dc voltage bias, axisymmetric pulses of the electric field are periodically shed by an inner circular cathode. These pulses decay as they move towards the outer anode, which they may not reach. As a pulse advances, the external current increases continuously until a new pulse is generated.

40|$|Composite fermions in {{fractional}} quantum Hall (FQH) {{systems are}} believed to form a Fermi sea of weakly interacting particles at half filling ν= 1 / 2. Recently, it was proposed (D. T. Son, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031027 (2015)) that these composite fermions are Dirac particles. In our work, we demonstrate experimentally that composite fermions found in monolayer graphene are Dirac particles at half filling. Our experiments have addressed FQH states in high-mobility, suspended graphene <b>Corbino</b> <b>disks</b> {{in the vicinity of}} ν= 1 / 2. We find strong temperature dependence of conductivity σ away from half filling, which is consistent with the expected electron-electron interaction induced gaps in the FQH state. At half filling, however, the temperature dependence of conductivity σ(T) becomes quite weak as expected for a Fermi sea of composite fermions and we find only logarithmic dependence of σ on T. The sign of this quantum correction coincides with weak antilocalization of composite fermions, which reveals the relativistic Dirac nature of composite fermions in graphene.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a single-electron tunneling effect of two-dimensional electron systems {{formed in the}} Corbino nano-scale disk. By controlling bias and gate voltages, the transistor using this effect is able to control electrons one by one. The present study focuses on the electronic transmission probability affected by the charging energy in the Corbino-type single-electron transistor. We reformulated the Schrödinger equation for an electron in the <b>Corbino</b> <b>disk</b> in order to consider {{the effect of the}} curvature of the disk, taking into account the charging effect on the performance of the Corbino-type single-electron transistor. We formulated the transmission probability of the electron by applying the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method. The electron’s energy in the formula of the transmission probability is then associated to the energy eigenvalue of the Schrödinger equation for an electron in an effective confining potential.

40|$|Using the {{transfer}} matrix in the angular-momentum space we investigate {{the impact of}} trigonal warping on magnetotransport and scaling properties of a ballistic bilayer graphene in the Corbino geometry. Although the conductivity at the charge-neutrality point and zero magnetic field exhibits a one-parameter scaling, the shot-noise characteristics, quantified by the Fano factor F and the third charge-transfer cumulant R, remain pseudodiffusive. This shows that the pseudodiffusive transport regime in bilayer graphene {{is not related to}} the universal value of the conductivity but can be identified by higher charge-transfer cumulants. For <b>Corbino</b> <b>disks</b> with larger radii ratios the conductivity is suppressed by the trigonal warping, mainly because the symmetry reduction amplifies backscattering for normal modes corresponding to angular-momentum eigenvalues ± 2 ħ. Weak magnetic fields enhance the conductivity, reaching the maximal value near the crossover field B_L= 4 / 3 √(3) (ħ/e) t't_[t_ 0 ^ 2 a(R_ o-R_ i) ]^- 1, where t_ 0 (t_) is the nearest-neighbor intra- (inter-) layer hopping integral, t' is the skew-interlayer hopping integral, and R_ o (R_ i) is the outer (inner) disk radius. For magnetic fields B≳B_L we observe quasiperiodic conductance oscillations characterized by the decreasing mean value 〈σ〉-σ_ 0 ∝B_L/B, where σ_ 0 =(8 /π) e^ 2 /h. The conductivity, as well as higher charge-transfer cumulants, show beating patterns with an envelope period proportional to √(B/B_L). This constitutes a qualitative difference between the high-field (B≫B_L) magnetotransport in the t'= 0 case (earlier discussed in Ref. [1]) and in the t'≠ 0 case, providing a finite-system analog of the Lifshitz transition. Comment: Minor revisions; new Ref. [41]. A version accepted for publication in Physical Review...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{transport}} {{through an}} impurity-free <b>Corbino</b> <b>disk</b> in bilayer graphene is investigated analytically, by the mode-matching method for effective Dirac equation, {{in the presence}} of uniform magnetic fields. Similarly as in the monolayer case (see Refs. [1, 2]), conductance at the Dirac point shows oscillations with the flux piercing the disk area Φ_D characterized by the period Φ_ 0 = 2 (h/e) (R_ o/R_ i), where R_ o (R_ i) is the outer (inner) disk radius. The oscillations magnitude depends either on the radii ratio or on the physical disk size, with the condition for maximal oscillations reading R_ o/R_ i≃[R_ it_/(2 ħv_F) ]^ 4 /p (for R_ o/R_ i≫ 1), where t_ is the interlayer hopping integral, v_F is the Fermi velocity in graphene, and p is an even integer. Odd-integer values of p correspond to vanishing oscillations for the normal Corbino setup, or to oscillations frequency doubling for the Andreev-Corbino setup. At higher Landau levels (LLs) magnetoconductance behaves almost identically in the monolayer and bilayer cases.
