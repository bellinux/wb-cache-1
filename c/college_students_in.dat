5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 <b>college</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Swiss {{scientist}} Albert Hofmann—known for {{the synthesis of}} the psychedelic drug LSD—chemically analyzed P.semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of paper chromatography, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) psilocybin in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in Psilocybe species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from <b>college</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> British Columbia identified P.semilanceata—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then {{support the idea that}} the variability of psilocybin content in P.semilanceata is low, regardless of country of origin.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two studies}} {{conducted to determine}} whether there is a stigma associated with being in psychotherapy and if so, how that stigma compares with the well-documented stigma associated with mental illness (Wahl, 1995). In the first study, community members (n= 89) were asked to listen to an audiotaped statement from a young man. All participants listened to the same statement, and were either told the statement was from a <b>college</b> <b>student,</b> a <b>college</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> psychotherapy, or a <b>college</b> <b>student</b> who is mentally ill. The prediction that the <b>college</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> psychotherapy and the <b>college</b> <b>student</b> who is mentally ill would be rated similarly was partially supported. In the second study, the procedures were identical except that the participants (n= 76) were asked to read a written transcript of the same audiotaped statement. Again, the prediction that the <b>college</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> psychotherapy and the <b>college</b> <b>student</b> who is mentally ill would be rated similarly was partially supported. Results suggest that persons in psychotherapy and persons designated as mentally ill are seen as no different from each other, but very different from persons believed to be normal.

25|$|A {{group of}} faculty members at the University of California San Diego first {{conceived}} the idea of establishing a college-preparatory school for minority groups after California Proposition 209, a state measure that banned the use of affirmative action, passed in 1996. It was their belief, as expressed by Cecil Lytle, provost of Thurgood Marshall College, that public universities were not active enough in creating educational opportunities for the state's most disadvantaged youth. Faculty members Hugh Mehan and Peter Gourevitch proposed establishing a college-preparatory school that would admit only low-income youths with the potential of becoming first-generation <b>college</b> <b>students.</b> <b>In</b> 1997, the proposal {{was sent to the}} Regents of the University of California for approval. The regents, citing a concerns over fiscal responsibility and oversight, rejected the proposal.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s {{were very}} {{challenging}} years for Phi Iota Alpha. The {{effects of the}} Vietnam War and the '60s counter-culture created an anti-institutional atmosphere amongst many <b>college</b> <b>students.</b> <b>In</b> addition, this drastically reduced the enrollment of Latin American students in American universities. This in turn hindered potential membership to the organization. As a result, by 1968, {{after many years of}} struggle, the only active undergraduate chapters were at LSU, and at RPI. The chapter at RPI became inactive in 1973 with the graduation of its Secretary General. The Secretary General took with him the chapter's official fraternity documents. By 1979, the last active brother from the chapter at LSU graduated, thereby marking the closing of the undergraduate chapter at LSU.|$|E
