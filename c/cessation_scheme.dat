40|$|The use of {{incentives}} to promote smoking cessation is a promising technique {{for increasing the}} effectiveness of interventions. This study evaluated the smoking cessation outcomes and factors associated with success for pregnant smokers who registered with a pilot incentivised smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>scheme</b> in a Scottish health board area (NHS Tayside) ...|$|E
40|$|Smoking {{cessation}} is {{well documented}} to be a clinically effective and cost effective health care intervention for adults. However, there has been limited research about whether the provision of smoking cessation services would be as appropriate for the adolescent age group, given the differences in their smoking behaviour and attitude. Following pilot adolescent smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>schemes</b> in Denmark, the Netherlands and Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government led the development of further pilot projects in: Belgium; Denmark; Greece; the Netherlands; Portugal; the Slovak Republic; Spain and Wales. Most projects delivered school-based weekly cessation sessions over a six to eight week period focussing on 16 to 18 year olds. However, there was variation in the approach adopted and in the contexts in which projects operated. Researchers from the Cardiff Institute of Society, Health and Ethics (CISHE) were appointed to evaluate the EU funded pilot programme focussing on a process evaluation of how the programme was implemented, delivered and supported in three case study countries. This report includes key lessons about what works in terms of setting up and implementing projects with a particular focus on adapting smoking cessation activities for adults to the different and changing needs of adolescents...|$|R
40|$|The "Green Europe" {{was created}} in 1967 in order to {{integrate}} the agricultural economy of the Member Countries. For the dairy market, the Community implemented programs aimed at ensure good supply of dairy products, reasonable revenue to dairy producers, and occupation of some less favored areas. The subsidizing and public storage program for dairy products (milk powder and butter) led to surplus production. The cost of such a policy became unacceptable for Community Members. In 1984, the Minister of Agriculture Council decided to implement a quota program on milk production coupled with strong <b>cessation</b> <b>schemes</b> {{in order to reduce}} milk production and improve efficiency of dairy farms. This program led to a 25 % reduction in number of dairy farms, a 8 % reduction in milk production and improved average productivity of dairy cows. The cost of the dairy policy decreased 20 %, including cost for supply and demand management of the dairy sector. Public intervention on the dairy market became unnecessary and revenue of dairy producers improved. Social goals, placed at a high priority level have been fulfilled. Agricultural and Food Policy, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, and in October of {{the same}} year a Direct Ryde and Ventnor Railway was proposed; {{requiring}} only Â£120,000 in capital it would follow much easier ground and claimed that landowners would not object to it; this scheme fared equally badly and was almost immediately abandoned. The end of the Railway Mania resulted in the <b>cessation</b> of railway <b>scheme</b> promotion for some time, and it was not until 1852 that further railways were proposed, but these too failed to gain support.|$|R
25|$|Some {{unregistered}} {{staff can}} work in other roles, for example as phlebotomists (taking blood samples), ECG technicians (recording electrocardiograms) or smoking <b>cessation</b> therapists, a <b>scheme</b> currently being employed {{in a number of}} general practitioner surgeries. Others can expand their ward-based role to include these tasks and others. There are few areas of nursing practice that cannot be legally performed by suitably trained non-registered staff, although they cannot fully replace them, as they legally must be supervised (either directly or indirectly) by a fully qualified registered nurse.|$|R
60|$|Lady Elizabeth {{could only}} {{feel that she}} should be more at ease when she was not always in dread of {{interrupting}} a tete-a-tete, and when there was no longer any need to force Emma into society, and see her put on that resigned countenance which expressed that it was all filial duty to a mother who knew no better. Moreover, Lady Elizabeth hoped for a <b>cessation</b> of the <b>schemes</b> for the Priory, which were so extravagant as to make her dread Emma's five-and-twentieth year.|$|R

40|$|Smoking is {{understood}} as {{the primary cause of}} preventable morbidity and premature death in the UK. In Northamptonshire, UK, the rate of smoking among adults was 20. 9 % (approximately 144, 607 people) in 2011 / 12. Among pregnant women, compared to the national average (13. 2 %), the rate of smoking at time of delivery was higher in Northamptonshire (16 %) in 2011 / 12. In terms of smoking cessation programs during pregnancy, incentivised smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>schemes</b> have been more frequently utilised when attempting to reduce rates of smoking among pregnant women. While smoking cessation interventions broadly accounted for a 6 % increase in late-pregnancy abstinence rates compared to control interventions, only those that contained an incentivised component showed a significantly larger effect (RR 0. 76, 95 % CI 0. 71 to 0. 81). This paper presents preliminary findings of an incentivised smoking cessation pilot intervention in Northamptonshire which aimed to recruit 50 pregnant women who smoke and evaluate the feasibility of the incentive programme in terms of its: uptake of stop smoking services; numbers of those setting a quit date; effectiveness to reduce smoking following referral to stop smoking services (i. e. 4 weeks after quit date); effectiveness to reduce smoking status at delivery and the psychosocial outcomes of incentivised smoking cessation programs for pre- and post-natal women. This research applied a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach to assess the aggregated effectiveness of the program (through cross-sectional analysis) and understand individual-level positive and negative experiences of the program (through storytelling and in-depth interviews). We will report initial results (data collection currently underway) that will include baseline profile data and uptake of the incentive programme. It {{is important to note that}} gendered roles and experiences may make it more difficult for some women to access treatment and support for smoking cessation, given the heightened stigma surrounding smoking during pregnancy and mothers who smoke. This presentation will, therefore, also emphasize findings that report gendered influences on smoking such as partner influence, socioeconomic impact of lone-motherhood and individual, societal and structural stigma surrounding mothers that smoke...|$|R
