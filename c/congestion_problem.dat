5|$|After the First World War, the {{population}} of the west London suburbs continued to grow, thanks to improved rail transport links and the growth in ownership of automobiles. In 1925, the Ministry of Transport convened a conference between Surrey and Middlesex county councils with the aim of reaching a solution to the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem,</b> and the Great Chertsey Road scheme was revived. In 1927, the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic approved the scheme to relieve the by then chronic traffic congestion on the existing, mostly narrow, streets in the area, and on the narrow bridges at Richmond Bridge, Kew and Hammersmith. The Ministry of Transport agreed to pay heavy subsidies towards the cost.|$|E

25|$|In January 2008, {{the mayor}} of Milan, Letizia Moratti, {{launched}} the Ecopass program expecting a 30% cut in pollution levels and a 10% reduction in traffic. The program imposed a charge on vehicles with higher pollution levels. Ecopass was an incentive for motorists to buy less pollutant cars, {{and in a few}} years the number of cars with free access were the majority. Despite the fact that these vehicles having less polluting engines, the free access helped less with the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem.</b> This trend contributed to a return to previous traffic levels {{and at the same time}} reducing revenue collected. This threatened the ability to keep the system in operation.|$|E
30|$|Mobility (or handover-based) load {{balancing}} {{has been identified}} as a relevant SON use case by the industry [6, 7] and standardization bodies [8]. Load balancing capability is included to deal with uneven and/or changing traffic distribution, which might cause network <b>congestion</b> <b>problems.</b> These <b>congestion</b> <b>problems</b> are commonplace in femtocell networks due to a high user concentration and the lack of a careful analysis of user trends. Therefore, improving load sharing capabilities is key to ensuring adequate performance in these heterogeneous scenarios.|$|R

40|$|The {{size and}} {{complexity}} of mobile communication networks have increased {{in the last years}} making network management a very complicated task. GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) systems are in a mature state now. Thus, non-optimal performance does not come from typical network start-up problems, but, more likely, from the mismatching between traffic, network or propagation models used for network planning, and their real counterparts. Such differences cause network <b>congestion</b> <b>problems</b> both in signalling and data channels. With the aim of maximising the financial benefits on their mature networks, operators do not solve anymore <b>congestion</b> <b>problems</b> by adding new radio resources, as they usually did. Alternatively, two main strategies can be adopted, a) a better assignment of radio resources through a re-planning approach, and/or b) the automatic configuration (optimisation, in a wide sense) of network parameters. Both techniques aim to adapt the network to the actual traffic and propagation conditions. Moreover, a new heterogenous scenario, where several services and Radio Access Technologies (RATs) coexist in the same area, is now common, causing new unbalanced traffic scenarios and <b>congestion</b> <b>problems.</b> In this thesis, several optimisation and modelling methods are proposed to solve <b>congestion</b> <b>problems</b> in data and signalling channels for single- and multi-RAT scenarios...|$|R

2500|$|The {{organisation}} is in {{the position}} against building new roads and they believe that this would not neither reduce the traffic nor the number of cars.

2500|$|Before the Ecopass {{came into}} force there were around 98 {{thousand}} vehicles entering the restricted zone every day, but now {{traffic in the}} ZTL is approaching 87,000 daily vehicles (91,7 thousand in November 2008) and it seems traffic jams are slowly {{coming back to the}} pre-Ecopass levels. In the same regard, another criticism is the slow erosion of the system benefits, as the Ecopass price structure has been an incentive for car owners to buy new vehicles, and now more than 7,000 vehicles per day have free access. Despite the fact that these vehicles having less polluting engines, the free access helps less with the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem.</b> [...] This trend is contributing to a return to previous traffic levels {{and at the same time}} reducing revenue collected. [...] This threatens the ability to keep the system in operation. Also it was criticized the decision to maintain the exemption for Euro IV diesel vehicles when authorities decided to extend the Ecopass until December 2009, because this decision is also contributing to the fading of the initial benefits.|$|E
2500|$|With {{ever-increasing}} {{population and}} traffic congestion, highways in South Florida {{are constantly being}} widened and upgraded with things such as express lanes to ease delays. Ironically, the virtually endless expansion and reconstruction projects due to rapid growth and induced demand {{are part of the}} <b>congestion</b> <b>problem.</b> The Miami-Dade area is consistently ranked as one of the worst regions in the country for traffic problems, and was ranked as the worst east coast metropolitan area for traffic in 2010. Parts of the Dolphin and Palmetto expressways as well as I-95 and Florida's Turnpike see near gridlock conditions at rush hour on a daily basis. According {{to a study by the}} American Highway Users Alliance (AHUA) in 2015, three of the nations worst bottlenecks are in Miami-Dade on the Dolphin and Palmetto Expressways. In the 2010s, increasing traffic delays were cited as an impediment to the rebounding office market.
