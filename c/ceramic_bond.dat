Method: Ceramic blocks (e. max CAD®, Ivoclar Vivadent AG) were firstly treated with one of two surface treatments: (1) hydrofluoric acid (HF) (IPS Ceramic Etching gel, Ivoclar Vivadent AG) etched followed by silane (Monobond-S, Ivoclar Vivadent AG) application; (2) HF etched, silane applied, followed by heating treatment and an application of an unfilled resin (Heliobond, Ivoclar Vivadent AG). Two testing models were used according to two testing substrates: <b>ceramic</b> <b>bonded</b> to <b>ceramic</b> with the same surface treatment (C-C) and <b>ceramic</b> <b>bonded</b> to resin composite (C-R). Two resin cements, Variolink II® (Ivoclar Vivadent AG) and Clearfil SA Cement (Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc.), were tested. Each group (n= 30) was stored in distilled water for 7 days at 37 °C. They were subjected to a tensile force until failure. Mean bond strengths were reported at the IADR-APR session in 2013. The results were subsequently analyzed using Weibull statistics with R 2. 12. 1 software package and are now presented here. Result: Weibull modulii of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>bonded</b> to resin composite groups were 3. 6 - 7. 8 while modulii of <b>ceramic</b> <b>bonded</b> to <b>ceramic</b> groups were 5. 1 - 9. 9.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to carry out and compare four {{different}} test methods for metal <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond</b> strength in fixed prosthodontics. Among these test methods were the crack-initiation test according to SCHWICKERATH (DIN EN ISO 9693), the VOSS procedure, the tensile bond strength test according to PÜCHNER {{as well as a}} thermal shock test for ceramic-metal systems. The four test methods were applied to the cobalt-chromium-based metal alloy WIROBOND C (BEGO, Bremen, Germany) with the suitable porcelain VITA OMEGA 900 (VITA, Bad Saeckingen, Germany) and subsequently critically evaluated. Fifty samples were produced for each test method and divided up into five series of ten samples each. Each series was exposed to one of the following preconditions: water (three months or six months), corrosive solution (three months and six months) or dry storage. Twenty series had to be tested altogether, with five series for each test method and each precondition. When exposed to the crack-initiation test, values between 34, 9 MPa and 37, 4 MPa were attained by the samples. The bond strength measured in the VOSS procedure was in the range of 1400 N and 2836 N, values in the tensile bond strength test (PÜCHNER) ranged from 31, 1 MPa to 33, 1 MPa. When exposed to the thermal shock test, the first damages to the crowns became obvious at a temperature of 150 °C. The revealed values were similar to the results of previous studies. Neither water nor the corrosive solution had an effect on the test results according to SCHWICKERATH, PÜCHNER or the thermal shock test. When exposed to the VOSS procedure (pressure load test), the values displayed a general reduction  a result which called for thorough discussion. The comparison of the tests did not exhibit any dependence or correlation of the obtained values among themselves. With regard to the forces measured, it can be concluded that each test method aims at testing a different component of the metal <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond.</b> Moreover, the productions of the samples differ in their complexity and the subsequent testing process is afflicted with the possibility of error. The appropriateness of the methods for general statements about the metal <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond</b> is to be regarded critically. Especially the test according to PÜCHNER is less suitable for the quantification of the metal <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond,</b> but indicates that the chemical compound is the main component of a metal <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond.</b> Retentive and cohesive elements fail during the test before destruction of the oxide layer. While the methods according to SCHWICKERATH and VOSS are most appropriate for assessing the bond strength in general, the thermal shock test seems fitting for analyzing technical factors in manufacturing metal ceramic crowns. These results are valuable for the work of dental technicians, as the thermal shock test gives information about internal tensions which are caused by the manufacturing production method or incompatible metal ceramic combinations. The present study indicates that a straightforward comparison of the chosen test methods is hardly realizable. When judged from different perspectives, each proposed method is qualified for testing a certain component of the metal <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond</b> which implies that recommendations regarding their utilization depend on the question to be answered, regarding metal <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond...</b>|$|E

For the clinical longevity, metal-ceramic prostheses must have satisfactory bond strength between metal and ceramic. Aim and Objective: The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the effect of Laser etching on shear bond strength between base metal alloys and ceramic. Materials and Methods: A total of 60 specimens were made (Base 5 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness, step with 4 mm diameter and 4 mm in length). They were divided into three groups. Group A-control, Group B-sand blasting, and Group C-laser etching. The Surface morphology, surface roughness, and wettability of the specimens were observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM) Ceramic application was carried out layer by layer for an optimal height of 4 mm. The shear bond strength test was performed using a universal testing machine and the nature of the fracture was examined under SEM. Results: The mean shear bond strength values for laser etched (Group C) Nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloy <b>bonded</b> with <b>ceramic</b> was (49. 12 ± 7. 12 MPa) and <b>ceramic</b> <b>bonded</b> with Cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) was (50. 04 ± 4. 27 MPa), sand blasted (Group B) Ni-Cr alloy <b>bonded</b> with <b>ceramic</b> was (26. 00 ± 5. 22 MPa), and <b>ceramic</b> <b>bonded</b> with Co-Cr was 24. 54 ± 4. 78 MPa.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to compare three {{different}} test methods for metal <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond</b> strength of dental ceramics fused to alloys and to investigate {{if there is a}} correlation between these tests. Implemented test methods were the crack-initiation test according to SCHWICKERATH (described in DIN EN ISO 9693), the VOSS procedure and the thermal shock test. The specimens were crafted according to the terms of advice of the particular test and manufacturer’s data. Seven different alloys by the BEGO Company, which are all available on the dental market, were used. To cover a wide range of different alloys two nickel-chrome-, two cobalt-chrome-, a palladium-, a gold-reduced- and a high-gold-alloy were chosen. The veneering ceramic was Omega 900 by the VITA Company. Twelve specimens for each alloy and each test method were compounded to obtain a high reproducibility. The total number added up to 252 test specimens. During the crack-initiation test, values between 36, 4 and 49, 2 MPa were measured. The samples of the VOSS procedure achieved bond strength in the range between 626 and 1987 N. The specimens of the thermal shock test passed the test almost error-free. Only two failures could be seen at a level of 150 and 165 °C. Comparing my own results with previous studies it is obvious that they are similar which proves the correctness of my results. The production of the samples differed in complexity. The samples for the SCHWICKERATH-test had a simply defined geometry. The shaping of the crowns for the VOSS procedure and the thermal shock test was more complex. According to that the manufacturing had a higher risk of error. This becomes obvious in the test results; the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation reached a lower level in the SCHWICKERATH-test than in the VOSS procedure. The three test methods are suitable to show different aspects of the metal <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond.</b> The crack-initiation test examines the compound structure which means that the layer between metal and opaquer is concerned whereas the VOSS procedure gives information on the system as a whole. The thermal shock test shows thermal tensions and incompatibilities within the microstructure. The question to be answered was if the three test methods correlate with each other. The present investigation reveals that they do not correlate. To sum up it can be said clinical testing is essential for the predictability if a combination of materials can be used in-vivo. New alloys can be compared with well-known materials. Admittedly one single test method is not sufficient to give advice for good clinical practice...|$|E

The latter showed thermal expansion near to zero up to 500 °C, followed by an expansion of ∼ 0. 5 % up to 1000 °C, then a decrease between 1000 and 1050 °C, concluding with a constant value of expansion < 0. 5 % up to 1250 °C.

One of the possibilities to improve the properties of PCD materials is the lowering of cobalt bonding phase content which is used in commercial materials. Design/methodology/approach: The new bonding phases were prepared using the self-propagating high temperature method of synthesis (SHS). The MAX compounds Zr 2 SnC and Ti 2 SnC were produced from stoichiometric mixtures of powders. Diamond powders mixtures with participation of 10 mass% of the SHS product were prepared. Diamond composites were obtained using the high pressure - high temperature sintering method. Microstructure investigations were performed using the electron scanning microscope. Phase compositions of the SHS products and diamond compacts were analyzed by x-ray diffraction. Findings: The X-ray phase analyses indicate that the bonding material prepared {{by means of the}} SHS method has a multiphase composition. As a result of reaction between carbon and elements of the bonding phase new carbon phases appear in the diamond compacts. Studies of the microstructures of the diamond composites show good consolidation without microcracks. There is good penetration of the bonding phase between diamond crystallites. Practical implications: Due to the <b>ceramic</b> <b>bonding</b> phase diamond composites should have better thermal resistance than the diamond with the cobalt bonding phase.

The deposition conditions have a great influence on the structure and biofunctionality of calcium phosphate coatings. Corrosion processes and poor adhesion to substrate material reduce the lifetime of implants with calcium phosphate coatings. The research has focused on the development of advanced methods to deposit double-layered ceramic oxide/calcium phosphate coatings by a hybrid technique of magnetron sputtering and thermal methods. The thermal method can promote the crystallization and the formation of HAp coatings on titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V substrates at low temperature, based on the principle that the solubility of HAp in aqueous solutions decreases with increasing substrate temperature. By this method, hydroxyapatite directly coated the substrate without precipitation in the initial solution.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 ths {{grinding}} wheels of Sol-Gel-Corundum were introduced for the finishing of metallic materials. Sol-Gel-Corundum wheels represent a flexible, efficient and economical {{alternative to the}} high-hard abrasives CBN and diamond. Likewise high-speed grinding technique {{was established in the}} 1990 ths as efficient finishing technology. Previous developments are concentrated on the technical systems grinding wheel and grinding machine. Little attention found the system grinding wheel structure, which consist of the components grain and bond. Although new grain and bond materials were introduced, systematic investigations of the grain bond compounds are missing. Questions about real geometry of the grains and the bond bridges or the reactions at the interface grain/bond remained unanswered. Target of this work was, to examine systematically the chemical reactions of the grinding grain materials Sol-Gel-Corundum compared with White Corundum with a <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond</b> material and to discuss the effects of the reaction zones at the interface grain/bond for a grinding wheel structure. The perceptions should be brought into connection with the mechanical data from bending strength investigations and grain outbreak tests as well as be examined in relation to the real grinding wheel structure. Within the methodology a special attention was turned to the interdisciplinary approach, which connects the systematic mode of operation of product development with the approaches of the engineering sciences and analytics of the natural sciences. It were used Design of Experiments for mixture quantity experiments, the Inductive coupled plasma (ICP) for the chemical analysis, the heating microscopy for determination of the flow behaviour, the Differential Scanning Calorimetry Analysis (DSC) for the analysis of the phase formation under temperature supply, the light microscopy and the raster electron microscopy analysis (REM) for the investigation of the two-dimensional grinding wheel structures, bending break test for the determination of the flexural strength and youngs-modulus, grain break out experiments for the determination of the grain break out behaviour, electron beam micro probe analysis (EPMA) for the phase analysis as well as the microcomputer tomographic investigation of a grinding wheel structure, whose results were transferred as three-dimensional geometry model into a CAD system. It could be shown that the simplifications of the models according to Frenkel, Pietsch and Rumpf {{will not be able to}} represent the structure of a grinding wheel. Both the simplifications of the effective forces at the interface grain/bond and of the description of geometry of the grains and the bond bridges are too large, than that the model could illustrate the grinding wheel structure with sufficient accuracy. As well it is not possible to determine the number of bond bridges, which connect the grains. Therefore a further technique was used, in order to illustrate the three-dimensional geometry of a grinding wheel structur and make it possible to analys a grinding wheel by numerical simulations. The priority target of further investigations must be the analysis of the phases occurring at the boundary surface of the interface grain/bond. The detailed knowledge of the mechanical characteristic values of the grains and the bond bridges as well as crystallites in the burned status are elementary conditions for the accurate numeric simulation of the grinding process. Therefore special attention must be put to the develop methods for the determination of the mechanical characteristic values of a burned grinding wheel and adequate material models for their representation in future research projects in order to prepare the way from the empirical to the systematical product development. The knowledge of the processes running between grain and bond have been deepened and the fundamental connections between the chemical raw material and the resulting physical and mechanical characteristics at the boundary surface at the interface grain/bond in a grinding wheel have been determined.

The second null-hypothesis {{was rejected}} in part, as the luting agent {{had a significant}} influence on the SBS in groups ES+ with adhesive, ES and ES+ without adhesive. Etching alone and use of adhesive resin promoted similar bond strength, which {{can be explained by}} the micromechanical interlocking created by the luting agent or adhesive coat [25]. However, this work reaffirms the importance of associating the mechanical and chemical treatments to reach high bond strength as illustrated by E/S groups and application of the adhesive resin over the silanated surface to provides better infiltration into the irregularities of the etched surfaces [11]. On the other hand, Passos et al. [12] did not find better results when applying the adhesive coat before the luting agent because they used a dual-cure resin cement which is flowable by nature. When using more viscous luting agents, however, the low viscosity resin seems to be indispensable to wet the etched and silanized ceramic surface, infiltrate in the micrometric spaces and ensure the <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond</b> strength by micromechanical interlocking [11, 25]. The omission of this step probably generated an insufficient penetration of the luting agent in the micro porosity and consequently decreases the ceramic mechanical strength [26]. These empty spaces can be an area of stress concentration since the adhesive layer work like an damper [27]. The lower bond strength obtained by silane alone, regardless of the use of adhesive resin and type of luting agent, {{can be explained by the}} absence of micromechanical retention in the ceramic surface, showing that the chemical step alone is not sufficient to obtain high bond strength. Regarding the luting agent, the similarity in bond strength between restorative and flowable composite resin could be explained by the fact that in this research the authors did not used pressure during the luting agent application. Seating pressure during luting could promote a better penetration of the resin into the ceramic retention. This study is restricted to some materials and did not evaluated the longevity of the SBS, thus more studies are suggested to compare the luting agent degradation in the course of time.|$|E

For the diffusion bonding technology, titanium interlayers (coatings and foils) were used to aid in the joining of silicon carbide (SiC) substrates. The influence of such variables as surface finish, interlayer thickness, and processing time were investigated. Electron microprobe analysis was used to identify the reaction formed phases. In the diffusion bonds, an intermediate phase, Ti 5 Si 3 Cx, formed that is thermally incompatible in its thermal expansion and caused thermal stresses and cracking during the processing cool-down. Thinner interlayers of pure titanium and/or longer processing times resulted in an optimized microstructure. Tensile tests on the joined materials resulted in strengths of 13 - 28 MPa depending on the SiC substrate material. Nondestructive evaluation using ultrasonic immersion showed well formed bonds.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background: All-ceramic restorations have {{excellent}} esthetic outcomes {{compared with other}} restorative materials. Lithium disilicate is classified as one of many silica-based all-ceramic materials. Currently, companies have provided single-step adhesives, known as universal adhesives, compatible with different restorative materials including lithium disilicate. Many studies have reported greater bond strengths when using a silane to treat the lithium disilicate before applying the bonding agent. Moreover, few studies were published comparing the bond strength when using the universal adhesive alone. Purpose: The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate and compare shear bond strength of three universal adhesives to lithium disilicate ceramic restorative material. Materials and Methods: Three universal adhesive bonding agents were selected from commercially available adhesives. 408 IPS e. max CAD ceramic discs were processed, fired, and etched for 20 s. The specimens were divided into six groups. The first three groups used the universal adhesive directly. The remaining three groups were treated with silane. Then, a composite resin cylinder was placed on top of the adhesive using a bonding jig. Each group was subdivided into four equal subgroups (n = 17), subjected to different aging simulation procedures: 24 h, one month with 5000 thermocycles, two months with 5000 cycles, and three months with 5000 cycles. Then, specimens were debonded using shear force by a universal testing machine (MTS). Results: Shear bond strength was greater with silane than without silane (p < 0. 0001), regardless of the levels of adhesive or time. Shear bond strength was significantly greater at 24 h and 1 m than at 2 m (p < 0. 0001) or 3 m (p < 0. 0001) regardless of the adhesive or the presence of silane. Debonded specimens were examined under a stereomicroscope at X 45 magnification to evaluate the fracture pattern. SEM was used to prove the results were considered as mixed failure. Conclusion: The optimal bonds to lithium disilicate are achieved by application of silane prior to application of a universal adhesive. Although the constituent silane in the universal adhesive was not effective in optimizing the resin to <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond,</b> silane should always be applied to lithium disilicate prior to bonding. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background and Rationale: As {{compared}} with glass-based ceramics, zirconia has gained considerable popularity in restorative dentistry {{due to its}} superior mechanical properties. Clinically, however, zirconia ceramics pose a significant challenge regarding the achievement of a reliable and durable bond to resin-based cements. Thus far, it has been established that zirconia bond to resin-based cements can be enhanced after different surface conditioning methods, such as airborne particle abrasion with aluminum oxide particles. Meanwhile, another major issue pertaining to bonding of ceramic restorations is related to its potential contamination before cementation. Briefly, after sandblasting and clinical try-in procedures, zirconia can be contaminated with saliva and/or blood. As with many metals, zirconium shows a strong affinity towards the phosphate group found in saliva and other fluids, which reacts with the zirconia surface and makes bonding very difficult. Recently, a new cleaning agent called Ivoclean® (Ivoclar-Vivadent), which is an alkaline suspension of zirconium oxide particles, has been introduced in the market to remove contamination from zirconia {{in an effort to}} improve bonding to resin cements. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of saliva contamination and the effect of several cleaning methods, including Ivoclean on resin bond strength to zirconia. Materials and Methods: Eighty square-shaped specimens (ϕ = 12 mm x 12 mm x 3 mm) of yttria-stabilized full-contour zirconia (Diazir®, Ivoclar-Vivadent, Amherst, NY) were sectioned from zirconia blocks using a water-cooled diamond blade. Then, these specimens were embedded in acrylic resin, and their surfaces gradually finished with silicon carbide papers (600 grit to 1200 grit). The prepared zirconia surfaces were sandblasted with 50 -μm aluminum oxide particles for 15 s, under 2. 5 bars and from distance of 10 mm. After sandblasting the specimens were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath containing distilled water for 5 min and air-dried for 10 s. All samples were equally divided into 4 groups (n = 20) according to the cleaning method. Airborne particle abraded specimens without contamination was served as the control group. Remaining groups were contaminated with saliva, and subjected to different cleaning protocols, namely: Ivoclean®, 70 % isopropanol, and no treatment. Two resin cement buttons (Multilink – Ivoclar-Vivadent, Amherst, NY) were built over each zirconia surface and light-cured following the manufacturer recommendations. The influence of contamination and surface cleaning methods on <b>ceramic</b> <b>bond</b> durability were examined after 24 h on half of the samples in each group (n = 10, n = 20), and the other half (n = 10, n = 20) specimens will undergo 6000 thermocycles (TC) before shear bond testing in the universal testing machine. Conclusion of Expected Outcomes: The shear bond strength of resin cement to zirconia led to a significant improvement after cleaning with Ivoclean both immediately and after thermal aging...|$|E
40|$|Since {{previous}} investigations {{revealed that}} most clinical failures in adhesively luted ceramic restorations initiate from the cementation or internal surfaces, the study presented in Chapter II evaluated {{the effect of}} three different surface conditioning methods on the bond strength of a Bis-GMA based luting cement to glass ceramics, glass infiltrated alumina, glass infiltrated ZrO 2 reinforced alumina. The three conditioning methods assesed were: (1) HF acid etching, (2) Air-borne particle abrasion, (3) Tribochemical silica coating. All specimens were tested for shear bond strength at dry and long-term thermocycled (6000 times) conditions. It was hypothesized {{in this study that}} amphoteric alumina in the ceramic matrix could form strong enough chemical adhesion bonds, covalent bridges, through its surface hydroxyl groups with hydrolysed silanol groups of the silane: -Al-O-Si-. The results indicated that bond strengths of the Bis-GMA based composite luting cement tested on the dental ceramics after surface conditioning techniques varied in accordance with the ceramic types. HF acid gel was effective mostly on the ceramics having glassy matrix in their structures. The findings confirmed that the use of HF acid appeared to be the method of choice for bonding the Bis-GMA resin composite luting cement to those ceramics having glassy matrix in their structures. Conditioning the ceramic surfaces with air-particle abrasion followed by silanization provided higher bond strengths for high-alumina ceramics and the values increased more significantly after silica coating followed by silanization. Thermocycling decreased the bond strength values significantly after all surface conditioning methods tested and the least favourable results were obtained with ZrO 2 and glass infiltrated ZrO 2 reinforced alumina. Experimental and clinical reports provide evidence of significant differences in the survival of metal posts. The separation of core materials from titanium posts has been identified as one of the clinical problems related to post-core restorations. To withstand functional loads, the bond between the core material and the post should be strong and durable. In order to study the interaction between conditioned titanium posts and cores, in Chapter III, 6 brands of core materials with different compositions (microfilled, hybrid, compomer, resin-modified glass ionomer) were applied to titanium posts that were previously conditioned and coated with either of the two types of lightpolymerized opaquers (methacrylate, bismethacrylate). Five conditioning methods based on silica coating followed by silanization and acrylization namely, Silicoater Classical, Silicoater MD, Rocatec, Kevloc and Siloc were used. The resistance of the various core materials adapted to differently conditioned titanium posts were evaluated using a torque test that is quite an aggressive method compared to previous test methods existing in the literature. When compared with the non-conditioned control group, the results indicated that the resistance to torsional forces for the core materials on titanium posts increased with the use of chemical surface conditioning techniques and varied in accordance with the opaquer type. Type of core material also significantly influenced the resistance after long term thermocycling. Resistance against torque forces was the greatest with Siloc and then, in descending order, with Silicoater Classical, Silicoater MD, Rocatec, and Kevloc surface conditioning systems. The resistance of core materials based on silica coating and silanization or silica coating and acrylization varied in accordance with the opaquer used. Methacrylate opaquer demonstrated higher resistance values than bismethacrylate opaquer. Monomethacrylates are linear polymers with high flexibility but providing better adhesion and on the other hand, polymerization is more difficult to be obtained by light curing. However, dimethacrylates are highly cross-linked with increased brittleness. Hybrid composites and compomers used as core materials demonstrated higher torque resistance compared with microfilled composites or resin-modified glass ionomer. With the increased demand for adult orthodontics, the orthodontists are often faced with the problem of luting brackets to metal-ceramic fixed-partialdentures. Recently, more aesthetic and relatively invisible brackets, satisfying patient desires gained popularity in orthodontics. Unfortunately lack of durable bonding between the brackets and ceramic restorations is still a major problem in adult orthodontics. Bonding concepts in orthodontics are somewhat different than in the other restorative applications in operative dentistry. Since bonding in orthodontics is semi-permanent in nature, bond strength should be high enough to resist debonding during the whole course of treatment but also low enough so that damage to the existing tooth or restoration would not occur during debonding. In the study presented in Chapter IV, the effect of five different surface conditioning methods, namely (1) Phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) + primer+ bonding agent, (2) HF acid gel + primer +bonding agent, (3) chair side tribochemical silica coating (4) Air-borne particle abrasion with alumina + silane, (5) Air-borne particle abrasion with alumina + silane + bonding agent were tested for the shear bond strength of polycarbonate brackets to glazed feldspathic ceramic surfaces using light-polymerized resin-based cement. Since the orthodontic treatment duration is shorter than conventional restorative procedures, bond tests were performed after only 1000 cycles. The results indicated that bond strengths of the polycarbonate brackets luted with resin composite cement tested on the dental ceramics after surface conditioning techniques varied in accordance with the conditioning methods. Air-borne particle abrasion with aluminium trioxide or silica coating followed by silanization demonstrated the most favourable bond strengths. The satisfactory bond strengths obtained after air-particle abrasion either with silica or alumina together with silanization could eliminate the need for acid etching, primer and/or bonding agent applications. After debonding, the fracture sites of the ceramic specimens and the bracket bases were further examined under scanning electron microscopy to evaluate the changes on the surface. The failure modes were classified according to modified Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) system. While in the phosphoric acid etched group, the brackets failed mainly at the ceramic/resin interface with all of the luting cement remaining on the bracket base, in the HF acid treated group, predominantly {{less than half of the}} composite was left on the ceramic surface after debonding. In both airborne particle abraded groups, more than half of the luting cement was left adhered to the ceramic surface and the bracket base. On the contrary, in the silica coated group, luting cement was mainly debonded from the bracket base being left adhered to the ceramic surfaces with distinct impression of bracket mesh. The type of failures observed after debonding indicated that the critical parameter was the strength of the adhesive joints of the luting cement to both the bracket and the <b>ceramic.</b> <b>Bond</b> strengths of the polycarbonate brackets luted with resin composite cement tested on the dental ceramics after surface conditioning techniques varied in accordance with the conditioning methods. The use of HF acid would still be appropriate for orthodontic reasons with sufficient bond strength and favourable failure modes after debonding if the critical aspect was accepted to use this chemical agent intraorally. Adhesion of resins to processed composites has been difficult to achieve. Aggressive oral environment and enzymatic changes all provoke discoloration, degradation, microleakage, wear, ditching at the margins, delamination or simply fracture being often experienced in clinical conditions, that may require replacement of the restoration. We hypothesized that if the right conditioning method could be found then a new layer of composite could be applied to the already polymerized one in an attempt to prolong the service life of restorations suffering from small deficiencies. Therefore the objective of the study presented in Chapter V was to evaluate the effect of three surface conditioning methods 1) HF acid gel (9. 5 %) etching, (2) Air-borne particle abrasion (50 μm Al 2 O 3), (3) Silica coating (30 μm SiOx, CoJet®-Sand) on the shear bond strength of a low-viscous diacrylate veneering particulate filler resin-composite (PFC) to 5 PFC substrates. The bond strengths were evaluated at both dry and thermocycled (6. 000 cycles) conditions. Bond strengths of low-viscous diacrylate veneering resin to PFC substrates tested, increased with the use of silica coating and silanization and varied in accordance with the PFC types. HF acid gel appeared to dissolve the filler particles but resulted in the least favourable bond strengths when compared with other methods tested. Air-borne particle abrasion with silica particles increased the bond strengths regardless of the PFC type. When compared to dry testing conditions, bond strengths decreased after thermocycling in all HF acid gel treated substrates but no significant change was noted after airparticle abrasion or silica coating followed by silanization. Complete or partial cusp fracture of posterior teeth associated with amalgam restorations is a common problem in dental practice. In an attempt to find a reliable method to restore the fractured surfaces without drilling and removing the sound amalgam restorations, in the study presented in Chapter VI, the effect of different surface conditioning methods on the shear bond strength of a hybrid resin composite to fresh amalgam were evaluated. Amalgams were conditioned using one of the following conditioning methods: (1) Alloy primer + opaquer, (2) Air-borne particle abrasion (50 μm Al 2 O 3) + alloy primer + opaquer, (3) Silica coating (30 μm SiOx) + silanization + opaquer, (4) Opaquer + pre-impregnated continuous bidirectional E-glass fibre sheets, (5) Silica coating + silanization + fibre sheets, (6) Silica coating + silanization + opaquer + fibre sheet application. Non-conditioned amalgam surfaces were considered as control group (7). The mean surface roughness depth (Rz) was measured from the control group and air-abraded amalgam surfaces. All specimens were tested at dry and thermocycled (6. 000 cycles) conditions. The results revealed that combination of silica coating and silanization with addition of glass fiber sheets at the adhesive interface could be considered as an alternative method to improve adhesion of resin composite to amalgam. Bond strengths of the resin composite to amalgam substrates varied in accordance with the surface conditioning techniques. Conditioning the amalgam surface with air-borne particle abrasion prior to bonding resin composite provided higher bond strengths compared to the nonconditioned control group or alloy primer treated groups in dry conditions. The use of optional E-glass fibers was tried for the first time in this study in combination with silica coating and silanization. The addition of optional resinimpregnated bidirectional E-glass fiber sheets at the adhesive interface increased the bond strengths significantly and therefore can be considered as an alternative method to improve attachment of resin composite to amalgam. Thermocycling decreased the bond strength values significantly after all surface conditioning methods tested. In Chapter VII the methodological aspects of the experiments conducted in Chapters II-IV are evaluated and the results obtained after thermocycling in relation to the recommended ISO standard are discussed. The efficacy of various adhesion methods and some hazardous aspects related to the use of hydrofluoric acid are critically evaluated and the future research ideas that are planned on surface analysis are mentioned. Furthermore in this chapter, recent data obtained by the author after the completion of this thesis using airborne particle abrasion, silica coating together with silanization are mentioned and the ongoing research, further investigation on the working mechanisms and durability of these methods are discussed. Finally the results of this thesis were extrapolated to clinical situations. The results of this thesis seem to be more in favour of chemical conditioning methods for various substrates. Using these methods in clinical practice may prolong the service life of dental restorations in a cheaper way, avoid the total replacement of the existing restorations and preserve the tooth structure in a non-traumatic way. ...|$|E

Despite the high prevalence of fluorosis in many parts of South Africa (Louw A, Chikte U 1997), only limited information is available on the integrity of the bond between orthodontic brackets and fluorosed teeth. The objective of this study was to measure and compare Shear Bond Strengths (SBSs) of metal and ceramic orthodontic brackets on fluorosed and non-fluorosed teeth. One hundred and twenty (60 fluorosed and 60 non-fluorosed) extracted premolar teeth were divided into four groups A to D, consisting of 30 teeth in each group. BluGloo® was used as an orthodontic adhesive to bond brackets on the buccal surface of each tooth. The experimental groups consisted of Group A, in which Nu-Edge® metal brackets were used and Group B, in which InspireIce® <b>ceramic</b> brackets were <b>bonded</b> to fluorosed teeth. Group C and D consisted of Nu-Edge® metal brackets and InspireIce® <b>ceramic</b> respectively, <b>bonded</b> to non-fluorosed teeth. Bonding techniques were kept the same and standardised for all four groups. An Instron testing device was used to debond and measure the SBSs. SBSs were compared using ANOVA with posthoc analysis done using Dunnett’s C test for pairwise comparisons. Significance was set at PGroup C>Group D>Group A. <b>Ceramic</b> brackets <b>bonded</b> to fluorosed teeth had the highest SBS with a mean of 15. 78 (SD= 9. 07) Megapascals (MPa), while metal brackets bonded to fluorosed teeth produced the lowest SBS of 8. 41 (SD= 4. 68) MPa. The SBSs of <b>ceramic</b> brackets <b>bonded</b> to fluorosed teeth was significantly higher than that of SBS of metal brackets bonded to fluorosed teeth, but not significantly different from SBSs obtained from either brackets bonded to non-flurosed teeth. The BluGloo adhesive if used to <b>bond</b> <b>ceramic</b> brackets to fluorosed teeth can produce adequate SBS for clinical use. The recommendation from this study is that ceramic brackets can be used efficiently to bond to fluorosed teeth. A follow up study should be carried out to assess the nature of enamel damage caused during debonding of flourosed teeth.
