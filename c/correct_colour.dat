5|$|The {{final game}} {{was a giant}} {{modified}} roulette wheel split into 36 alternately coloured sections (18 red and 18 black), awarding a £1m prize if the player chose the <b>correct</b> <b>colour.</b> Red or Black? made its first millionaire in the first show, with bricklayer Nathan Hageman, from Reading, winning on red. The following night the second millionaire was made, with carer Kevin Cartwright also winning on red. Two further millionaires, Darren Thompson and Gary Brocklesby, were made during the series.|$|E

2500|$|The Newfoundland dog {{is a large}} working dog. They can {{be either}} black, brown, or white-and-black (called Landseer). However, in Canada, the country of their origin, the only <b>correct</b> <b>colours</b> are either black or Landseer. [...] They were {{originally}} bred and used as a working dog for fishermen in the Dominion of Newfoundland (which {{is now part of}} Canada). They are known for their giant size, intelligence, tremendous strength, calm dispositions, and loyalty. Newfoundland dogs excel at water rescue/lifesaving because of their muscular build, thick double coat, webbed feet, and innate swimming abilities.|$|R

25|$|The Irish Terrier is {{coloured}} golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten. Dark red {{is often}} mistaken {{as the only}} <b>correct</b> <b>colour,</b> possibly because wheaten coats are often of worse quality.

As an Irish Terrier grows older, grey hair may appear here and there.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the South African Reserve Bank issued 100-rand {{banknotes}} {{which were}} defective because they lacked fluorescent printing visible under UV light. In June, printing of this denomination was {{moved from the}} South African Bank Note Company to Crane Currency’s Swedish division (Tumba Bruk), which reportedly produced 80 million 100-rand notes. The South African Reserve Bank shredded 3.6 million 100-rand banknotes printed by Crane Currency because {{they had the same}} serial numbers as a batch printed by the South African Bank Note Company. In addition, the notes printed in Sweden were not the <b>correct</b> <b>colour,</b> and they were 1 mm short.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrometer}} transformed how beer was brewed. Before {{its introduction}} beers were brewed {{from a single}} malt: brown beers from brown malt, amber beers from amber malt, pale beers from pale malt. Using the hydrometer, brewers could calculate the yield from different malts. They observed that pale malt, though more expensive, yielded far more fermentable material than cheaper malts. For example, brown malt (used for Porter) gave 54 pounds of extract per quarter, whilst pale malt gave 80 pounds. Once this was known, brewers switched to using mostly pale malt for all beers supplemented with a small quantity of highly coloured malt to achieve the <b>correct</b> <b>colour</b> for darker beers.|$|E
5000|$|Miller {{claims that}} the flag of Galicia {{consisted}} of the two stripes: amaranth and white, but the official Austro-Hungarian publication Wappenrolle (1898) clearly features the flag of Galicia in red and white. In Wappenrolle there {{is a picture of}} an amaranth and white flag, used unofficially, and described as [...] "the national colours of the Poles" [...] (Nationalfarben der Polen), but under no circumstances as the flag of Galicia. It seems, therefore, that the colours featured in Wappenrolle (red and white) were the <b>correct</b> <b>colours</b> of the Galician flag from 1890 to 1918, and not those reported by Miller (amaranth and white).|$|R

40|$|<b>Correcting</b> <b>colour</b> {{imbalances}} between stereo views {{is a major}} task in {{the production}} of high quality 3 D stereoscopic content. This paper addresses extreme cases of colour imbalance where the intensity range of one view exceeds the valid range causing image burnout in the degraded view. We propose a comprehensive framework for restoring the degraded view by using the other well-exposed view to interpolate both colour and texture information. The texture copy is done in the gradient domain by solving the Poisson equation and using the disparity map to guide the interpolation. We also propose a method of detecting burnout inspired by a technique for detecting poorly exposed regions in image stills. Our results show {{that it is possible to}} get a good restoration in stereo pairs with a significant degree of image burnout. 1...|$|R
500|$|The {{boiler house}} and Number 2 Engine {{were in a}} {{particularly}} bad condition: the roof was wrecked, the metal fixtures were corroded, moss was growing on exposed surfaces and the boilers were not operational.

[...] Every moving part was cleaned by hand, and the exterior was repainted in its <b>correct</b> <b>colour</b> after the original paintwork was discovered under layers of mould and rust. [...] The eight men worked for about six months on these tasks; Number 2 Engine was successfully fired up again on 14 March 1976 after the two renovated Lancashire boilers were tested and inspected by safety officials (the other two were left in their unrestored state).|$|E
500|$|The first 48 {{members of}} the class were named after places in the West Country served by its trains or close to its lines. This {{represented}} a publicity success due to many of the locomotives being able to visit their namesake areas. Many 'West Country' locomotives sported an additional plaque with the coat of arms of the town or region the locomotive was named after. This plaque was mounted on the casing between the gunmetal locomotive nameplate and the West Country Class scroll, above the middle driving wheel. Several {{members of the}} class had only the nameplate and the [...] "West Country Class" [...] scroll, a gap being left where a crest would have been mounted. The background of the nameplate was usually painted red, though sometimes examples could be found in black if the locomotive works undertaking overhaul of the engine could not locate the <b>correct</b> <b>colour</b> paint.|$|E

40|$|Painterly {{rendering}} {{has been}} linked to computer vision, but we propose to link it to human vision because perception and painting are two processes that are interwoven. Recent progress in developing computational models allows to establish this link. We show that completely automatic rendering can be obtained by applying four image representations in the visual system: (1) colour constancy can be used to <b>correct</b> <b>colours,</b> (2) coarse background brightness in combination with colour coding in cytochrome-oxidase blobs can be used to create a background with a big brush, (3) the multi-scale line and edge representation provides a very natural way to render fi ner brush strokes, and (4) the multi-scale keypoint representation serves to create saliency maps for Focus-of-Attention, and FoA can be used to render important structures. Basic processes are described, renderings are shown, and important ideas for future research are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of iron-clad ships the magnetic deviation observed in compasses became more severe. Methods of compensation by arranging iron or magnetic objects near the binnacle were developed. In 1854, {{a new type of}} binnacle was patented by John Gray of Liverpool which directly incorporated adjustable correcting magnets on screws or rack and pinions. This was improved again when Lord Kelvin patented in the 1880s another system of compass and which incorporated two compensating magnets. These are colloquially known as [...] "Kelvin's balls" [...] in the UK, and [...] "navigator's balls" [...] in the United States. Unlike most display binnacles today, which have the balls painted red and green to represent port and starboard side of the vessel, the balls shall be painted black or have another uniform color.

50|$|Under German occupation, the Varsity was a {{forbidden}} event. However, Triton {{was allowed}} to organise the Varsity in 1941 {{as part of their}} lustrum. Later that year, after the German occupiers prohibited education of Jewish students, all student rowing clubs (and all other student clubs) closed their gates. A mock Varsity took place in a Japanese internment camp. Representatives of the student rowing clubs created a game where dice decided the outcome. With cardboard they created a 5 meter track, boats, finish tower and they even painted the boats in the <b>correct</b> <b>colours.</b> Members and supporters of the student rowing clubs created the traditional outfit and practised the anthem of the club. Representatives of each pre-war KNSRB club (Njord, Laga, Triton, Nereus, Aegir) played for the main event, while Argo, a student rowing club not yet member of the KNSRB, only could participate in the skiff, double four and in the eight.

50|$|It was {{in these}} that Netscher's genius was fully displayed. The choice of these subjects, and {{the habit of}} {{introducing}} female figures, dressed in glossy satins, were imitated from Ter Borch; they possess easy yet delicate pencilling, brilliant and <b>correct</b> <b>colouring,</b> and pleasing light and shade; but frequently their refinement passes into weakness. The painter was gaining both fame and wealth {{when he began to}} suffer from gout and took to his bed, where he continued to paint lying down and died prematurely in 1684, in The Hague. His sons Constantyn (1668-1722), and Theodorus (1661-1732), were also painters after their father's style, who Houbraken meant to include in his 4th volume of painters. He was also the father of Anthonie who emigrated to Batavia. According to the RKD, his registered pupils in the Confrerie Pictura besides his three sons were Johannes van den Brande, Otto Brandt, Olivier van Deuren, Jacob van der Does the younger, Van Hardenbroeck, Daniël Haringh, Mouritz van der Linden, J.

50|$|Wizball is a {{scrolling}} shooter {{inspired by}} Gradius {{with an additional}} collection dynamic. It is a horizontally scrolling game taking place over eight levels, which involves navigating around a landscape and shooting at sprites. However, {{the aim of the}} game is to collect droplets of coloured paint to colour the level. Each level starts off as monochromatic, drawn in three shades of grey, and needs three colours (red, blue, and green) to be collected to complete it. The player, a wizard who has taken the form of a green ball, can navigate between the levels through portals. At first the wizard only has access to the first three levels, but completing levels gains access to further levels. Each level has bouncing spheres of a different colours, and shooting them releases droplets, which may be collected. At the same time, each level needs a different colour to be added, which can be composed by collecting sufficient quantities of the <b>correct</b> <b>colours.</b> On later levels, the spheres of paint start shooting bullets, further adding to the challenge.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the summers}} from 1804, Scott made his {{home at the}} large house of Ashestiel, on the south bank of the River Tweed 6 mi north of Selkirk. When his lease on this {{property}} expired in 1811, Scott bought Cartley Hole Farm, downstream on the Tweed nearer Melrose. The farm had the nickname of [...] " [...] Hole", and when Scott built a family cottage there in 1812 he named it [...] "Abbotsford". He continued to expand the estate, and built Abbotsford House {{in a series of}} extensions.The farmhouse developed into a wonderful home that has been likened to a fairy palace. Scott was a pioneer of the Scottish Baronial style of architecture, therefore Abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling. Through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour, trophies of the chase, a library of more than 9,000 volumes, fine furniture, and still finer pictures.

40|$|Objects {{look very}} {{different}} in the underwater environment compared to their appearance in sunlight. Images with <b>correct</b> <b>colouring</b> simplify the detection of underwater objects and may allow the use of visual SLAM algorithms developed for land-based robots underwater. Hence, image processing is required. Current algorithms focus on the colour reconstruction of scenery at diving depth where different colours can still be distinguished.

First, laboratory tests are performed using a special light source imitating underwater lighting conditions. It is shown that the k-nearest neighbour method and support vector machines yield excellent results. Based on these results an experimental verification is performed under severe conditions in murky water of a diving basin. It is shown that the k-nearest neighbour method gives very good results for small distances between the object and the camera and for small water depths in the red channel. For higher distances, water depths, and for the other colour channels support vector machines are the best choice for the reconstruction of the colour as seen under white light from the underwater images...|$|R
