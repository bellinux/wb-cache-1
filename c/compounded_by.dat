5|$|Marguerite Louise's caprices lead to sour {{relations}} with the family. She argued with the Grand Duchess Vittoria over precedence, and with Grand Duke Ferdinando over her spending. Her spending habits not only spelled conflict with the Grand Duke, but made her unpopular with the Florentines. This was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> her unseemly conduct, such as the two grooms who frequented her chamber at all hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} in southern Baja California, killing two rescue works from floodwaters. Resort areas near the coast experienced minor effects, though further inland {{the damage was}} more severe. The impact of Ignacio was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> flooding from Hurricane Marty a month later, with damage from the two hurricanes totaling about $1billion (2003USD, $1.1billion 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{adequate and}} reliable on secondary services throughout their working lives, their utility <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> their light weight and steady handling. They were however disappointing on main line traffic until the draughting was improved after the war. They were fitted with steam carriage heating, and despite being primarily a freight design, they periodically deputised in this duty.|$|E

5|$|The longer 7.5cm {{guns were}} a mixed blessing. In {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy {{to such an extent}} that the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank tending to sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the introduction of the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{fell into}} a deep {{recession}} {{in the second half of}} 1998, triggered and then <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans {{did in the}} face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E

5|$|August 30, 1999– Hurricane Dennis {{parallels}} the state offshore, and {{five days later}} it executes a loop and makes landfall along Cape Lookout National Seashore as a strong tropical storm. The hurricane drops heavy rainfall peaking at 19.9inches (506mm) in Ocracoke, while its extended duration offshore causes localized severe beach erosion. The rainfall causes flooding along several rivers, which is <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the effects of Hurricane Floyd just weeks later. Damage in the state amounts to over $50million.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series of changes in {{ownership}} and management. These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was {{the manager of the}} Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy {{casualties in}} the battles. Estimates {{of the number of}} Austro-Hungarian casualties vary. Jordan states that the Austro-Hungarians suffered a total of 37,000 {{casualties in the}} battle, of whom 7,000 were fatalities. Misha Glenny states that almost 30,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were wounded and 6,000–10,000 were killed. Horne writes that the Austro-Hungarians had 8,000 soldiers killed and 30,000 wounded in the battle, <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the loss of 46 cannons, 30 machine guns and 140 ammunition wagons. Historian David Stevenson states that 4,500 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the anxiety of the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E
5|$|Despite Hong Kong's {{reputation}} of being intensely urbanised, the territory has tried to promote a green environment, and recent growing public concern has prompted the severe restriction of further land reclamation from Victoria Harbour. Awareness of the environment is growing as Hong Kong suffers from increasing pollution <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> its geography and tall buildings. Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates {{from other parts of}} the Pearl River Delta.|$|E

5|$|Elita dropped heavy {{rainfall}} {{of more than}} 200mm (8inches), which damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Madagascar. Over 50,000people were left homeless, primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara provinces. Flooding from the storm ruined more than 450km² (170sqmi) of agricultural land, including important crops for food. Across the island, the cyclone caused 33deaths, with its impact further <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> Cyclone Gafilo about two months later. Elsewhere, Elita brought rainfall and damage to Mozambique and Malawi, and its outer wind circulation produced rough seas and strong gusts in Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
40|$|The {{anaerobic}} metabolism of phthalate and other aromatic <b>compounds</b> <b>by</b> the denitrifying bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain P 136 was studied. Benzoate, cyclohex- 1 -ene-carboxylate, 2 -hydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate, and pimelate were detected as predominant metabolic intermediates during the metabolism of three isomers of phthalate, m-hydroxybenzoate, p-hydroxybenzoate, and cyclohex- 3 -ene-carboxylate. Inducible acyl-coenzyme A synthetase activities for phthalates, benzoate, cyclohex- 1 -ene-carboxylate, and cyclohex- 3 -ene-carboxylate were {{detected in the}} cells grown on aromatic compounds. Simultaneous adaptation to these aromatic compounds also occurred. A similar phenomenon was observed in the aerobic metabolism of aromatic <b>compounds</b> <b>by</b> this strain. A new pathway for the {{anaerobic metabolism}} of phthalate {{and a series of}} other aromatic <b>compounds</b> <b>by</b> this strain was proposed. Some properties of the regulation of this pathway were also discussed...|$|R
