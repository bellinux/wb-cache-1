5|$|The {{ceremony}} is often held weeks, months, or {{years after the}} death so that the deceased's family <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses. Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward Puya (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, {{the body of the}} deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the tongkonan. The soul of the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral {{ceremony is}} completed, after which it begins its journey to Puya.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E

Mercedes discovers she is {{pregnant}} with Tony's child {{and plans to}} have an abortion. Jacqui discovers the affair and asks Mercedes if she <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> child herself, as she is unable to have children. However, Mercedes has an abortion anyway. Mercedes has a brief relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) and is upset to learn that he is having an incestuous affair with his half-sister, Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan). Mercedes and Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) make a bet: Darren has {{to have sex with}} Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby), and if he does Mercedes promises to have sex with him. Darren accompanies an intoxicated Hannah home and takes a photo of her with no top on. Mercedes refuses to believe Darren, but sends the photo to Hannah's boyfriend, Danny Valentine (David Judge). Danny ends his relationship with Hannah and sleeps with Mercedes.|$|E

25|$|To provide heat more efficiently, an {{electrically}} driven {{heat pump}} <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> indoor temperature by extracting {{energy from the}} ground, the outside air, or waste streams such as exhaust air. This can cut the electricity consumption to as little as 35% of that used by resistive heating.|$|E
25|$|In this situation, {{the surge}} <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure}} of the air to a level that can cause damage. This is because if the pressure rises high enough, a compressor stall occurs—stored pressurized air decompresses backward across the impeller and out the inlet. The reverse flow back across the turbocharger makes the turbine shaft reduce in speed more quickly than it would naturally, possibly damaging the turbocharger.|$|E

25|$|Electrification cost: {{electrification}} {{requires an}} entire new infrastructure {{to be built}} around the existing tracks at a significant cost. Costs are especially high when tunnels, bridges and other obstructions have to be altered for clearance. Another aspect that <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> cost of electrification are the alterations or upgrades to railway signalling needed for new traffic characteristics, and to protect signalling circuitry and track circuits from interference by traction current. Electrification may require line closures while the new equipment is being installed.|$|E
25|$|Unglazed transpired {{collectors}} are perforated sun-facing walls {{used for}} preheating ventilation air.

The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12years) make them a more cost-effective alternative to glazed collection systems. As of 2015, over 4000 systems with a combined collector area of 500,000 m2 had been installed worldwide. Representatives include an 860 m2 collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1300 m2 collector in Coimbatore, India used for drying marigolds.|$|E
25|$|For {{an adult}} patient with {{isolated}} hematuria, tests such as ultrasound of the kidney and cystoscopy are usually done first {{to pinpoint the}} source of the bleeding. These tests would rule out kidney stones and bladder cancer, two other common urological causes of hematuria. In children and younger adults, the history and association with respiratory infection <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> suspicion of IgA nephropathy. A kidney biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen shows proliferation of the mesangium, with IgA deposits on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. However, patients with isolated microscopic hematuria (i.e. without associated proteinuria and with normal kidney function) are not usually biopsied since this is associated with an excellent prognosis. A urinalysis will show red blood cells, usually as red cell urinary casts. Proteinuria, usually less than 2grams per day, also may be present. Other renal causes of isolated hematuria include thin basement membrane disease and Alport syndrome, the latter being a hereditary disease associated with hearing impairment and eye problems.|$|E

25|$|A Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor {{consists}} of two wire cages, one inside the other, {{often referred to as}} grids, that are placed inside a vacuum chamber. The outer cage has a positive voltage versus the inner cage. Typically, deuterium gas is injected into this chamber. It is heated past its ionization temperature, making positive ions. The ions are positive and move towards the negative inner cage. Those that miss the wires of the inner cage fly {{through the center of the}} device at high speeds and can fly out the other side of the inner cage. As the ions move outward, they feel a Coulomb force that directs them back towards the center. Over time, a core of ionized gas can form inside the inner cage. Ions pass back and forth through the core until they strike either the grid or another nucleus. Most nucleus strikes do not result in fusion. Grid strikes <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> temperature of the grid as well as eroding it. These strikes conduct mass and energy away from the plasma.|$|E
25|$|Stressful working {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} three types of strains: Behavioral (e.g., absenteeism or poor performance), physical (e.g., headaches or coronary heart disease), and psychological (e.g., anxiety or depressed mood). Physical symptoms that may occur because of occupational stress include fatigue, headache, upset stomach, muscular aches and pains, weight gain or loss, chronic mild illness, and sleep disturbances. Psychological and behavioral problems that may develop include anxiety, irritability, alcohol and drug use, feeling powerless and low morale. The spectrum of effects caused by occupational stress includes absenteeism, poor decision making, lack of creativity, accidents, organizational breakdown or even sabotage. If exposure to stressors in the workplace is prolonged, then chronic health problems can occur including stroke. An examination was of physical and psychological effects of workplace stress was conducted {{with a sample of}} 552 female blue collar employees of a microelectronics facility. It was found that job-related conflicts were associated with depressive symptoms, severe headaches, fatigue, rashes, and other multiple symptoms. Studies among the Japanese population specifically showed a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of total stroke among men with job strain (combination of high job demand and low job control). Those in blue-collar or manual labor jobs are more likely to develop heart disease compared to those in white-collar jobs. Along with the risk of stroke, stress <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> risk of high blood pressure, immune system dysfunction, coronary artery disease. Prolonged occupational stress can lead to occupational burnout. Occupational stress can also disrupt relationships.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Harmonix {{launched}} a crowd funding campaign through the Fig platform to produce Rock Band 4 for personal computers, {{to have been}} released {{in the last quarter}} of 2016. Harmonix estimated the game would cost $2 million to make, of which they would contribute $500,000 towards if they <b>can</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> remaining $1.5 million. The port would have been primarily handled by Sumo Digital, integrating the updates that Harmonix will continue to provide in the main game. The game would have been released via Steam, allowing users to use the Steam Workshop to create their own songs and distribute it to others, with curation by Harmonix to avoid copyright infringements, in a manner comparable to the Rock Band Network but at a lower cost; they have already ported the previous Rock Band Network tools to offer to backers of the campaign. Harmonix planned to allow compatibility with all existing instrument controllers from the various PlayStation 2, 3 and 4, and Xbox 360 and One platforms, and had begun working through details with Sony and Microsoft. The game would have shipped with the same 65 songs as the console version, and at least 1700 songs for downloadable content (all those currently available for Rock Band 4 on consoles), though, as with the console versions, users would have had to repurchase these songs on the PC and cannot transfer over songs they already own on either platform. The funding campaign failed to reach its goal, only obtaining about $793,000 of the $1.5M target; Harmonix has not ruled out approaching a personal computer version in the future as they are aware there is some demand for Rock Band there.|$|E
