The paper rejected her ad because no one <b>could</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to classify it, but forwarded her inquiry to Hermann Helms, the [...] "Dean of American Chess", who told her that Master Max Pavey, former Scottish champion, would be giving a simultaneous exhibition on January 17, 1951.

500|$|Two musical {{themes in}} Wicked run {{throughout}} the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works, the first– Elphaba's theme– came from The Survival of St. Joan, {{on which he}} worked as musical director. [...] "I always liked this tune a lot and I never <b>could</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> {{what to do with}} it," [...] he remarked in an interview in 2004. The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's brass section, with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, [...] "like a giant shadow terrorizing you". When played by the piano with some electric bass in [...] "As Long As You're Mine", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered bridge, the theme forms the core of the song [...] "No One Mourns the Wicked" [...] and its reprises.|$|E
500|$|With the US {{entry into}} World WarII in 1941, copper and tin, which were both {{used in the}} cent, were in short supply. [...] Experiments were carried out by several {{corporations}} under contract from the Mint; they tested various metallic and non-metallic substances, including fiber, tempered glass, and several types of plastic. [...] These experiments used various designs, since actual Lincoln cent dies could not leave government custody. [...] As the experiments proceeded, production of bronze cents was cut back drastically in , and ceased in December. [...] On , 1942, Congress gave the mint authorization to change {{the composition of the}} cent for a three-year period, and five days later, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau announced that the coin would be made out of zinc-coated steel. [...] Zinc and iron form an electromagnetic [...] "couple"; the two metals soon corrode when in contact with each other in a damp atmosphere. The public soon complained that the new coins were becoming spotted and stained. [...] Another common complaint was confusion with the dime, and some letters suggested that a hole be punched {{in the center of the}} new coins. Morgenthau responded that the new pieces would soon become darker, and that the Mint would be willing to darken them if it <b>could</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> a suitable process.|$|E

2500|$|Both Mexican and U.S. {{authorities}} {{suspected that}} Kilroy's disappearance {{was some sort}} of foul play. They speculated that Kilroy could have been a victim of drug-related violence or of robbery-killing, but they were short on leads to make any firm conclusions. When Kilroy's friends reported the disappearance, Customs agents went with them to Matamoros to help retrace their steps. Texan officials contacted the U.S. consulate in Matamoros and asked investigators to carry out a search with Kilroy's description in Matamoros jails and hospitals. Investigators then hired a hypnotist to see if he <b>could</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> some clues. Under hypnosis, Bradley stated that he saw a young Hispanic man wearing a blue plaid shirt and with a visible scar across his face talking to Kilroy before he disappeared. He recalled that the man walked up to Kilroy and told him, [...] "Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?" [...] though Bill said he was not sure if Kilroy responded back. However, none of the friends were able to precisely recall the exact moment or place where Kilroy disappeared. Investigators deduced by this story that Kilroy was kidnapped for robbery or ransom. The first option seemed the most likely because his abductors had not called for a payment. They believed that Kilroy's body was probably dumped in a remote location. Helicopters and terrain vehicles of the United States Border Patrol were called to look on the Rio Grande River, but his body was not found.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{admitted}} that the South Sea Islander {{in a state of}} nature is overmuch addicted to the practice of eating human flesh; but concerning that I submit: first, that he likes it; second, that those who supply it are mostly dead. It is upon his enemies that he feeds, and these he would kill anyhow, as we do ours. In civilized, enlightened and Christian countries, where cannibalism has not yet established itself, wars are as frequent and destructive as among the maneaters. The untitled savage knows at least why he goes killing, whereas the private soldier is commonly in black ignorance of the apparent cause of quarrel--of the actual cause, always. Their shares in the fruits of victory are about equal: the Chief takes all the dead, the General all the glory. Moreover it costs more human life to supply a Christian gentleman with food than it does a cannibal--with food alone: [...] "board;" [...] if you <b>could</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the number of lives that his lodging, clothing, amusements and accomplishment cost the sum would startle. Happily he does not pay it. Considering human lives as having value, cannibalism is undoubtedly the more economical system.|$|E
