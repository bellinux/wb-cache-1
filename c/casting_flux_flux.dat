5000|$|A [...] "permanent-magnet {{synchronous}} motor" [...] (PMSM) or [...] "permanent-magnet motor" [...] (PMM) is a {{synchronous motor}} that uses permanent magnets rather than windings in the rotor. Electronic excitation control with integrated power inverter and rectifier, sensor, and inverter electronics {{is required for}} practical operation. Form-factors for the PMSMs are either axial <b>flux,</b> radial <b>flux,</b> transverse <b>flux,</b> or <b>flux</b> switching depending on the arrangement of components, with each topology having different tradeoffs among efficiency, size, weight, and operating speed. Also in the axial <b>flux</b> or radial <b>flux</b> form-factor, other brushless motors are the brushless wound-rotor doubly-fed synchronous motor system and the magnetic reluctance, which require electronic excitation control for practical operation, and the asynchronous induction motors, which is with or without electronic excitation control depending on the application. Conventional methods of electronic AC excitation control of electric motors, such as volt/frequency control, were available prior to the 1950s with at least mercury vapor thyratrons switching devices and modern age state of art control (or Field Oriented Control) became available in the late 1960s. Permanent magnet motors have been in existence since the introduction of electric motors more than one-hundred years ago.|$|R

The SolarMonitor Active Region Tracking (SMART) algorithm relies on consecutive image differencing to remove both quiet-Sun and transient magnetic features, and region-growing techniques to group <b>flux</b> concentrations into classifiable features.

A persistence algorithm is used to associate developed active regions with emerging <b>flux</b> regions in previous measurements, and to track regions beyond the limb through multiple solar rotations. We find that the total number and area of magnetic regions on disk vary with the sunspot cycle. While sunspot numbers are a proxy to the solar magnetic field, SMART offers a direct diagnostic of the surface magnetic field and its variation over timescale of hours to years.

40|$|Radiative heat {{transfer}} in three-dimensional inhomogeneous, nongray and anisotropically scattering participating media was investigated by using REM 2 method. The {{accuracy of the}} method was verified by benchmark comparisons against the solutions of Monte Carlo and YIX methods {{in the case of}} three-dimensional inhomogeneous media {{and in the case of}} three-dimensional media composed of nongray CO 2 gas and carbon particles with strong anisotropically scattering.

40|$|Traditional {{modeling}} of radiative transfer in reacting flows has ignored turbulence-radiation interactions (TRI). Radiative <b>fluxes,</b> <b>flux</b> divergences and radiative properties {{have been based}} on mean temperature and concentration fields. However, both experimental and theoretical work have suggested that mean ra-diative quantities may differ significantly from those predictions based on the mean parameters because of their strongly non-linear dependence on the temperature and concentration fields. The composition PDF method is able to consider many nonlin-ear interactions rigorously, and the method is used here to study turbulence-radiation interactions.
