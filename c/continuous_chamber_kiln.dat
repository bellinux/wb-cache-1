50|$|In 1820 Richard Greaves {{started a}} lime kiln using Blue Lias from a quarry {{just north of}} the village. Completion of the railway in 1852 made it easier for the works to obtain coal and {{distribute}} its lime and cement. The business became Greaves, Bull and Lakin and in 1855 opened a new cement works. By 1882 it had four bottle kilns and was making 120 tons of Portland cement a week. The Great Western revised the railway junction to the works in 1883 and had a signal box built for it in 1899. By 1907 there were 18 <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> making 600 tons a week, and more railway track was laid including a second connection to the works.

50|$|In 1866 Earle's Cement {{acquired}} the cement {{works on the}} near the river bank and land south of the Victoria Dock Branch Line; the works was connected by rail sidings to the dock branch. Production was around 3000t pa of Roman cement in 1870. From 1875 bottle kilns were constructed {{for the production of}} Portland cement, with a capacity of 38t per week by around 1882. From 1888 <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> were installed, with 28 in total by 1898 with a total capacity of 980t per week. The first two Rotary kilns were installed in 1906, adding a capacity of 860t per week. Further rotary kilns were added in 1912 and 1920, by which time the location of the plant was seen a non-optimal, Earle's large plant in Hope, Derbyshire being preferred.|$|R
5000|$|The kilns were {{normally}} made of brick, and are {{one type}} of [...] "cross-draught" [...] kilns, where the flames travel more or less horizontally, rather than up from or down to the floor. The firing time could be relatively short, meaning about 24 hours for a small kiln. Early kilns were rising tunnels, not divided into chambers, but with a step at intervals giving relatively flat floor levels, and perhaps using gravel or similar material {{on the floor to}} allow vertical stacks to be rested. From the Southern Song period (1127-1279), some kilns were built as a series of chambers, stepped as they ran up the slope, and with connecting doors to allow access to both the kiln-workers during loading and unloading, and the heat during firing. There might be up to 12 <b>chambers.</b> <b>Chambered</b> <b>kilns</b> were usual for making Longquan celadon.|$|R
40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} how a separate conditioning chamber can make progressive kilns more efficient. The 2 - zone progressive kilns have a decreasing {{wet bulb depression}} in the second zone, which leads to low moisture spread even without conditioning chamber. With a separate conditioning chamber the capacity can, however, be increased by shortening the drying time. This is possible since the conditioning phase {{can be adapted to}} get a good drying quality without tensions in the cross section of the board. If needed the conditioning chamber can also be used as to extend the drying time which is useful especially when the board dimensions in the kiln is changed. The conditioning face also reduces the moisture spread with 50 % compared to batches from <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> with target moisture content is around 18 %. When the drying is performed in a level of wet bulb temperatures over 60 °C there is less problems with cracks on thicker boards because of the plastic behavior on the wood surface. Progressive kilns with conditioning face can therefore produce greater volumes then from separate <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> with equal quality concerning slicing test gap and even moisture spread. The technical performance of the conditioning chamber was very god on the pilot <b>kiln.</b> The conditioning <b>chamber</b> opens one door on each side when the loading starts, which influence the climate. It was, however, not any problem to get a stable climate after loading/unloading a tray in the conditioning chamber throughout the experiments, but the spray line must be in perfect condition to reach the wet bulb temperature fast enough. Finally the control system to support the kiln operator in his daily work must be developed with more functions when adding a conditioning chamber to the progressive kiln. This system should give some guidance of how to adjust the climate in the conditioning chamber when changing board-dimensions to be able to achieve a good accuracy around the target moisture...|$|R
50|$|In the 1890s George Henry Skelsey used {{funds from}} a public listing of his company to build a cement plant, Port Adamant Works, at Barton, west of the Haven, {{replacing}} a site he had acquired in 1885 at Morley Street, Stoneferry, Hull in the 1880s. Clay and chalk for the process were sourced on site, with chalk brought from the New Cliff chalk quarry, by a short narrow gauge rail line. Initially the plant had a capacity of around 330t per week, using <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns,</b> supplemented by shaft kilns in around 1901 increasing weekly capacity by around 320 t. In 1911 the company became part of British Portland Cement Manufacturers, and a rotary kiln was installed in 1912 replacing the earlier kilns. The plant closed in 1927 after the acquisition and establishment by {{the parent company of}} the large Humber Cement Works and Hope Cement Works.|$|R
50|$|The kilns allowed large {{quantities}} of pottery to be fired at high temperatures, but the firing was not usually even across {{the length of the}} kiln, which often produced different effects on pieces at different levels. Very often the higher chambers produced the better pieces, as they heated up more slowly. As one example, the wide range of colours seen in Chinese celadon wares such as Yue ware and Longquan celadon is largely explained by variations in firing conditions. Variations in the shades of white porcelains between and within the northern Ding ware and the southern Qingbai were also the result of the fuel used. Some of the most advanced <b>chambered</b> <b>kilns</b> were built to fire Dehua porcelain, where precise control of high temperatures was essential. The dragon kiln form was copied in Korea, from sometime between 100 and 300 CE, and much later in Japan in various types of climbing anagama kilns, and elsewhere in East Asia.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{approximately}} 1972 {{nearly all the}} products of Dan Kwian kilns were functional vessels. Common forms were water storage jars of around 50 liters capacity, lidded jars for preparing fermented fish, mortars, and basins. There {{is no evidence of}} tableware production at Dan Kwian. Most of the pottery is fired in above-ground anagama-style wood kilns, although at least one noborigama <b>chamber</b> <b>kiln,</b> many gas kilns, and at least one electric kiln have been used in recent years. Ceramic ware in Dan Kwian was traditionally fired in two distinct styles, Phao Dam (Thai:เผาดำ), or [...] "fired black," [...] and Phao Deng (Thai:เผาแดง), [...] "fired red." [...] Phao Dam ware was fired to temperatures between approximately [...] and [...] The ware at this temperature became dark brown and vitreous.

40|$|The {{enhanced}} {{need for}} food items is receiving more importance {{due to a}} gradual increase in the world population and, in this scenario, fertilizers play {{a very important role}} in agriculture. In this study, the production of the normal superphosphate was investigated with a <b>continuous</b> <b>chamber</b> method by adding potassium chloride to a mixture of Hibin apatite and Kingisepp phosphorite. In the experiments, the following parameters were selected: The concentration of sulfuric acid (54 – 66 % (w/w)), the stoichiometric norm of sulfuric acid (100, 107, 110, 114 % (w/w)), the ratio of apatite/phosphorite in the mixture of phosphate (95 / 5, 90 / 10, 85 / 15, 80 / 20, 75 / 25, 70 / 30, 65 / 35, 60 / 40, 55 / 45, 50 / 50 (w/w)), potassium chloride/the mixture of phosphate (1 / 50, 2 / 50, 3 / 50, 4 / 50, 5 / 50 (w/w)), and the reaction time (2 – 8 min). It was observed that by adding potassium chloride to a low-grade phosphorite and using it to substitute a fraction of high-grade apatite in the normal superphosphate production not only resulted in a high-quality product but also eliminated the waiting period for the maturation of superphosphate in the storage.

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze endovascular laser-assisted resection of human aortic valves in situ in 10 human cadavers. Material and MethodsAfter anterolateral minithoracotomy, the aortic valve isolation chamber system was inserted into the descending aorta and pushed forward transluminally into the aortic position to generate a separate operation space between the subvalvular and the proximal ascending aortic area. After deployment and sealing of the chamber, stable function with a <b>continuous</b> <b>chamber</b> lavage of 1. 58 L/min saline solution was established (8 / 10 cases). The endoscopically guided laser fiber was delivered via the right carotid artery. After fixation of a leaflet by a forceps catheter, the native leaflets were resected each by a thulium:YAG laser with 20 -W power rating. Macropathology and micropathology of surrounding anatomic structures were analyzed. ResultsThe duration of transluminal positioning and deployment of the aortic valve isolation chamber took 7. 3 ± 5. 8 minutes. Fluoroscopy confirmed sealed chambers. The resection was completed in all leaflets and took, on average, 6. 0 ± 3. 5 minutes per leaflet. The aortic wall was moderately injured in 4 of 10 cases and the aortic annulus in two cases with one aortic wall perforation. The surrounding tissue, the coronary ostia, the mitral valve, and the left ventricular outflow tract remained unaffected.
