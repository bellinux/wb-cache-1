People who are interested in <b>counselling</b> <b>organisations</b> towards a fair corporate culture can learn some basic principles of what should be observed as a method of intervention. The same applies to people who are interested in coaching people in need (suffering under unfair conditions or treatment). If a person has reached a certain standard of instructions, this is then expressed in a certificate. The first certificates of this kind were awarded in 2003. The fairness coaches or trainers are now the means of how the Fairness Foundation can become active in granting support to people suffering under unfair conditions. [...] The Fairness Foundation is a non-commercial limited company (a [...] ) which already implies some degree of public recognition.

30|$|Marketing campaigns Marketing campaigns {{about the}} {{availability}} of gambling counselling are based on culturally appropriate designs and ease of access to all community members. Some {{of the media and}} marketing activities that were developed by the service in partnership with the funding body and a larger multicultural gambling <b>counselling</b> <b>organisation</b> were the production of video/DVD/TVC short documentaries about problem gambling {{and its impact on the}} Arabic gamblers and their families and community (Gamblers Help/NSW. 2012 a, b). The production featured interviews with a prominent and respected Arabic medical General Practitioner (GP) in South West Sydney and an Arabic counsellor providing their thoughts about gambling and its multiple forms and preferences within the Arabic culture. The GP and counsellor provided their guidance to the audience about the consequences of problem gambling and enforced and normalised the behaviour of help-seeking and its benefits to the person affected and their families. Arabic speaking GPs and counsellors who deliver educational messages on social issues to community members often succeed in their mission to influence positive social change. For example, a self-identified problem gambler in Canberra quoted that “Our family doctor, who has treated our family for 25  years, has been of assistance in dealing with these problems” referring to his gambling problems, alcohol abuse and stress (McMillen et al. 2004).|$|E

A quantitative methodology was utilised with questionnaires completed online. Participants were surveyed in relation to the constructs of secondary traumatic stress, burnout, compassion satisfaction, resilience, social support, degree of exposure to trauma and personal history of trauma. The majority of the participants reported age greater than 50 years (n= 84), female gender (n= 109) and identified as being of New Zealand European/ Pakeha descent (n= 105). Statistical analyses were completed to establish the prevalence of secondary traumatic stress, burnout and compassion satisfaction, the relationship between exposure and risk of secondary traumatic stress, the relationship between personal trauma history and risk of secondary traumatic stress and the relationships between burnout, compassion satisfaction, resilience and social support levels with secondary traumatic stress. In addition, the moderating effect of compassion satisfaction was analysed. Results established a prevalence of 21. 7 % for high risk of secondary traumatic stress, 24. 8 % for high risk of burnout and 21. 7 % for high potential for compassion satisfaction in this sample. Results established statistically significant relationships between exposure and secondary traumatic stress, between burnout and secondary traumatic stress and between resilience and secondary traumatic stress. These results are discussed in relation to the secondary exposure to trauma of counsellors working with trauma clients.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{dynamics}} of the triadic therapeutic relationship between interpreters, counsellors and non-English speaking clients in a triangular research design. It comprises three parts: In part one, two focus groups were held with a group of interpreters and of counsellors to explore common issues and general concerns that were pertinent to the relevant fields. In part two, twenty-nine semi-structured individual interviews were carried out with another group of interpreters and counsellors with the aim of exploring the issues that arose in the focus groups. In part three, a group of clients were interviewed to explore their experiences of receiving emotional help through interpreters. Participants were recruited through interpreting agencies and <b>counselling</b> <b>organisations.</b> The data was analysed, using Thematic Analysis. The overarching themes show that all the participants wanted to trust each other and expected to be trusted by the others. Confidentiality came out as a common concern across the data sets. Translation and language issues, cultural matters and organisational restraints were found to be barriers to establishing a working alliance. All participants expected practitioners, including language interpreters, to have relevant knowledge, awareness of their own strength and weaknesses, to be critical and flexible, and to demonstrate certain personal qualities. Overall, the participants were apprehensive about the triadic therapeutic process which they found to be emotional and full of surprises. They also found the process helpful and rewarding. The findings of this triangulated research suggest that mental health interventions and relevant educational programmes for counsellors and interpreters should address the complex needs of a multicultural client group and include an understanding of three-dimensional relationships...|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} changes which neoliberal ideologies {{have triggered}} in counselling. Meeting {{the demands of}} liberalism in counselling is a challenge both to organisation and to people. As far as people are concerned, the argument is driven by such questions as: What is the human being of this system (homo consultans) like? What is his world? How does he relate to this world? The questions about <b>counselling</b> as <b>organisation</b> pertain to its objectives and goals. In the industrial era, counselling goals were of paternalistic nature, but in economy-dominated neoliberalism they are certainly different. At a time of neoliberalism, the counsellor faces the following dilemmas: How to gain the client? How to satisfy the client? How to reconcile ethical demands inscribed in the counselling mission with the economic preoccupations of neo-positivist ideologies? In response, three kinds of counselling emerge. Rehabilitative counselling is organised for people severely damaged by adversity. Existential counselling is organised for people whose biographical trajectory is disturbed by temporary problems. Career counselling is organised for people who chose their life-paths in the neoliberal realities. 3871825 Studia Edukacyjn...|$|R

40|$|Magister Artium (Child and Family Studies) - MA(CFS) Childhood {{sexual abuse}} transcends {{boundaries}} of social class, race, age and gender. Research suggests that its effects are so profoundly debilitating {{that even in}} adulthood, victims struggle {{with a range of}} emotional, psychological and behavioural challenges. Nationally, South Africa has experienced a high prevalence of childhood sexual abuse, with a noticeable reporting of sexual abuse amongst children whose mothers survived childhood sexual abuse. The current study was aimed at exploring and describing the experiences of maternal survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) whose children also disclosed childhood sexual abuse. It furthermore explored the maternal intergenerational transference of sexual abuse and its influence on parenting, as well as exploring how the experience of childhood sexual abuse influences maternal parental practice and confirms or negates whether sexual abuse is generational. A qualitative research design was used to explore the experiences and perceptions of seven mothers who experienced sexual abuse as children, whose children also disclosed sexual abuse. The sample was purposefully drawn and the interviews were conducted at the premises of two <b>counselling</b> <b>organisations,</b> where they (mothers/children) were receiving counselling. The researcher made use of in-depth interviewing with maternal survivors of childhood sexual abuse whose children also disclosed childhood sexual abuse. The data was collected using an interview schedule with open-ended questions, which facilitated the interview process. Interviews that were conducted with the maternal survivors of childhood sexual abuse were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data from the study was analysed using thematic analysis, with all data managed manually. Ethical considerations were deliberated to participants who provided signed, informed consent for participation in the study. The findings were revealed in four themes. Theme one describes the experience of loss {{as a result of the}} CSA, which included loss of childhood, loss of relationships with family and friends, and loss of parental attachment. Theme two describes the interpersonal and psychological challenges resulting from CSA. A range of psychological and interpersonal sequelae resulting from the CSA experience poses many challenges for the maternal survivor of CSA. These include post-traumatic stress, cognitive distortions, emotional distress, avoidance, and interpersonal difficulties. Theme three describes the barriers affecting the maternal survivor's sense of Self, which includes negative body image and negative self-image. Maternal survivors of CSA struggle with issues pertaining to negative body image, which is as a result of the CSA experience. Issues pertaining to negative self-image were also captured. Theme four describes the parental practice of the maternal survivor and coping capacity, which includes challenges affecting the parental role, the maternal survivor's reaction to her children’s disclosure, as well as the coping strategies adopted to cope and move on. The results of the study show that maternal survivors of CSA experienced a shared feeling of loss, both on a personal level and a relational level. The findings furthermore indicate that the interpersonal and psychological challenges experienced by the maternal survivor are a direct consequence of the CSA and adversely affect the parental role of the maternal survivor. The findings indicate that in cases of intra-familial CSA, the chances are increased for CSA to re-occur in subsequent generations when contact with the mother's perpetrator is maintained. The findings indicate that when CSA occurs in a subsequent generation, regardless of whether intra-familial or extra-familial, maternal survivors are supportive towards their children’s disclosures, as they are confronted with their own CSA experience...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent debate {{suggests}} Huntington’s disease (HD) may be {{more prevalent}} than previously reported. In addition, relatively {{little is known about}} current disease management. This study aims to provide epidemiological data and describe the pharmacological management of HD in the United Kingdom. Methods: A primary care research database was accessed to identify incident and prevalent HD cases between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2008. Patients with Read codes denoting a definite diagnosis or possible diagnosis, and undiagnosed patients with a positive family history were identified. A subset of patients with a definite diagnosis and prescribed medication indicating symptom onset was also identified. Epidemiological data were estimated. Pharmacological prescriptions to HD patients from 2004 to 2008 were identified, and prescription frequencies were grouped according to the British National Formulary categories. Results: HD incidence estimates ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 78 per 100, 000 person-years, and HD prevalence ranged from 5. 96 to 6. 54 per 100, 000 of the population. Forty-four percent of pharmacological prescriptions targeted the central nervous system. Nearly half of the HD patients were prescribed antidepressants, and over 40 % were prescribed analgesics. Conclusions: Although prevalence estimates fell short of figures suggested in recent debate, it is feasible that the true prevalence may be much higher than previously reported. Pharmacological management appears to rely heavily on central nervous system drugs and nutrition support. Many of these drugs are prescribed to HD patients for reasons other than the medication’s primary use. Further work is required to evaluate the impact of alternative management strategies, such as therapist intervention, <b>counselling,</b> and <b>organisation</b> support, on the patients’ quality of life...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{publication}} of the memorandum of understanding on gay to straight conversion therapy brought many key psychology, health, <b>counselling,</b> and psychotherapy <b>organisations</b> {{together for the first}} time to collaborate on a subject on which they had no disagreement. The memorandum clearly states that efforts to try to change sexual orientation through psychological therapies are unethical and potentially harmful. Clearly, therapy has come a long way since the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM, 1973) and the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD, 1992). What the document left out was conversion therapy as it applies to gender and sexual diversity (GSD) identities and practices beyond gay identities and same sex attractions. For example, in relation to transgender, some therapists still deem it acceptable to try to eliminate behaviour in children that doesn’t conform to cultural gender norms or private ‘cross-dressing’ practices by husbands in a heterosexual marriage. In the case of bisexuality, some still encourage clients to ‘pick’ homosexuality or heterosexuality, rather than respecting the person holding a bisexual identity. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{develop a}} patient {{satisfaction}} system for disablement services centres and {{to report on}} how the initial findings {{have been used in}} audit to improve their quality of care and services. DESIGN [...] Interview survey of randomly selected users attending in three centres: Birmingham (centre X), Oxford (centre Y), and Cambridge (centre Z) to establish core topics for developing a patient satisfaction questionnaire with incorporation into a computer patient satisfaction system (PATSAT) to enable collation of responses to the questionnaire. A pilot of the questionnaire was undertaken in the centres to assess the sensitivity of the questionnaire, which was subsequently used as part of clinical audit process during June 1991 and April 1992 in centre X and the patient satisfaction system used to monitor changes in routine practice. PATIENTS [...] 123 amputees in the development phase, selected by cluster sampling, and 1103 amputees in the pilot study. MAIN MEASURES [...] Satisfaction scores for components of the service. RESULTS [...] The questionnaire included 16 core topics contributing to quality of care and services, including comfort of limbs, appointments, interpersonal aspects of care, a system of support and <b>counselling,</b> and <b>organisation.</b> The pilot survey demonstrated high satisfaction scores for aspects of interpersonal care, organisation, and physical surroundings of the centres and lower satisfaction for counselling services, comfort of the limb and the number of alterations made before the limb was considered acceptable. During the audit in centre X these results prompted changes to care and services which produced significant improvements in satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS [...] The early results suggest that the questionnaire, coupled with PATSAT software system, enable users' views to be expressed, collated, and fed back to staff; the information provided has already prompted change, and the system is sufficiently sensitive to measure changes in satisfaction with the service...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{describes}} the organisation {{inherent in the}} initiation and development of a counselling service in the Church of England Diocese of Gloucester. The aim was to provide counselling for clergy and their families {{which was based on}} professional standards of counselling psychology for both the client and the organisation of the diocese. The history of the situation in the diocese and the author's prior involvement which had led to this initiative are recorded in the background to this study in Appendix 1. This describes how the need for an organised professional counselling service had become increasingly evident as a result of-, [i] a vacuum left by the breakdown of the previous network of professionally unqualified helpers [ii] the growing incidence of clergy client work [iii] the bishop's need for clergy psychological assessment to assist in his decision making [iv] the lessons learned from the experience of the Diocese of Sheffield. [v] the need for competent practice by professionally qualified and supervised counsellors. The author became increasingly aware that such a counselling service needed to be formally and clearly structured, easily accessible, and reflect both high standards of counselling from the profession of counselling psychology for the client and also the theory and research which was currently emerging about <b>counselling</b> in <b>organisations.</b> The clergy <b>counselling</b> service aimed to be tailor-made to suit the size, culture, ministry, location and workforce of the diocese.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{application}} of ICT to enhance the peer consulting activities of groups of professionals. In this study, peer consulting is defined as the sharing of people's experience through action and reflection in the context of actual practice (Eisen, 2001). The research is undertaken within two New Zealand <b>counselling</b> services <b>organisations,</b> one for-profit and one not-for-profit. The primary guiding research question is: "How do NZ social services organisations apply online technologies to enhance the professional development of their staff?" The study is qualitative in nature, and follows the action research methodology. Within one in-depth action research cycle, key participants of each organisation and the researcher collaborate to describe the problem situation, and select and set up pilot online systems. Groups of counselling practitioners then participate in actual online peer consulting sessions, after which the outcomes of the sessions are evaluated and learnings gained. Data gathered through interviews, observations and systems statistics are analysed to derive the first of two major theoretical contributions of this research, the Model of Peer Consulting Transition. This model reflects the experiences of the research participants as they move through the developmental stages of Defining, Structuring, Experimenting, Engaging and Embedding. The second theoretical contribution of this study is the novel application of the Technology-in-Practice framework developed by Orlikowski (2000). This framework is the lens through which the environmental factors that exist within each organisational situation and influence peer consulting transition are explained. The theoretical models developed in this study provide an important contribution to the use of ICT in facilitating professional development. In addition, the participant organisations benefitted directly from being part of the study. The development of an alternative way to engage staff in professional development activities saves time and financial resources, and engaging in actual peer consulting sessions offered participants the opportunity to further develop their respective professional capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Background: Representatives of <b>counselling</b> and person-centred <b>organisations</b> {{indicate}} many {{of their}} members feel their profession and orientation is under threat, with counselling services being decommissioned in NHS settings. Aims:To understand the views of key figures in the psychological therapies field (policy makers, researchers {{and representatives of the}} counselling community) towards randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and their present and future role in developing the evidence-base for counselling and psychotherapy. Method: Interviews (phone, Skype or face-to-face) were conducted with 24 authorities in the field. Relevant practitioner and academic networks were also contacted and key documents in the field were reviewed. Results: Key figures believe that RCTs will continue to play a decisive role in determining which psychological interventions are recommended and commissioned within the NHS for the foreseeable future. Other methods are seen as having some validity, but are generally considered supplementary to RCTs and not a replacement for them. Discussion: Although many members of the counselling community are critical of RCTs, they are likely to remain the mainstay of commissioning policy for some years to come. This means, in the coming years, members of the counselling community may face difficult choices in how to promote their work, while maintaining their core principles and values...|$|R

This paper looks at the major causes that lead to children leaving their homes for the streets. A representative sample was drawn which comprised of 40 street kids who were receiving some assistance from four non-governmental organizations and 8 officials from the organizations. A qualitative descriptive survey was used to guide the methodology. Data was collected using questionnaires and structured interviews for officials and the street kids respectively. Qualitative data with descriptive statistics was used in the presentation and analysis of data. The results showed that children were forced into the streets by factors that included social factors connected with the breakdown of the family structure, economic factors that included poverty and unemployment. The study recommended that non-governmental organizations must get to the root cause of the problem instead of just treating the symptoms of the problem as what is currently happening. It was also recommended that there was need for the organizations to involve the street children in finding solutions to their problems.

Eight of 14 women's organisations joining the Women Against Tobacco Taskforce agreed to participate. All staff, volunteers, {{and members of the}} eight organisations were invited to complete a self-administered anonymous questionnaire during July and August 2006. A total of 623 out of 771 (80. 8 %) affiliates responded. Their knowledge on smoking and health (mean= 3. 91, SD= 1. 44 on a range of 0 - 7), smoking related diseases (mean= 2. 91, SD= 0. 97 on a range of 0 - 4), and women-specific diseases (mean= 2. 93, SD= 1. 87 on a range of 0 - 6), was considered to be inadequate. They had positive attitudes towards tobacco control (mean= 3. 31, SD= 0. 55) and their own role in smoking cessation counselling (mean= 3. 19, SD= 0. 56) on a 4 -point Likert scale and 39. 3 % reported had attempted to offer quitting advice. Logistic regression analysis found that participants having direct contact with smokers who had a positive attitude towards their own role in smoking cessation counselling (OR= 2. 57; 95 % CI= 1. 67 - 3. 95) and better knowledge of smoking and smoking-related diseases (OR= 1. 35; 95 % CI= 1. 06 - 1. 71) were more likely to provide cessation counselling after controlling for gender; knowledge on smoking and health, and women-specific diseases; attitude towards tobacco control, negative and positive attitudes towards female smokers, and perceived self-efficacy in smoking cessation <b>counselling.</b> Women's <b>organisations</b> showed limited support towards tobacco control and their affiliates had a limited knowledge on smoking and health but had positive attitudes.

40|$|Abstract- This {{study is}} part of a broad {{research}} that sought to establish the counseling needs of adolescent street kids and in Harare Central Business District. This paper looks at the effectiveness of support services available for the street adolescent in Harare. The representative sample drawn comprised of 40 street kids who were receiving some assistance from four non-governmental organizations and 8 officials from the organizations. A qualitative descriptive survey was used to guide the methodology. Data was collected using questionnaires and structured interviews for officials and the street kids respectively. Qualitative data analysis with descriptive statistics was used in the presentation and analysis of data. The study found out that those organizations that offered support services concentrated on providing food, recreation, education and blankets. The personnel who were involved in counseling the street did not possess the relevant counseling qualifications. The study concluded that the support services were not effective in the long run as the organisations focussed on the symptoms of the problem. There is need for the organisations that deal with street kids to give more emphasis on empowering the children to take charge of their lives instead of making them depend on handouts. In addition the organizations need to be advised to take in employment people who have some counseling qualification to work with these children or encourage the present ones to acquire counseling qualifications.

40|$|Increasingly, {{contemporary}} pedagogical {{approaches are}} based on teamwork. We speak of teamwork when a group is focused on a particular aim {{and the members of}} the group work together with a purpose of achieving the aim. In pedagogy, this means that at least two pedagogical workers at the same time are focused on the same students. In social pedagogy, teamwork is essential as well since social pedagogues can find employment in different areas, e. g. residential groups, educational institutions, school <b>counselling,</b> non-governmental <b>organisation.</b> Regardless of area of employment, to be successful, one needs to work in a team. An attitude toward teamwork affects our team activities importantly as well. It can be defined as a lasting mental readiness for a particular way of responding. An attitude consists of three basic components: cognitive, emotional and motivational component. The cognitive component is presented by knowledge, experience, information, judgement of value and arguments about team work. The emotional component includes emotional relation to team work. The motivational component is our tendency to be active and to want to work in a team. In my master’s thesis I have dealt with the following questions: what teamwork experience do students of social pedagogy and employed social pedagogues have, what are their attitudes toward teamwork and, in what way are the experience with team work and the attitudes toward teamwork related. 109 interviewees took part in the research, 37 students of social pedagogy and 72 employed social pedagogues. The results have shown that students of social pedagogy and employed social pedagogues have quite positive experience with teamwork. Experience with communication, aims, roles and fulfilling the needs in a team were estimated highly. The least positively estimated experience was regarding the evaluation in a team. The interviewees have very positive standpoint on teamwork. Both groups of interviewees agree with the attitude that good communication is needed for effective teamwork. Students of social pedagogy and employed social pedagogues are also unified in the attitude with which they agree the least, that conflicts should be avoided in a team. We couldn’t prove any statistically significant differences concerning attitudes toward teamwork between the students of social pedagogy and the employed social pedagogues. Results have shown that there is a positive relation between the experience with teamwork and attitudes toward teamwork. Interviewees with more positive experience with teamwork have more positive attitudes toward team work and vice versa, those with more positive attitudes toward teamwork have more positive experience with it...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of instrumentalism on the praxis of {{counselling}} and psychotherapy in Britain, {{and is based on}} an ethnographic study of responses to state and organisational authority {{in the form of the}} social actions of therapists within several therapy-based institutions. Following a brief social history of British psychotherapy, the thesis includes an autoethnographic account of my entry into a psychotherapy habitus and my emerging self-identified role as an involved observer. This is followed by a discussion of material (from the period 2006 - 2015) arising from an analysis of six case studies and forty-five in-depth interviews. During this time, therapy organisations acted partly to facilitate the expected statutory regulation of counselling and psychotherapy, and partly in anticipation of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapy scheme. These actions included the codification and componentisation of therapy praxis in compliance with NICE guidelines for the empirical evaluation and approval of psychological therapy, using outcome measures and randomised controlled trials. They took place against a backdrop of neoliberal imperatives, designed to reduce welfare payments, (including the use of therapy as workfare), and the recasting of therapy knowledge within an economistic perspective. My informants include: senior therapy managers and training course directors within <b>counselling</b> and psychotherapy <b>organisations</b> who were collectively engaged in the production of monistic representations of therapy, therapy trainers subjected to numericised emotion management, and students on training courses aligned to digitally-Taylorised representations of therapy praxis. The thesis concludes with an interpretation of these actions, using a range of sources, followed by a discussion of the acts of resistance (since the beginning of 2016) by factions of therapists...|$|R
