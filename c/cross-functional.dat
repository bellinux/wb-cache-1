5|$|Innovation management: The {{value of}} the {{coordinating}} role of design in new product development has been well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing <b>cross-functional</b> innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E

25|$|Agile {{software}} development describes {{a set of}} values and principles for {{software development}} under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing <b>cross-functional</b> teams. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. These principles support the definition and continuing evolution of many software development methods.|$|E
500|$|Project teams (also {{referred}} to as development teams) produce new products and services for an organization or institution on a one-time or limited basis, of which the copyrights of that new product or service will belong to the establishment that it was made for once it is completed. The task of these teams may vary from just improving a current project, concept or plan to creating an entirely new projects with very few limitations. Projects teams rely on their members being knowledgeable and well versed in many disciplines and functions, as this allows them {{to complete the task}} effectively. Once a project is completed, the team either disbands and are individually moved to other special functions or moves on to other projects and tasks that they as a unit can accomplish or develop. A common example of project teams are <b>cross-functional</b> teams. [...] A project team's effectiveness is associated with the speed with which they are able to create and develop new products and services which reduces time spent on individual projects.|$|E
500|$|Ready {{to begin}} work on a full game, the NEMO team {{returned}} {{to the idea of}} surveillance cameras, but wanted to make a more interactive and engaging experience. Zito originally had a plan for an interactive movie was based on the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series. After negotiations with the film studio fell through, Zito hired Terry McDonell to write an original script. A <b>cross-functional</b> team of writers, directors, game designers, and programmers discussed how to blend the art of film with the interactivity of video games to create a compelling interactive narrative. The initial idea was to take the basis of Scene of the Crime to an extreme with a billionaire leaving an extremely large sum of money alone in a large house, guarded by a state-of-the-art security system. In this concept, the billionaire's daughter is staying at the house with her teenage friends when the house is attacked by ninja burglars who are attempting to steal the money. Through much deliberation, the game evolved into the final vampire concept seen in Night Trap. Hasbro was concerned that the game may feature [...] "reproducible violence". As a result, Hasbro did not want the vampires, later dubbed Augers, to bite or move too quickly. In addition, the device used by the Augers to drain blood from their victims was purposely designed to pass Hasbro's non-reproducible violence requirements.|$|E

2500|$|According to Lutz (1993), while AMC had {{its share}} of problems, it was far from being a bunch of [...] "brain-dead losers". He {{describes}} the [...] "troops" [...] at AMC as more like the Wake Island Marines in battle, [...] "with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy, they were able to roll out an impressive succession of new products". After first reacting with anger to the purchase, Chrysler managers soon anticipated the benefits. To further solidify the organizational competencies held by AMC, Lee Iacocca agreed to retain former AMC units, such as engineering, completely intact. In addition, AMC's lead engineer, François Castaing, was made head of all engineering at Chrysler. In an unthinkable strategic move, Castaing completely dismantled the entrenched Chrysler groups. In their place AMC's [...] "platform team" [...] was implemented. These were close-knit <b>cross-functional</b> groups responsible for the whole vehicle, as contrasted with Chrysler's highly functional structure. In this capacity, Castaing's strategy was to eliminate the corporate administrative overhead bureaucracy. This move shifted corporate culture and agitated veteran executives who believed that Chrysler's reputation as [...] "the engineering company" [...] was being destroyed. Yet, according to the popular press, by the 1980s Chrysler's reputation was totally shot, and in Lutz's view only dramatic action was going to change that. In summary, Chrysler's purchase of AMC laid the critical foundation to help re-establish a strategy for its revival in the 1990s.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012 and 2013, {{the concept}} of 'Coopetitive Knowledge Sharing' was {{inspired}} by inter-organization research literature toward developing a Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing that explains (1) how coopetition should be conceptualized, (2) What forms coopetition (three formative constructs of outcome (goal, reward), means (task related), boundary (friendship, geographical closeness, sense of team belonging) interdependencies), and (3) How coopetition and its interrelated components interact and influence knowledge sharing behaviors in <b>cross-functional</b> software teams. This series of publications in the Journal of Systems and Software and Information Processing & Management conceptualize and operationalize the multi-dimensional construct of <b>cross-functional</b> coopetition and presents an instrument for measuring this construct. <b>Cross-functional</b> coopetition is conceptualized with five distinct and independent constructs, {{three of them are}} related to <b>cross-functional</b> cooperation (task orientation, communication, interpersonal relationships), and two are associated with <b>cross-functional</b> competition (tangible resources and intangible resources).|$|E

A dedicated scribe should be present to document the discussion, freeing up the Business Analyst to lead the discussion {{in a direction that}} generates appropriate requirements which meet the session objective.|$|E

This includes information from all functional departments. System integration becomes important because it makes all information accessible through a single interface. An inherent benefit of a <b>cross-functional</b> team is the breadth of knowledge brought to the group by each member. Each team member is a representative of a department and therefore can leverage their familiarity with accessing and providing knowledge of that department for the team.

50|$|Classic state {{diagrams}} {{require the}} creation of distinct nodes for every valid combination of parameters that define the state. This {{can lead to a}} very large number of nodes and transitions between nodes for all but the simplest of systems (state and transition explosion). This complexity reduces the readability of the state diagram. With Harel statecharts it is possible to model multiple <b>cross-functional</b> state diagrams within the statechart. Each of these <b>cross-functional</b> state machines can transition internally without affecting the other state machines in the statechart. The current state of each <b>cross-functional</b> state machine in the statechart defines the state of the system. The Harel statechart is equivalent to a state diagram but it improves the readability of the resulting diagram.|$|E
