These systems may not be spectrally efficient in case of group or broadcast-based voice and data calls, a common feature of PMR systems. We propose a new asymmetric PMR system comprising a wideband OFDM-based downlink and a narrowband uplink, which not only achieves a better spectral efficiency but also can support high bit rate multimedia applications. The system is shown to have high trunking efficiency since all users are assumed to use the pool of channels available in the wideband downlink.

40|$|The role {{assigned}} to the judge varies from one legal system to another. In the Anglo-Saxon legal systems, {{in the context of}} the absence of an independent legislative body, judge is the one who creates law; his mission consists in solving a specific case, given the existing judicial precedents; if he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> appropriate rule of law, the judge has to create one and to apply it. On the other hand, in the continental system, creation of law is the mission of the legislator. Evolving under the influence of Roman law, the continental law systems differ from the Anglo-Saxons by: the assuming of Corpus iuris civilis; the tendency to abstraction, leading to the creation of a rational law; the rule of law, with the consequence of blurring the role of jurisprudence. In spite of these essential differences, the last decades of the twentieth century have found out the convergence of the written coded system and the common law system. Thus, the increasing of the legislature`s role in common law system is accompanied by the reconsideration of the judge`s role in the Roman-Germanic legal system. While Anglo-Saxons accept the "compromise" of coding, Continentals shyly step towards rethinking the status of law source of the jurisprudence. History has shown that, one by one, law and jurisprudence have disputed the the role of prime creator of law. Emphasizing the creative force of jurisprudence, Vladimir Hanga wrote: "The law remains in its essence abstract, but the appreciation of the jurisprudence makes it alive, as the judge, understanding the law, examining the interests of parties and taking inspiration from equity, ensures the ultimate purpose of the law: suum cuique tribuere&# 39; 1.

30|$|The {{pairwise}} key establishment between any two neighboring nodes {{is the main}} objective. Each sensor node can communicate with each neighboring sensor node using the {{pairwise key}} they shared. Eschenauer and Gligor[7] proposed a well-known key management scheme called basic scheme. In the key predistribution phase, a large pool of P keys and their key identifiers are generated. Each sensor node randomly selects k keys from the key pool P without replacement. In the shared-key discovery phase, any two neighboring sensor nodes can {{find out if they}} share (at least) a common key via exchanging the list of key identifiers on their key rings or using a challenge-response protocol. If any two neighboring nodes <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> out <b>a</b> common key on their key rings, they can perform path-key establishment if the graph is connected. Chan et al.[1] proposed three schemes called q-composite random key predistribution, multipath key reinforcement and random-pairwise keys scheme, respectively. The first and second schemes are the modifications of the basic scheme[7]. The q-composite random key predistribution scheme requires that any two neighboring sensor nodes need to share at least q (q> 1) keys for their link in order to increase the resilience against sensor node compromise. The multipath key reinforcement scheme can strengthen any link between any two neighboring sensor nodes that shared a single key via updating the communication key if enough routing information of them can be exchanged. The random-pairwise keys scheme offers the perfect resistance against node capture and node-to-node authentication. These schemes are all based on probabilistic shared keys.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{rectangular}} faulty block {{model is}} {{the most commonly used}} fault model for designing fault-tolerant, and deadlockfree routing algorithms in mesh-connected multicomputers. The convexity of a rectangle facilitates simple, efficient ways to route messages around fault regions using relatively few or no virtual channels to avoid deadlock. However, such a faulty block may include many nonfaulty nodes which are disabled, i. e., they are not involved in the routing process. Therefore, it is important to define a fault region that is convex, and at the same time, to include a minimum number of nonfaulty nodes. In this paper, we propose an optimal solution that can quickly construct a set of minimum faulty polygons, called orthogonal convex polygons, from a given set of faulty blocks in a 2 -D mesh (or 2 -D torus). The formation of orthogonal convex polygons is implemented using either a centralized, or distributed solution. Both solutions are based on the formation of faulty components, each of which consists of adjacent faulty nodes only, followed by the addition of a minimum number of nonfaulty nodes to make each component a convex polygon. Extensive simulation has been done to determine the number of nonfaulty nodes included in the polygon, and the result obtained is compared with the best existing known result. Results show that the proposed approach <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>find</b> <b>a</b> set of minimum faulty polygons, but also does so quickly {{in terms of the number}} of rounds in the distributed solution.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} analysis of a deterministic optimization scheme termed Greedy Exhaustive Dual Binary Swap for the optimization of nuclear reactor core loading patterns. The goal of this optimization scheme is to emulate the approach taken by an engineer when manually optimizing a reactor core loading pattern. This is to determine if this approach is able to locate high quality patterns that, due to their location in the core loading solution space, are consistently missed by standard stochastic optimization methods {{such as those in}} the genetic algorithm class, or those in the simulated annealing class. This optimization study is carried out using the poropy tool to handle the reactor physics model. Initially, optimizations are carried out using beginning of cycle eigenvalue as a surrogate for core excess reactivity and thus cycle length. The deterministic Dual Binary Swap is found to locate acceptable patterns less reliably than stochastic methods, but those that are located are of higher quality. Optimizations of the full depletion problem result in the deterministic Dual Binary Swap optimizer locating patterns that are of higher quality than those found by the stochastic Simulated Annealing, with comparable frequency. The Dual Binary Swap optimizer is, however, found to be very dependent on the starting core configuration, and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> reliably <b>find</b> <b>a</b> high quality pattern from any given starting configuration. by Carl C.

This becomes a hard problem when the various representations to be aligned reveal significant differences not only in tempo, instrumentation, or dynamics but also in structure or polyphony. Because of the complexity and diversity of music data, one <b>can</b> <b>not</b> expect to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> universal synchronization algorithm that yields reasonable solutions in all situations. In this paper, we present a novel method that allows for automatically identifying the reliable parts of alignment results. Instead of relying on one single strategy, our idea is to combine several types of conceptually different synchronization strategies within an extensible framework, thus accounting for various musical aspects. Looking for consistencies and inconsistencies across the synchronization results, our method automatically classifies the alignments locally as reliable or critical. Considering only the reliable parts yields a high-precision partial alignment. Moreover, the identification of critical parts is also useful, as they often reveal musically interesting deviations between the versions to be aligned. ...|$|R
