40|$|Determinations of {{the complex}} {{impedance}} (measured in terms of resistance and capacitance) have already provided a means of characterizing {{the surface of the}} red corpuscle (1). This paper is concerned with an extension of this method to a study of hemolysis. EXPERIM~ENTAL PROCEDURE The impedance of a suspension of ceils may be represented as a resistance and a parallel capacitance which, per centimeter cube of suspension, are referred to as the resistivity R (ohms-cm.) and the capacity C (micromicrofarads-cm. - 1) of the suspension. The values of R and C at frequencies between I/ 4 and 2000 kilocycles per second were measured with a Wheatstone bridge, using a substitution method (I). The electrolytic cell containing the corpuscles is replaced by a similar cell filled with a salt solution of the same resistance and connected in parallel to a condenser (of negligible inductance). The function of the bridge is solely to indicate the existence of electrical equivalence in the two cases. The capacitance of the suspension is obtained by adding the static capacitance of the <b>comparison</b> <b>cell</b> to the capacitance of the parallel condenser. The static capacitance of the <b>comparison</b> <b>cell</b> equals D 9 7. 1 4 ~'K 10 K ~#F where D is the dielectric constant of water (79 at the experimental temperature of 21. 4 °C.), and K is the cell constant. The same procedure of substitution was used from 2000 to 16, 000 kilocycles/sec., but a resonance method was used instead of the bridge to indicate the existence of equivalence. The electrolytic cells are cylindrical with one electrode mounted on a micrometer screw which allows a fine adjustment of the resistance of the <b>comparison</b> <b>cell</b> to be made.

METHODOLOGY: MDPC- 23 cells were exposed to supernatants from biofilm cultures of strains isolated from the deepest part of a carious lesion as well as from a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used for <b>comparison.</b> <b>Cell</b> activity was assessed using an methyl-thiazolyl-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and collagen 1 levels were determined by ELISA. RESULTS:The lesion microflora was dominated by Lactobacillus spp. Neither extracellular products from the isolates nor LPS affected the activity of the MDPC- 23 cells, whereas extracellular products from E. faecalis and LTA significantly reduced total cell activity (P < 0. 01). Enterococcus faecalis had an inhibitory effect upon collagen 1 production by the cells, whereas no such effect or even a slight stimulatory effect was seen for the isolates from the deep carious lesion. CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate that culture supernatants from E. faecalis reduced the metabolic activity of odontoblast-like cells as shown using the MTT assay. No effect was seen for supernatants from biofilms of bacteria recovered from a deep carious lesion. Different bacteria varied in their effects upon collagen 1 production suggesting that the nature of the bacterial species in a carious lesion may have a direct influence upon the ability of the odontoblasts to produce tertiary dentine...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Advanced {{endometrial cancer}} often shows {{resistance}} to clinical chemotherapy although potencies of anticancer drugs in vitro are promising. The disparity {{suggests that in}} vi vo microenvironments are not recapitulated by in vitro models used for preclinical testing. However, spheroids replicate some important properties of tumours in vivo. Therefore, for the first time, we compared effects of doxorubicin and cisplatin on 3 D multicellular structures and 2 D cell monolayers of endometrial cancer cells. Methods 3 D multicellular structures were generated by culturing cancer cells on non-adherent surfaces; and for <b>comparison</b> <b>cell</b> monolayers were cultured on adherent culture plates. Ishikawa, RL 95 - 2, and KLE cell lines were studied. Morphologies of 3 D multicellular structures were examined. After 48 hours treatment with anticancer drugs, apoptosis, proliferation, glucose metabolism and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were analysed. Immunostaining of PCNA, Glut- 1, p-Erk 1 / 2, SOD- 1 and p-Akt 1 / 2 / 3 was also performed. Results Distinct 3 D multicellular morphologies were formed by three different endometrial cancer cell lines. Doxorubicin induced less apoptosis in 3 D multicellular structures of high grade cancer cells (RL 95 - 2 and KLE cell lines) than in cell monolayers. Parallel alterations in Erk 1 / 2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation might suggest they were linked and again doxorubicin had less effect on 3 D multicellular structures than cell monolayers. On the other hand, there was no correlation between altered glucose metabolism and proliferation. The responses depended on cancer cell lines and were apparently not mediated by altered Glut- 1 levels. The level of SOD- 1 was high in 3 D cell cultures. The effects on VEGF secretion were various and cancer cell line dependent. Importantly, both doxorubicin and cisplatin had selective paradoxical stimulatory effects on VEGF secretion. The microenvironment within 3 D multicellular structures sustained Akt phosphorylation, consistent with it having a role in anchorage-independent pathways. Conclusions The cancer cells responded to microenvironments in a distinctive manner. 3 D multicellular structures exhibited greater resistance to the agents than 2 D monolayers, and {{the differences between the}} culture formats were dependent on cancer cell lines. The effects of anticancer drugs on the intracellular mediators were not similar in 3 D and 2 D cultures. Therefore, using 3 D cell models may {{have a significant impact on}} conclusions derived from screening drugs for endometrial carcinomas. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer-related {{mortality}} in women worldwide. Since a significant portion of cases present with or progress to metastatic disease, furthering our understanding of metastasis is critical to develop better treatments. Epithelial cells maintain contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) predominantly via integrin engagement, a process required for tissue integrity and barrier function. In non-transformed cells, loss of ECM adhesion promotes a specialized form of programmed cell death, anoikis. In order for efficient metastasis to occur, breast tumor cells must evade anoikis. miR- 203, known to be down-regulated in several cancers, was found by our lab to be induced ten-fold 24 hours following detachment in breast epithelial cells, but not invasive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, suggesting that miR- 203 may participate in promoting anoikis. Interestingly, more invasive breast cancer cell lines have been shown to express miR- 203 at significantly lower levels than those of less invasive lines. Objectives: Since restoration of miR- 203 expression ectopically is not feasible in a clinical setting, we sought to identify and characterize miR- 203 target genes in order to provide a pharmaceutical platform for restoration of anoikis sensitivity in metastatic breast cancer. Methods: We performed traditional RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) coupled with immunoprecipitation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC; Ago 2 RIP-Seq) in MCF- 10 A, an immortalized, but non-transformed breast epithelial cell line, overexpressing precursor miR- 203 or an empty vector control. MDA-MB- 231, triple negative ductal carcinoma cells, were used as our invasive <b>comparison</b> <b>cell</b> line. Results: Here we show that miR- 203 induction in detached MCF- 10 A cells is due to loss of integrin signaling. Our coupled RNA-Seq and Ago 2 RIP-Seq approach revealed 72 potential candidates, 42 of which were predicted miR- 203 targets based on the TargetScan algorithm. We subjected the candidates to stringent characterization and found 9 bona-fide miR- 203 targets that promote cell death when inhibited. Among these, WDR 69, PRKAB 1, PRPS 2, and HBEGF were significantly elevated in TNBC tumor samples, as determined by RNA-Seq analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Conclusion: Understanding the mechanisms by which cells evade anoikis during tumor dissemination is crucial to developing more effective therapies in breast cancer. miR- 203, which is expressed at very low levels in more invasive breast cancers, is a positive regulator of anoikis that is upregulated in response to loss of contact with the ECM. Our combined RNA-sequencing screen revealed 42 direct miR- 203 targets. Inhibition of 9 bona-fide targets promoted cell death, suggesting that they are negative regulators of anoikis. WDR 69, PRKAB 1, PRPS 2, and HBEGF were all significantly elevated in TNBC tumor samples relative to less invasive samples, likely a consequence of low miR- 203 expression. The identified genes represent potential pharmaceutical targets for novel breast cancer therapies...|$|E
