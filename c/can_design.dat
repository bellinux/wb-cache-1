By contrast, Harry M. was much more autocratic and did not pay much attention to the advice his teammates were giving him, which eventually led to Gbemi and Lizzie (who were designing the can) deciding to return the favour and not pay attention to his ideas on the <b>can</b> <b>design.</b> Lord Sugar said that this was the closest decision in any of the advertising tasks since the UK Apprentice began, but ultimately gave Atomic their first (and only) win {{based on the fact that}} Kinetic's advert and <b>can</b> <b>design</b> were both badly made and did not stand out.|$|E

25|$|Theoretical {{computer}} science seeks to understand which computational {{problems can be}} solved by using a computer (computability theory) and how efficiently (computational complexity theory). Traditionally, {{it is said that}} a problem can be solved by using a computer if we <b>can</b> <b>design</b> an algorithm that produces a correct solution for any given instance. Such an algorithm can be implemented as a computer program that runs on a general-purpose computer: the program reads a problem instance from input, performs some computation, and produces the solution as output. Formalisms such as random access machines or universal Turing machines can be used as abstract models of a sequential general-purpose computer executing such an algorithm.|$|E

So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative."

We <b>can</b> <b>design</b> shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas." ...|$|E

500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you <b>can</b> <b>design</b> a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the concept}} of suppressing {{mutation}} raises the question: How <b>can</b> <b>design</b> evolution occur at the nanoscale without a process of random mutation and deterministic selection? Critics argue that MNT advocates have not provided a substitute for such a process of evolution in this nanoscale arena where conventional sensory-based selection processes are lacking. [...] The limits of the sensorium available at the nanoscale could make it difficult or impossible to winnow successes from failures. [...] Advocates argue that design evolution should occur deterministically and strictly under human control, using the conventional engineering paradigm of modeling, design, prototyping, testing, analysis, and redesign.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century, Sullivan's star was well on the descent and, for the {{remainder}} of his life, his output consisted primarily of a series of small bank and commercial buildings in the Midwest. Yet a look at these buildings clearly reveals that Sullivan's muse had not abandoned him. When the director of a bank that was considering hiring him asked Sullivan why they should engage him at a cost higher than the bids received for a conventional Neo-Classic styled building from other architects, Sullivan is reported to have replied, [...] "A thousand architects could design those buildings. Only I <b>can</b> <b>design</b> this one." [...] He got the job. Today these commissions are collectively referred to as Sullivan's [...] "Jewel Boxes". All still stand.|$|E
2500|$|A firm <b>can</b> <b>design</b> {{any number}} of {{channels}} they require to reach customers efficiently and effectively. [...] Channels can be distinguished {{by the number of}} intermediaries between producer and consumer. [...] If there are no intermediaries then this is known as a zero-level distribution system or direct marketing. [...] A level one (sometimes called one-tier) channel has a single intermediary. A level two (alternatively a two-tier) channel has two intermediaries, and so on. This flow is typically represented as being manufacturer to retailer to consumer, but may involve other types of intermediaries. In practice, distribution systems for perishable goods tend to be shorter - direct or single intermediary, because of the need to reduce the time a product spends in transit or in storage. In other cases, distribution systems can become quite complex involving many levels and different types of intermediaries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus. The structure of the Bauhaus Vorkurs (preliminary course) reflected a pragmatic approach to integrating theory and application. In their first year, students learnt the basic elements and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented {{with a range of}} materials and processes. This approach to design education became a common feature of architectural and design school in many countries. For example, the Shillito Design School in Sydney stands as a unique link between Australia and the Bauhaus. The colour and design syllabus of the Shillito Design School was firmly underpinned by the theories and ideologies of the Bauhaus. Its first year foundational course mimicked the Vorkurs and focused on the elements and principles of design plus colour theory and application. The founder of the school, Phyllis Shillito, which opened in 1962 and closed in 1980, firmly believed that [...] "A student who has mastered the basic principles of design, <b>can</b> <b>design</b> anything from a dress to a kitchen stove".|$|E
