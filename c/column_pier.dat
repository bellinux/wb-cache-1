These are constructed such that the water can be pumped out, keeping the working environment dry. When piers are to be built using an open caisson and it is not practical to reach suitable soil, friction pilings may be driven to form a suitable sub-foundation. These piles are connected by a foundation pad upon which the <b>column</b> <b>pier</b> is erected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The existed {{concrete}} column reinforced by external steel tube {{is a common}} reinforcement technique and widely used in engineering. However, the computational theory on bearing capacity of the reinforced structure is insufficient at present. In the condition that the existed column concrete before completely unloading is reinforced or the initial stress level is low, the mechanics characteristics of reinforced components were analyzed based on the limit equilibrium method, and then the computational equations of the bearing capacity subjected to axial loading after the short <b>column</b> <b>pier</b> reinforced structure had been deduced. Comparing the calculation results with the correspondent experimental data shows that the deduced equation can provide reasonable results for predicting the axial bearing capacity, which provides a support for the computation of the bearing capacity for the reinforcement pier in practice...|$|E

[25] investigated the buckling response of glue-laminated columns reinforced with fibre-reinforced plastic sheets. The study of Li et al. [26] showed that the short LBL columns (with the cross section of 100  mm ×  100  mm) in compression display {{a significant amount of}} plastic behaviour before crushing, and also showed that the stress–strain relationship in compression could be represented using a tri-linear model with an elastic portion, and elastoplastic portion and a purely plastic portion. Su et al. [27] investigated the mechanical performance of laminated bamboo lumber <b>column</b> <b>pier</b> under axial compression. Luna et al. [28] and Li et al.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in confinement reinforcement of building columns {{have resulted in}} changes in Canadian code for Design of Concrete Structures CSA A 23. 3 - 04. Bridge <b>columns</b> and <b>piers</b> may also {{take advantage of these}} advances. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to use a comparable approach to propose new equations to be introduced in future Canadian bridge design code. The adopted approach for transverse reinforcement is based on the recently developed uniaxial confinement model for concrete column at Sherbrooke University. Parametric studies have been carried out on some typical bridge <b>columns</b> and <b>piers</b> to develop equations for confinement reinforcement. An intermediate level of ductility (moderate ductility) for bridge <b>columns</b> and <b>piers</b> has been introduced, similar to that in CSA A 23. 3 - 04 building design code. Confinement reinforcement for this level of ductility has been found to be less stringent than that for ductile level. This level of ductility is suitable for regions of low to medium seismicity. The adopted approach is supported by experimental results and will provide the designer more flexibility but economical and safer seismic design of bridge <b>columns</b> and <b>piers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Modern {{reinforced}} concrete structural systems, consisted of various slender members (i. e. <b>columns,</b> <b>piers,</b> frame legs, etc.), are used more frequent than ever.
