5|$|Because Armero's {{hospital}} {{was destroyed in}} the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> over the country. Of the 1244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been thoroughly cleaned, {{many of these people}} could have been saved.|$|E

They <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> parts of Palestine as well as Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Germany. They were also of differing {{religious}} denominations, including Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Catholic, Coptic, and Maronite.

Most of the teachers employed during the orphanage’s first 50 years were German, with some Armenians and Arabs.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} on 22 June, approximately 1.8million French soldiers were in captivity; a figure representing roughly 10 percent of the total adult male population of France at the time. One of the terms of the Compiègne Armistice was that French prisoners would remain in German custody {{until the end of the}} war which was thought to be imminent. French prisoners <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> backgrounds, regions and civilian occupations within France and also included a substantial number of soldiers from the French colonial empire. Nevertheless, approximately a third of all French prisoners of war were French farmers or peasants and, in some regions, the total proportion of agricultural workers captured was much higher. This created labour shortages in many civilian occupations, particularly agriculture which was largely unmechanised.|$|E

5|$|No {{preparations}} {{had been}} made for their reception, accommodation had not been set aside and no food had been prepared. The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and sick children were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in the barracks had no electricity or running water, and food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Michael {{learned of}} the fall of Amisos, he ordered a huge force to be {{assembled}} (al-Tabari gives its size at 50,000 men) under his uncle Petronas, the Domestic of the Schools, and Nasar, the stratēgos of the Bucellarian Theme. Al-Tabari records that the Emperor himself assumed command of these forces, but this is not supported by Byzantine sources. Given the bias against Michael by the historians writing during the Macedonian dynasty, this may be a deliberate omission. The forces assembled <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> over the Byzantine Empire. Three separate armies were formed and converged on the Arabs: a northern Byzantine force composed of the forces from the Black Sea themes of the Armeniacs, Bucellarians, Koloneia and Paphlagonia; a southern force, probably the one that had already fought at the Bishop's Meadow and had kept shadowing the Arab army, composed from the Anatolic, Opsician and Cappadocian themes, as well as the kleisourai (frontier districts) of Seleukeia and Charsianon; and the western force, under Petronas himself, comprising the men of the Macedonian, Thracian and Thracesian themes and of the imperial tagmata from the capital.|$|E
5|$|The 11th Battalion {{was formed}} on 17 August 1914, {{less than two}} weeks after the {{declaration}} of war on 4 August, and was among the first infantry units raised during World War I for the all-volunteer First Australian Imperial Force. Along with the 9th, 10th and 12th Battalions, it formed Colonel Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan's 3rd Brigade, which was assigned to the 1st Division. The first battalion raised in Western Australia, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James Lyon-Johnston, the 11th concentrated at Blackboy Hill, Western Australia. Drawing personnel from around the state with the majority coming from Perth and the goldfields, recruits <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> elements of society, with the majority being former labourers and agricultural workers or miners. Seventy-three percent of original enlistments were Australian born, with the remaining recruits being mainly English-born with smaller numbers coming {{from other parts of the}} British Isles. By 24 September it had reached its authorised strength of 1,023 officers and other ranks. On formation, the battalion consisted of eight rifle companies, designated 'A' to 'H', and a headquarters company with signals, transport, medical and machine-gun sections.|$|E
