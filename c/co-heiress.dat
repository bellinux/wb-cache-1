5|$|In 1336 John married Maud de Badlesmere, who was {{the second}} of the four daughters of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, of Badlesmere in Kent and Margaret de Clare. Maud was a <b>co-heiress</b> of her brother Giles de Badlesmere, 2nd Baron Badlesmere. When Giles died in 1338, this brought a {{significant}} part of the Badlesmere inheritance into de Vere's hands. The marriage also forged a strong bond with William Bohun, Earl of Northampton, who had married Badlesmere's third daughter, Elizabeth de Badlesmere, and thus became Oxford's brother-in-law. The two campaigned together, sat on the same commissions and died the same year.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{inherited}} {{lands in}} Lincolnshire worth {{one half of}} a knight's fee. These were augmented with gifts from Richard and John, much of which were in Essex. He also acquired lands in Surrey and in Somerset, and his marriage to Joan brought him estates in Essex. Joan's lands also brought him into conflict with Falkes de Breauté, the husband of Joan's younger sister and <b>co-heiress,</b> and the two brothers-in-law were involved in lawsuits over their wives' lands {{for more than five}} years. Joan and her sister were also co-heiresses to the barony of Courcy, in right of their mother Alice de Courcy.|$|E
5|$|The Steynings {{family owned}} Holnicote until the direct male line became extinct {{with the death}} of Charles Staynings (1622–1700). His wife, Susanna (died 1685), was a {{daughter}} of Sir Nicholas Martyn of Oxton and Steynings's heir was their nephew, William Martyn. According to records of the Heralds' Visitations of Devon and research by the Victorian historian J. L. Vivian, this William Martyn lived in Oxton in the parish of Kenton, Devon; he was Susanna Martyn's great-nephew and died in 1710, aged 30. He sold the estate to William Blackford, a Master in Chancery. Blackford then bought the manors of Bossington and Avill, the latter from Anthony Stocker and his wife, Sarah; this estate extended from the ridge of Grabbist nearly to the sea-shore and also included land in the parishes of Dunster, Carhampton, Crowcombe, Stogumber, Timberscombe and St. Decumans. He married Elizabeth, a daughter of John Dyke of Pixton, and died in 1728. His son, William, succeeded him and married Henrietta Collet (died 1727), a daughter and <b>co-heiress</b> of Joseph Collet of Hertford Castle in Hertfordshire. However, he died only three years after his father. Their only daughter and heiress, Henrietta Blackford, inherited the estate as an infant, but died aged 7 in 1733. The estates were divisible upon a great-aunt, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737), and a second cousin, Elizabeth, a daughter of Thomas Dyke of Tetton and Mary, a daughter of Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737). Later in 1733, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737) conveyed her share in the estate to her only surviving son, Edward Dyke (died 1746) who in turn conveyed his portion to his niece in 1744, making her the sole owner of the entire estate.|$|E

25|$|The {{descent of}} Stafford from the Kelloway family of Stowford (Stafford Barton) {{in the parish}} of Dolton is as follows: Thomas Kelloway of Dowland, the second son of Robert Kelloway of Stowford by his wife Elizabeth Menwenick, adopted the surname Stafford, {{retained}} use of his Kelloway paternal arms, and married Margaret Avery of Bremelcombe. Their son was John Stafford of Dowland, who married Juliana Osborne, daughter and <b>co-heiress</b> of Hugh Osborne of Iddesleigh.

25|$|About five generations {{after the}} first Simon Fraser, another Simon Fraser was {{captured}} fighting for Robert the Bruce and was executed in 1306 by Edward I of England. Simon’s cousin was Alexander Fraser of Cowie who was Bruce’s chamberlain. He married Bruce’s sister Mary. Alexander Fraser’s younger brother was another Sir Simon Fraser, from whom the chiefs of the Clan Fraser of Lovat are descended. One of Simon Fraser’s grandsons was Sir Alexander Fraser of Cowie and Durris.

25|$|The Tormohun {{region of}} the town belonged to William Briwere, or Brewer, during this period. Briwere was a {{powerful}} baron in the reigns of Henry II, Richard I, John, and Henry III, until the marriage of his younger daughter and <b>co-heiress</b> brought the ownership of Tormohun to the Mohun family thus forming the basis for its future name of Tor Mohun. The land was given to Torre Abbey by John de Mohun {{in the years following}} the Black Death. In 1540 Tormohun was purchased by John Ridgway, whose grandson, Thomas, was created a baronet in 1612, in 1616 the Lord Ridgway and finally in 1622, Earl of Londonderry, making Tormohun the seat of the Earls of Londonderry until its sale to the Palk family.|$|E
25|$|Llywelyn {{sought to}} avoid the pitfalls the Dinefwr example {{revealed}} and curried favor with his brother-in-law Henry III of England. Despite the occasional conflict between the Welsh prince and the English king, their personal relationship as brothers-in-law {{was not one of}} constant discord, and for the greater period between 1218 and 1240 {{there was a sense of}} amenity between the two. Henry III fully endorsed Dafydd as Llywelyn's heir, and in 1226 Henry III had successfully petitioned the Papacy to free his sister Joan from any stigma of illegitimacy. In 1229, Dafydd traveled to London to do homage for the lands he would inherit, and Llywelyn arranged for the advantageous marriage between Dafydd and Isabella de Braose, daughter and <b>co-heiress</b> of Llywelyn's powerful ally the Marcher lord William de Breos.|$|E

25|$|Burton {{was born}} in Torquay, Devon, at 21:30 on 19 March 1821; in his autobiography, he {{incorrectly}} {{claimed to have been}} born in the family home at Barham House in Elstree in Hertfordshire. He was baptized on 2 September 1821 at Elstree Church in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. His father, Lt.-Colonel Joseph Netterville Burton, of the 36th Regiment, was an Irish-born British army officer of Anglo-Irish extraction who through his mother's family– the Campbells of Tuam– was a first cousin of Lt.-Colonel Henry Peard Driscoll and Mrs Richard Graves. Richard's mother, Martha Baker, was the daughter and <b>co-heiress</b> of a wealthy English squire, Richard Baker (1762–1824), of Barham House, Hertfordshire, for whom he was named. Burton had two siblings, Maria Katherine Elizabeth Burton (who married Lt.-General Sir Henry William Stisted) and Edward Joseph Netterville Burton, born in 1823 and 1824, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Hales had two sons, Humphrey and Edward, both of Gray's Inn, and a {{daughter}}, Mildred. Humphrey was {{the father}} of Sir James Hales (d.1589), knighted by Queen Elizabeth at Cobham Hall in September 1573. Sir James Hales (d.1589) married Alice Kempe (d.1592), the daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe (d. 7 March 1591) of Olantigh in Wye, Kent, by his first wife, Katherine Cheney, daughter and <b>co-heiress</b> of Sir Thomas Cheney, Treasurer of the Royal Household and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, by whom he had a son, Cheyney Hales. Alice is the dedicatee of Greene's Menaphon (published 1589), in which she {{is said to have been}} 'the patterne of a louing and vertuous wife, whose ioyes liued in hir husbands weale, and ended with his life'. After the death of Sir James Hales (d.1589), Alice married Sir Richard Lee (d. 22 December 1608) of Hook Norton, illegitimate brother of Queen Elizabeth's champion, Sir Henry Lee.|$|E
25|$|Bertie {{naturally}} {{opposed the}} proceedings against Danby {{that began in}} December 1678, but was nonetheless appointed to the committee to consider Danby's impeachment. In the general election of March 1679, Sir Richard Cust, formerly an ally of the Berties, and William Hyde obtained {{the support of the}} new Lord Exeter at Stamford. The Exclusion Crisis had weakened the Berties' position; the Stamford electors were now indifferent to the sensibilities of the Court, and Exeter's electoral interest was strong enough that both Charles and Peregrine withdrew from the contest without a poll. Peregrine's Horse Guards troop escorted the commissioners appointed by the new Parliament to disband the standing army through East Anglia in June 1679. Later that month, he resigned his commission and was replaced by Thomas Lucy. The death of his brother-in-law Sir Thomas Monins, 3rd Baronet in 1678 had left his wife <b>co-heiress</b> of the estate of Waldershare. She eventually became the sole possessor, and Bertie was to make his residence there {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1680, he was removed as a commissioner of assessment in Lincolnshire and appointed a justice of the peace in the Parts of Holland and Lindsey, and he became a member of the Honourable Artillery Company in 1682. He exchanged his post as a deputy searcher of customs for that of a surveyor of landwaiters in 1683, replacing the late Samuel Cust; he was succeeded by Edward Le Neve. By 1686, he had become surveyor of the searchers instead.|$|E

25|$|On {{the south}} aisle wall are three {{monument}}s all of white marble on black marble back plates. One is to Mrs Penelope Cholmeley (died 1821 aged 75 years), {{the sister of}} Montague Chomeley. Her remains were interred at Twyford, Middlesex. The monument back plate is straight sided with top and bottom curved and facetted. The raised inscription plaque is oblong with a 45° cut at each corner, over which is a moulded shelf, on which sits an urn with 'cloth' swagging attached and topped with a flambeau. Floriate devices are a boss {{each side of the}} urn, bell flower ribbons hanging from the shelf either side of the plaque, and an oval flower and leaf spray below. The second is a double dedication: firstly to Sir Montague Cholmeley (died 1851 aged 59 years); secondly to Dame Elizabeth, his wife (died 1822), daughter and <b>co-heiress</b> of John Harrison of Norton Place, north from Lincoln. This monument back plate is straight sided with top deeply curved and bottom partly curved. The raised inscription plaque is rectilinear, and sits on a square-edged stepped shelf supported by curved brackets with embossed acanthus decoration, with a device of two strapped palm leaves below. At each side of the plaque is a hanging folded drape attached to a moulded cornice. At each side of the cornice top is a conch shell which provides the holding point for a plain swag that springs from a knot above; between the swagging is a raised cross. The monument was provided by George Wilcox of Piccadilly. Above this monument is one smaller to James Harrison Cholmeley (1808–1854), of a scrolled plaque on a straight sided back plate with a pointed top; above the scroll sits a decorative crest.|$|E
500|$|A 1937 {{survey by}} the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a brass {{memorial}} plaque from 1609, erected by Richard Williams to his wife Marcelie Lloyd, daughter and <b>co-heiress</b> of David Lloyd of Llysdulas. [...] The plaque, which was previously in the old church, bears three shields, one with the coat of arms of Williams, another with Marcelie Lloyd's arms, and the middle one with the two coats of arms combined. [...] Below the shields, husband and wife are shown with their children (Anne, William and Griffith) kneeling in prayer on cushions. [...] The survey also noted a plain silver cup, dated 1711–1712. Other items of communion plate (an inscribed silver chalice, a plain silver paten and a plain silver flagon) were donated by Gwyn Gertrude Hughes in 1866. The church furniture (including the octagonal wooden pulpit and the choir stalls) dates from the 19th century, although the octagonal font was reused from the old church.|$|E
