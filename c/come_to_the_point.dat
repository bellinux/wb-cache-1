25|$|In the United States, {{competitive}} drifters {{are required}} to run US DOT-approved (road legal) tires similar to racing slicks in rubber composition, but with shallow treads included. This is permitted, {{with the exception of}} some major championships including D1GP and Formula Drift which only permits commercially available tires that are approved by the sanctioning body. Professional drifting has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where grip is tuned into cars to be defeated. It makes for a faster drift necessary in the current professional climate. Tires typically used by drifters are around the DOT treadwear rating of 200. Examples include the Hankook Ventus RS-3, Falken Azenis RT615K, Nitto NT05, Yokohama ADVAN Neova AD08R, and Achilles Radial 123s.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{recording}} {{sessions and}} programming {{took place at}} Sa-Ra's Cosmic Dust Studio. Sa-Ra member Om'mas Keith remarked on Badu's role at their studio, [...] "Sometimes she’d come through and pick a skeletal and other times the beats would get made right then and there." [...] Keith played instruments such as the Fender Rhodes, Roland Juno-106, and Roland SH-101. Of all her collaborators, Badu only let Husayn write lyrics for her on the album. Husayn said that because Badu had not allowed anyone to do this before, [...] "she {{had to go through}} some personal things to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where she'd let somebody write for her in the manner that we did. It was spontaneous {{but at the same time}} there was structure to it. It might not have the right expression, or the right enunciation. Writing is so personal. That was a big thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E

2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick {{to put you in}} your place. She doesn't sit and ponder about stuff, where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. But every now and then I like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which Jackson says every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though I later learned it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. For years I didn't. Now I love being called Jo. I've <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that has happened to me. I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E
