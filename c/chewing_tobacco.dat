25|$|<b>Chewing</b> <b>tobacco</b> is {{the oldest}} way of {{consuming}} tobacco leaves. It is consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands, or in a shredded form. When consuming the long, sweetened strands, the tobacco is lightly chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded tobacco, small amounts are placed at the bottom lip, between the gum and the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it can often be called dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the salivary glands, {{which led to the}} development of the spittoon.|$|E

25|$|Gwynn {{had three}} {{procedures}} to remove noncancerous growths from his parotid gland since 1997. In 2010, {{he was diagnosed}} with cancer of a salivary gland and had lymph nodes and tumors from the gland removed. The operation left his face partially paralyzed on the right side, leaving him unable to smile. Later that year, he underwent eight weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. He was declared cancer free afterwards, and also regained his ability to smile. Additional surgery was performed in 2012 to remove more cancerous growth and address nerve damage. Gwynn attributed the cancer to the dipping tobacco habit that he had since playing rookie ball in Walla Walla in 1981.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the article {{was to examine the}} type of {{lifestyle}} adopted by the elderly and its effects on their health conditions and this was based on the data available from the National Family Health Survey– 2 (NFHS– 2). The study found that lifestyle adversely affected health and increased morbidity conditions among the elderly. Lifestyles such as alcohol consumption, regular smoking and <b>tobacco</b> <b>chewing</b> had adverse effects on one’s ability to control diseases. It was observed that asthma was higher among the elderly who smoked regularly, consumed alcohol and <b>chewed</b> <b>tobacco.</b> About 144 persons per 1, 000 population who consumed alcohol were suffering from asthma. Similarly, 143 persons who smoked regularly and 97 persons who <b>chewed</b> <b>tobacco</b> were suffering from asthma. Though TB was related to the lifestyle of a person, it was less among tobacco chewers and alcohol drinkers, but it was higher among those who smoked regularly. Smoking led to higher Illness Prevalence Rate (IPR). The IPRs of smokers and non-smokers by age group showed that in every age group, smokers had higher IPR than the non-smokers. The increase in prevalence of illness among smokers was particularly high {{in the case of the}} elderly. Old people were also generally susceptible to various cardiovascular disorders and other extraneous factors such as consumption of alcohol and <b>tobacco</b> <b>chewing.</b> The elderly morbidity due to alcohol abuse was 8. 6 per cent...|$|R
