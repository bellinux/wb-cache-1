50|$|Typically, the {{grating coupler}} {{has only a}} few periods, so light can be coupled into the {{waveguide}}, but not back out. In such a case, light will be guided in the waveguide until it reaches the waveguide edge, or an additional <b>coupling</b> <b>element,</b> which will couple the light out.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of power on pulsed plasma thruster (PPT) discharge current with respect to its peak, duration, and behavior while the power elevates in a low power range. Design/methodology/approach – A rectangular parallel‐plate breech‐fed PPT has been developed with a self‐inductor <b>coupling</b> <b>element</b> connecting the PPT cathode to the ignitor plug cathode. The PPT has been operated in vacuum chamber at 10 − 6 [*]mbar and its discharge current has been recorded using a Rogowski coil while input power has been changed by means of varying the capacitor voltage at given capacitance and frequency. Findings – The analysis leads to elucidate the effects of input power on discharge current of a PPT employing a self‐inductor <b>coupling</b> <b>element.</b> The power varies within a range of less than 10 to more than 50 [*]W. The results show that current peak rises from 5 to 10 [*]kA while discharge duration and behavior seems to be independent of power within the operating range. Additionally, utilization of the <b>coupling</b> <b>element</b> seems to change the typical oscillating behavior of PPT discharge to a more efficient behavior.

Using SEA for force control removes the need for high-precision force sensors/actuators and allows for accurate force control through simple position control of the deflection of a compliant <b>coupling</b> <b>element.</b> Since {{the performance of a}} SEA is highly dependent on the design of this compliant <b>coupling</b> <b>element,</b> we employ a design optimization framework to design this element. In particular, we propose a compliant, under-actuated half-pantograph mechanism as a feasible kinematic structure for this <b>coupling</b> <b>element.</b> Then, we consider multiple design objectives to optimize the performance of this compliant mechanism through dimensional synthesis, formulating an optimization problem to study the trade-offs between these design criteria. We optimize the directional manipulability of the mechanism, simultaneously with its task space stiffness, using a Pareto-front based framework. We select an optimal design by studying solutions on the Pareto-front curve and considering the linearity of the stiffness along the actuation direction as a secondary design criteria. The optimized mechanism possesses high manipulability and low stiffness along the movement direction of the actuator; hence, achieves a large stroke with high force resolution. At the same time, the mechanism has low manipulability and high stiffness along the direction perpendicular to the actuator motion, ensuring good disturbance rejection characteristics. We model the behavior of this compliant mechanism and utilize this model to synthesize a controller for SEA to study its dynamic response.
