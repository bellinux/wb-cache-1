50|$|Primary maladaptive emotion {{responses}} are also initial emotional {{responses to a}} given stimulus; however, they are generally dysfunctional responses based on emotion schemes that are no longer useful (and {{that may or may}} not have been useful in the past) and that were often formed through previous traumatic experiences. Examples include sadness at the joy of others, anger at the genuine <b>caring</b> <b>or</b> concern of others, fear at harmless situations, and chronic feelings of insecurity/fear or worthlessness/shame. For example, a person may respond with anger at the genuine <b>caring</b> <b>or</b> concern of others because as a child he or she was offered <b>caring</b> <b>or</b> concern that was usually followed by a violation; as a result, he or she learned to respond to <b>caring</b> <b>or</b> concern with anger even when there is no violation. The person's angry response is understandable, and needs to be met with empathy and compassion even though his or her angry response is not helpful. Secondary maladaptive emotion {{responses are}} accessed in therapy with the aim of transforming the emotion scheme through new experiences.|$|R

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual <b>care,</b> <b>or</b> sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E

5|$|In {{regards to}} {{pathogenic}} <b>care,</b> <b>or</b> {{the type of}} care in which these behaviors are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.|$|E
5|$|No <b>care</b> <b>or</b> nursing {{services}} and welfare payments are available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities. The University Hospital of North Norway operates a clinic, Longyearbyen Hospital. Other public offices with presence on Longyearbyen are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Longyearbyen is subordinate Nord-Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal, both located in Tromsø.|$|E

A levee, completed in 1995, protects the city from further flooding. While industry remains important to the city, about a third of Lock Haven's workforce is employed in education, health <b>care,</b> <b>or</b> social services.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate {{for people who}} reach a hospital alive was estimated at 30% in 1966; more recent estimates place this number at 9%. The number of people reaching a hospital alive has increased, perhaps due to improved prehospital <b>care</b> <b>or</b> specialized treatment centers. Of those who reach the hospital alive but then die, most do so within the first two hours of arrival. The sooner a TBI is diagnosed, the higher the {{mortality rate}}; this is likely due to other accompanying injuries that prove fatal.|$|E
5|$|The terms {{attachment}} disorder, attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. However, {{the terms}} and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated, particularly those in the foster care, kinship <b>care,</b> <b>or</b> adoption systems, and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages.|$|E
5|$|In Western and Southern Asia, women {{represent}} {{only a third}} of the work force.

5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured {{and sold to}} some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate <b>care</b> <b>or</b> stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic <b>care</b> <b>or</b> spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal manipulation based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Longyearbyen Community Council is {{the only}} elected local {{government}} in the archipelago and has {{many of the same}} responsibilities of a municipality. It is organized with a fifteen-member council which since 2011 has been led by Mayor Christin Kristoffersen of the Labour Party. The council's main responsibilities are infrastructure and utilities, including power, land-use and community planning, education from kindergarten to upper secondary level and child welfare. It operates three kindergartens in addition to the 13-grade Longyearbyen School. However, unlike mainland municipalities, the healthcare services are provided by the state through Longyearbyen Hospital, a clinic operated by the University Hospital of North Norway. No <b>care</b> <b>or</b> nursing services and welfare payments are available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities.|$|E

This {{transaction set}} is not intended to replace the Health Care Claim Payment/Advice Transaction Set (835) and therefore, is not used for account payment posting. The notification is at a summary or service line detail level. The notification may be solicited or unsolicited.|$|R

5|$|Private Ambulance Service – Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or ambulatory transport), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency <b>care,</b> <b>or</b> to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions and government agencies do not provide this service. Companies such as Falck, Acadian Ambulance, and American Medical Response {{are some of the}} larger companies that provide such services. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. From April 2011 all private ambulance services in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.|$|E
5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered {{nurses are}} {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of the}} patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. When patients are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound <b>care</b> <b>or</b> even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E
5|$|Since 2002, Longyearbyen Community Council has {{had many}} of the same {{responsibilities}} of a municipality, including utilities, education, cultural facilities, fire department, roads and ports. No <b>care</b> <b>or</b> nursing services are available, nor is welfare payment available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities. The hospital is part of University Hospital of North Norway, while the airport is operated by state-owned Avinor. Ny-Ålesund and Barentsburg remain company towns with all infrastructure owned by Kings Bay and Arktikugol, respectively. Other public offices with presence on Svalbard are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Svalbard is subordinate to Nord-Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal, both located in Tromsø.|$|E
