40|$|The {{management}} of domestic fisheries {{by the use}} of catch shares has become a topic of increased attention in recent years. The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) recently voted to adopt a catch share program for their Northeast Multispecies Fishery, proposing the addition of 17 new sectors which will manage a <b>collective</b> <b>quota</b> for the multispecies complex. This paper discusses the specifics of the Fishery Management Plan amendment as it pertains to the sector program and highlights three potential concerns that have been raised with regard to the implementation of sectors: insufficient monitoring, excessive consolidation, and impacts on communities. An exploration of actions taken by other regional Fishery Management Councils to address these concerns provides insight into potential management options that the New England Fishery Management Council may wish to consider as they move forward. These options are evaluated in the context of New England’s groundfish fishery, culminating in recommended actions that would enhance the ability of the management program to achieve its desired goals. Evaluation of the monitoring program in the British Columbia Groundfish Fishery reveals the potential benefits of full monitoring coverage for the Northeast Multispecie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only. The New England Multispecies (groundfish) {{fishery is}} about to {{implement}} the catch share management system, where self-identified groups of harvesters called sectors receive quota allocations of total allowable catch (TAC) proportional to the harvest history of their members. Joining a sector is voluntary, thus there will be both sector members and non-sector members, which will remain in a common pool fishery, coexisting in this fishery. Basic game theory tells us that relative profitability between the sector and non-sector will dictate the flow of membership, while the profitability itself is a inversely related function of membership size. This raises an important question: will a success of a sector, measured by its increased profitability (rent), ultimately undermine the sustainability of that sector? What are the characteristics of an equilibrium, and how would that be affected by (a) the dynamics of biology (fish population) and economics (rent generation), and (b) the management scheme chosen by a sector? This paper develops a microeconomic model of fishers behavior under sector allocation program based on the differential game theory, and solves for dynamic equilibrium in aim to answer these questions. The first model developed is where sector members with individual quota coexisting with non-sector members. Generally, sector members will wait until the nonsector members reach their <b>collective</b> <b>quota,</b> but an interesting result {{is that there will}} be some sector members who will opt to fish with the non-sector members. Revenue sharing in aim to foster collective effort coordination within a sector is also considered...|$|E

But times when the oceans were a horn of plenty are over for good. A combination of fishing technology advances and behaviour has brought many of the world’s stocks to their limits and beyond. Similarly to other resources like fresh water or the climate, mankind must control its activity to prevent irreversible damages. Such management needs information: on the behaviour of fish and fishermen. Focussing on Norway's most valuable fish stock, this study investigates the economic-technological structure the two largest fleet segments of Norway’s coastal cod fishery. The coastal fleet is a peculiar industry: some of the numerous vessels are more than seventy years of age while others are brand-new. They (fish) are fishing with traditional methods but modern gear. Their range of operation is small and particular species are only fished seasonally. Coastal vessels thus 'appear' to not fit into the modern fish industry which demands a steady flow of fish to optimally utilise the processing facilities (Stendal and Aarset, 2001, p. 4). Seemingly a relic from other times, it is claimed by some to be a waste of resources: firstly because it consists of too many vessels and secondly because large ocean going vessels supposedly can do the job cheaper. It is thus wondered whether their existence bases on regulations protecting them. But fishing along the coast of Norway also preserves a traditional lifestyle and gives the chance to choose it. And is bigger better anyway? Answering such questions requires knowledge. Interestingly, there is little academic attention paid to the coastal NEAC fishery in Norway in the literature. This is puzzling since it catches around seventy per cent of the total catch in Norway each year. It is first asked whether neoclassical modelling is appropriate in the given context. Next, a partial-equilibrium neoclassical model is developed. Since the vessels do not only fish cod but a multitude of species, a multi-output framework is appropriate. Thirdly, the empirical model, a system of linear regression equations is estimated by iterative seemingly unrelated regression estimation. The empirical results paint a picture of a flexible fishery. Fishermen strongly react on price changes by shifting targets. Vessels are apparently also able to circumvent the capital restrictions by substituting away from it. Cod cannot be viewed as a fishery of its own: fishermen would not harvest it the way they do were it not for haddock. This implies that bio-economic modelling of cod only is inappropriate. Neither could a composite ‘fishing effort’ be supported. Finally, since saithe is nonjoint, the inclusion in the <b>collective</b> <b>quota</b> seems unjustified. The current study could be seen as groundwork in establishing the ‘economic side’ of a bio-economic model of the NEAC fishery. It can also be regarded as a basis for fisheries management in other ways, be it for the result that saithe can economically be seen as independent or for the ‘flexibility’ uncovered in the coastal fishery...|$|E

He transformed China from a centrally-planned economy to a more free-market economy, his supporters insisted that the iron rice bowl had to be smashed if China was to modernize. During the 1978 Rural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping implicitly set an end to the iron rice bowl with the implementation of a number of economic reforms that were meant to embrace free markets. These reforms included the replacement of the collective farming system with a “household responsibility system," [...] under which households could contract land, machinery, and facilities from collective organizations in order to make independent operating decisions without losing the value of unified, collective management. This meant that farmers were able to personally benefit financially from their own crops, as households were able to get rid of surpluses in production {{as long as they were}} able to fulfill the <b>collective</b> <b>quotas.</b> The adoption of the contract system in rural China increased productivity and food supplies in those areas.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} effects that a redistributive fishing quota policy, within a <b>collective</b> rights <b>quota</b> assignment system, might have on the profits and employment of artisanal fisher organizations. The Chilean authorities have been pursuing a deliberate quota redistributive policy between ship-owners of different vessel categories. This policy has affected income distribution between organizations. We use this experience to study the impact of distributive policies in artisanal fisheries. We use a multi-objective programming model {{and apply it to}} the common sardine and anchovies fisheries in the Biobío Region in Chile. The results indicate the presence of trade-offs between the equity–profits and equity–employment objectives. However, the scope for effective redistributive policies seems limited if the artisanal organizations consume their assigned quotas entirely. Moreover, the results suggest the existence of widespread inefficiencies in the effort allocation within the organizations, independently of the weight given to the different objectives...|$|R

Khrushchev's policy of amalgamating farms was continued by Brezhnev, because he shared Khrushchev's belief that bigger kolkhozes would increase productivity. Brezhnev pushed {{for an increase in}} state investments in farming, which mounted to an all-time high in the 1970s of 27% of all state investment– this figure did not include investments in farm equipment. In 1981 alone, 33 billion U.S. dollars (by contemporary exchange rate) was invested into agriculture.|$|R
40|$|Technological {{progress}} {{is associated with}} both excessive depletion and improved conservation of environmental resources. This dissertation explores the role of technological progress under different regulatory and producing institutions. The first chapter, "Firm Boundaries and Impure Public Goods'', establishes a relationship between property rights, firm structure, and productivity. I adapt {{the theory of the}} firm to show that reducing common-pool externalities can lead to mergers (distinct from permit consolidation among low cost firms) and greater human capital investments. These predictions are supported by data from the New England groundfish industry where some groups called "sectors'' were exempted from input controls and given a <b>collective</b> output <b>quota.</b> Sectors exhibited better managerial performance (i. e., higher productivity) relative to non-sector firms following the change, but the species composition of their harvest shifted considerably. The following two chapters investigate technology adoption and productivity in common -pool resource industries. The second chapter, "Technological Change and Managerial Ability : Evidence from a Malaysian Artisanal Fishery'', uses stochastic frontier analysis to compare the productivity of technology adopters in the gillnet fishery on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Technologies include cell phones, GPS, sonar, and mechanical winches for hauling nets. Electronics adopters were more productive than non- adopters on average but difficult to distinguish from efficient non-adopters, while adopters of mechanical net haulers had low technical efficiency, low labor productivity and high labor use. Our results suggest capital investments in new technology may tie the least successful participants to the fishery despite most respondents' self-reported desire to exit. The dynamic implications of these findings are explored in the third chapter, "Exogenous Productivity Shocks and Capital Investment in Common-pool Resources''. We develop a compound Poisson process to model rapid adoption of technologies in common-pool industries. Technology shocks lower the equilibrium resource stock while causing capital buildup based on transitory quasi-rents. The steady state changes from a stable node to a shifting focus with boom and bust cycles, even if only technology is uncertai...|$|R
