All previous T1 versions used a simple clutch-brake steering system which led to a loss of power while turning.

50|$|The company {{obtained}} a patent for a tank transmission using <b>controlled</b> <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> system, {{known as the}} Merritt-Brown system, devised by Dr. H. E. Merritt, Director of Tank Design at Woolwich Arsenal, in 1935. The first vehicle to use this system was the Churchill tank, and it was subsequently used on the Centurion tank and the Conqueror tank, {{as well as the}} Tortoise heavy tank.|$|E
50|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} 570 {{horsepower}} Mitsubishi HM21 WT V12 turbocharged diesel mounted {{at the rear of}} the hull and exhausting through pipes on either side of the rear of the hull. The engine is coupled to a Mitsubishi manual transmission system which uses a <b>controlled</b> <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> system. The track is driven from the front, and has six rubber road wheels on each side along with three return rollers. The suspension is a torsion bar system with the first, second and sixth road wheel fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers.|$|E
50|$|The {{drive train}} {{consists}} of twin GMC Model 302 6-cylinder inline petrol engines, each developing 146 hp at 3600 rpm. Both engines were {{directly connected to}} a Hydramatic model 301MG transmission (early models used 300MG) with four forward speeds and one reverse. <b>Steering</b> is through <b>controlled</b> <b>differential</b> via <b>steering</b> levers at the drivers station. The track is driven by a drive sprocket at the front. There are five road wheels per side, along with three return rollers. The vehicle uses torsion bar suspension and has shock absorbers on {{the first and last}} road wheel. The vehicle has a top road speed of about 32 miles per hour, considerably less than that of its M75 predecessor.|$|R
50|$|The M4 also {{includes}} an electronically <b>controlled</b> limited-slip <b>differential,</b> electric <b>steering,</b> additional bolted joints between the axle subframe {{and the body}} sills, aluminium stiffening plate and a five-link rear suspension constructed from aluminium Carbon-fibre {{is used for the}} roof, bootlid, strut brace and driveshaft.

40|$|Abstract- Biped {{locomotion}} for humanoid robots is {{a challenging}} {{problem that has}} come into prominence in recent years. As the degrees of freedom of a humanoid robot approaches to that of humans, {{the need for a}} better, robust, flexible and simpler maneuverability becomes inevitable for real or realistic environments. This paper presents a new method of controlling the trajectory of a humanoid robot on the basis of <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> systems. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that such a technique has been applied on humanoid robots. It has been empirically shown that a humanoid robot can plan its trajectory by using the same principle applied in <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> systems, and the change in its orientation can be easily calculated in degrees. Therefore, this method enables the robot to move in a desired curved-shape trajectory, instead of aligning itself with the target prior to walking or performing more complex and time consuming motions like diagonal walk or sidewalk. This method is also beneficial when further trajectory planning constraints such as obstacle avoidance are considered...|$|R

5000|$|A {{differentially}} steered robot {{is similar}} to the differential gears used in automobiles in that both the wheels can have different rates of rotations, but unlike the differential gearing system, a differentially steered system will have both the wheels powered.

25|$|The triple {{differential}} is {{a modification}} to the double <b>differential,</b> replacing the <b>steering</b> clutches {{with a single}} braked <b>differential</b> similar to <b>controlled</b> <b>differential.</b> This third differential produces any desired output speed in the steering shaft, compared to the double differential where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|R

50|$|The most {{conventional}} steering {{arrangement is}} to turn the front wheels using a hand-operated steering wheel which is positioned {{in front of the}} driver, via the steering column, which may contain universal joints (which may also be part of the collapsible steering column design), to allow it to deviate somewhat from a straight line. Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles, for example, a tiller or rear-wheel steering.

A model and simulation of the balancing and the stair-climbing process are derived and the stair-climbing is compared against experimental results with a prototype.
