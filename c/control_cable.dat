25|$|Increasingly, modern {{lighting}} {{instruments are}} available which allow remote control of effects other than light intensity, including direction, color, beam shape, projected image, and beam angle. The {{ability to move}} an instrument ever more quickly and quietly is an industry goal. Some automated lights have built-in dimming and so are connected directly to the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> or network and are independent of external dimmers.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighting}} controller {{is connected to}} the dimmers (or directly to automated luminaires) using a <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> or wireless link (e.g. DMX512) or network, allowing the dimmers which are bulky, hot and sometimes noisy, to be positioned away from the stage and audience and allowing automated luminaires to be positioned wherever necessary. In addition to DMX512, newer control connections include RDM (remote device management) which adds management and status feedback capabilities to devices which use it while maintaining compatibility with DMX512; and Architecture for Control Networks (ACN) which is a fully featured multiple controller networking protocol. These allow the possibility of feedback of position, state or fault conditions from units, whilst allowing much more detailed control of them.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical or {{manually}} operated flight control systems {{are the most}} basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder {{in addition to the}} warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.|$|E
50|$|In June 2013 Kori 2 was shutdown, and Kori 1 {{ordered to}} remain offline, until safety-related <b>control</b> <b>cabling</b> with forged safety {{certificates}} is replaced. <b>Control</b> <b>cabling</b> {{installed in the}} APR-1400s under construction failed flame and other tests, so {{need to be replaced}} delaying construction by up to a year.|$|R
50|$|Facility {{contractors}} introduced {{safety concerns}} on several occasions. In {{one of the}} more serious incidents, contractor personnel damaged hydraulic units, allowing hydraulic fluid to spray over reactor <b>control</b> <b>cables.</b> The same crew then performed welding operations to equipment located above the <b>control</b> <b>cables.</b> Hot slag fell onto the material used to contain the hydraulic fluid and ignited it, along with the fluid on the <b>control</b> <b>cables.</b> The fire involved the cables for five minutes, and 16 essential <b>control</b> <b>cables</b> were damaged. The contractor personnel then failed to inform plant personnel of the situation and the reactor was in operation for several hours in this condition. On another occasion, contractor personnel using improperly grounded welding apparatuses tripped neutron protection circuits, leading to a nuisance trip of the entire plant.|$|R

2500|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{immediately}} {{appointed a}} panel of two to investigate the accident. Examination of the wreckage showed that the flaps and undercarriage were retracted and both engines had been producing high power {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] All trim tabs were in typical positions for takeoff and all <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> runs were intact. [...] Nothing was found in the wreckage to indicate any prior defect or failure that might have caused the aircraft to crash or the pilot to lose control. [...] The setting of the automatic pilot could not be determined due to destruction of the forward fuselage. The investigation initially focussed on possible failure to remove one of the flight control chocks, defective flight instruments, misuse of the wing flaps, structural failure of the tailplane, defective elevator control system, misuse of the automatic pilot, and incorrect loading.|$|E
2500|$|Swedish {{military}} experts and several politicians, including former Minister for Defence Mikael Odenberg, {{have stated that}} the pipeline can cause a security policy problem for Sweden. [...] According to Odenberg, the pipeline motivates Russian navy presence in Swedish economic zone and the Russians can use this for military intelligence should they want to. [...] Finnish military scholar Alpo Juntunen has said {{that even though the}} political discussion over Nord Stream in Finland concentrates on the various ecological aspects, there are clearly military implications to the pipeline that are not discussed openly in Finland. More political concerns were raised when Vladimir Putin stated that the ecological safety of the pipeline project will be ensured by using the Baltic Fleet of the Russian Navy. [...] German weekly Stern has reported that the fibre optic cable and repeater stations along the pipeline could theoretically also be used for espionage. Nord Stream AG asserted that a fibre-optic <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> was neither necessary nor technically planned.|$|E
2500|$|Zenith Aircraft {{disputed the}} NTSB's {{conclusions}} and stated in a response on their website that [...] "e {{continue to believe}} wing flutter will not occur if the control cables are adjusted properly." [...] They also cited Zenair Europe's disagreement with the Dutch government's conclusion that that accident was caused by flutter. AMD issued a safety alert in October 2008 mandating inspections of aileron <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> tensions. The company hired an independent consultant, Dr. Uwe Weltin, an internationally recognized flutter and vibrations specialist {{and head of the}} Institut für Zuverlaessigkeitstechnik at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg who concluded that when the CH 601 XL is built and maintained to Zenair specifications, there is [...] "no tendency to flutter or divergence found within the flight envelope of the CH 601 XL". The company claimed that the report clears the Zodiac design of flutter-related concerns as long as CH 601 XL is built and maintained to Zenair specifications.|$|E

2500|$|Reyes {{said in an}} {{interview}} for the Canadian television series Mayday that when he disengaged the autopilot he feared that the aircraft would bank right again and the crew would lose control of the aircraft; however, because of the pressing need to land quickly to attend to the injured and inspect the plane for additional damage, Reyes instructed Herrera to take hold of his own controls and then Reyes deactivated the autopilot. [...] The aircraft did not bank after the disengagement of the autopilot, but neither would it respond to steering inputs from either controller due to the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> damage caused by the bomb. The crew struggled to use the ailerons, which could allow the aircraft to roll but were still unable to change the plane's direction. Finally the flight crew, including First Officer Jaime Herrera and Comendador, disengaged the auto-throttles and resorted to steering via throttle control, reminiscent of United Airlines Flight 232.|$|E
50|$|Investigation {{revealed}} that the Redstone's engine shutdown was caused by two of its electrical cables separating in the wrong order. These cables were a <b>control</b> <b>cable,</b> which provided various control signals, and a power cable, which provided electrical power and grounding. Both cables were plugged into the rocket at the bottom edge {{of one of its}} tail fins and would separate at liftoff. The <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> was supposed to separate first, followed by the power cable. However, for this launch, the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> was longer than expected—it was one designed for the military PGM-11 Redstone missile rather than the shorter cable designed for Mercury-Redstone. This <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> had been clamped to compensate for its greater length, but when the vehicle lifted off, the clamping did not work as planned and the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> separation was delayed, eventually occurring about 29 milliseconds after the power cable had separated.|$|E
