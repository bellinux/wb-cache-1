40|$|Now WHO experts {{annually}} formulates references on {{structure of}} both the 3 rd, and 4 valent vaccines against influenza applied worldwide. The purpose of work was the assessment of averted costs due to influenza vaccination with trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines in different age groups. Material and methods. The analysis {{was carried out by}} a modeling from a societal perspective taking into account epidemiological data on the Russian Federation. Results. According to data on structure of the allocated influenza viruses in the Russian Federation for 2006 - 2015, at vaccination coverage of 40 % of the population, replacement of trivalent vaccines with quadrivalent vaccines could prevent in addition during the season on average 604 <b>cases</b> of influenza <b>per</b> 100 <b>thousand</b> children aged up to 3 years, 736 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> 100 <b>thousand</b> children at the age of 3 – 6 years, 613 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> 100 <b>thousand</b> children aged from 7 up to 14 years, 106 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> 100 <b>thousand</b> citizens at the age of 15 – 64 years, 19 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> 100 <b>thousand</b> citizens at the age of 65 years and older. In the whole population replacement of trivalent vaccines with quadrivalent vaccines would allow to prevent during the season on average 181 <b>cases</b> of influenza <b>per</b> 100 <b>thousand</b> citizens in addition. The averted cost is the greatest at vaccination of children of preschool and school age. In general, the volume of the costs averted when replacing trivalent vaccines with quadrivalent vaccines against influenza could be increased for 2006 – 2015 on average by 15, 0 %, and during separate seasons this increasing could be more. Replacement of a trivalent vaccines with quadrivalent vaccines could cause decrease in number of cases of influenza during the season by 265, 8 thousand, and the costs averted could make 2, 498 billion rubles. Conclusions. Influenza vaccination with quadrivalent vaccines can increase clinical effectiveness and costs averted in comparison with trivalent vaccines. Replacement of trivalent vaccines with quadrivalent vaccines can be the most significant at vaccination of children of preschool and school age, and also in adults from risk groups and elderly people. Economic and clinical advantages of quadrivalent vaccines in comparison with the trivalent vaccines depend on a share in the general structure of a case rate of the strains of influenza B which aren’t relating to the line included in the trivalent vaccine. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Clinical malaria {{has proven}} an elusive burden to enumerate. Many cases go undetected by routine disease {{recording}} systems. Epidemiologists have, therefore, frequently defaulted to actively measuring malaria in population cohorts through time. Measuring the clinical incidence of malaria longitudinally is labour-intensive and impossible to undertake universally. There is a need, therefore, {{to define a}} relationship between clinical incidence and the easier and more commonly measured index of infection prevalence: the "parasite rate". This relationship can help provide an informed basis to define malaria burdens in areas where health statistics are inadequate. Methods Formal literature searches were conducted for Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence surveys undertaken prospectively through active case detection at least every 14 days. The data were abstracted, standardized and geo-referenced. Incidence surveys were time-space matched with modelled estimates of infection prevalence derived from a larger database of parasite prevalence surveys and modelling procedures developed for a global malaria endemicity map. Several potential relationships between clinical incidence and infection prevalence were then specified in a non-parametric Gaussian process model with minimal, biologically informed, prior constraints. Bayesian inference was then used {{to choose between the}} candidate models. Results The suggested relationships with credible intervals are shown for the Africa and a combined America and Central and South East Asia regions. In both regions clinical incidence increased slowly and smoothly as a function of infection prevalence. In Africa, when infection prevalence exceeded 40 %, clinical incidence reached a plateau of 500 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> of the population per annum. In the combined America and Central and South East Asia regions, this plateau was reached at 250 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> of the population per annum. A temporal volatility model was also incorporated to facilitate a closer description {{of the variance in the}} observed data. Conclusion It was possible to model a relationship between clinical incidence and P. falciparum infection prevalence but the best-fit models were very noisy reflecting the large variance within the observed opportunistic data sample. This continuous quantification allows for estimates of the clinical burden of P. falciparum of known confidence from wherever an estimate of P. falciparum prevalence is available. </p...|$|E

The objective of the {{research work}} was to study the prevalence and incidence, age-related structure of sarcoidosis. Materials and methods. Statistical data were obtained processing the medical records of 287 patients from Ivano-Frankivsk regional phthysio -pulmonary centre at the age of 18 years and older whose diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed either histologically or by means of helical computed tomography of thoracic organs. Results. The average incidence index was 3. 37 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> 100 <b>thousand</b> people, while the prevalence index was 14. 35 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> 100 <b>thousand</b> people. The highest indices were recorded in Kalush and Kolomyia districts, which are considered as the territories with increased anthropogenic load. The morbidity rate in the regions with well-developed woodworking industry was subaverage, though the incidence was considerably higher in males, who are actually engaged in this field of industry. The number of males and females diagnosed with sarcoidosis was identical in the regional centre and in Kalush district, while in Kolomyia district the incidence rate was higher among female population. The study found that the peak incidence in male population was at the age of 20 to 29 years, and females more often developed the disease at the age of 40 to 49 years. The most common comorbidities included the disorders of cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Conclusions. Geographic and ecological factors have a considerable influence on the incidence, prevalence and development of sarcoidosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Following the tsunami, a {{detailed}} {{overview of the}} area specific transmission levels is essential in assessing the risk of malaria in Sri Lanka. Recent information on vector insecticide resistance, parasite drug resistance, and insights into the national policy for malaria diagnosis and treatment are important in assisting national and international agencies in their control efforts. Methods Monthly records over the period January 1995 – October 2004 of confirmed malaria cases were used to perform an analysis of malaria distribution at district spatial resolution. Also, a focused review of published reports and routinely collected information was performed. Results The incidence of malaria was only 1 <b>case</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> population in the 10 {{months leading up to}} the disaster, in the districts with the highest transmission. Conclusion Although relocated people may be more exposed to mosquito bites, and their capacity to handle diseases affected, the environmental changes caused by the tsunami are unlikely to enhance breeding of the principal vector, and, given the present low parasite reservoir, the likelihood of a malaria outbreak is low. However, close monitoring of the situation is necessary, especially as December – February is normally the peak transmission season. Despite some losses, the Sri Lanka public health system is capable of dealing with the possible threat of a malaria outbreak after the tsunami. The influx of foreign medical assistance, drugs, and insecticides may interfere with malaria surveillance, and the long term malaria control strategy of Sri Lanka, if not in accordance with government policy. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{the last}} decade, active {{surveillance}} for {{transmissible spongiform encephalopathies}} in small ruminants has been intensive in Europe. In many countries {{this has led to}} the detection of cases of atypical scrapie which, unlike classical scrapie, might not be contagious. EU legislation requires, that following detection of a scrapie case, control measures including further testing take place in affected flocks, including the culling of genotype susceptible to classical scrapie. This might result in the detection of additional cases. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the occurrence of additional cases in flocks affected by atypical scrapie using surveillance data collected in Europe in order to ascertain whether atypical scrapie, is contagious. RESULTS: Questionnaires were used to collect, at national level, the results of active surveillance and testing associated with flock outbreaks in 12 European countries. The mean prevalence of atypical scrapie was 5. 5 (5. 0 - 6. 0) <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> ten <b>thousand</b> in abattoir surveillance and 8. 1 (7. 3 - 9. 0) <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> ten <b>thousand</b> in fallen stock. By using meta-analysis, on 11 out of the 12 countries, we found that the probability of detecting additional cases of atypical scrapie in positive flocks was similar to the probability observed in animals slaughtered for human consumption (odds ratio, OR = 1. 07, CI 95 %: 0. 70 - 1. 63) or among fallen stock (OR = 0. 78, CI 95 %: 0. 51 - 1. 2). In contrast, when comparing the two scrapie types, the probability of detecting additional cases in classical scrapie positive flocks was significantly higher than the probability of detecting additional cases in atypical scrapie positive flocks (OR = 32. 4, CI 95 %: 20. 7 - 50. 7). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that atypical scrapie is not contagious or has a very low transmissibility under natural conditions compared with classical scrapie. Furthermore this study stressed the importance of standardised data collection to make good use of the analyses undertaken by European countries in their efforts to control atypical and classical scrapi...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper by}} Vu Dinh Thiem et al. {{in this issue}} of the Journal {{provides}} valuable documentation of the costs for providing killed oral cholera vaccine during a mass-vaccination programme in Vietnam (1). Vietnam is the only country where cholera vaccine is now being given to endemic populations, although many other countries in Asia and Africa have regular seasonal outbreaks of cholera. This raises the question of defining the circumstances for using cholera vaccine in endemic areas. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended use of killed oral cholera vaccine in refugee populations of Africa (2), but it has not yet formulated a policy for use of either the live or killed oral vaccines in areas endemic for cholera (Chaignat C-L. Personal communication, 2003). There are several reasons why it has been difficult for WHO to formulate such a policy. The true burden of disease from cholera is not well-understood since many nations with cholera do not report it because of fears of restriction on trade and travel, and when they do, the numbers likely do not reflect the true rates of infection. Outbreaks or epidemics {{are more likely to be}} reported than cases occurring in endemic situations, and many endemic areas do not have the laboratory or epidemiological surveillance resources to document accurate rates. Since countries are not reporting cholera, it becomes difficult for WHO to recommend a vaccine for an infection that is not recognized to occur (3). However, many geographic areas continue to have a large burden of disease from cholera, often exceeding one hospital <b>case</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> annually. In these areas, cholera is well-known to the local population, they greatly fear it and would likely welcome a vaccine providing protection...|$|R

Epidemiological studies conducted in the general population have been able to examine more heterogeneous forms of this disorder than clinical studies, and have also been able to provide early estimations of population incidence and prevalence. Large differences in case identification procedures and sampling methods have led to considerable divergence in the rates of prevalence reported, which ranged from 1 % to 29 %. Suggested improvements in the definition of MCI have led to an upward adjustment of prevalence rates in most studies, giving between 5 % and 29 %. Incidence is estimated as 8 to 58 new <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> persons per year, and the probability of conversion from MCI to dementia is estimated at around 15 %. The principal risk factors that have been identified so far for MCI using regression models applied to general population data are age, education, race, medicated hypertension, infarcts, white matter lesions, depression, and apolipoprotein E 4 (AP 0 E- 4 J allele. An etiological model derived from these studies indicates possible intervention points for future therapeutic strategies at the level of both clinical intervention and environmental exposure. There is, however, a clear need for epidemiological studies that take into account a broader range of risk factors than those studied to date, which have focused principally on known risk factors for dementia...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed at}} {{determining}} peptic ulcer disease (PUD) incidence among {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) patients during 1998 – 2008, compared to patients without CKD, and at examining associations between CKD and PUD. Methods: Data for 1998 – 2008 were extracted from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The annual PUD incidence (<b>cases</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> persons per year) was calculated separately for patients with and without CKD. Characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed PUD (n = 16322) were compared to those of a control group without PUD (n = 32644). The 2 groups were matched for age, sex, and index year. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by logistic regression. Results: Over the 10 -year period, the PUD incidence was, 10 – 12 times higher in CKD patients than in those without CKD. Its incidence in elderly CKD patients increased rapidly over time. For CKD patients, most PUD events (. 95 %) were managed during hospitalization. Peptic ulcer risk, adjusted for all potential confounders, was much higher in CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis (adjusted OR, 9. 74; 95 % CI, 7. 11 – 13. 31). Maintenance hemodialysis patients were 2 {{times more likely to}} have gastric ulcers than duodenal ulcers, while CKD patients not on dialysis had similar risks for both. There were no significant interactions between medications and CKD status on the peptic ulcer risk. Unlike CKD patients on nonsteroidal anti...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{epidemiology}} {{of diabetes}} in elderly {{people is not}} well understood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate the incidence of diabetes mellitus among elderly people in Canada and the relative risks of death and admission to an institution among elderly diabetic patients. METHODS: The study was a secondary analysis of data for a community-dwelling sample from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, a nationwide representative cohort study of 9008 elderly people (65 years of age or older at baseline) in Canada. Diabetes was identified primarily by self-reporting, and a clinician's diagnosis and the presence of treatments for diabetes were used to identify diabetic patients who did not report that they had the condition. RESULTS: The reliability of self-reported diabetes (the kappa statistic) was 0. 85. The estimated annual incidence of diabetes was 8. 6 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> for elderly Canadians. Incidence decreased with age, from 9. 5 for subjects 65 - 74 years of age, to 7. 9 for those 75 - 84 years of age and then to 3. 1 for those 85 years of age and older. Diabetes was associated with death (relative risk 1. 87, 95 % confidence interval 1. 59 - 2. 19) and admission to an institution (relative risk 1. 58, 95 % confidence interval 1. 28 - 1. 94). INTERPRETATION: Diabetes mellitus is common among elderly people, but the incidence declines among the very old...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} decade, active {{surveillance}} for {{transmissible spongiform encephalopathies}} in small ruminants has been intensive in Europe. In many countries {{this has led to}} the detection of cases of atypical scrapie which, unlike classical scrapie, might not be contagious. EU legislation requires, that following detection of a scrapie case, control measures including further testing take place in affected flocks, including the culling of genotype susceptible to classical scrapie. This might result in the detection of additional cases. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the occurrence of additional cases in flocks affected by atypical scrapie using surveillance data collected in Europe in order to ascertain whether atypical scrapie, is contagious. Results Questionnaires were used to collect, at national level, the results of active surveillance and testing associated with flock outbreaks in 12 European countries. The mean prevalence of atypical scrapie was 5. 5 (5. 0 - 6. 0) <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> ten <b>thousand</b> in abattoir surveillance and 8. 1 (7. 3 - 9. 0) <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> ten <b>thousand</b> in fallen stock. By using meta-analysis, on 11 out of the 12 countries, we found that the probability of detecting additional cases of atypical scrapie in positive flocks was similar to the probability observed in animals slaughtered for human consumption (odds ratio, OR = 1. 07, CI 95 % : 0. 70 - 1. 63) or among fallen stock (OR = 0. 78, CI 95 % : 0. 51 - 1. 2). In contrast, when comparing the two scrapie types, the probability of detecting additional cases in classical scrapie positive flocks was significantly higher than the probability of detecting additional cases in atypical scrapie positive flocks (OR = 32. 4, CI 95 % : 20. 7 - 50. 7). Conclusions These results suggest that atypical scrapie is not contagious or has a very low transmissibility under natural conditions compared with classical scrapie. Furthermore this study stressed the importance of standardised data collection to make good use of the analyses undertaken by European countries in their efforts to control atypical and classical scrapie. </p...|$|R
50|$|GBS {{infections in}} newborns are {{separated}} into two clinical syndromes, early-onset disease (EOD) and late-onset disease (LOD). EOD manifests from 0 to 7 living {{days in the}} newborn, {{most of the cases}} of EOD being apparent within 24h of birth. The most common clinical syndromes of EOD are sepsis without apparent focus, pneumonia, and less frequently meningitis. EOD is acquired vertically (vertical transmission), through exposure of the fetus or the baby to GBS from the vagina of a colonized woman, either intrautero or during birth after rupture of membranes. Infants can be infected during passage through the birth canal, nevertheless newborns that acquire GBS through this route can become only colonized, and these colonized infants habitually do not develop EOD. Roughly 50% of newborns to GBS colonized mothers are also GBS colonized and (without prevention measures) 1-2% of these newborns will develop EOD. In the past, the incidence of EOD ranged from 0.7 to 3.7 <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> live births in the US and from 0.2 to 3.25 <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> in Europe. In 2008, after widespread use of antenatal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, the CDC reported an incidence of 0.28 <b>cases</b> of EOD <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> live births in the US.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the risk of dengue and sociodemographic variables through the use of spatial regression models fully Bayesian in the municipalities of Esp&# 237;rito Santo in 2010. METHOD: This is an ecological study and exploration that used spatial analysis tools in preparing thematic maps with data obtained from SinanNet. An analysis by area, taking as unit the municipalities of the state, was performed. Thematic maps were constructed by the computer program R 2. 15. 00 and Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), calculated in WinBugs, Absolut and Normalized Mean Error (NMAE) were the criteria used to compare the models. RESULTS: We were able to geocode 21, 933 dengue cases (rate of 623. 99 <b>cases</b> <b>per</b> 100 <b>thousand</b> habitants) with a higher incidence in the municipalities of Vit&# 243;ria, Serra and Colatina; model with spatial effect with the covariates trash and income showed the best performance at DIC and Nmae criteria. CONCLUSION: It was possible to identify the relationship of dengue with factors outside the health sector and to identify areas with higher risk of disease...|$|R
