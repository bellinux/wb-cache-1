50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>Progress</b> Analysis (CPA), also <b>called</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Progress</b> Detection (CPD), is {{a generic}} term for signal {{processing}} algorithms that operate on audio during call setup. The goal of CPA {{is to determine}} the nature of the callee or the outcome of call setup to an external network (traditional or IP). Specifically, when a call or session is being established, the caller or initiator is interested in knowing if someone answered, if the line is busy, etc. When the caller is an automated application, such as an automated dialer or message broadcasting system, CPA algorithms are used to perform the classification automatically.|$|R

50|$|A <b>call</b> <b>progress</b> tone is {{a pattern}} of audible tones played to the caller in a {{telephone}} call, conveying {{the status of the}} call. ToneScript describes the pattern of frequency, cadence, and level of the signal.
