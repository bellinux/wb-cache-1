50|$|In 1970, {{the company}} had 130 employees. In January 1973, Urschel Laboratories began {{operating}} its own stainless <b>steel</b> <b>casting</b> <b>foundry,</b> {{the first to be}} constructed in Porter County, Indiana. The foundry would manufacture parts for the company's machines. The company also announced the opening of Urschel International Limited, a London-based sales and warehousing office, with plans to ultimately expand across the entire European continent. At that time, {{the company had}} business dealings in 50 countries. On July 2, 1973, ground was broken for a 5000 sq ft advertising and marketing complex {{on the north side of}} the company's property, at a cost of $100,000.

40|$|The {{globalisation}} of trade, {{environment and}} technology requires a continuous improvement of all products in functionality and exact adaptation of materials {{to the conditions}} of use. Therefore the range of materials was increased and {{the race of the}} designers as well as the material suppliers in finding the best solution for new challenges is also a challenge for the <b>steel</b> <b>foundries.</b> This paper shows two examples of new <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> types and points out the aspects which are considered for research, development and for the introduction of newly developed <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> grades into commercial production. It also shows the technical and commercial issues that are very often denied {{for the benefit of the}} final product from the very beginning. One example is a <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> for offshore structures with high yield strength in low temperature application and good weldability. The second example is a new creep resistant <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> grade used in advanced steam power plants at higher temperatures and pressures for increase of efficiency and decrease of environmental pollution. No company or even industrial sector can afford the expensive development of new processes and materials. Therefore operators, manufacturers and material suppliers have to work together in a network of international projects which make the contribution of a single company effective for the benefit of all partners involved, also for competitors on the market. The role of <b>steel</b> <b>foundries</b> and the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> materials within this new type of competition of materials is an important part for being successful with the development of new or advanced processes and technologies. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a wet treatment {{process for the}} reclamation of exhaust sands coming out from different foundries and moulding procedures is evaluated in this technical note. The reclamation process foresees sequential phases of magnetic separation, wet attrition, screening. The produced sludges are thickened by means of chemical conditioners and mechanical dewatering. The process was tested on industrial scale on exhaust sands coming from different <b>cast</b> iron and <b>steel</b> <b>foundries,</b> considering both green sands and sands mixed with inorganic and organic binders. For each kind of sand, inflow and outflow {{in relation to the}} adopted reclamation treatment were characterized: the particle-size analysis and the determination of silica, loss on ignition, acid request, oolitic and some metals contents were performed. The characterization was also extended to a green sand sample coming from a thermal reclamation treatment, and to some bentonite and coal dust samples commonly employed in foundry processes. A final valuation of the process was performed keeping into account the obtained quality of recovered silica sands considering the foundry requirements and the economical end environmental aspects of the reclamation treatmen...|$|R

40|$|The data {{needed for}} quality {{control in the}} <b>steel</b> <b>casting</b> process is often {{difficult}} to obtain. This is especially true when referring to the surface quality of the part as it undergoes multiple inspections. A typical inspection involves identifying the location of anomalies and marking them for further processing in the cleaning room. Each time an inspector views a casting, information on the part surface quality is conveyed. This information however, is rarely available for analysis since it is recorded directly on the casting. A few foundries have attempted to collect this surface quality data (anomaly type, size, and location) as identified during inspection. Unfortunately, their data format is difficult to manage and has limited analysis opportunities. This paper presents a software program which removes the problems associated with current attempts at data collection. The program provides an easy to use interface for recording anomaly type and location directly on a 3 D CAD model. Analysis modules designed for this data include histograms, frequency plots, area calculations, correlations, and principal component analysis (flaw pattern recognition). A case study for collecting and analyzing real data from a <b>steel</b> <b>casting</b> <b>foundry</b> was completed using this program.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the program was}} to optimize refractory materials and foundry processing used in <b>casting</b> <b>steel.</b> This objective was to be met by completing the following: (1) Surveying the <b>steel</b> <b>foundries</b> both through paper/electronic surveys sent to North American <b>steel</b> <b>foundries</b> as well as plant visits to participants. Information concerning refractory selection and performance as well as refractory and steelmaking practices provides a baseline for future comparison and to identify opportunities for substantial improvement in energy efficiency. (2) Conducting post-mortem analysis of materials from existing refractory/steelmaking practices to determine wear/failure mechanisms. (3) Identify areas for research on developing refractories for use in <b>steel</b> <b>foundry</b> furnaces, adjusting steelmaking practices to improve efficiency and modifying slag practices to improve refractory performance. The {{overall objective}} of the <b>steel</b> <b>foundry</b> refractory lining optimization program was to review established refractory and steelmaking practices to identify opportunities for improvements that would yield substantial energy savings for <b>steel</b> <b>foundries.</b> Energy savings were expected to arise from improved efficiency of the electric arc furnaces and from reductions in the post-casting welding and grinding that are normally required. Ancillary energy savings related to a reduction in the amount of refractories currently produced {{to meet the needs of}} the <b>steel</b> <b>foundry</b> industry, and a shift from pre-fired materials (shaped refractories) to monolithic refractories that are heat treated ''in situ'' were anticipated. A review of the complete program results indicates that techniques for achieving the overall goal were demonstrated. The main difference between the predicted and the actual achievements relates to the areas from which actual energy savings could be realized. Although reductions in furnace tap temperature would result in a reduction in the power required for melting, such reductions are realized through changes within the ladle transfer portion of the process, through modified ladle pre-heat and refractory insulation. Reductions in clean room energy usage proved very difficult to track, and some questions as to just how much impact refractory related inclusions have on the degree of welding and grinding required for completion of a casting, remain. Post-mortem analysis of casting defects did identify refractory derived inclusions but the greatest concentration of inclusions related to steel reoxidation issue. In almost every instance, the suggested refractory/process modifications were proven to be both technically and economically feasible. The difficulty in implementation of the proposed changes relates to the ''up front'' expense and the learning curve associated with any process modification. These two issues were compounded by production slow downs that are too common in the current market. Such slow downs normally result in less energy efficient processing coupled with reductions in capital or ''up front'' expenditures. A return to historical norms should allow foundries to implement the suggested modifications and then evaluate the overall benefit...|$|R
