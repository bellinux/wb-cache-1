5|$|Several {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the number of LIMs on the Robin tower. From opening day to 2004, Robin operated with 7 LIMs {{on each side of the}} track. Before the 2004 season, 3 LIMs were taken off on both sides of the Robin tower, leaving 4 LIMs per side. Then two more LIMs were taken off (one per side) the Robin side's tower, leaving three per side before the 2005 season began. A few weeks after the <b>Chiller</b> re-opened in 2007, two more LIMs were added back to the tower, bringing the total back to 4 per side.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air <b>chiller</b> for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E

40|$|Dormancy is {{commonly}} separated into a rest period, when the buds remain dormant due to growth-arresting physiological conditions, and a quiescent period, when the buds remain dormant due to unfavourable environmental conditions. A sequential model predicting {{the number of}} days during dormancy based on accumulation of <b>chill</b> days during rest and anti-chill days during quiescence is described. <b>Chill</b> days and anti-chill days are calculated using the single triangle method to estimate degree days relative to a threshold temperature. The temperature threshold for calculating the <b>chill</b> and anti-chill days and the <b>chilling</b> requirement to determine when rest is broken are found by trial and error to minimize the root mean square error of predicted and observed bud-burst dates. Using several years of weather and phenological data for cherry, pear, kiwifruit and olive orchards and nine forest species from locations in Sardinia, Italy, the <b>Chill</b> days model performed better than four classical <b>chill</b> unit models and two <b>chilling</b> hour models. The classical <b>chill</b> unit and <b>chilling</b> hour models failed to predict bud-burst in some years depending on the species and climate, whereas the <b>Chill</b> days model always gave good results. The classical <b>chill</b> unit and <b>chilling</b> hour models start to accumulate <b>chilling</b> when temperatures fall below the threshold in autumn, whereas the <b>Chill</b> days model begins to accumulate <b>chilling</b> at a phenological stage (i. e. leaf fall or harvest). Moreover, the classical <b>chill</b> unit and <b>chilling</b> hour models do not separate dormancy into rest and quiescent periods. These factors may partially explain the better performance of the <b>Chill</b> days model. When compared with the null model (using the mean calenda...|$|R
40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} climate change on fruit production in Germany, this study aimed at determining long-term trends in winter <b>chill,</b> as calculated with the <b>Chilling</b> Hours and Dynamic Models (<b>Chill</b> Portions). An idealized daily temperature curve was used to convert daily temperature records from 43 weather stations, taken throughout the twentieth and late nineteenth centuries, into an hourly dataset, which was then converted to units of winter <b>chill.</b> Besides exposing temporal trends in winter <b>chill,</b> the data could be spatially interpolated, yielding contiguous maps of typical winter <b>chill</b> in Germany around 2010, as well as <b>chilling</b> losses since 1950. Throughout Germany, winter <b>chill</b> varied between 1700 and 3000 <b>Chilling</b> Hours or 125 and 150 <b>Chill</b> Portions. The areas of highest winter <b>chill</b> were located in the northern parts of the country. For the whole of Germany, there were no significant temporal trends. The extent of interregional variation in winter <b>chill</b> depended on the <b>chilling</b> model used. While the <b>Chilling</b> Hours Model showed strong declines in winter <b>chill</b> for the areas around Dresden and Leipzig, {{as well as for the}} Lake Constance region, the Dynamic Model did not detect such dramatic changes. More than a decline in winter <b>chill,</b> increased heat during the winter months might become a challenge to German fruit growers.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} {{a surface}} modification technique {{to evaluate the}} mechanical properties like hardness and sliding wear resistance of cast Iron surface used in engineering. Basic sand casting mold was used and a portion of {{it was designed to}} accommodate the external mild steel <b>chill</b> (MSC). <b>Chill</b> accelerates the cooling rate of molten metal which leads to directional solidification. Cooling rate is directly proportional to formation of carbides in the form of iron carbide (Fe 3 C) near the <b>chill</b> end By controlling the flow of liquid nitrogen, the temperature of <b>chills</b> was reduced (upto - 100 °C).

The present work provides the effective <b>chilling</b> thickness, which gives higher hardness near the <b>chilled</b> surface and a fairly appreciable hardness conducive for a specific wear functional requirement.

25|$|Although {{there are}} {{similarities}} between adsorption chillers and absorption refrigeration, {{the former is}} based on the interaction between gases and solids. The adsorption chamber of the <b>chiller</b> is filled with a solid material (for example zeolite, silica gel, alumina, active carbon or certain types of metal salts), which in its neutral state has adsorbed the refrigerant. When heated, the solid desorbs (releases) refrigerant vapour, which subsequently is cooled and liquefied. This liquid refrigerant then provides a cooling effect at the evaporator from its enthalpy of vaporization. In the final stage the refrigerant vapour is (re)adsorbed into the solid. As an adsorption <b>chiller</b> requires no compressor, it is relatively quiet.|$|E

25|$|HVAC use of {{a cooling}} tower pairs the cooling tower with a {{water-cooled}} <b>chiller</b> or water-cooled condenser.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare two <b>chilling</b> methods, {{combined}} (aerosol) and water <b>chilling,</b> {{in terms of their}} effectiveness in <b>chilling</b> of different weight categories of broiler chickens. At the same time microbial associations of different weight categories of broiler chickens were evaluated. Samples were collected in an approved establishment and poultry carcasses were divided according to weight and <b>chilling</b> methods into five categories. The first four categories were <b>chilled</b> using combined <b>chilling</b> method and fifth category was <b>chilled</b> with water. The temperature of the breast muscle before and after <b>chilling</b> and microbiological parameters (total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella) was measured. By comparing the temperature of the breast muscle after combined <b>chilling</b> method was not achieved in the breast muscles temperature below 4 °C in all weight categories. In any case, the lowest average temperature has been reached in the weight category < 1. 2 kg (4. 9 °C) and with increasing weight, the average temperature was rising, and the highest was in weight category 1. 8 to 2. 5 kg (10. 8 °C). Poultry carcasses were subsequently divided into portions and after cutting were <b>chilled</b> up to a temperature below 4 °C. In poultry carcasses <b>chilled</b> by water, the average temperature of the breast muscle after 20 minutes in the water bath was even higher (19. 6 °C) compared to combine <b>chilling.</b> Thus <b>chilled</b> poultry carcasses were frozen up to - 18 °C in a core of muscles. Comparing the microbiological contamination in different weight categories and <b>chilling</b> techniques, we found that the lowest total viable count (TVC) before and after <b>chilling</b> was in the lowest category and the difference before <b>chilling</b> was significantly lower comparing with all other categories.
