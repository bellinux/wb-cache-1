Also they were asked {{if they were going to}} do the second leg of The Mighty Death Pop! Tour, and they said that they will go on tour in 2014 but it won't be called The Mighty Death Pop! Tour. During an interview in March 2014 DJ Paul of Da Mafia 6ix announced that they will be doing a collaboration album with Insane Clown Posse, and will tour to promote the album. In June 2014 Psychopathic Records announced that Insane Clown Posse and Da Mafia 6ix were working on a collaboration album, and Insane Clown Posse posted pictures on their official instagram page of them and Da Mafia 6ix sitting around in Violent J's home studio. The album is scheduled to be released sometime in August 2014. A few days after Faygoluvers.net conducted the interview with Insane Clown Posse, Psychopathic Records, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie released a picture of the Dark Lotus hand sign stating that all original members (Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid & Blaze Ya Dead Homie) were going to be back in the studio recording a new studio album on all their media outlets. Under the hand sign were Roman numerals translating to (7-29-2014). The album will initially be released at the 2014 GOTJ (7/23/2014 - 7/27/2014). In June 2014 Insane Clown Posse announced that they will be releasing their first box set The First Six with all first six Joker Cards (Carnival of Carnage, Ringmaster, Riddle Box, The Great Milenko, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, /), along with a <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> signed by Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope, 6 tarot cards, and an 8-song EP of all new music titled House of Wax, that will be released on October 28, 2014. In a July 6, 2014 interview Faygoluvers.net conducted with Jumpsteady, he stated that Psychopathic is currently working with some new supergroups. At the 2014 GOTJ during Anybody Killa's seminar, it was announced that he and Big Hoodoo have created a new group called The Have Nots. Insane Clown Posse have composed a group with Da Mafia 6ix called The Killjoy Club, and will be releasing their debut album titled Reindeer Games on September 2, 2014. ICP, DM6, Madchild, Jelly Roll and Mushroom Head plus others are to go on tour possibly titled [...] "ShockFest" [...] which will run from September 18, 2014 - October 31, 2014. ICP finally announced that they will release a Psypher featuring artists that are not signed to Psychopathic Records sometime before Hallowicked, including Madchild. Also announced Otis of AMB and DJ Paul will both release solo albums on Psychopathic records in 2015. On August 5, 2014 ICP released a promo flyer for their upcoming tour titled [...] "ShockFest" [...] with Da Mafia 6ix, Mushroomhead, Madchild and Jelly Roll from September 30, 2014 through October 31, 2014. The tour was originally scheduled to be a 45-date tour, and scheduled to kick off on September 18, 2014, but due to Madchild performing in Australia with his group Swollen Members for a mini tour until September 27, 2014, the tour will now kick off on September 30, 2014 Columbus, Ohio, and will conclude on ICP's 21st annual Hallowicked concert on October 31, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. Psychopathic Records released a video promo for [...] "ShockFest" [...] in early August 2014. The tour is now scheduled to run from September 25, 2014, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and will conclude on October 31, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. In the booklet released with the Reindeer Games album were four flyers in promotion of new albums. The first was for Insane Clown Posse, it said that the 3rd Joker Card in the 2nd Deck will be released [...] "sooner than you think". The second was for Otis, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Slaughter and it said that it too will be released [...] "soon". The third was for DJ Paul, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Master Of Evil and it said that it too will be released [...] "soon". The fourth was for Da Mafia 6ix, it was for their upcoming album titled [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] which will be released on October 31, 2014, not on Psychopathic Records. In early October 2014 it was announced that [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] will be pushed back to a 2015 release creating speculation that Psychopathic will release the album. Instead DM6 will release a mixxtape titled Hear Some Evil in October 2014. The First Six was initially scheduled to be released on October 28, 2014, but after a minor setback it is now scheduled to be released on November 25, 2014. At the 2014 20th Hallowicked Anniversary, ICP revealed the 3rd Joker Card in the 2nd Deck which is broken up into two parts, [...] which will be released on Violent J's 43rd bday, April 28, 2015, and [...] will be released July 28, 2014. On December 6, 2014, at the show in Topeka, Kansas, Tha Hav Knots a group composed of Anybody Killa and Big Hoodoo released their first-ever debut track titled [...] "Happy Wicked Holiday", a Christmas-themed single. During ABK's set during the tour they opened with their first official song titled [...] "Don't Stop", no studio version of the song has been released, and ended with [...] "Happy Wicked Holiday".|$|E

40|$|Abstract Erythrina × neillii Mabberley & Lorence, Fabaceae, is {{a sterile}} hybrid between E. herbacea L. and E. humeana Spreng. Nothing was traced about its genetic, macro and micromorphology. Therefore, it was deemed of {{interest}} to study its botanical characters, {{in addition to the}} DNA fingerprint to help in the identification of the plant. The anatomical characters of the old stem and its bark are characterized by the presence of cork cells, bast fibers and sclereids. Pericycle is sclerenchymatous forming crystal sheath. The epidermises of the leaf and young stem are characterized by the presence of anomocytic and paracytic stomata, non-glandular, unicellular and multicellular two armed hairs, and glandular club shaped hair. Calcium oxalate is present in the form of crystal sheath and prisms. Secretory cavities are distributed in the phloem and cortex. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used as one of the molecular methods to differentiate between the samples of Erythrina. The DNA of Erythrina was extracted and analyzed using seven-mer random primers. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA were recognized. This characterization allows <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> Erythrina × neillii, in order to provide quality control for the plant...|$|R

40|$|Authenticity in agriculture, {{food and}} {{resource}} markets {{has been an}} ongoing policy challenge to regulators and food industries, and a major concern to consumers given the complex nature of global food supply chains and the increasing spate of market fraud reports across the world. In a bid to boost their economic return, some firms may engage in illicit activities that comprise authenticity including: adulteration, substitution of substandard products, unapproved enhancements of food products, false and misleading quality claims. Such actions, often times, create negative reputation externalities for other agri-food firms in the sector, and may also result in trade conflicts and border rejections; while consumers incur transaction (search) costs in verifying product attributes due to quality uncertainty. This dissertation focuses on collective reputation and contributes {{to an understanding of}} authenticity issues in agri-food and resource markets. The analysis examines the role of industry-led quality assurance systems and evolving technologies in enhancing authenticity signals and reducing information asymmetry in the context of market fraud and collective reputation within food and resource supply chains. This dissertation consists of three papers. Paper 1 examines technological solutions to authenticity issues in the context of international trade. The paper explores the role of an emerging authenticity technology, International Barcode of Life (IBOL) in strengthening the enforcement of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES). The focus of the analysis is CITES restrictions on commercial trade in the endangered species tree of Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra). The first paper provides an overview of the applications of the IBOL technology in species identification to date. A graphical partial equilibrium trade model examines three scenarios consisting of adoption of IBOL authenticity technology by a single major importing country, multilateral adoption, and adoption by the exporting country. The scenarios suggest that a threat of multilateral testing for the authenticity of imported rosewood could eliminate cross border commercial trade in the endangered species. Upstream testing and <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> in the exporting country could increase importers’ confidence and the demand for legally harvested rosewood. The results suggest that technological solutions to authenticity issues in international markets have the potential to reduce quality uncertainty and could act as a complement to regulatory enforcement under CITES. Paper 2 explores the industry-led Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) quality assurance system for Canadian wines to examine how an industry seeks to signal authenticity assurances to protect its collective reputation. Hedonic and Probit models are estimated using data on wine attributes sourced from the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO). Hedonic models examine whether VQA certification, versus other collective and individual reputation signals (region, winery), elicits a price premium. The Probit analysis examines factors that determine a winery’s decision to seek VQA certification for a specific wine. The results suggest that while a number of attributes including VQA certification, percentage alcohol content, sweetness (sugar level), volume of wine supplied and vintage, have a significant influence on the price of wine, VQA adds a premium beyond other signals of reputation (winery and region). The magnitude of the effect of individual and collective reputation on the price of wine differs for the different types/colours of wine. The Probit model results suggest that wineries that supply large volumes of wine (more than 1000 cases) in Ontario and produce icewine and non-blended wines have a higher tendency of seeking VQA status. The results imply that VQA {{could be used as a}} shorthand for quality, while premium and reputation driven by authenticity in the wine industry could serve as an incentive for other agri-food industries to establish similar quality assurance systems. Paper 3 examines the incidence of mislabelling and substitution in fish markets using supply, demand and welfare analysis. The paper focuses on incentives for the private sector (retailers) or a third party to adopt IBOL technology to protect their reputation and for supply chain monitoring. The feasibility of IBOL technology for a typical retail store in Canada is assessed using a simple simulation analysis. The analysis suggests that the costs of switching to the IBOL system, the number of retailers already using the technology and their market shares are likely to influence a retailer’s adoption of the technology. The ease of catching cheaters along the fish supply chain through third party monitoring is expected to depend on the accuracy of the technology in detecting fraud, the sampling frequency (rate) and rate of species substitution; while enforcement of legal penalties and other costs would serve as a disincentive to cheat as these costs negatively affect expected profit. The simulation analysis suggests that presently IBOL technology appears to be feasible for a typical retail store in Canada if testing is done in an external facility, but may not be feasible if fixed and other costs associated with the IBOL system are considered. The paper suggests that reducing the size of the technology to a hand-held tool and coordination of small scale retailers are potential ways to make the technology affordable and expand its use...|$|E

This paper argues that the strong stance on Messianic Jewish authenticity in this community is facilitated by the employment of the evaluative grammar <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> within a model of reality strongly influenced by the eschatology and epistemology of American Christian fundamentalism. The indexical underpinnings of the cosmos within this model of reality make it logical to conceive of the Messianic Jewish movement as a unique manifestation of authentic biblical religion. This mode <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> is briefly compared to that reflected in the discourse of critics <b>of</b> Messianic Jewish <b>authenticity</b> who tend to employ this evaluative grammar within a more natural/ historical model of reality. This ethnographic example is useful for exploring {{some of the basic}} contours <b>of</b> conflicts over <b>authenticity,</b> including how the value-laden domains of knowledge and agency are implicated in these conflicts.

The self-discovery conception <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> is based on a problematic conception of a static, real inner self. The notion of self-creation, although more plausible, blurs the distinction between identity and autonomy. Moreover, both conceptions are overly individualistic and fail sufficiently to account for the relational constitution of personal identity. The authors propose that a relational, narrative understanding of identity and autonomy can incorporate the more plausible aspects of both interpretations <b>of</b> <b>authenticity,</b> while providing a normatively more illuminating theoretical framework for approaching the question of whether and how neurotechnologies threaten identity. 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In philosophy, {{authenticity}} {{has been}} used with two meanings: one entails the notion of correspondence; the other entails the notion of genesis (Cooper, 1983 : 15). As in certain branches of philosophy, language teaching has perhaps clung too long to {{the first of these}} notions <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> {{at the expense of the}} other. This paper reviews four key conceptualisations <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> which have emerged in the field of applied linguistics: text <b>authenticity,</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> language competence, learner authenticity and classroom <b>authenticity.</b> If any <b>of</b> these types <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> is couched exclusively in terms of one usage or the other, it can lead to an impoverishment and objectification of the experience of language learning. Text authenticity can lead to a poverty <b>of</b> language; <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> competence can lead to a poverty <b>of</b> performance; learner <b>authenticity</b> can lead to a poverty <b>of</b> interpretation; classroom <b>authenticity</b> can lead to a poverty of communication. This paper proposes that a pedagogy of intercultural communication be informed by a more hybrid view <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> as a process of subjectification, derived from the Heideggerian concept of self-concern. doi: 10. 2167 /laic 252. ...|$|R

For instance, the philosophers Jean Paul Sartre and Theodor Adorno had opposing views regarding jazz, with Sartre considering it authentic and Adorno inauthentic. The concept <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> is often aired in musical subcultures, such as punk rock and heavy metal, where a purported lack <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> is commonly labeled with the epithet [...] "poseur". There {{is also a}} focus on authenticity in music genres such as [...] "...house, grunge, garage, hip-hop, techno, and showtunes".|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} commodification of cultural heritage induced by tourism development, {{the perception of}} a ‘real’ travel experience often depends on what is defined as authentic, original and local. Visitors are becoming increasingly concerned about the <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> eco-cultural tourism practices when they visit culturally and environmentally remote regions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the role performance plays in visitors' perception <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> eco-cultural tourism experiences. Various theoretical foundations and aspects of visitors' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> in cultural heritage tourism are considered. A grounded theory approach based on in-depth semi-structured interviews with several categories of visitors including 25 clients from two eco-tours in South and Central Kazakhstan and 29 Free Independent Travellers (FITs) was adopted to identify visitors' perception <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> various aspects of their tourism experiences and the attributes of the visitors' performative aspects of their travels. Results reveal that the performative aspects contributing to the perceived <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> the visitors' eco-cultural experiences are spontaneous, existential and reciprocal relationships with their hosts in intimate tourism encounters. The findings contribute to literature regarding authenticity and cultural heritage tourism by exploring new directions in which to apply the concept <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> in eco-cultural tourism experiences and by theorising the link between performance-based touristic space and the perception <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> This space becomes a basis for interaction and social exchange within the host–guest relationship...|$|R

Three wine farms in the Cape Winelands cultural landscape, a proposed serial World Heritage Site, have been studied.

40|$|We {{argue that}} the value <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> does not explain the value of self-knowledge. There are a {{plurality}} of species of authenticity; {{in this paper we}} consider four species: avoiding pretense (section 2), Frankfurtian wholeheartedness (section 3), existential self-knowledge (section 4), and spontaneity (section 5). Our thesis is that, for each of these species, the value of (that species <b>of)</b> <b>authenticity</b> does not (partially) explain the value of self-knowledge. Moreover, when it comes to spontaneity, the value of (that species <b>of)</b> <b>authenticity</b> conflicts with the value of self-knowledg...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen the {{development}} of a post-colonial museum praxis in which research and authority is shared between indigenous people and museums. With these new developments suggestions of collection management en restoration possibilities have made questions <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> within these ethnographic objects necessary. Authenticity is a concept which cannot be limited to several criteria, since questions concerning <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> objects van only be answered within their own cultural context. Developed definitions <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> are culture specific, and the application of western notions <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> to ethnographic objects poses difficulties. Since there is not one definition <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> which can be applied to ethnographic objects, research must be performed on an object per object basis, which makes this kind of research a costly one. This is emphasised by several museum professionals who have practical experience with these questions from a museum context. They emphasised the importance of cultural background and open communication with indigenous people in discovering the <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> collections and planning for future management. Questions <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> can only arise when there is the possibility that there is inauthenticity. Those inauthentic objects were at first thought to be hybrid objects; objects made within indigenous culture but using materials external to that society. The interviewed disagreed and stressed the importance of these objects in the understanding of contact between indigenous communities and cultural change within this modern world. Application of both the theories <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> and the opinions of the interviewed to two case-studies confirmed the difficulties of the concept <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> within ethnographic objects. From the case-studies {{it became clear that the}} objects could not be considered authentic on the criteria presented by Lowenthal in 1992. Although the concept <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> context seemed to provide the best opportunities, it still did not consider the fact that in modern museum practice indigenous communities reengage with their ancestral objects in museum collections. This makes clear that for application to ethnographic objects new considerations <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> are necessary. 	As Gustaaf Verswijver stated during the interview, if indigenous people consider an object as authentic within their own cultural context, this view should not be contested within a museum context. The application of concepts and theories <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> to museum is a complex matter, but studies which are focussed on this topic will enrich not only knowledge about collections but also might be used to strengthen bonds between museums and source communities. Therefore it should be more common in museums to research all aspects <b>of</b> their collections <b>authenticity...</b>|$|R
