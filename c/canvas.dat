5|$|At 3:21 of the 1st round, after Wanderlei flurried {{and missed}} a punch {{with his right}} hand, Jackson countered with a left hook on Silva's jaw, sending the latter on to the <b>canvas</b> and {{rendering}} him unconscious. Jackson followed with three punches to Silva's head on the ground, two of which occurred after referee Yves Lavigne attempted to halt the contest. Wanderlei remained on the <b>canvas</b> for several moments, but appeared to be OK {{as he left the}} cage under his own power.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>canvas</b> {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with <b>canvas</b> made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Makinti's works, {{including}} her Clemenger Award and NATSIAA paintings, are created with synthetic polymer on linen or <b>canvas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sabrina (Chaplin) {{walks down}} the stairs, and Ray puts the {{painting}} back and hides. Sabrina turns down Gerald's music to watch EastEnders. Gerald returns, sitting away from Sabrina. He turns up his music and the pair fight over the television remote, before leaving through the patio door and arguing, though their voices are muffled. Ray cuts away the <b>canvas</b> and replaces it with kitchen roll. When Sabrina reenters, she unknowingly stands on the <b>canvas.</b> Kim picks it up, mistaking it for laundry, and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs. Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something into his eyes. Ray knocks out Kim and sees the <b>canvas</b> in a laundry basket, which is sent up a laundry chute. He runs upstairs, while Gerald remains outside.|$|E
5|$|The panels were {{laterally}} divided so {{that both}} sides could be displayed simultaneously, {{and a number of}} the panels were transferred to <b>canvas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Art Connections {{underwent}} a complete renovation in 2004. Most {{of the work}} went into installing new, high-tech activities, including a virtual <b>canvas</b> powered by a laser-light paintbrush and a room that turns dancers' shadows into art on the wall.|$|E
5|$|By 1918 the two {{surviving}} Invincibles {{carried a}} Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on flying-off ramps fitted {{on top of}} 'P' and 'Q' turrets. Each platform had a <b>canvas</b> hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} six years, the {{large-scale}} projections for Enlighten were coordinated by Electric <b>Canvas.</b> Electric Canvas's managing director Peter Milne has also {{worked on the}} 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games.|$|E
5|$|His {{death is}} also {{depicted}} in paintings. It {{is the subject}} of an eighteenth-century oil on <b>canvas</b> by Joseph-Benoît Suvée and a work by the eighteenth-century Irish painter James Barry.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Nationalmuseum {{bought the}} {{painting}} from the collector ordered a frame for stretching the <b>canvas</b> from Per Målare, a carpenter in Gagnef, Dalarna, and installed it permanently where Carl Larsson had intended it to be.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting {{would soon be}} beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement <b>canvas</b> to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore {{the surface of the}} painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of <b>canvas</b> was added {{to the back of the}} painting, and the three layers were glued together.|$|E
5|$|Irving Blum {{made the}} {{original}} thirty-two canvases {{available to the}} public through an arrangement with the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC by placing them on permanent loan two days before Warhol's death. However, the original Campbell's Soup Cans is now a part of the Museum of Modern Art permanent collection. A print called Campbell's Soup Cans II is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 200 Campbell's Soup Cans, 1962 (Acrylic on <b>canvas,</b> 72inches x 100inches), in the private collection of John and Kimiko Powers is the largest single <b>canvas</b> of the Campbell's Soup can paintings. It is composed of ten rows and twenty columns of numerous flavors of soups. Experts point to it {{as one of the most}} significant works of pop art both as a pop representation and as conjunction with immediate predecessors such as Jasper Johns and the successors movements of Minimal and Conceptual art. The very similar 100 Cans from the Albright-Knox Art Gallery collection is shown above. The earliest soup can painting seems to be Campbell's Soup Can (Tomato Rice), a 1960 ink, tempera, crayon, and oil <b>canvas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jackson Pollock's drip {{painting}} {{style has}} a definite fractal dimension; among {{the artists who}} may have influenced Pollock's controlled chaos, Max Ernst painted Lissajous figures directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a <b>canvas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} figures depicted, five are looking {{directly}} {{out at the}} royal couple or the viewer. Their glances, along with the king and queen's reflection, affirm the royal couple's presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians H. W. Janson and Joel Snyder suggest {{that the image of}} the king and queen is a reflection from Velázquez's <b>canvas,</b> the front of which is obscured from the viewer. Other writers say the <b>canvas</b> Velázquez is painting is unusually large for a portrait by Velázquez, and is about the same size as Las Meninas. Las Meninas contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by Velázquez.|$|E

25|$|Inside {{the jacket}} of a suit, between the outer fabric {{and the inner}} lining, there is a layer of sturdy {{interfacing}} fabric to prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the <b>canvas</b> after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a floating <b>canvas,</b> while cheaply manufactured models have a fused (glued) <b>canvas.</b> A fused <b>canvas</b> is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the suppleness and durability of the jacket, so many tailors are quick to deride fused <b>canvas</b> as being less durable, particularly since they may tend to permanently pucker along the jacket's edges after some use or a few dry cleanings. However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small. A few London tailors state that all bespoke suits should use a floating <b>canvas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{technique}} {{is that of}} <b>canvas</b> collage, which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted <b>canvas</b> patches {{to the surface of}} a painting's main <b>canvas.</b> Well known for use of this {{technique is}} British artist John Walker in his paintings of the late 1970s, but <b>canvas</b> collage was already {{an integral part of the}} mixed media works of such American artists as Conrad Marca-Relli and Jane Frank by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical Lee Krasner also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.|$|E

25|$|In later paintings, Kelly {{distilled}} {{his palette}} and introduced new forms. In each work, {{he started with}} a rectangular <b>canvas</b> which he carefully painted with many coats of white paint; a shaped <b>canvas,</b> mostly painted black, is placed on top.|$|E

25|$|The PWS-6 was a {{two-seater}} biplane of {{a wooden}} construction. A fuselage, oval in cross-section, was covered with <b>canvas</b> skin on a wooden frame, except the engine part, which was covered with aluminium sheets. The wings were two-spar, two-section, rectangular with rounded tips, covered with <b>canvas</b> and plywood (in front). Lower and upper wings halves had the same dimensions, therefore the upper wing had smaller span, lacking a central section. The upper wing was staggered forward, and connected with a lower wing by N-shaped struts and a slanted transverse strut, without wires. The empennage was of wooden construction, <b>canvas</b> covered.|$|E

25|$|The {{church of}} Sant'Ignazio {{remained}} unfinished with bare ceilings even after its consecration in 1642. Disputes {{with the original}} donors, the Ludovisi, prevented {{the completion of the}} planned dome. Pozzo expediently proposed to make an illusionistic dome, when viewed from inside, by painting on <b>canvas.</b> It was impressive to viewers, but controversial; some feared the <b>canvas</b> would soon darken.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s {{he started}} working with irregularly angled canvases. Yellow Piece (1966), the artist’s first shaped <b>canvas,</b> {{represents}} Kelly’s pivotal break with the rectangular support and his redefinition of painting’s figure/ground relationship. With its curved corners and single, all-encompassing color, the <b>canvas</b> itself becomes the composition, transforming the wall behind it into the picture’s ground.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Wilson Foundation {{made use}} of {{newspaper}} advertising and planned a fundraising <b>canvas</b> in connection with its January 1922 endowment drive. Rather than a door-to-door drive, this <b>canvas</b> {{seems to have taken}} the form of volunteers from various organizations, frequently women, operating fundraising tables at banks, drug stores, and other well-trafficked places.|$|E
25|$|In 19th century Russia and Scandinavia, pigs {{were used}} as decoys and were transported in strong <b>canvas</b> sacks on horse-drawn sleighs. The pigs, kept in the <b>canvas</b> bags, were made to squeal {{in order to attract}} the wolves. Hunters would wait at a {{distance}} to shoot the wolves when they came out after the pig. Once the wolves arrived, the hunters would either shoot them or retrieve the pig and <b>canvas</b> bag. In the latter case, they took off down the road, luring the wolves behind. The wolves would be led to a palisade, where they would be trapped and shot.|$|E
