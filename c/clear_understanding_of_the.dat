5|$|The {{concept of}} writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje {{in the form}} of {{classical}} Chinese books likely written on paper and {{in the form of}} manuscript rolls (kansubon). This probably happened {{at the beginning of the}} 5th century (around 400), and certainly during the 6th century. According to legend the scholar Wani introduced the Chinese writing system as well as Confucianism to Japan. The oldest texts of Japanese origin, which show a <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept of writing, date to the 5th century and are—like most texts from before 700—inscriptions on stone or metal.|$|E

This serious criticism has been absorbed by later transpersonal theory, which has been more willing to reflect on these important dimensions of human existence.|$|E

25|$|The Founding Father who {{perhaps most}} studied and valued Machiavelli as a {{political}} philosopher was John Adams, who profusely commented on the Italian's thought in his work, A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America. In this work, John Adams praised Machiavelli, with Algernon Sidney and Montesquieu, as a philosophic defender of mixed government. For Adams, Machiavelli restored empirical reason to politics, while his analysis of factions was commendable. Adams likewise agreed with the Florentine that human nature was immutable and driven by passions. He also accepted Machiavelli's belief that all societies were subject to cyclical periods of growth and decay. For Adams, Machiavelli lacked only a <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institutions necessary for good government.|$|E

25|$|While glacier {{variations}} {{are likely}} to have minimal effects upon global climate, their recession may have contributed one third to one half of the observed 20th Century rise in sea level (Meier 1984; IPCC 1996). Furthermore, it is extremely likely that such extensive glacier recession as is currently observed in the Western Cordillera of North America, where runoff from glacierized basins is used for irrigation and hydropower, involves significant hydrological and ecosystem impacts. Effective water-resource planning and impact mitigation in such areas depends upon developing a sophisticated knowledge of the status of glacier ice and the mechanisms that cause it to change. Furthermore, a <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms at work is crucial to interpreting the global-change signals that are contained in the time series of glacier mass balance records.|$|E

2500|$|The last {{argument}} {{she considered}} was that Congress had intended the 1934 Act {{to be interpreted}} consistently with Wilko. An extensive overhaul of the 1934 Act passed in 1975, the McMahons claimed, included the language [...] "Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to modify existing law" [...] and in any event did not change the relevant language. They pointed to a conference committee report on that section stating that [...] "it was the <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conferees that this amendment did not change existing law, as articulated in Wilko v.

2500|$|The second rank {{describes}} {{the recognition of}} the Absolute within [...] "the midst of the variety of different situations in action; you see everything before your eyes as your own original true clean face, just as if you were looking at your face in the mirror". That is, unlike the insight of the first rank, which can be easily disturbed, the second rank has greater constancy in the face of distractions. However, seeing the absolute within the relative does not extend to one's behavior towards others. Hakuin describes that at this point one [...] "is neither conversant with the deportment of the bodhisattva, nor does he understand the causal conditions for a Buddha-land. Although he has a <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universal and True Wisdom, he cannot cause to shine forth the Marvelous Wisdom that comprehends the unobstructed interpenetration of the manifold dharmas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} {{deviance}} {{from the source}} material is how Shakespeare characterises the rule of Antony and Cleopatra. While Plutarch singles out the [...] "order of exclusive society" [...] that the lovers surrounded themselves with – a society with a specifically defined and <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hierarchies of power as determined by birth and status – Shakespeare's play seems more preoccupied with the power dynamics of pleasure as a main theme throughout the play. Once pleasure has become a dynamic of power, then it permeates society and politics. Pleasure serves as a differentiating factor between Cleopatra and Antony, between Egypt and Rome, and {{can be read as}} the fatal flaw of the heroes if Antony and Cleopatra is a tragedy. For Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, the exclusivity and superiority supplied by pleasure created the disconnect between the ruler and the subjects. Critics suggest that Shakespeare did similar work with these sources in Othello, Julius Caesar, and Coriolanus.|$|E

The Chinese government has also responded to the criticism, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu stating: [...] "Relevant countries should have a <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rules of the escorts and understand their work. They have used their bodies to protect the torch, so their acts should be praised and the violent acts of those Tibet independence elements be condemned." [...] Also, according to British journalist Brendan O’Neill, there is nothing mysterious about the security-service employees of the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee.

2500|$|The Eastern Orthodox view of {{the origin}} of icons is {{generally}} quite different from that of most secular scholars and from some in contemporary Roman Catholic circles: [...] "The Orthodox Church maintains and teaches that the sacred image has existed from the beginning of Christianity", Léonid Ouspensky has written. [...] Accounts that some non-Orthodox writers consider legendary are accepted as history within Eastern Orthodoxy, [...] because they are a part of church tradition. [...] Thus accounts such as that of the miraculous [...] "Image Not Made by Hands", and the weeping and moving [...] "Mother of God of the Sign" [...] of Novgorod are accepted as fact: [...] "Church Tradition tells us, for example, of the existence of an Icon of the Savior during His lifetime (the [...] "Icon-Made-Without-Hands") and of Icons of the Most-Holy Theotokos [...] immediately after Him." [...] Eastern Orthodoxy further teaches that [...] "a <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance of Icons" [...] was part of the church from its very beginning, and has never changed, although explanations of their importance may have developed over time. [...] This is because icon painting is rooted in the theology of the Incarnation (Christ being the eikon of God) which didn't change, though its subsequent clarification within the Church occurred over the period of the first seven Ecumenical Councils. [...] Also, icons served as tools of edification for the illiterate faithful during most of the history of Christendom.|$|E
