50|$|The <b>collared</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius collaris) {{is a small}} shorebird in the plover family, Charadriidae. It lives along coasts and riverbanks of the {{tropical}} to temperate Americas, from central Mexico south to Chile and Argentina.|$|E
50|$|Dense {{rainforest}} covers 94.1% of {{the national}} forest. Fluvial pioneer formations cover 2.7% and 0.2% is campinarana.Areas that have suffered from human activity account for 2% of the total.Migratory birds include <b>collared</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius collaris), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and large-billed tern (Phaetusa simplex).The glossy antshrike (Sakesphorus luctuosus) is endemic.|$|E
50|$|The diverse {{plant species}} include manilkara huberi, caryocar, dipteryx odorata, chrysophyllum, goupia glabra, copaiba, bertholletia excelsa, {{anacardium}} giganteum and palms such as attalea maripa, oenocarpus bacaba and astrocaryum vulgare.Migratory bird species include osprey (pandion haliaetus), <b>collared</b> <b>plover</b> (charadrius collaris) and large-billed tern (phaetusa simplex).The glossy antshrike (sakesphorus luctuosus) is endemic.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>collared</b> <b>plover</b> {{is usually}} {{very similar to}} the male, but some {{individuals}} can be sexed by a brown tinge to the black areas. Immature birds lack any black on the head, and the breast band is replaced by brown patches {{on each side of the}} chest. The flight call is a sharp metallic pip.|$|E
50|$|Two {{sympatric}} Charadrius {{species are}} very similar: The snowy plover {{is similar in}} size and structure to this species, but is paler above, has dark legs, and never has a complete breastband. semipalmated plovers are larger, thicker-billed, and has a pale collar. Ironically, it {{is the lack of}} a pale collar which gives the <b>collared</b> <b>plover</b> its English language and scientific names.|$|E
50|$|The <b>collared</b> <b>plover</b> {{is found}} on sandy coasts, estuarine mud, inland riverbanks and open sandy savannas. It breeds from Mexico south through Central America {{and most of}} South America. It also occurs {{on some of the}} {{southern}} Caribbean islands, and both Trinidad and Tobago. It appears to be mainly sedentary, although there is some evidence for limited seasonal movements. Collared plovers feed on insects and other invertebrates, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups. This species is not particularly gregarious, and seldom forms flocks. It is usually very wary.|$|E
50|$|They {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings, but most species of lapwing {{may have more}} rounded wings. Their bill are usually straight (except for the wrybill) and short, their toes are short, hind toe could be reduced or absent, depending on species. Most Charadriidae also have relatively short tails, the killdeer is the exception. In most genera, the sexes are similar, very little sexual dimorphism occurs between sexes. They {{range in size from}} the <b>collared</b> <b>plover,</b> at 26 grams and 14 cm, to the masked lapwing, at 368 g and 35 cm.|$|E
