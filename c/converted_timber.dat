50|$|The oldest {{building}} in the hamlet is Coleman's Farm, a 19th century grade II listed structure. It includes a former milking parlour which has been redundant since 1978 and a <b>converted</b> <b>timber</b> barn, now a dwelling.|$|E
50|$|The {{floor of}} the cellar {{includes}} bricks and flagstones, with integral drainage channels. The provision of an easily cleaned durable surface was a necessary feature of areas with much traffic and those in use for supplementary household tasks. It {{is important to remember}} that everything necessary for the efficient running of a household was carried out on site: all food preparation, preservation and storage and all drinks. In addition, laundry, fuel storage (<b>converted</b> <b>timber,</b> coal), water storage, cleaning, ink-making, brewing, candle-making, cheese making, meat smoking, salting and a very many other tasks. Ample space was required to undertake the tasks and to prepare and store the items required. Alterations and additions were of course made over time and there is documentary evidence of improvements to the water management of the building in the mid-19th century.|$|E

50|$|The Hamlet used to {{be larger}} but {{it is known that}} two houses burnt down {{in the early part of}} last century. The Exlade Street Blacksmiths forge {{previously}} stood in the car park of the Highwayman pub and several large barns existed for the storing and working of wood from the local area. It is estimated by the South Oxfordshire Archaeological Group (SOAG)that up to 30 extra buildings existed. In the 1980s SOAG’s founder, Cynthia Graham Kerr, researched the buildings and landscape of Exlade Street. SOAG and The Oxfordshire Woodland Group are now leading a new multipart project, which includes: searching for lost buildings; understanding how local timber buildings were constructed and studying how the local woodlands were exploited for these purposes, in particular how extant sawpits were used to <b>convert</b> <b>timbers.</b>|$|R
60|$|A {{fortnight}} later Athelney {{presented a}} changed appearance. A thousand men were gathered there. Trees {{had been cut}} down, a strong fort erected on the highest ground, and formidable works constructed at three points where alone a landing could be effected. The smoke rose from a score of great mounds, where charcoal-burners were <b>converting</b> <b>timber</b> into fuel for the forges. Fifty smiths and armourers were working vigorously at forges in the open air, roofs thatched with rushes and supported by poles being erected over them to keep the rain and snow from the fires. A score of boats were threading the mazes of the marshes bringing men and cattle to the island. All was bustle and activity, every face shone with renewed hope. King Alfred himself and his thanes moved to and fro among the workers encouraging them at their labours.|$|R

50|$|In 1963 {{the timber}} {{building}} was moved about 150 metres to the north-west and re-oriented 90°, {{prior to the}} construction of the new brick church. Internal alterations were undertaken , to <b>convert</b> the <b>timber</b> building into the parish hall. These included the removal of decorative elements particularly around the sanctuary and altar. The stained glass windows and other memorials were removed, and the majority placed in the brick church in 1965.|$|R
50|$|In September 2011 Wessex {{moved into}} a new depot which was a {{specially}} <b>converted</b> former <b>timber</b> yard on St Andrew's Road, Avonmouth. The move allowed Wessex to set up a new regional head office for the south west operations where all the maintenance requirements could be met.

From November 2013 they had 132 buses and 242 employees.|$|R
50|$|Parliament House was {{originally}} designed as the Customs House in colonial Georgian architecture style by skilled convict architect John Lee Archer in 1830. The {{site for the}} building had originally been a market, but had been <b>converted</b> into <b>timber</b> yards in the 1820s. The site was reserved in 1832 for {{the building of a}} customs house due to its close location to the wharves of Sullivans Cove (the building {{was originally}} closer to the water's edge than it is today following further reclamation).|$|R
50|$|As {{in other}} towns in Washington County, large parcels of timberland are {{changing}} hands and undergoing intensive harvest.

50|$|The town prospered as {{a result}} of {{railroad}} logging in the nearby Zuni Mountains, and it served as a section point for the Atlantic and Pacific, which became part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The Zuni Mountain Railroad short line had a roundhouse in town (near present-day Exit 81 off Interstate 40) and housed workers in a small community named Breecetown. Timber from the Zuni Mountains was shipped to Albuquerque, where a large sawmill <b>converted</b> the <b>timber</b> to wood products that were sold around the west.|$|R

5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century onwards the Normans {{began to build}} new castles in stone and <b>convert</b> {{existing}} <b>timber</b> designs. This was initially a slow process, picking up speed towards {{the second half of}} the century. Traditionally this transition was believed to have been driven by the more crude nature of wooden fortifications, the limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents. Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{two-level}} Hierarchical Timber Allocation {{model was}} developed that iteratively negotiates medium-term (sustainable forest management) decisions with operational (lumber production) plans. At the medium-term level, a multi-criteria timber allocation model optimally allocates forest land units, called stewardship units, to different forest products companies based on five sustainability criteria: profit, employment, wildlife habitat, recreation, and visual quality. At the operational level, a sawmilling model maximizes the profits resulting from optimally <b>converting</b> the <b>timber</b> allocated by the medium-term level into lumber products. An iterative algorithm {{was developed in}} which the decisions generated by the two hierarchical levels reach a mutually beneficial solution. The model is demonstrated in two cases and conclusions are presented about future development...|$|R

50|$|The siting of Jimna {{conformed}} {{to a number}} of criteria for establishment of sawmilling townships. Jimna is situated on the Jimna Range approximately 1690 feet (515.11 metres) above sea level on the western side of Yabba Creek about 40 kilometres from Kilcoy. Proximity to the Kilcoy branch line made timber-felling and sawmilling there viable. According to E.S. Hancock of Hancock and Gore Ltd. bush sawmills were set up because royalties for the timber were assessed {{on the basis of the}} cost of extraction of logs to the nearest railway siding plus freight to the market, which was either a provincial city or Brisbane. When the logs were <b>converted</b> to <b>timber</b> in the country there was a saving in freight because, in the case of pine, there was a loss of approximately 25 per cent in sawdust and edging, and in hardwood a 50 per cent loss. Consequently, the saving in freight costs to market by railway, although not equivalent to the sawdust reduction was attractive. Furthermore, sawmill settlements were placed close to well-timbered forests on a site with a good water supply.|$|R
5|$|In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham {{opened a}} modern brickworks near Brill station, with a {{dedicated}} siding, and in 1895 his heir William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe, expanded the brickworks, {{which became the}} Brill Brick & Tile Works, using the Brill Tramway to deliver bricks to the main line at Quainton Road. With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, Brill Brick & Tile Works was unable {{to compete with the}} nearby brickworks at Calvert, and soon closed.

50|$|The Johannesburg Zoo has {{its origins}} {{as part of}} the Braamfontein farm which was owned by Hermann Eckstein. He had bought the farm to explore it for {{minerals}} and when he failed to find any, the land was <b>converted</b> as a <b>timber</b> plantation in 1891 called Sachsenwald after Otto von Bismarck. In August 1903, the Mayor of Johannesburg, W. St. John Carr, received a letter from Wernher Beit & Co and Max Michaelis with an offer of 200 acres of freehold ground in the Sachsenwald plantation to the Johannesburg Town Council for recreational use by the people of Johannesburg with the park being named the Herman Eckstein Park to honour the man of the same name. This park would become Zoo Lake, the Johannesburg Zoo and the South African National Museum of Military History. The land was transferred to the Johannesburg Town Council on 22 March 1904.|$|R
40|$|Low density wood such as Pulai (Alstonia sp.), Sesendok (Endospermum sp.) and Kekabu Hutan (Bombax sp.) {{have never}} been {{regarded}} as structural material due to their inferior strengths. <b>Converting</b> these <b>timbers</b> into Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) and reinforcing them with stronger timber could turn them into much sought after materials. This study discusses the effects of incorporating Keruing veneers into LVL panels made from low density wood. Laminated Veneer Lumber comprised 11 -ply and 15 -ply veneers fabricated by arranging Keruing veneers located at the surface and the low density woods were arranged as core. Phenol Formaldehyde (PF) resin {{was used as the}} binder. The LVLs were subjected to cyclic boil-dry test according to voluntary product Standard PS 1 - 95 : Construction and Industrial Plywood. The bending properties and percent delamination were determined according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) for Structural LVL: 1993 before and after the cyclic boil dry treatment. Result showed through incorporating low density wood with Keruing veneers, both 11 -ply and 15 -ply LVL panels achieved the minimum requirements for various grades stipulated in the JAS for Structural LVL Standard: 1993. At the same panel thickness, 15 -ply LVL shows a better performance compares to those of 11 -ply LVL. Presence of Keruing veneers as surface layers significantly increased the strength of the LVL panels. All panels passed the delamination test stipulated on the JAS for Structural LVL: 1993. Conclusively, combining Keruing and the low density wood veneers in LVL fabrication gave greater strength and more stable material...|$|R
50|$|One {{reason for}} forest {{depletion}} is to grow cash crops. Nine West African countries depend on cash crop exports. Products like gum, copal, rubber, cola nuts, and palm oil provide rather steady income {{revenue for the}} West African countries. Land use change spoils entire habitats with the forests. <b>Converting</b> forests into <b>timber</b> is another cause of deforestation. Over decades, the primary forest product was commercial timber. Urbanized countries account for a great percentage of the world's wood consumption, that increased greatly between 1950 and 1980. Simultaneously, preservation measures were reinforced to protect European and American forests. Economic growth and growing environmental protection in industrialized European countries made request for tropical hardwood become strong in West Africa. In {{the first half of}} the 1980s, an annual forest loss of 7,200 square kilometers was note down along the Gulf of Guinea, a figure equivalent to 4-5 per cent of the total remaining rain forest area. By 1985, 72 per cent of West Africa's rainforests had been transformed into fallow lands and an additional 9 per cent had been opened up by timber exploitation.|$|R
