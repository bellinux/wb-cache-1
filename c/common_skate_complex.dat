This article examines long-term changes in the distribution and occurrence of the elasmobranch assemblage of the southern North Sea, based on extensive historical time series (1902 – 2013) of fishery-independent survey data. In general, larger species (thornback ray, tope, spurdog) exhibited long-term declines, and the largest (<b>common</b> <b>skate</b> <b>complex)</b> became locally extirpated (as did angelshark). Smaller species increased (spotted and starry ray, lesser-spotted dogfish) as did smooth-hound, likely benefiting from greater resilience to fishing and/or climate change. This indicates a fundamental shift from historical dominance of larger, commercially valuable species to current prevalence of smaller, more productive species often of low commercial value. In recent years, however, some trends have reversed, with the (cold-water associated) starry ray now declining and thornback ray increasing. This shift {{may be attributed to}} (i) fishing, including mechanised beam trawling introduced in the 1960 s– 1970 s, and historical target fisheries for elasmobranchs; (ii) climate change, currently favouring warm-water above cold-water species; and (iii) habitat loss, including potential degradation of coastal and outer estuarine nursery habitats. The same anthropogenic pressures, here documented to have impacted North Sea elasmobranchs over the past century, are likewise impacting shelf seas worldwide and may increase in the future; therefore, parallel changes in elasmobranch communities in other regions are to be expected...|$|E
40|$|The basal {{prerequisite}} for managing species and understanding ecosystems is correct species and population identification. Without knowing the species, we cannot with accuracy detect changes in distribution or abundance due to climate change, fisheries, diseases {{or any other}} types of impact. This thesis gives the first complete overview of chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras), recorded in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. A total of 49 species were found to occur, and the most specious regions were the Bering Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea, {{also known as the}} Arctic Gateways. The Bering Strait is an effective zoogeographic barrier, separating the Pacific from the Atlantic species. In particular, skates are prone to misidentifications. Species complexes are known to occur, and the group is commonly lumped as “Skates & Rays” in fishery statistics or in scientific publications. By use of genetic methods (DNA barcoding), the skate species reported from the northern Northeast (nNE) Atlantic was investigated. A total of 12 species were found to occur in the area, and three of those were new for the region. Skates are commonly encountered in the nNE Atlantic, but ~ 95 % are the smaller-sized Amblyraja radiata. Larger skates may be landed and they are necessarily a mix of the remaining 11 species, some of which are considered threatened. There were strong indications of the disappearance of Leucoraja fullonica, as well as over-reporting of the critically endangered <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> <b>complex</b> formerly known as Dipturus batis. Amblyraja radiata was suspected to be cryptic due to large differences in size-at-maturity across its distributional range. However, the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) did not support this hypothesis. To further elucidate this question, a higher resolution method was applied, and 10 microsatellite markers were investigated from specimens across the North (N) Atlantic. Pairwise fixation indexes (FST) indicated that there may be three major clusters in the N Atlantic: Northwest Atlantic, Mid Atlantic (Greenland) and NE Atlantic. However, more rigorous tests revealed high physical mixing of individuals over a large geographical area. The microsatellite results did not support the hypothesis of A. radiata being cryptic. Although the population structure of A. radiata could not be fully explained, baselines for occurrence of chondrichthyan fishes are established, and a new identification guide for skates in the nNE Atlantic is provided. Hopefully, this will pave the way for a better management of the skates by improving data quality...|$|E

2500|$|Like other <b>skates,</b> the <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> is {{a bottom}} feeder.

The {{size of the}} individual can affect its diet. Larger ones eat larger things like fish. The bigger the skate is the more food that {{will be needed to}} sustain its large body size. The activity level determines how much it eats; the more active it is the more it eats.
