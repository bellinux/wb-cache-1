2500|$|Many NTC {{thermistors}} {{are made}} from a pressed disc, rod, plate, bead or <b>cast</b> <b>chip</b> of semiconducting material such as sintered metal oxides. [...] They work because raising the temperature of a semiconductor increases the number of active charge carriers - it promotes them into the conduction band. The more charge carriers that are available, the more current a material can conduct. In certain materials like ferric oxide (Fe2O3) with titanium (Ti) doping an n-type semiconductor is formed and the charge carriers are electrons. In materials such as nickel oxide (NiO) with lithium (Li) doping a p-type semiconductor is created where holes are the charge carriers.|$|R
40|$|The {{treatability}} {{study to}} macroencapsulate radioactively contaminated lead and steel swarf (cuttings and/or chips) and chunks, {{a low level}} mixed waste, from the dismantlement of excess surplus uranium fuel handling and transfer casks was successful. Macroencapsulation is the land disposal restriction treatment standard for this waste form per 40 CFR 268. 42 Table 3. An epoxy-based thermoset system was employed due to cracking failures {{of other types of}} thermoset systems. Bench scale tests were performed with a two-part epoxy (resin and hardener) using <b>cast</b> iron <b>chips</b> as a surrogate waste media. A two stage encapsulation process was employed in treating the swarf. Two liters of epoxy were added to a 2. 8 {ell} (3 qt) container of swarf under 51 K Pa vacuum (- 15 -inch of Hg) during the first stage of the process. In this stage each individual particle or chip was wetted by epoxy and allowed to harden into an initial monolith. The second stage encapsulated the initial monolith with a secondary layer of epoxy forming a larger final monolith. By evacuating the air from the swarf and epoxy during the initial monolith encapsulation, a higher density (higher swarf to epoxy ratio) was achieved. Tensile and compressive strength tests were performed on samples and without any media (<b>cast</b> iron <b>chips).</b> The coupons were prepared from a series of monoliths featuring various mixtures ratios and vacuum levels. The tensile strength of epoxy without chips averaged 41 M Pa (6000 psi) and 1. 4 M Pa (2000 psi) with <b>cast</b> iron <b>chips.</b> Compression strengths averaged 140 M Pa (20, 000 psi) without chips and 66. 2 M Pa (9600 psi) with <b>cast</b> iron <b>chips...</b>|$|R

40|$|The upgrade {{recycling}} of cast-iron scrap chips towards β-FeSi 2 thermoelectric materials is proposed as an eco-friendly and cost-effective production process. By using scrap waste from the machining process of cast-iron components, the material cost to fabricate β-FeSi 2 is reduced {{and the industrial}} waste is recycled. In this study, β-FeSi 2 specimens obtained from <b>cast</b> iron scrap <b>chips</b> were prepared both in the undoped form and doped with Al and Co elements. The maximum figure of merit (ZT) indicated a thermoelectric performance of approximately 70 % in p-type samples and nearly 90 % in n-type samples compared to β-FeSi 2 prepared from pure Fe and other published studies. The use of <b>cast</b> iron scrap <b>chips</b> to produce β-FeSi 2 shows promise as an eco-friendly and cost-effective production process for thermoelectric materials...|$|R

40|$|In this {{protocol}} the fabrication, experimental {{setup and}} basic {{operation of the}} recently introduced microfluidic picoliter bioreactor (PLBR) is described in detail. The PLBR can be utilized {{for the analysis of}} single bacteria and microcolonies to investigate biotechnological and microbiological related questions concerning, e. g. cell growth, morphology, stress response, and metabolite or protein production on single-cell level. The device features continuous media flow enabling constant environmental conditions for perturbation studies, but in addition allows fast medium changes as well as oscillating conditions to mimic any desired environmental situation. To fabricate the single use devices, a silicon wafer containing sub micrometer sized SU- 8 structures served as the replication mold for rapid polydimethylsiloxane <b>casting.</b> <b>Chips</b> were cut, assembled, connected, and set up onto a high resolution and fully automated microscope suited for time-lapse imaging, a powerful tool for spatio-temporal cell analysis. Here, the biotechnological platform organism Corynebacterium glutamicum was seeded into the PLBR and cell growth and intracellular fluorescence were followed over several hours unraveling time dependent population heterogeneity on single-cell level, not possible with conventional analysis methods such as flow cytometry. Besides insights into device fabrication, furthermore, the preparation of the preculture, loading, trapping of bacteria, and the PLBR cultivation of single cells and colonies is demonstrated. These devices will add a new dimension in microbiological research to analyze time dependent phenomena of single bacteria under tight environmental control.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, a {{friction}} composite material {{which will be}} used for material of train brake shoe was investigated to study the effect of ingredients on flexural strength. The Taguchi method is used to measure relative effect of ingredients on flexural strength of composite. Taguchi L 8 orthogonal array which consists of 7 factors with 2 levels each is applied to perform experiment. Ingredients of friction composite were considered as factors or parameters and % volume for each factor was varied at 2 levels. Phenolic resin and barite (BaSO 4) were not included as factor. Phenolic resin was always kept constant at 30 % volume and % volume of barite (BaSO 4) was varied to compensate the changing of other ingredients amount. The results show that glass fiber and <b>cast</b> iron <b>chip</b> have significant effect on increasing of flexural strength of brake shoe composite. Conversely, NBR has significant effect on decreasing of flexural strength of brake shoe material. Cashew dust, Cu short wire, fly ash and graphite have insignificant effect on flexural strength.

A miracle occurred: A special carob tree chad charuva emerged for them, and a special spring of water. They ate from that carob and drank from that water. Eliyahu, whose memory should bring goodness, would come to them each day, at two periods, and teach them, and no human knew of this, etc. -- so it is written in Zohar Chadash, parashat Tavo. And this is called Tikunei haZohar, which are seventy faces of the Torah which Rabbi Shimon explained on the word [...] "Bereishit" [...] from {{the secrets of the}} Torah.Arise, Rabbi Shimon, and open with words before the Shekhinah (Divine Presence)! did the Arizal He opened and said (Dan. 12:3), [...] "Vehamaskilim yaz'hiru kezohar haraki`a/And the enlightened ones will shine as the shining of the skies..." [...] Meir said: And the [...] "enlightened ones" [...] are Rabbi Shimon and his friends. Shimon explained in response: [...] "Yaz'hiru/They will shine" [...] -- when they gathered to make this book, permission was given to them and to Eliyahu be with them, and to all the souls of the yeshivot to descend among them, and to all the angels come in concealment and by way of the intellect. And above all, permission was given to all the holy names, and to all the Havayah's (Tetragrammatons), and to all the Divine appellations, to reveal concealed secrets to them -- each Name according to its level; and permission was given to the Ten Sefirot to reveal concealed secrets to them, for which, permission to reveal to them had not been given until the generation of the king Mashiach comes. [...] "As the shining of the skies" [...] -- which includes all colors: Sefirot are described: Shining that is concealed and hidden Keter, shining that is bright in the skies Chokhmah, shining that casts sparks and shines with a pale light like lightning to the eyes Binah, shining that shines white like the moon Chesed, shining that shines red like Mars [...] Gevurah, shining that shines with pale light that includes yellow like the sun Tiferet, shining that is pale pink like Mercury Netzach, shining that includes white and red Hod , shining that shines to all sides, like one who strikes with a hammer and <b>casts</b> sparking <b>chips</b> to all sides Yesod -- thus from this shining, several souls shine forth, which all shine in the skies.And these souls of those enlightened ones, who have in themselves intellect to know the secrets of their Master, are all inscribed and pictured in the Malkhut/kingship of the skies like stars that shine in the skies.

40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to obtain a better {{definition}} of the stratigraphic succession of the M. Facito fm. that is the oldest part of the Lagonegro Mesozoic basin in Southern Apennines (Italy). Seismic data show that the Lagonegro succession overthrusted the western part of the Apulian Carbonate Platform and so the M. Facito fm. appears as a broken formation composed by a variety of different lithofacies. They were partially described by CIARAPICA & PASSERI (2000) in the two other typical areas. This paper, therefore, contribuetes to obtain a complete panorama of the lithofacies contained in the M. Facito fm. a) Calcirudites with fusulinids (Upper Permian). They are known only as scattered boulders and pebbles in tectonic melange and debris. These boulders are interpreted as tectonic shavings coming from melanges and reworked in the postorogenic debris flow. They are the only witness of the Permian in Southern Apennines. b) Capelluzzo lithofacies (Spathian-Aegean). It consists of black calcilutites, slates and calcarenites with abundant quartz grains. Sedimentary structures allowed us to recognize a coastal environment with offshore facies (thin-bedded black limestones), transition facies (limestones, slates and thin layers of cross-laminated quartz calcarenites) and shore-face facies (amalgamated beds of quartz calcarenites). c) Pietra Maura lithofacies (Anisian p. p.). It is represented by massive limestone with green algae, encrusting organisms, foraminifera and brachiopods. The main outcrops of Pietra Maura and Le Ripe are interpreted as carbonate build-ups. Sometimes they show evidence of exposure on the top. d) Varesano lithofacies (Anisian p. p.). It consists of marls, shales and sandstones. It partially lies by side and partially on the top of the previous lithofacies. The same species of brachiopods are contained in both the Pietra Maura limestone and in the shales and sandstones of Varesano, documenting their same age. Sandstones include quartz-wackes, quartz-psammites and quartz-arenites. In some outcrops they contain beautiful wavy ripples and burrows, but in other places they show turbidites with thick graded beds, flute <b>casts,</b> clay <b>chips</b> and current ripples. Sandstones with wave ripples overlying marls indicate a regressive trend. Turbidites are likely a witness of the successive deepening. e) Bellagamba lithofacies (Ladinian p. p.). This lithofacies marks the birth of the deep-water Lagonegro basin. It contains red nodular limestone (Rosso Ammonitico Auctt.) with very rare ammonites but rich in conodonts (early Fassanian to late Longobardian p. p.), radiolarian chert and true radiolarites. Calcirudites and megabreccias include elements coming from Ladinian build-ups that are not present in the Mt. Facito area but that are well known in other zones as Tempa di Rocca Rossa (Tempa di Rocca Rossa lithofacies, Ladinian p. p.). f) Petina Chiana lithofacies (late Longobardian to early Julian). This lithofacies is characterized by the presence of red shales and thin-bedded calcilutites with radiolarians and thin-shelled pelecypods (filaments). It contains the Ladinian-Carnian boundary and it marks the transition to the overlying Calcari con Selce fm. (Carnian and Norian). Some lithofacies lacking of clear relationships with the previous ones (Lithofacies Incertae Sedis) are also described in this paper. Among them, the Cognone lithofacies, that was settled down in a coastal environment and could be referred to the Anisian. The last subject is devoted to the description of the melange, well developed in the Mt. Facito area. It is possible to distinguish synsedimentary, synorogenic and postorogenic melange. The first one is represented by the Bellagamba lithofacies (radiolarites with calcirudites) that is the expression of the Middle Triassic rifting of the Ionian Ocean. The second one is related to thrust surfaces and it contains shavings of the oldest parts of the Lagonegro succession (Permian limestone and phyllites pebbles) sometimes mixed with Cretaceous elements of the «flysch galestrino fm. ». The third one is very common and it consists of weathering products, loose sediments by mass flow and, sometimes, well cemented fluvial conglomerates. The abundance of melanges in the outcrops of Mt. Facito fm. probably lead to misinterpret it as a unique, huge olistostroma. In our opinion the fragmentary character of this formation is mainly due to tectonic...|$|R
6000|$|After {{passing through}} the locks, we had poled {{ourselves}} through the canal here, {{about half a mile}} in length, to the boatable part of the river. Above Amoskeag the river spreads out into a lake reaching a mile or two without a bend. There were many canal-boats here bound up to Hooksett, about eight miles, and as they were going up empty with a fair wind, one boatman offered to take us in tow if we would wait. But when we came alongside, we found that they meant to take us on board, since otherwise we should clog their motions too much; but as our boat was too heavy to be lifted aboard, we pursued our way up the stream, as before, while the boatmen were at their dinner, and came to anchor at length under some alders on the opposite shore, where we could take our lunch. Though far on one side, every sound was wafted over to us from the opposite bank, and from the harbor of the canal, and we could see everything that passed. By and by came several canal-boats, at intervals of a quarter of a mile, standing up to Hooksett with a light breeze, and one by one disappeared round a point above. With their broad sails set, they moved slowly up the stream in the sluggish and fitful breeze, like one-winged antediluvian birds, and as if impelled by some mysterious counter-current. It was a grand motion, so slow and stately, this [...] "standing out," [...] as the phrase is, expressing the gradual and steady progress of a vessel, as if it were by mere rectitude and disposition, without shuffling. Their sails, which stood so still, were like <b>chips</b> <b>cast</b> into the current of the air to show which way it set. At length the boat which we had spoken came along, keeping the middle of the stream, and when within speaking distance the steersman called out ironically to say, that if we would come alongside now he would take us in tow; but not heeding his taunt, we still loitered in the shade till we had finished our lunch, and when the last boat had disappeared round the point with flapping sail, for the breeze had now sunk to a zephyr, with our own sails set, and plying our oars, we shot rapidly up the stream in pursuit, and as we glided close alongside, while they were vainly invoking Aeolus to their aid, we returned their compliment by proposing, if they would throw us a rope, to [...] "take them in tow," [...] to which these Merrimack sailors had no suitable answer ready. Thus we gradually overtook and passed each boat in succession until we had the river to ourselves again.|$|R
