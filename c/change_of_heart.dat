5|$|After a fortnight, Kumar met Balachander in Chennai {{and watched}} Uyarndha Manithan {{again for a}} second time to study his character. This time, however, Kumar hesitated to portray Ganesan's role and {{requested}} Balachander to direct the remake of Babu (1971). Balachander showed concern with Kumar's <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> and refused the offer, leading to both the remakes of Uyarndha Manithan and Babu being shelved.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes had a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> and returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to play Test cricket again. He approached Aubrey Oxlade, the chairman of Australian cricket's Board of Control, to ask if there was any impediment to his return to the Australian team. Oxlade told Barnes that he would be judged solely on his batting performances.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{by what he}} {{felt was}} too much individualism in the game, Schriner {{contemplated}} retiring from professional hockey in favour of taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league. He had a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> {{and returned to the}} Leafs for the 1942–43 NHL season. Schriner again announced his intention to leave the game in June 1943, this time citing past injuries to his knee and dissatisfaction with Leafs' owner Conn Smythe's contract offer for the following season.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Veronica is {{hired by}} {{researchers}} in the disappearance of a Capuchin monkey being used for animal testing on non-human primates. However, she has a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> after infiltrating an animal rights group {{as part of the}} case.

5|$|After {{the hostage}} {{exchange}} is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues {{that he should}} not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus spends much of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart.</b> Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth is confirmed when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E
5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> was at least partly contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} January 2007, the {{government}} declared it would postpone the demolition of Queen's Pier until a consensus could be reached on the course of action; consultations with the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, the Hong Kong Institute of Engineers, and the Conservancy Association were held. The Institute of Architects, whose members opposed dismantling the pier, originally maintained the pier should remain untouched. However, {{it was reported that}} after meeting {{the government}}, the Institute and the Conservancy Association were persuaded by the government that the pier could first be dismantled, and then reassembled at another location after completion of the reclamation. This <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> was heavily criticised by Winston Chu, founder of the Society for Protection of the Harbour. The HKIA clarified that their opposition had not in fact changed.|$|E

5|$|Later at the Central Perk café, Phoebe convinces Ross to tell Rachel how {{he feels}} about her before she leaves for her new job in Paris. As he is about to tell her, Central Perk manager Gunther (James Michael Tyler) confesses his love for Rachel. Back at Monica and Chandler's apartment, Ross decides not to tell Rachel, for fear of rejection. She prepares to leave to catch her flight, but waits long enough for Monica and Chandler to return with the twins, named Erica (after their {{biological}} mother) and Jack (after Monica's father). After Rachel leaves, Ross has a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart,</b> and Phoebe takes him in her taxi to follow Rachel to the airport.|$|E
5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves had a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E
5|$|Ten were honoured {{for their}} role in the operation, seven {{receiving}} Distinguished Service Medals, two the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and one, the grievously wounded Ritchie, the Victoria Cross. Ritchie had not initially been recommended for this award; the recommendation being submitted at a later date by an unidentified figure in the Admiralty. Snelling speculates that the Admiralty's <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> was possibly a morale boosting measure, although Ritchie's courage during the action was never called into question. The shrapnel and bullet wounds he sustained in the raid were extensive, including injuries to his forehead, left thumb, left arm (twice), right arm, right hip and a badly broken right leg after being hit by two large calibre machine gun bullets.|$|E

5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{proposals}} {{were published in}} March 1958, and a new bill was introduced under the Ten Minute Rule, failing to gain the requisite support. After A. P. Herbert stood for Parliament {{on a platform of}} obscenity reform, the Home Office had a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> and introduced a new bill through Roy Jenkins in 1959, a compromise between the aims of the campaigners and the goals of the Home Office. It was introduced to the House of Lords by Lord Birkett, received the Royal Assent on 29 July 1959, and came into force on 29 August 1959 as the Obscene Publications Act 1959.|$|E

They watch the process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Marie herself {{begins the}} {{operation}} {{on a quest}} to seduce and betray her target. Her reversal (followed by two subsequent <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart,</b> {{back to the original}} mission and then in opposition to it) counterbalance the wickedness of Madame du Gua and Corentin. Her ultimate fidelity to the object of her desire demonstrates the possibility of sincere passion, even as the other pair speak to the venom <b>of</b> the slighted <b>heart.</b>|$|R
50|$|Even in jurisdictions {{that do not}} {{recognize}} surrogacy arrangements, if the genetic parents and the birth mother proceed without any intervention {{from the government and}} have no <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> along the way, they will likely be able to achieve the effects of surrogacy by having the surrogate mother give birth and then give the child up for private adoption to the intended parents.|$|R

5|$|The motive behind Edward's <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> {{could have}} been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in a good {{position}} to support his cause in Gascony. When the King left for France in November, Edward's behaviour turned into pure insubordination. He made several appointments to advance the cause of the reformers, causing his father to believe that his son was considering a coup d'état. When the King returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the two were eventually reconciled. Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.|$|E
5|$|When the Landlords {{arrive at}} the Axe Gang casino to settle the score, Sum sends the Beast to fight them. During the fight, he stabs both with hidden blades, {{weakening}} but not defeating them. Sum orders Sing to strike the Landlord to break the stalemate, but Sing has a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> and strikes the Beast instead. The Beast turns and pummels Sing until he is rescued by the Landlords and taken back to Pig Sty Alley. The Beast kills Sum for disrupting his fight, and then orders an all-out assault on Pig Sty Alley.|$|E
5|$|After McKinley {{was assassinated}} in September 1901, Long had a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart,</b> and {{tendered}} his resignation to President Roosevelt on May 1, 1902. The exact reasons for this are unclear, but several factors probably contributed. First, Roosevelt had {{a close relationship with}} Long's political rival Lodge, was known to disagree with Long on naval matters, and was not welcoming of his presence at the White House. Second, an inquiry into the actions of Admiral Winfield Scott Schley around the July 1898 Battle of Santiago de Cuba had resulted in a significant amount of criticism of Long's role in the war. Third, one of his daughters died in October 1901, {{less than a month after}} McKinley's assassination. These matters drove Long into a depression, and the situation was further exacerbated when Roosevelt squabbled with him over the beginning of the war, and then made newsworthy overrides of some of his decisions. Historian Wendell Garrett notes that Roosevelt took a great personal interest in the Navy, and had difficulty working with subsequent secretaries.|$|E
2500|$|William James, {{who wrote}} {{on these matters}} as a scientist, reminds us {{that it is not}} {{theology}} and ceremonies which keep religion going. Its vitality is in the religious experiences of many people. [...] "If you ask what these experiences are, they are conversations with the unseen, voices and visions, responses to prayer, <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart,</b> deliverances from fear, inflowings of help, assurances of support, whenever certain persons set their own internal attitude in certain appropriate ways." ...|$|R
5000|$|All non-qualified deferred-compensation plans must involve {{substantial}} risk of forfeiture or other methods of avoiding constructive receipt, such as conditioning payment upon performance of future conditions or service.
