40|$|The {{climate and}} the urban systems are changing, leading to new {{challenges}} and opportunities in the urban environment. Adaptation to these challenges is needed, using the vulnerability assessment areas that are vulnerable can be identified. Vulnerability is the likelihood a system experiences harm and is the combination of both risks and adaptability. Finding adaptability can be hard and is not straightforward, therefor this thesis aims to operationalize adaptability for the current urban environment, focussing on climate change and the physical indicators related to adaptability. Adaptability simply means the ability there is (within a system, society or city) to adapt. A lot of different definitions for adaptability (or adaptive capacity) {{can be found in}} literature, which makes talking about, using and comparing adaptability hard. Different fields of interest use different definitions, frameworks and approaches. Most of the definitions and frameworks found in the literature search of this thesis tend to be meant for assessing social adaptability on regional or country scale. They focus on institutions, economy and (technical) knowledge on larger scales. These assessments come down to, the third world countries have bad adaptability while the first world countries have better adaptability. For decision-making on municipality level assessment on smaller scale is needed. For this thesis a lot of indicators have been gathered (a grand total of 38) by literature research and interviews with experts. Indicators are one of the ways of assessing adaptability, so by selecting and combining indicators it is able to determine a measure for adaptability. The used indicators (9 in total) are grouped in so called determinants. There are indicators saying something about space that is available for <b>climate</b> <b>proofing</b> or the type of <b>climate</b> <b>proofing</b> (blue, green or grey solutions) that can be used (space: percentage buildings, percentage water and percentage greening). Furthermore there are indicators that express the underground conditions in an area (underground: soil type and underground infrastructure). There are indicators stressing opportunities regarding <b>climate</b> <b>proofing</b> that may arise (matching: planned works and estimated end of life cycle). There are also indicators that stress the drive for <b>climate</b> <b>proofing</b> (budgets: urgency). Lastly there are indicators related to specific characteristics of an area (function related demands: historical city centre). The indicators are then combined to construct a rapid assessment tool for the municipality of Dordrecht. This tool can be used to prioritize <b>climate</b> <b>proofing</b> in the Dordrecht area, when used side-by-side with a risk map. Quick wins (high adaptability, high risks) can be identified as well as areas that need further attention, research or innovation (low adaptability, high risks). The resulting maps from the tool, show expected behaviour. The historical city centre of Dordrecht shows lower adaptabilities, while harbour, park and nature areas show higher adaptabilities. Assessing and using adaptability adds data and information to your decision-making process. <b>Climate</b> <b>proofing</b> is needed, for it being the least-social-cost strategy, assessing vulnerability helps making good and funded decisions on <b>climate</b> <b>proofing.</b> Water ResourcesWater ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

In order to make the Dutch water system <b>climate</b> <b>proof,</b> dikes must be reinforced and raised and/or the design water level must be lowered. In this study, a flood channel as a measure to decrease water levels has been investigated, and has been compared to dike reinforcements. The investigated flood channel runs from the Afgedamde Maas towards the Biesbosch and Bergse Maas. This flood channel has been designed by architect Robbert de Koning, and {{is part of a larger}} plan to make the Dutch lower rivers <b>climate</b> <b>proof</b> until the year 2100.

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) acknowledges this and is increasingly incorporating science from the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and CCAFS, to introduce <b>climate</b> <b>proofing</b> into their project design and implementation. CIAT research was used to support the prioritization of USD 75 million in public investment in agricultural development in Liberia, Uganda, and Comoros. Following the success of CIAT’s collaboration with IFAD and the Government of Nicaragua in the ‘Adapting to Markets and Climate Change Project’ (NICADAPTA), CIAT was asked to conduct studies that could help the prioritisation of agricultural adaptation strategies in Liberia, Uganda and Comoros, as part of IFAD’s Adaptation for Smaller Agriculture Programme (ASAP). In Liberia, studies explored the projected climate impacts on cocoa, and recommended adaptation strategies for specific regions based on their exposure to climate impacts. Based on the study a USD 4. 5 million IFAD project adopted interventions such as improved varieties and alternative agricultural practices, to make the cocoa sector more resilient to climate change. In Uganda, researchers used the CIAT-developed Climate-Smart Agriculture Rapid Appraisal (CSA-RA) Prioritization Tool to provide appraisals of farming systems in four districts.

However, few prototypes are easy to use and accessible for decision-makers to evaluate and manage risks locally. DESYCO is a GIS based {{decision support}} system specifically designed to better understand the risks that climate change poses at the regional/subnational scale (e. g. the effect of sea level rise and coastal erosion on human assets and ecosystems) and set the context of strategic adaptation planning within Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It implements a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowing the spatial assessment of multiple climate change impacts in coastal areas and the ranking of key elements at risk (beaches, wetlands, protected areas, urban and agricultural areas). The core of the system is a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model used to operationalize the steps of the RRA (hazard, exposure, susceptibility, risk and damage assessment) by integrating a blend of information from climate scenarios (global/regional climate projections and hydrodynamic/hydrological simulations) and from non-climate vulnerability factors (physical, environmental and socio-economic features of the analysed system). User-friendly interfaces simplify the interaction with the system, providing guidance for risk mapping, results communication and understanding. DESYCO was applied to low-lying coastal plains and islands (the North Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Gabes and the Republic of Mauritius), river basins and groundwater systems (Upper Plain of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche Region).

40|$|Due to {{the long}} term {{character}} of the policy issue, the associated uncertainties and the large variety of affected stakeholders, adapting densely populated delta areas to the impacts of climate change is an important governance challenge and a wicked problem. In this paper, we analyse adaptive delta management (ADM), a policy development approach that relies on adaptation tipping points and adaptation pathways, used by the Dutch Delta Programme to <b>climate</b> <b>proof</b> the Dutch delta. ADM operationalizes adaptive management ideas {{for the long term}} governance of river deltas. Taking a governance perspective, we assess the potential of ADM to contribute to each of the five governance capabilities required to deal with wicked problems: reflexivity, responsiveness, resilience, revitalization and rescaling. We conclude that ADM can contribute substantially to the governance capabilities of resilience (through robustness and flexibility) and rescaling (through addressing the time scale mismatch). ADM has the potential to contribute to the governance capabilities of reflexivity and responsiveness, but also has some characteristics that could result in non-reflexivity and non-responsiveness.

During two workshops, groups, mostly in the same composition, explored what it takes to achieve through the formulation of interim objectives, interventions required and challenges. They have thereby assumed extreme climate scenarios : 25 m rise in sea level of the upper limit used by the Delta Commission 1. 30 m sea level rise in 2100 (Delta Commission, 2008) ...|$|R
