40|$|The two {{principal}} reasons that can hinder industrial success of bioscouring are {{the inability to}} remove <b>cotton</b> <b>waxes</b> at low-temperature and that bioscouring is a slow diffusion controlled process. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to develop an improved cotton scouring process by applying mechanical action and enzyme treatment to efficiently remove the cuticle and primary wall compounds from the cotton fibre. The role of the mechanical action for improving the bioscouring process is discussed. To study the effect, a known amount of mechanical energy was applied using the ‘wedge apparatus’ before and after the enzyme treatment. The effect of mechanical action was evaluated for a faster scouring process with cutinase, pectinase and optimum incubation conditions such as pH, temperature, ionic strength, enzyme concentration, and incubation time were determined. It is demonstrated that cutinase from fungus Fusarium solani pisi is effective in the degradation of <b>cotton</b> <b>waxes</b> at low-temperature in less than 30 min after applying mechanical action. Wax removal with cutinase reduces pectinase incubation time and increases hydrolytic rate of pectinase. By the introduction of mechanical energy a fast one-step low-temperature enzymatic cotton scouring process is developed at lab scale...|$|R

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes the}} potential of a cutinase from the fungus Fusarium solani pisi for <b>cotton</b> <b>wax</b> degradation in order to design an efficient low temperature scouring process. The main characteristics, relevant to <b>cotton</b> <b>wax</b> removal with F. solani pisi cutinase are given. The additive effect of cutinase on pectinase was investigated and optimum incubation conditions were determined. Compatibility of cutinase with surfactants, essential for the rapid migration of enzymes into the fabric, is explored. A clear strategy is presented to achieve a rapid enzymatic cotton scouring process. Wax removal with cutinase reduces pectinase incubation time and increases the hydrolytic rate of pectinase. Cutinase appears {{to be effective in}} the degradation of cotton waxes at low-temperature, allowing the design and introduction of a competitive innovative enzymatic scouring process...|$|E
