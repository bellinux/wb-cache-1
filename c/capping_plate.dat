The plate was never found but Dr. Brownlee believes that the plate never left the atmosphere, for example it could have been vaporized by compression heating of the atmosphere due to its high speed. The calculated velocity was interesting enough that the crew trained a high-speed camera on the plate which, unfortunately, only appeared in one frame indicating a very high lower bound for the speed of the plate.|$|E

The most commonly used CCS configuration for parenteral drug products is the glass vial, sealed with a rubber stopper and an aluminum crimp cap. In combination with an adequately designed and controlled aseptic fill/finish processes, a well-designed and characterized capping process is indispensable to ensure product quality and integrity and to minimize rejections during the manufacturing process. In this review, the health authority requirements and expectations related to container closure system quality and container closure integrity are summarized. The pharmaceutical vial, the rubber stopper, and the crimp cap are described. Different capping techniques are critically compared: The most common capping equipment with a rotating <b>capping</b> <b>plate</b> produces the lowest amount of particle.

Stopper compression measured by computer tomography correlated to residual seal force measurements.

In addition, we compared two large-scale good manufacturing practice manufacturing capping equipment and different capping equipment settings and their impact on product quality and integrity, as determined by residual seal force. The <b>capping</b> <b>plate</b> to plunger distance had a major influence on the obtained residual seal force values of a sealed vial, whereas the capping pre-compression force and the turntable rotation speed showed only a minor influence on the residual seal force of a sealed vial. Capping process parameters could not easily be transferred from capping equipment of different manufacturers. However, the residual seal force tester did provide a valuable tool to compare capping performance of different capping equipment. No vial showed any leakage greater than 10 (- 8) mbar L/s as measured by a helium mass spectrometry system, suggesting that container closure integrity was warranted in the residual seal force range tested for the tested container closure systems.

40|$|The vial capping {{process is}} a {{critical}} unit operation during drug product manufacturing, as it could possibly generate cosmetic defects or even affect container closure integrity. Yet there is significant variability in capping equipment and processes, and their relation to potential defects or container closure integrity has not been thoroughly studied. In this study we applied several methods-residual seal force tester, a self-developed system of a piezo force sensor measurement, and computed tomography-to characterize different container closure system combinations that had been sealed using different capping process parameter settings. Additionally, container closure integrity of these samples was measured using helium leakage (physical container closure integrity) and compared to characterization data. The different capping equipment settings lead to residual seal force values from 7 to 115 N. High residual seal force values were achieved with high capping pre-compression force and a short distance between the <b>capping</b> <b>plate</b> and plunge. The choice of container closure system influenced the obtained residual seal force values. The residual seal force tester and piezoelectric measurements showed similar trends. All vials passed physical container closure integrity testing, and no stopper rupture was seen {{with any of the}} settings applied, suggesting that container closure integrity was warranted for the studied container closure system with the chosen capping setting ranges...|$|E

The cleat plate thickness was kept constant for all tests. The cleat plate orientation relative to the tube was investigated and was found to affect the joint strength. There was evidence of shear lag taking place. The test results also revealed that the use of very thick <b>cap</b> <b>plates</b> (more than 20 mm) does not lead to increased joint capacity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{appraise}} typical components used in flexographic printing to provide more knowledge on the use of printing with functional inks on filmic substrates when printing packaged products inline. An oxygen barrier coating was applied using different plate-screening technologies and anilox rolls. Comparing two plate-screening technologies and three different anilox rolls using oxygen permeability tests helped to conclude the optimum plate and anilox roll solution that best apply the ink for proper functionality of the coating, with minimal ink application as to reduce waste. Further knowledge of printing oxygen barrier coatings inline will yield results that benefit in both production and cost areas. Selecting the right combination of plate technology and anilox roll that achieves similar results of barrier properties available in pretreated films will allow companies to achieve maximum barrier assets in their packaging in a more cost effective manner. The first print run comparing the different plate screening technologies, revealed that the <b>capped</b> <b>plate</b> technology provided much higher barrier properties than the cell patterned technology. As the <b>capped</b> <b>plate</b> technology was used with the second print run comparing the anilox rolls, optimum results disclose the combination of these two flexographic components for achieving maximum functionality of barrier inks. Using the 360 CPI, 6. 53 BCM anilox roll with the <b>capped</b> <b>plate</b> technology provides barrier properties that are competitively comparable with pretreated films. Benefits of inline printing versus pretreated films are found in both cost and production areas of the company...|$|R

Nuclei and other organelles {{were placed in the}} outermost portion of the cytoplasm whereas chloroplasts protruded into the vacuole. The utricle cell wall was formed by a single stratum covered by a rugose cuticle. Only gametangia producing a single type of gametes were observed. Progametangia consisted of an apical vacuolate portion and a basal portion with partitioned cytoplasm. The clear apical portion of immature gametangia revealed abundant endoplasmic reticulum, dictyosomes and electron translucent vacuoles. Most of the gametangium volume was occupied by spherical nuclei and small chloroplasts. Gametes were delimitated by the activity of electron translucent vesicles. Mature gametes were pear-shaped with a prominent papilla occupied by the basal apparatus. An anterior nucleus was anteriorly flanked by a large mitochondrion.

50|$|Screw piles can be {{referred}} to as screw-piles, steel screw-in foundations, screw piers, helical piles, helical anchors, screw anchors, screw foundations and helical piers. Screw piles were first described by the Irish civil engineer Alexander Mitchell in a paper in Civil Engineer's and Architects Journal in 1848 - however, helical piles had been used for almost a decade by this point. Screw foundations first appeared in the 1800s as pile foundations for lighthouses, and were extensively used for piers in harbours. Between the 1850s through 1890s, more than 100 screw-pile lighthouses were erected on the east coast of the United States using screw piles. Made originally from cast or wrought iron, they had limited bearing and tension capacities. Modern screw pile load capacities are in excess of 2000 kN. Large load capacity screw piles may have various components such as flat half helices, Bisalloy cutting tips and helices, <b>cap</b> <b>plates</b> or re-bar interfaces for connection to various concrete or steel structures.|$|R

Iron tie rods 1+1/4 in wide serve as diagonal cross-braces on the panels, and there is a horizontal tension rod at each end of the truss. A set of expansion rollers at the west end, intended to provide additional stability, has since corroded due to road salt and rust.|$|R

40|$|External bonding {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) {{is one of}} the most efficient techniques for retrofitting and strengthening concrete structures. However, the bond interface is the weakest link in such retrofitted or strengthened concrete members, resulting in premature FRP debonding. Therefore, a newly improved hybrid bonded FRP (IHB-FRP) technique is developed in this paper for strengthening concrete members. Unlike the conventional mechanical fastening method, the mechanical fasteners in the technique do not penetrate the FRP strips and the <b>capping</b> <b>plates</b> serve to apply vertical pressure to the FRP strips. An experimental study on the flexural strength of IHB-FRP technique strengthened beams is conducted. It is found that all the beams strengthened with the IHB-FRP technique fail due to tensile rupture of FRP strips even for seven plies of FRP strips. Based on the experimental results, the effects of the steel reinforcement ratio, the number of FRP plies, and the fastener spacing on the ultimate load are evaluated. Finally, a simplified method is proposed for estimating the ultimate bending moment of the IHB-FRP strengthened beam. The validity of the method is verified with the experimental results...|$|R

The adoption of a reasonable structure of the springing joint is of important significance in the design of an arch bridge.

In Scheme- 1, the lower chords of steel truss arch ribs are connected to the concrete piers with shear studs on the ribs and <b>cap</b> <b>plates</b> welded on the ribs at the top of concrete piers., while Scheme- 2 is a integrated spring joint with a base plate {{on the bottom of the}} steel arch ribs and with reinforcing bars through the holes on the joints steel arch ribs. 3 D finite element models of the two types of springing joint were established and the relative slips between the concrete and steel were taken into account in the analyses. The mechanical behavior of the concrete and the steel structure of the joints under applied loads was investigated and the analysis result showed that Scheme- 2 is a relative better structure of springing joint, with less principle tensile stress in concrete and less Mises stress in steel plates...|$|R
