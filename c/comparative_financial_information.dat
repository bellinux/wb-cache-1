40|$|This report {{presents}} <b>comparative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> by {{size and}} type on local cooperative associations that are first-handlers of grain. These associations had annual sales in 1985 and 1983 {{of at least}} $ 5 million, with grain sales representing {{more than half of}} total value of sales. Many of the associations handled farm supplies and provided related services. Net savings averaged lower in 1985 than in 1983 for most type/size groups studied, most noticeably for cooperatives in the Corn Belt and Southern Plains. This resulted from sharply lower grain sales and higher operating expenses, particularly labor. Most type/size groups were impacted more by increased operating expenses than by factors affecting gross income. Considerable debt reduction occurred during this period, but many associations were still left financially troubled in 1985...|$|E

We {{do this by}} directly comparing insider trading returns and insider’s ability to predict future earnings from accruals in Spain and Australia. Results show higher excess returns and greater prediction of future earnings from conditioned insider trading in Australia that is then utilized by financial analysts to lower forecast errors – particularly in contrarian-based accruals trading. Possible explanations include: (i) a high asymmetric quality for market-based accruals, (ii) information transfer from informed insiders to uninformed insiders and financial analysts and (iii) a more timely dissemination of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> in Spain through different ownership and governance structures...|$|R

Banks as lenders to Medium Sized firms use the <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> in the credit assessment process. The availability {{and quality of the}} <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> depends on the information environment of the country. We have conducted a quantitative study where we examined 80 loan applications of the Medium Sized firms to the Big 4 private banks inPakistan. We collected the data of 80 loan applications by the Medium Sized firms of which in 40 cases, the banks granted loans and in 40 cases, the banks rejected the loan applications. We wanted to create a representative sample of the population that leads us to choose snowball sampling that is non-probability technique in our research to find the responsible persons in the banks who can give us our desired data. To get the desired data from the bank officials, we have used close ended questionnaire to collect the data on different variables of availability of <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> the quality of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and the verification of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> with relation to loan decisions. We have analyzed the impact of the availability of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> variables i. e. number of years’ financial statements, bank account statement, income tax return and audit on the loan decisions of the banks. Later, we analyzed the impact of the quality of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> on the loan decisions and on the verification process of the banks. We used univariate data analysis to summarize the data and to examine the descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation of the dataset.

We have conducted Chi-square to measure the statistical significance to check the p-value to accept or reject the hypotheses. We have found that if more number of years’ financial statements, income tax return and audit is available, the banks are more likely to make grant decision. However, bank account statement does not have any effect on the loan decisions of the banks. Later, we found that the banks are more likely to grant loans to Medium Sized firms if the quality of the <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> is not poor.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} the value relevance of non-financial performance information, {{within the context}} of the biotechnology industry. We also investigate the interactions between <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and non-financial performance information. We develop six hypotheses that are specific to the biotechnology industry: H 1 : <b>Financial</b> <b>information,</b> after controlling for its sign, is value relevant. H 2 : A firm's product market status enhances the value relevance of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> Reported by biotechnology firms. H 3 : Information about R&D expenditures (R&D inputs) has incremental value relevance over <b>financial</b> <b>information.</b> H 4 : Clinical trial information about a firm's drug portfolios (R&D outputs) has incremental value relevance over financial and R&D input information. H 5 : The incremental value relevance of information on a firm's drug portfolios is greater for drugs at more advanced stages than for drugs at earlier stages. H 6 : Information about a firm's business relations has incremental value relevance over its financial and R&D innovation information. We test these hypotheses using data of biotechnology firms collected from 1998 to 2001. Our findings indicate that, in the biotechnology industry, (1) <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> after the control for its sign, is value relevant; (2) a firm's product market status can help investors better understand the value relevance of <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> especially earnings; (3) R&D intensity (proxy for R&D inputs) is incrementally value relevant over financial information; (4) drug portfolios (proxies for R&D outputs) are incrementally value relevant over <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and R&D intensity; (5) the incremental value relevance of drug portfolios is greater for drugs at more advanced stages than for drugs at earlier stages; (6) Alliances (a proxy for business relations) are incrementally value relevant over <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> R&D intensity and drug portfolios. With respect to the interactions between <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and non-financial performance information, we find that <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> can enhance the value relevance of non-financial performance information, while non-financial performance information, in turn, can enhance the value relevance of <b>financial</b> <b>information.</b> Based on these interactions, we suggest an interactive perspective for the evaluation and exploration of the value relevance of the two types of information. In addition, we propose a more reliable measurement of R&D innovation. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

The way individuals and institutions use the concept of financial literacy suggests that different people attach different meanings to this construct. In order to establish a conceptual model for financial literacy, this study endeavours to formulate what financial literacy entails as well as decision makers’ expectations of <b>financial</b> <b>information.</b> The increase in the volume and complexity of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> often outstrips the abilities of users to understand and interpret it for decision-making purposes. A financial literacy interface provides an opportunity window for decision makers in organisations to break through their fears and concerns in using financial figures and language. Users of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> differ vastly with regard to their level of financial capability and sophistication, and preparers of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> should take cognisance of the fact.
