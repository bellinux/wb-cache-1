25|$|Minimum wage rates {{vary greatly}} across many {{different}} jurisdictions, {{not only in}} setting a particular amount of money—for example $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year) under certain US state laws (or $2.13 for employees who receive tips, which {{is known as the}} tipped minimum wage), $9.47 in the US state of Washington, or £7.50 (for those aged 25+) in the United Kingdom—but also in terms of which pay period (for example Russia and <b>China</b> <b>set</b> monthly minimum wages) or the scope of coverage.
