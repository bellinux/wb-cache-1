50|$|The {{construction}} of the Panama Canal was envisioned by John Frank Stevens, <b>chief</b> American railroad <b>construction</b> <b>engineer,</b> as a huge earthmoving project using the extended railroad system. Many tracks were added temporally to transport the sand and rock from the excavation. Stevens used {{the biggest and most}} durable equipment available. The French equipment was nearly all judged obsolete, worn out, or too light duty, and nearly all their railroad equipment was not built for heavy-duty use. Some of this French equipment was melted down and converted into medals presented to men working on the Panama Canal.|$|R

5000|$|The Sukkur Barrage has 66 [...] Gates.The Sukkur Barrage (formally called Lloyd Barrage), built {{under the}} British Raj on the Indus River, {{controls}} {{one of the}} largest irrigation systems in the world. It was designed by Sir Arnold Musto KCIE, and constructed under the overall direction of Sir Charlton Harrison, KCIE, as <b>Chief</b> <b>Engineer.</b> <b>Construction</b> of the barrage was started in 1923 and completed in January 1932. The 5001 ft long barrage is made of yellow stone and steel and can water nearly 10 million acres (40,000 km2) of farmland through its seven large canals.

5000|$|Charles Praray first {{emerges as}} the <b>chief</b> {{designer}} and <b>construction</b> <b>engineer</b> of the Makepeace firm, and {{was made a}} partner circa 1892. As designer, in 1894, he patented what was known as [...] "Praray's Improved Construction", a system of mill construction which separated {{the structure of the}} roof and floors of a mill from that of the walls, allowing much more daylight to enter the building. Visually, Praray's design may be most noted for its unusual window patterns, which emerge from the brick piers in a zig-zag pattern. Only five these mills have been documented as being built, but Chas. A. M. Praray & Company touted it in advertisements for many years. Prior to its demolition around 2014, the Selma Cotton Mill of 1896 in Alabama was the best-preserved example of Praray's mill design. The only surviving example with walls intact is one of the Holt mills in Haw River, North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|During {{the next}} few years the {{organization}} of the Reclamation Service was completed and plans outlined for extensive work in each of the western states, work being initiated in most of these. In 1907, when Mr. Walcott left the Geological Survey to become Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Reclamation Service was organized as a separate bureau of the Department of the Interior with Mr. Newell as Director and Arthur P. Davis as <b>Chief</b> <b>Engineer.</b> <b>Construction</b> was rapidly pushed until twenty-six projects, including reservoirs, canals and related works were completed in whole or part, notably the Roosevelt, Shoshone, Arrowrock, Gunnison Tunnels and others, involving the investment of over $100,000,000, in 100 dams, of which ten form reservoirs of national importance also 25 mi of tunnels, 13000 mi of irrigating canals and ditches with regulating works, bridges, steam and hydro-electric generators, transmission lines, pumps and devices connected with supplying water to 20,000 farms. Special efforts were made to attain the highest practicable economy and efficiency in the execution of the work and to meet the need and desires of the settlers under them.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1918 and 1920 Graftio was {{the first}} deputy of the <b>chief</b> <b>construction</b> <b>engineer</b> of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station, the first {{hydroelectric}} station to be built according to the plan. In February 1920, Graftio was included into the committee charged to draft the GOELRO plan, the program to provide sufficient electric power needed for future industrialization of Soviet Russia and, eventually, the Soviet Union. In the committee, {{he was responsible for}} the sections dealing with transportation and with the electrification of the Caucasus areas. The plan was drafted in December 1920. Since early 1921, he was the <b>chief</b> <b>construction</b> <b>engineer</b> until the construction was completed in 1927. [...] On 21 March 1921 he was arrested on the charges of counterrevolutionary activity, but was freed after several months due to intervention of Gleb Krzhizhanovsky, who needed Graftio to continue working on the construction. After 1927, he was the chief engineer of the construction of the Svir Hydroelectric Station, opened in 1933. Between 1938 and 1945 Graftio was the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Energy, tasked with the power plant construction. In particular, he was responsible for the program of the restoration of the stations destroyed during World War II. He died in 1949 in Leningrad.|$|E

Mattoon, the <b>chief</b> <b>construction</b> <b>engineer</b> working for the Terre Haute and Alton Railroad and partner of the Massachusetts firm [...] "Phelps, Mattoon, and Barnes." [...] The reason for the honor is unclear; some say he won the naming rights because his rail crew arrived first. Others say he beat other claimants in a card game, or that Pegtown {{residents}} hoped the wealthy Mattoon would invest in the town if they named it after him. With its combination of excellent transportation and remarkably fertile prairie soils, Mattoon expanded rapidly.
