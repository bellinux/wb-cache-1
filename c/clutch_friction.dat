50|$|The 4-speed {{automatic}} transmission in 1999 to 2001 models had {{serious problems with}} transmission durability. Honda spokesman Mike Spencer stated that four-speed models were afflicted with a bad bearing that could break apart, scattering fragments of metal that clogged fluid passageways in the transmission, causing it to shift erratically. Honda responded to the problems by extending the warranty on the transmission on American 1999-2001 models to 7 years or 100000 mi. A class action settlement further extended coverage to 109000 mi or 93 months for some 1999-2001 Odysseys in the US. Canada is not included. The five-speed automatic was first installed in the Odyssey for the 2002 model, but general reliability of the 1999-2003 transmission was poor according to Consumer Reports. Mike Spencer, a spokesman for Honda, said that the five-speed models typically were damaged by premature wear of the third-gear clutch pack. As the <b>clutch</b> <b>friction</b> material abraded, it scattered bits inside the transmission case, clogging fluid lines and causing erratic shifting. Drivers might suffer slipping, poor or no shifts, or sudden down-shifts from 5th gear to 2nd gear.|$|E

40|$|The torque {{coordination}} control during mode {{transition is}} a very important task for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with a clutch serving as the key enabling actuator element. Poor coordination will deteriorate the drivability of the driver and lead to excessive wearing to the <b>clutch</b> <b>friction</b> plates. In this paper, a novel torque coordination control strategy for a single-shaft parallel hybrid electric vehicle is presented to coordinate the motor torque, engine torque, and clutch torque so that the seamless mode switching can be achieved. Different to the existing model predictive control (MPC) methods, only one model predictive controller is needed and the clutch torque is taken as an optimized variable rather than a known parameter. Furthermore, the successful idea of model reference control (MRC) is also used for reference to generate the set-point signal required by MPC. The parameter sensitivity is studied for better performance of the proposed model predictive controller. The simulation results validate that the proposed novel torque coordination control strategy has less vehicle jerk, less torque interruption, and smaller clutch frictional losses, compared with the baseline method. In addition, the sensitivity and adaptiveness of the proposed novel torque coordination control strategy are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} a {{continuous}} investigation of the roles played by the tribofilm on dry automotive clutch system performance. Tribological experiments were performed {{by the addition of}} wear debris at the beginning of tribometer tests and by reducing the surface roughness of a cast iron counter-face. The initial surface conditions of cast discs were 0. 2 and 1. 2 µm.

When the wear debris was added into the tribosystem, the friction coefficient level dropped drastically while the assembly wear rate rose. In contrast, the modified cast discs provided a reduced wear rate of assembly and a higher and more stable friction coefficient level. These improvements were obtained in a severe condition where higher temperature levels were reached. For the tests with added debris, SEM observations revealed a more intense tribofilm development over the worn surfaces of the <b>clutch</b> <b>friction</b> material.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Clutch take-up judder is a {{torsional}} vibration phenomenon induced by stick-slip oscillations at the friction lining interfaces between the <b>clutch</b> <b>friction</b> disc and the flywheel and pressure plate surfaces {{during the process}} of clutch engagement. This is short-lived transient phenomenon affected by the clutch lining material’s friction characteristics, topography of the mating-sliding surfaces and operational conditions during engagement such as contact pressure, interfacial slip speed and contact temperature. The phenomenon leads to driver discomfort as well as gradual wear of contacting surfaces, even if short-lived. Its frequency is is usually reported to be in the range 5 - 20 Hz depending on the vehicle type. The friction characteristics alter in a transient manner during engagement and it should be measured under controlled conditions. In this paper the measured interfacial friction characteristics together with clamp load variation (contact pressure) under different surface temperatures are included in a multi-degree of freedom dynamic analysis to obtain torsional vibrations of the system, pertaining to take up judder conditions. Such an in-depth investigation has not hitherto been reported in literature. The paper shows that take up stick-slip judder is omnipresent under all clutch engagement conditions, but its poignancy is most evident at cold surface temperatures.

40|$|Wet {{friction}} clutches are machine elements enabling the power transmission from {{an input shaft}} to an output shaft during the operation, based on the friction occurring in lubricated contacting surfaces. These components {{play a critical role}} in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions, power shift transmissions and limited slip differentials. An unexpected failure occurring in clutches can lead to an unexpected total breakdown of the vehicle. This undesirable situation can put human safety at risk, possibly cause long-term vehicle down times, and eventually result in high maintenance costs. In order to minimize the negative impacts, an optimal maintenance strategy, i. e. a condition based maintenance (CBM), driven by an accurate condition monitoring and prognostics therefore needs to be developed and implemented for wet {{friction clutches}}. A literature study has been carried out during this work in order to establish the state-of-the-art development of clutch monitoring and prognostics systems. Despite the fact that the performance demands for clutches increase, research in this direction is apparently very limited. Several methods related to this aspect have been reported in literature, but, they are not sufficiently pragmatic and flexible to implement for real-life applications. To fill this substantial gap, development of a clutch monitoring and prognostics method that can be easily implemented on real-life applications is the main objective of this thesis. There are two main failure modes that can interrupt the functionality of wet friction clutches as reported in the literature, namely (i) lubricant and (ii) friction material degradations. This thesis mainly focuses on the failure of wet friction clutches caused by the friction material degradation, which is a valid assumption for heavy-duty applications. In this scope, a better understanding of how friction material degradation affects the clutch dynamic behavior during its operation is of paramount importance for developing an effective clutch monitoring and prognostics system. In the first place, this thesis contributes to the contact modeling of nominally flat rough surfaces with asymmetric asperity heights distribution, which is relevant for clutch contact problems. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art of the <b>clutch</b> <b>friction</b> characteristics is established that leads to the derivation of a friction model appropriate for clutches, wherein some considerably important friction phenomena are taken into account. Subsequently, the effects of two major friction material degradation mechanisms, namely (i) adhesive wear and (ii) thermal degradation, on the clutch contact and friction characteristics are theoretically and experimentally investigated, which is the second contribution of this thesis. A novel experimental procedure, which is the third contribution, is proposed in order to systematically evaluate how the sliding friction characteristics of a clutch evolve during the lifetime. This way, the evolution of the frictionmodel parameters can be observed and quantified. A knowledge gained from the aforementioned evolution motivates to model and simulate the dynamic responses of a degrading clutch system. Based on the simulation results, some measurable ``features'' representing the progression of the <b>clutch</b> <b>friction</b> material degradation are derived, which is the fourth contribution. A feasibility study on the derived features recommends to develop two clutch monitoring methods: i. e. (a) post-lockup-features-based method and (b) pre-lockup-features-based method. In the first monitoring method, which is the fifth contribution, the torsional natural frequency and the corresponding damping extracted from the post-lockup torsional vibration signals are proposed as relevant features. The second monitoring method, which is the sixth contribution, utilizes the relative velocity signals of interest for extracting the relevant features, i. e. (i) the normalized engagement duration, (ii) normalized Euclidean distance and (iii) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distance. In order to evaluate and verify the developed monitoring methods, accelerated life tests (ALTs) were carried out on some commercial wet clutches using a fully instrumented SAE # 2 test setup which is designed by an industrial partner, Dana-Spicer Off Highway Belgium. The experimental results confirm that the developed monitoring methods are feasible to be used for practical applications. As the last contribution, a data-driven health assessment and prognostics method which can be used to assess the condition and to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of wet friction clutches is developed. This strategy has been successfully evaluated and verified on some commercially available wet clutches. The evaluation and verification show that the developed strategy is prospective for aiding a condition based maintenance for wet friction clutches. nrpages: 284 status: publishe...|$|E

Consequently, change of the contact stiffness can affect the normal-mode dynamic behavior. If this hypothesis holds, condition of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> can also be monitored based on the change of the normal-mode dynamic behavior. In order to verify the hypothesis, in this study, accelerated lifetime tests (ALTs) were carried out on two paper-based wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> under different operations using an SAE# 2 test setup. The normal-mode vibration signal is measured every 200 duty cycles by using an accelerometer axially mounted on the bearing housing of the clutch.
