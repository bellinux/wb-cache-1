500|$|Some critics felt season 13 was an {{improvement}} over the previous Scully seasons. DVDDizzy rhetorically asked how the season [...] "stand up for someone just looking to jump into a full, semi-recent year of episodes", answering [...] "Pretty darn well". It explained [...] "Nearly everything that makes [...] "The Simpsons" [...] what it is can be found here. Most important is the large cast of Springfield residents used to perfection...Clearly, real thought and lots of it goes into each episode's creation", and added [...] "it's almost miraculous how fresh and sharp [...] "The Simpsons" [...] remains in its thirteenth year on air". The site explained [...] "Not every moment here is brilliant. After a rocky start, the season really hits its groove a few episodes in. Even though jokes don't always land, there are guaranteed {{to be at least}} a few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't changed all that much. There are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from way back in the early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out." [...] Casey Burchby of DVD Talk gave the season a 3/5 and wrote [...] "the thirteenth season is further proof of the regrettable change in comic tone that the series took on {{in the early part of}} the last decade." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lucy Liu {{immediately}} {{agreed to}} play the lead character of ‘Sadie.’ She admitted, “I first read the script at 3:00am {{in the morning and}} so I understood the project from that perspective, what it needed and what the character was about. It wasn’t strictly horror—it has an incredible emotional undercurrent, that and it had a thriller, noir quality about it.”She continued, “I met Sebastian {{a couple of days later}} and we hit it off. It’s hard to explain, but sometimes you just connect with things; this script and Sebastian were things that I connected with.” Gutierrez stated it was not a film just about revenge, “Rise is a serial killer movie in which our protagonist is the serial killer, and we, the audience, want her to commit the killings. If it was just a straight revenge tale, it becomes more of an action movie—I am interested in the emotional moments.” He added, “At the heart of the story there is this emotional core. It’s very sad—Sadie’s been killed. It’s the worst thing that <b>could</b> possibly <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> She is trying to understand it, put an end to those that wronged her, and die again. There is this sense of dread, of the wrong that has already happened and you can’t correct it—you just learn to understand it—or not.” “Sadie has become something that she doesn’t want to be and she struggles with that for the entire film and tries to do the right thing under those circumstances which you know is a pretty tough thing for her to go through.” Liu continued, “Sadie wants to be alive again, but she can’t have that. What is her option? What is her choice? She tries to kill herself — but no, that’s not going to work, so she chooses this path. It’s a story where people die for a reason.” As ‘Sadie,’ a reporter who transforms herself into a killer once she realizes it’s the only way she can avenge her murderers, Liu revealed, “She’s a normal person that’s caught up in this insane situation. She comes on really strong, and then as we watch the movie, we see that she’s completely unraveled and must become a soldier and warrior.” ...|$|R

Golly, {{it was so}} good <b>to</b> hear from <b>you.</b> I wanted <b>to</b> write 2 ̆ 6 answer it right away but couldn’t manage. What a madhouse I live in. Per usual I’m at work now. It’s always hard to write {{with a bunch of}} girls talking <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Everyone right now is pretty quiet. Something must have {{happened}} because {{this is the first time}} since I’ve been here that we’ve been quiet—all of us. It’s probably a darn good thing that <b>you</b> didn’t have <b>to</b> take that check on Monday. Oh, did you get lost on that Cross Country thing? How was it? Where abouts in Pennsylvania did you go? (I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt in assuming that <b>you</b> even got <b>to</b> Pennsylvania.) Well, it’s too bad about the tickets for Saturday night but it’s probably just as well. It was a nice idea anyhow. What’s this song, “This <b>Could</b> <b>Happen</b> <b>To</b> Me?” Do <b>you</b> by any chance mean “It <b>Could</b> <b>Happen</b> <b>To</b> You?” As far as I can remember, which isn’t very far, I’ve never heard your version. Well, Judson, if the life I’ve been leading lately keeps up, you’ll have your wish about me being very dull, uninteresting and homely. It’s really sad. My bags are practically suitcases. Sleep is something which I haven’t had any of. Time certainly flies when you come home. The weekend gets shorter 2 ̆ 6 shorter every time. When <b>you</b> do learn <b>to</b> speak in shorthand teach me. That would be wonderful. We should or at least I should, write down all the things I want <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> <b>you</b> 2 ̆ 6 then read them off. That picture you sent me was absolutely darling. It’s so cute! But—I still want those pictures of you in front of the plane or whatever it is. The pictures we took last weekend haven’t come back yet but when they do, if they’re any good I’ll have a set made and send them <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Well, honey, please write soon. You’ll be home in two more days. It seems as though someone threw an extra two hundred days in this week. Hope you can read this. Be good 2 ̆ 6 take care of yourself.

It was all very well, while my uncle was laying down the law--with Lady Lundie in a rage, and the dogs barking, and the doors banging, and all that. The excitement kept me up. But when my uncle had gone, and the dreadful gray, quiet, rainy evening came, and it had all calmed down again, there was no bearing it. The house--without you--was like a tomb. If I had had Arnold with me I might have done very well. But I was all by myself. Think of that! Not a soul to speak to! There wasn't a horrible thing that <b>could</b> possibly <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that I didn't fancy was going <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> I went into your empty room and looked at your things. That settled it, my darling! I rushed down stairs--carried away, positively carried away, by an Impulse beyond human resistance. How could I help it? I ask any reasonable person how could I help it? I ran to the stables and found Jacob. Impulse--all impulse! I said, 'Get the pony-chaise--I must have a drive--I don't care if it rains--you come with me.' All in a breath, and all impulse! Jacob behaved like an angel. He said, 'All right, miss.' I am perfectly certain Jacob would die for me if I asked him. He is drinking hot grog at this moment, {{to prevent him from}} catching cold, by my express orders. He had the pony-chaise out in two minutes; and off we went. Lady Lundie, my dear, prostrate in her own room--too much sal volatile. I hate her. The rain got worse. I didn't mind it. Jacob didn't mind it. The pony didn't mind it. They had both caught my impulse--especially the pony. It didn't come on to thunder till some time afterward; and then we were nearer Craig Fernie than Windygates--to say nothing of your being at one place and not at the other. The lightning was quite awful on the moor. If I had had one of the horses, he would have been frightened. The pony shook his darling little head, and dashed through it. He is to have beer. A mash with beer in it--by my express orders. When he has done we'll borrow a lantern, and go into the stable, and kiss him. In the mean time, my dear, here I am--wet through in a thunderstorm, which doesn't in the least matter--and determined to satisfy my own mind about you, which matters a great deal, and must and shall be done before I rest to-night!" ...|$|R

But {{she said she did}} not want to see it; only he must be careful; and she kissed him again and let him go, and when he got away he could see her wiping her eyes. It seemed to him that she was crying a good deal in those days, and he could not {{understand}} what it was about. She was scared at any little thing, and would whoop at the least noise, and when his father would say: [...] "Lucy, my dear girl!" [...] she would burst out crying and say that she could not help it. But she got better and better to Pony all the time, and it was this that now made him ashamed with Jim Leonard, because it made him not want to run off so much.|$|E

No honest man, no man who was not always a rogue at heart, could have done what you've done; juggled with the books for years, and bewitched the record so by your infernal craft, that it was never suspected till now. You've given mind to your scoundrelly work, sir; all the mind you had; for if you hadn't been so anxious to steal successfully, you'd have given more mind to the use of your stealings. You may have some of them left, but it looks as if you'd made ducks and drakes of them, like any petty rascal {{in the hands of the}} Employees' Insurance Company. Yes, sir, I believe you're of about the intellectual calibre of that sort of thief. I can't respect you even on your own ground. But I'm willing to give you the chance you ask, for your daughter's sake. She's been in and out of my house with my girl like one of my own children, and I won't send her father to jail if I can help it. Understand! I haven't any sentiment for you, Northwick. You're the kind of rogue I'd like to see in a convict's jacket, learning to make shoe-brushes. But you shall have your chance to go home and see if you can pay up somehow, and you sha'n't be shadowed while you're at it. You shall keep your outside to the world three days longer, you whited sepulchre; but if you want to know, I think the best thing that <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on your way home would be a good railroad accident." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You're {{doing the}} humble {{dependent}} now," [...] he said: [...] "you do it beautifully, {{as you do}} everything." [...] She replied that she didn't make it humble enough--she couldn't; she was too proud, too insolent in her triumph. She liked that, the triumph, too much, and she didn't mind telling him she was perfectly happy. Of course as yet the triumph was very limited; but success was success, whatever its quantity; the dish was a small one but had the right taste. Her imagination had already bounded beyond the first phase unexpectedly great as this had been: her position struck her as modest compared with the probably future now vivid to her. Peter {{had never seen her}} so soft and sympathetic; she had insisted in Paris that her personal character was that of the good girl--she used the term in a fine loose way--and it was impossible to be a better girl than she showed herself this pleasant afternoon. She was full of gossip and anecdote and drollery; she had exactly the air he would have wished her to have--that of thinking of no end of things to tell him. It was as if she had just returned from a long journey and had had strange adventures and made wonderful discoveries. She began to speak of this and that, then broke off to speak of something else; she talked of the theatre, of the [...] "critics," [...] and above all of London, of the people she had met and the extraordinary things they said to her, of the parts she was going to take up, of lots of new ideas that had come to her about the art of comedy. She wanted to do comedy now--to do the comedy of London life. She was delighted to find that seeing more of the world suggested things to her; they came straight from the fact, from nature, if you could call it nature; she was thus convinced more than ever that the artist ought to live so as to get on with his business, gathering ideas and lights from experience--ought to welcome any experience that would give him lights. But work of course was experience, and everything in one's life that was good was work. That was the jolly thing in the actor's trade--it made up for other elements that were odious: if you only kept your eyes open nothing <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that wouldn't be food for observation and grist to your mill, showing you how people looked and moved and spoke, cried and grimaced, writhed and dissimulated, in given situations. She saw all round her things she wanted to [...] "do"--London bristled with them if you had eyes to see. She was fierce to know why people didn't take them up, put them into plays and parts, give one a chance with them; she expressed her sharp impatience of the general literary bétise. She had never been chary of this particular displeasure, and there were moments--it was an old story and a subject of frank raillery to Sherringham--when to hear her you might have thought there was no cleverness anywhere but in her own splendid impatience. She wanted tremendous things done that she might use them, but she didn't pretend to say exactly what they were to be, nor even approximately how they were to be handled: her ground was rather that if she only had a pen--it was exasperating to have to explain! She mainly contented herself with the view that nothing had really been touched: she felt that more and more as she saw more of people's goings-on.|$|E
