5|$|Yttrium {{has been}} studied as a nodulizer in ductile cast iron, forming the {{graphite}} into compact nodules instead of flakes to increase ductility and fatigue resistance. Having a high melting point, yttrium oxide is used in some ceramic and glass to impart shock resistance and low thermal expansion properties. Those same properties make such glass useful in <b>camera</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|E
5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle <b>camera</b> <b>lenses,</b> microscopy, and the core part of optical fibers. It has replaced titania as the dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption. GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties, such as that used in rewritable DVDs.|$|E

25|$|Cameron {{quit his}} job as a truck driver to enter the film {{industry}} after seeing Star Wars in 1977.

25|$|In modern times, more {{sophisticated}} surface coatings have been developed; these include violet-blue dyes and vacuum-sputtered films resembling the magnesium fluoride coating on <b>camera</b> <b>lenses.</b> These coatings effectively whiten the apparent {{color of a}} yellow-tinted diamond, because the two colors are complementary and act to cancel each other out. Usually only applied to the pavilion or girdle region of a diamond, these coatings are among the hardest treatments to detect—while the dyes may be removed in hot water or alcohol with ease, the vacuum-sputtered films require a dip in sulfuric acid to remove. The films can be detected under high magnification {{by the presence of}} raised areas where air bubbles are trapped, and by worn areas where the coating has been scratched off. These treatments are considered fraudulent unless disclosed.|$|E
25|$|In the Mk I PR Type B (also {{known as}} Medium Range (MR)) {{conversions}} which followed, the F24 <b>camera</b> <b>lenses</b> were upgraded to an eight-inch (203mm) focal length, giving images up {{to a third}} larger in scale. An extra 29 gal (132 l) fuel tank was installed in the rear fuselage. It had been envisaged that much larger cameras would be installed in the fuselage immediately behind the pilot, {{but at the time}} RAF engineers believed this would upset the Spitfire's centre of gravity. Cotton was able to demonstrate that by removing lead weights, which had been installed in the extreme rear fuselage to balance the weight of the constant speed propeller units, it was possible to install cameras with longer focal-length lens in the fuselage. The Type B was the first to dispense with the heavy bullet resistant windscreen. Many of these early PR Spitfires were fitted with the Merlin XII engine and Rotol constant-speed propeller with the early, blunt spinner of the Spitfire Mk II.|$|E

500|$|Another {{frequently}} used technique is Hooper's tendency {{to use a}} variety of focal length <b>camera</b> <b>lenses</b> to distort the resulting picture. In The Damned United he used a 10mm lens, notably in the scene where Clough stays inside during the Derby–Leeds match. Hooper operated the camera in this scene himself. In The King's Speech, Hooper used [...] "typically 14mm, 18mm, 21mm, 25mm and 27mm" [...] lenses and put the camera close to the actors' faces. Hooper said the use of this method in the first consulting room scene served to [...] "suggest the awkwardness and tension of Logue and Bertie's first meeting".|$|E
500|$|The {{movie was}} filmed {{in a process}} known as [...] "MGM Camera 65". 1957's Raintree County was the first MGM film to use the process. The MGM Camera 65 used special 65mm Eastmancolor film stock with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio. 70mm {{anamorphic}} <b>camera</b> <b>lenses</b> developed by the Mitchell Camera Company were manufactured to specifications submitted by MGM. These lenses squeezed the image down 1.25 times to fit on the image area of the film stock. Because the film could be adapted to the requirements of individual theaters, movie houses did not need to install special, expensive 70mm projection equipment. Six of the 70mm lenses, each worth $100,000, were shipped to Rome for use by the production.|$|E

[...] He had complained to Roddenberry of Barrett's acting skills, but stopped when {{he became aware of}} their relationship. It was only after Barrett's first appearance as Lwaxana Troi in the [...] episode [...] "", that he came to realize that it was the Chapel character he disliked, not Barrett herself and told her that his opinion had changed. Barrett also didn't care for the character of Chapel, saying [...] "I've never been a real aficionado of Nurse Chapel, I figured she was kind of weak and namdy-pamdy." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{innovation}} {{of the era}} secured Panavision's leading position: the Auto Panatar {{camera lens}} for 35mm anamorphic productions. Early CinemaScope <b>camera</b> <b>lenses</b> were notoriously problematic in close-ups with an optical aberration that was commonly known as [...] "the mumps": a widening of the face due {{to a loss of}} anamorphic power as a subject approaches the lens. Because of the novelty of the new anamorphic process, early CinemaScope productions compensated for this aberration by avoiding tightly framed shots. As the anamorphic process became more popular, it became more problematic. Panavision invented a solution: adding a rotating lens element that moved in mechanical sync with the focus ring. This eliminated the distortion and allowed for natural close-up anamorphic photography. The Auto Panatar, released in 1958, was rapidly adopted, eventually making CinemaScope lenses obsolete. This innovation earned Panavision the first of its 15 Academy Awards for technical achievement. Soon the screen credit [...] "Filmed in Panavision" [...] (as if Panavision itself were a widescreen format) began appearing on motion picture screen credits.|$|E
500|$|The high {{melting point}} and {{oxidation}} resistance lead {{to the use of}} the metal in the production of vacuum furnace parts. Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts, such as thermowells, valve bodies, and tantalum fasteners. Due to its high density, shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum. Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and {{high melting point}}. [...] It is also occasionally used in precious watches e.g. from Audemars Piguet, F.P. Journe, Hublot, Montblanc, Omega, and Panerai. Tantalum is also highly bioinert and is used as an orthopedic implant material. The high stiffness of tantalum makes it necessary to use it as highly porous foam or scaffold with lower stiffness for hip replacement implants to avoid stress shielding. Because tantalum is a non-ferrous, non-magnetic metal, these implants are considered to be acceptable for patients undergoing MRI procedures. The oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for <b>camera</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the <b>camera</b> <b>lenses,</b> making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E

[...] The song begins with the chorus, in which Aguilera sings, [...] "Everyone thinks that I have it all / But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (These castle walls) / If I should tumble if I should fall/ Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls? / There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls."

2500|$|Lens transmittances of 60%–90% are typical, so T-stops are {{sometimes}} {{used instead of}} f-numbers to more accurately determine exposure, particularly when using external light meters. [...] T-stops are often used in cinematography, where many images are seen in rapid succession and even small changes in exposure will be noticeable. Cinema <b>camera</b> <b>lenses</b> are typically calibrated in T-stops instead of f-numbers.
