40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} uncertainty {{into the}} growth {{function of the}} Schaefer model for the optimal management of a biological resource. There is a <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> for the biological stock, and it is optimal to do no harvesting if the biological stock is below that <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> and to exert whatever harvesting effort is necessary to prevent the stock from rising above that <b>critical</b> <b>value.</b> The introduction of uncertainty increases the <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> of the stock. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} of exceedance {{is the number}} of times a stochastic process exceeds some <b>critical</b> <b>value,</b> usually a <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> far from the process' mean, per unit time. Counting exceedance of the <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> can be accomplished either by counting peaks of the process that exceed the <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> or by counting upcrossings of the <b>critical</b> <b>value,</b> where an upcrossing is an event where the instantaneous value of the process crosses the <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> with positive slope. This article assumes the two methods of counting exceedance are equivalent and that the process has one upcrossing and one peak per exceedance. However, processes, especially continuous processes with high frequency components to their power spectral densities, may have multiple upcrossings or multiple peaks in rapid succession before the process reverts to its mean.|$|R

25|$|For a {{continuously}} {{differentiable function}} of several real variables, a point P (that {{is a set}} of values for the input variables, which is viewed as a point in Rn) is critical if all of the partial derivatives of the function are zero at P, or, equivalently, if its gradient is zero.

25|$|There is {{substantial}} incidental catches in fishing operations. Often, the Harbour Porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is killed by incidental by-catch (10, 11, 12). Gillnets pose {{a serious threat}} to the harbour porpoise as they are extremely susceptible to entanglement. A study by Caswell et al. in the western North Atlantic combined the mean annual rate of increase of the harbour porpoise with the uncertainty of incidental mortality and population size. It was found that the incidental mortality exceeds <b>critical</b> <b>values</b> and therefore by-catch is a significant threat to the harbour porpoise. Harbour porpoises become entangled in nets due to their inability to detect the nets before collision. In 2001, 80 harbour porpoises were killed in salmon gillnet fisheries in British Columbia, Canada.|$|E
25|$|In other {{departments}} of physics may be mentioned his {{paper on the}} conduction of heat in crystals (1851) and his inquiries in connection with Crookes radiometer; his explanation of the light border frequently noticed in photographs just outside {{the outline of a}} dark body seen against the sky (1883); and, still later, his theory of the x-rays, which he suggested might be transverse waves travelling as innumerable solitary waves, not in regular trains. Two long papers published in 1849 – one on attractions and Clairaut's theorem, and the other on the variation of gravity at {{the surface of the earth}} (1849)—also demand notice, as do his mathematical memoirs on the <b>critical</b> <b>values</b> of sums of periodic series (1847) and on the numerical calculation of a class of definite integrals and infinite series (1850) and his discussion of a differential equation relating to the breaking of railway bridges (1849), research related to his evidence given to the Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in Railway structures after the Dee bridge disaster of 1847.|$|E
40|$|Steady-state {{detached}} solidification {{of water}} was calculated using the Moving Meniscus Model. Similar {{to the experimental}} observation of many materials in microgravity, detached solidification of water is predicted to occur in a sealed ampoule at zero gravity under proper conditions. For steady detachment, the freezing rate must exceed a <b>critical</b> <b>value,</b> Henry’s constant of the dissolved gas must be below a <b>critical</b> <b>value,</b> {{the temperature of the}} top of the water must be below a <b>critical</b> <b>value,</b> the contact angle of water on the ampoule wall must exceed a <b>critical</b> <b>value,</b> and the diffusion coefficient must exceed a <b>critical</b> <b>value.</b> Each <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> depends on the physical properties and the other operating conditions. Thus different results are obtained for InSb and water. The critical gas pressure above the melt for water is much smaller than for InSb, the critical freezing rate is larger for water, and the critical contact angle of the melt on the ampoule wall is larger for water.
