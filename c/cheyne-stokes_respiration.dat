40|$|Severe {{congestive}} heart failure (CHF) is associated with <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> (C-S) <b>respiration,</b> which may be an index of poorer prognosis. The mechanisms linking C-S respiration to poorer functional status and prognosis in patients with CHF are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that C-S respiration increases muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in 9 patients with CHF. Oxygen saturation was 96 +/- 1 % during normal breathing and 91 +/- 1 % after the apneic episodes (p < 0. 05). Mean blood pressure was 79 +/- 8 mm Hg during normal breathing and 85 +/- 8 mm Hg during C-S respiration (p = 0. 001). C-S respiration increased MSNA burst frequency (from 45 +/- 5 bursts/min during normal breathing to 50 +/- 5 bursts/min during C-S respiration; p < 0. 05) and total integrated nerve activity (to 117 +/- 7 %; p < 0. 05). We also studied an additional 5 patients in whom C-S breathing was constant, without any periods of spontaneous normal breathing. In these patients, MSNA was higher (65 +/- 5 bursts/min) than MSNA in patients in whom C-S breathing was only intermittent (45 +/- 5 bursts/min; p < 0. 05). In all 14 patients, the effects of different phases of C-S respiration were examined. MSNA was highest {{during the second half}} of each apnea (increasing to 152 +/- 14 %; p < 0. 01) and blood pressure was highest during mild hyperventilation occurring after termination of apnea (p < 0. 0001). We conclude that C-S respiration decreases oxygen saturation, increases MSNA, and induces transient elevations in blood pressure in patients with CHF. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

50|$|They are physiologically {{interlinked}} in that (for {{any given}} patient) circulation time decreases as cardiac output increases.

40|$|<b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> {{is a form}} of {{periodic}} {{breathing in}} which central apneas and hypopneas alternate with periods of hyperventilation, producing a waxing and waning pattern of tidal volume. This review focuses on the causes and consequences of <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> in patients with congestive heart failure, in whom the prevalence is strikingly high and ranges from 30 % to 50 %. Several factors have been implicated in the genesis of <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration,</b> including low cardiac output and recurrent hypoxia. The key pathophysiological mechanism triggering <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> is hyperventilation and low arterial CO 2 (PaCO 2) that when below the apneic threshold triggers a central apnea. Hyperventilation is associated with pulmonary congestion, and <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> is more prone to occur during sleep, when the respiratory system is mainly dependent on chemical control. It is associated with recurrent dips in oxygen saturation and arousals from sleep, with oscillations in blood pressure and heart rate, sympathetic activation and increased risk of ventricular tachycardia. <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> is an independent marker of poor prognosis and may participate in a vicious cycle, further stressing the failing heart...|$|E

The central apnoea–hypopnoea index was highest in sleep stages 1 and 2, and lowest in slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was test the strength of this relationship in unselected patients admitted to hospital due to decompensated chronic heart failure. Methods We evaluated 191 patients (32 % women), mean age 73 years, ready for discharge from the heart failure unit in the University Hospital of Malmö, Sweden. The patients underwent echocardiography for determination of left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular inner diastolic diameter. A respiratory investigation during sleep was performed the last night before discharge. Results We found that 66 % of the patients had <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> more than 10 % of the total recording time. Only 7 (3. 6 %) of the patients had predominantly obstructive apnoeas. There was a significant but very weak relationship between left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular inner diastolic diameter on one hand and <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> on the other. Age was a stronger determinant of <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> than any of the cardiac or other clinical variables. Conclusion Although presence of <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> indicates left ventricular dysfunction, its severity seems only weakly related to the severity of heart failure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{document}} {{the degree of}} cognitive impairment in stable heart failure, and to determine its relation {{to the presence of}} <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> during sleep.  SUBJECTS— 104 heart failure patients and 21  healthy normal volunteers.  METHODS—Overnight oximetry was used (previously validated as a screening tool for <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> in heart failure). Cognitive function was assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests. Left ventricular function was assessed by echocardiography.  RESULTS—Heart failure patients performed worse than the healthy volunteers in tests that measured vigilance. Reaction times were 48 % slower (0. 89  (0. 03) s v 0. 60  (0. 05) s; p <  0. 005) and they hit twice as many obstacles on the Steer Clear simulator (75  (6. 4) v 33  (4. 6); p <  0. 005).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of nasal nocturnal oxygen therapy on respiration, sleep, exercise capacity, cognitive function and daytime symptoms in patients with congestive heart failure and <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration.</b> Background. <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> is common in patients with congestive heart failure and is associated with significant nocturnal oxygen desaturation and sleep disruption with arousals. Oxygen desaturations and arousals cause an increase in pulmonary artery pressure and sympathoneural activity and therefore may reduce exercise capacity. Oxygen is an effective treatment of <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> and should improve exercise capacity in these patients. Methods. The study was designed as a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial: 22 patients were assigned to 1 week each of nocturnal oxygen and room air. After each week, polysomnography, maximal bicycle exercise with expiratory gas analysis and trail-making test were performed, and a health assessment chart was completed. Results. Noturnal oxygen significantly reduced the duration of <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> (162 ± 142 vs. 88 ± 105 min [mean ± SD]; p < 0. 005). Sleep improved as evidenced by less stage 1 sleep and fewer arousals (20 ± 13 vs. 15 ± 9 /h total sleep time; p < 0. 05) as well as more stage 2 and slow-wave sleep; nocturnal oxygen saturation also improved. Peak oxygen consumption during exercise testing increased after oxygen treatment (835 ± 395 vs. 960 ± 389 ml/min; p < 0. 05). Cognitive function evaluated by the trail-making test improved, but daytime symptoms in the health assessment chart did not improve significantly. Conclusions.

40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} sleep disordered breathing within a United Kingdom heart failure population.  Subjects— 104 patients and 21  matched normal volunteers.  Methods—Overnight home pulse oximetry with simultaneous ECG recording in the patient group; daytime sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS); 41  patients underwent polysomnography to assess the validity of oximetry as a screening test for <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration.</b>  Results—Home oximetry was a good screening test for <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration</b> (specificity 81 %, sensitivity 87 %). Patients with poorer New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes had higher sleepiness scores (p <  0. 005). Twenty three patients had "abnormal" patterns of nocturnal desaturation suggestive of <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b> <b>respiration.</b> The mean (SEM) frequency of dips in SaO 2 exceeding 4 % was 10. 3  (0. 9) per hour in the patients and 4. 8  (0. 6) in normal controls (p <  0. 005). Ejection fraction correlated negatively with dip frequency (r = − 0. 5. p <  0. 005). The patient subgroup with ⩾  15 dips/hour had a higher mean (SEM) NYHA class (3. 0  (0. 2) v 2. 3  (0. 1), p <  0. 05), and experienced more ventricular ectopy (220  (76) v 78  (21) beats/hour, p <  0. 05). There was no excess of serious arrhythmia.  Conclusions—Nocturnal desaturation is common in patients with treated heart failure. Low ejection fraction was related to dip frequency.
