5|$|In {{the final}} days before the {{entrance}} of the United States into World War I, the US military was concerned that Germany was planning to purchase or seize the Danish West Indies for use as a submarine or zeppelin base. At the time, <b>Charlotte</b> <b>Amalie</b> on Saint Thomas was considered the best port in the Caribbean outside of Cuba, and Coral Bay on Saint John was considered the safest harbor in the area. Although the United States was not yet at war with Germany, the US signed a treaty to purchase the territory from Denmark for 25 million dollars on March 28, 1917. President Woodrow Wilson nominated James Harrison Oliver to be the first military governor. The United States announced plans to build a naval base in the territory to aid in the protection of the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May, Falke {{arrived in}} Port of Spain in Trinidad before being ordered {{to the coast}} of Venezuela to {{safeguard}} German interests {{during a period of}} unrest there. While en route, she stopped in Fort-de-France, Martinique to pick up a load of food and medical supplies for the people living around Mont Pelee, which had recently erupted. She then proceeded to La Guaira and Carúpano in Venezuela to protect German nationals from expected fighting, and from June evacuated German and French nationals from the two cities to Saint Thomas. She was based out of the port of <b>Charlotte</b> <b>Amalie</b> in the Virgin Islands. During this period, she made stops in Carúpano, La Guaira, and Puerto Cabello, along with a visit to Willemstad in Curaçao. On 30 September, she was sent to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to protect German nationals there during a revolution in the country. At times, landing parties had to be sent ashore to protect the German consulate in Gonaïves.|$|E

5|$|The African colonies enabled Brandenburg-Prussia to {{participate}} in the Triangular trade, yet it lacked its own trading post in the Caribbean Sea. In 1684, Brandenburg-Prussia was denied the purchase of the French islands Sainte Croix and Saint Vincent. In November 1685, after a failed attempt to purchase Saint Thomas from Denmark–Norway, a Brandenburg-Danish agreement was reached that allowed the Brandenburg African Company to rent part of Saint Thomas as a base for 30 years, while the sovereignty remained with Denmark and administration with the Danish West Indies and Guinean Company. The first Brandenburgian vessel arrived in 1686 with 450 Slaves from Großfriedrichsburg. Brandenburg-Prussia was allotted an area near the capital city <b>Charlotte</b> <b>Amalie,</b> called Brandenburgery, and other territories named Krum Bay and Bordeaux Estates further west. In 1688, 300 Europeans and several hundred slaves lived on the Brandenburgian estates. In November 1695, French forces looted the Brandenburgian (not the Danish) colony. In 1731, the Brandenburg-Prussian company on Saint Thomas (BAAC) became insolvent, and abandoned the island in 1735. Their last remains were sold by auction in 1738.|$|E

25|$|That Esmit {{had been}} {{prepared}} for the present contingency {{there could be no}} doubt. The gold, silver, and other property {{that he was able to}} scrape together had been sent to the Dutch island of St. Eustatius, whence they were to be shipped to Flushing. Although Milan had been instructed only to secure the persons of Esmit and his family and to have them sent to Copenhagen, he took it upon himself to try to secure the latter's property as well, by sending Niels Lassen to Governor Houtcooper of St. Eustatius with an alleged copy of his instructions and a demand for the delivery of the goods. But neither this nor subsequent attempts availed the crafty governor. Instead of seeking redress through diplomatic channels, as his masters expected him to do, he authorized Captain Delicaet to take the company's ship <b>Charlotte</b> <b>Amalie</b> (named after <b>Charlotte</b> <b>Amalie</b> of Hesse-Kassel or Hesse-Cassel), find the skipper who had transported the goods and make his ship lawful prize. It was to avoid just this sort of complication that Esmit had been displaced. But Milan was an exponent of direct action, he sought advice from none, and the council dared not oppose his will.|$|E

Storm surge in the <b>Charlotte</b> <b>Amalie</b> harbor beached the USCGC Point Ledge and damaged many smaller boats. Elsewhere in the territory, there was moderate to severe damage on St. Croix and St. John.

50|$|The St. Thomas Synagogue stands {{north of}} <b>Charlotte</b> <b>Amalie's</b> central {{business}} district, {{on the north}} side of Crystal Gade near its junction with Raadets Gade.

Its front, separated from the street by an entry courtyard, has a Greek Revival temple front, but with Gothic arched window openings. The facade is recessed, with the temple pediment supported by brick pillars with Tuscan styling. On the interior, the Torah ark is located on the east wall, with the bimah, or pulpit, on a dais against the west wall.

25|$|Born in Georgetown, {{the capital}} of Guyana, Hamer emigrated to Sint Maarten with his family at an early age, {{learning}} to play cricket on the island. In August 2005, he played several matches for the Leeward Islands under-19 team, which included a haul of 3/35 in a one-day match against the Guyana under-19s.

25|$|On June 2, 1917, Adams and {{his entire}} Juvenile Band were {{inducted}} into the United States Navy, thus becoming the first African-Americans to receive official musical appointments in the U.S. Navy {{since at least the}} War of 1812 and making Adams the navy’s first black bandmaster. It was an exceptional situation inspired by exceptional circumstance: the need to build a bridge between an all-white naval administration and a predominantly black population. Adams used his authority as bandleader and Chief Petty Officer with the navy as a source of power, wealth, and influence. Their induction not only helped to defuse the racial tension that plagued the navy’s presence on the island during World War I, but the band, and Adams in particular, functioned as educators to naval administrators about the needs and attitudes of Virgin Islanders. Further, Adams continued to grow into his role as a social leader on the islands, serving as an officer of the local chapter of the Red Cross, helping to found the public library in <b>Charlotte</b> <b>Amalie,</b> and developing the islands’ public school music education program.|$|E
25|$|European-based {{military}} band music {{first came}} to the Virgin Islands through ship-based bands as well as the small military ensembles of the Danish troops based in the islands. Regular band concerts were given by Danish musicians in <b>Charlotte</b> <b>Amalie</b> at least as early as 1888 at the Emancipation Garden bandstand. The Native Brass Band, reportedly the first official band of local musicians, was formed under the direction of Lionel Roberts in 1907, while the Adams Juvenile Band appeared in 1910 and would be inducted into the U.S. Navy when the service took over the administration of the islands from Denmark in 1917. The induction of this all-black unit into the U.S. Navy was remarkable for its time and thus recognized the first black musicians in the U.S. Navy since the War of 1812. The United States Navy Band of the Virgin Islands gave regular public concerts on St. Thomas until the departure of the naval administration in 1931, and not long after its founding two additional navy band units were stationed on St. Croix. Alton Augustus Adams, Sr., the founder of the Juvenile Band and the bandmaster of the Navy ensemble, also wrote the Virgin Islands March (1919), now the official territorial anthem of the Virgin Islands, as well as The Governor's Own, the official march of the Virgin Islands Governor. With the exception of a single surviving bamboula arrangement, Adams's marches are entirely in the standard American march style of his idol, John Philip Sousa.|$|E
