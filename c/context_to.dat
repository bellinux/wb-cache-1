5|$|For the French Byzantinologist Gilbert Dagron, Philip's Christianity is a legend—albeit a {{very old}} one—that intended, in a Late Roman/Early Byzantine <b>context,</b> <b>to</b> foster {{the idea of a}} Roman Empire that was Christian almost from the beginning, thereby melding Roman Imperial {{ideology}} and Christianism, and therefore offering a base for other later legends showing Roman emperors, beginning with Augustus , to be aware and/or sympathetic to Christian revelation, forming a legendary corpus that was brought together during the 6th century by the chronicler John Malalas.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{suggested}} that the Kir'Shara itself was similar in <b>context</b> <b>to</b> the Nag Hammadi library, which was a collection of thirteen codices found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 that date back to between the 2nd to 5th centuries. Unlike those codices, the Vulcan High Council attempts to suppress the revelation of the Kir'Shara {{in a similar manner}} to the Catholic Church's suppression seen in other fictional works such as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code or James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Mills's {{relationship}} with McCartney triggered considerable media interest. After her divorce, {{the attitude of}} the British media was hostile. Mills frequently accuses the press of misquoting her, and of using material out of <b>context</b> <b>to</b> give a negative impression of her, telling the Evening Standard that the claims that she had married McCartney for his money were more hurtful than losing her leg.|$|E

5|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of California, Riverside in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in electric mode (EV mode) that they may pose a risk to the blind, small children, the elderly, runners, cyclists, and other pedestrians, as they may have {{only one or two}} seconds, depending on the <b>context,</b> <b>to</b> audibly detect the location of approaching hybrid cars when the vehicles operate at very slow speeds. This research project was funded by the National Federation of the Blind.|$|E
5|$|We {{shall not}} feel that the generalization, {{unqualified}} and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its <b>context</b> <b>to</b> compete with the scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' has precisely the same status, and the same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic <b>context.</b> <b>To</b> conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair {{to the complexity of}} the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant to literature.|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more <b>context</b> <b>to</b> the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary <b>context</b> <b>to</b> function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E
5|$|The RF {{claimed that}} the bloody civil wars, {{military}} coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black nationalist leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black nationalist rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War <b>context</b> <b>to</b> form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{official}} retirement as {{the flag of}} South Africa, the flag was adopted by some white South Africans as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history. Many South Africans still {{view it as a}} symbol of apartheid, and therefore strongly discouraged its use. Despite the negative associations, it was never banned by the Government of South Africa post-1994 and the right to display it in South Africa is protected under Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa as an expression of free speech. In the 21st century, usage of the old South African flag experienced a revival of display as a symbol by white supremacists worldwide. A particular awareness of this followed the shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina black church in 2015, as the suspect Dylann Roof had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the flag and the flag of Rhodesia on it. This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical <b>context,</b> <b>to</b> be removed from display. An example of this is Cooma, Australia, where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the Snowy Mountains Scheme alongside the Canadian Red Ensign and other flags from 1956 when the scheme was created.|$|E
