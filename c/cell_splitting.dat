40|$|Abstract. Deploying Pico cell Base Station (PBS) {{throughout}} a Macro cell layout is a promising solution to enhance system capacity and user’s throughput. However, the strong received power from Macro cell Base Station (MBS) makes the Pico cell areas narrow and limits <b>cell</b> <b>splitting</b> gain. Range Expansion (RE) is desirable {{to balance the}} network load between MBS and PBS by expanding the coverage, which subsequently increases <b>cell</b> <b>splitting</b> gains. However, more interference may be introduced if the bias value of RE is not set properly. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Cell Range Expansion (DCRE) strategy that the bias value of RE is set dynamically according to the change of network environment. The proposed scheme aims to fulfill the resources utilization by RE scheme, and meanwhile improve the users ’ performance of cell edge through cell load balancing method. Simulation results show that DCRE scheme can improve the network performance of cell edge, and increase the cell capacity and user’s throughput compared with the existing methods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In location-based {{services}} (LBSs), {{the service}} is provided based on the users ’ locations through location determination and mobility realization. Most of the current location prediction research is focused on generalized location models, where the geographic extent is divided into regular-shaped cells. These models are not suitable for certain LBSs where the objectives are to compute and present on-road services. Such techniques are the new Markov-based mobility prediction (NMMP) and prediction location model (PLM) that deal with inner cell structure and different levels of prediction, respectively. The NMMP and PLM techniques suffer from complex computation, accuracy rate regression, and insufficient accu-racy. In this paper, a novel <b>cell</b> <b>splitting</b> algorithm is proposed. Also, a new pre-diction technique is introduced. The <b>cell</b> <b>splitting</b> is universal {{so it can be}} applied to all types of cells. Meanwhile, this algorithm is implemented to the Micro cell in parallel with the new prediction technique. The prediction technique, compared with two classic prediction techniques and the experimental results, show the effec-tiveness and robustness of the new splitting algorithm and prediction technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{segmentation}} {{of complex}} touching and overlapping cells in fluorescent micrographs poses {{a challenge for}} automated image analysis systems. In order to improve performance for complex image data, multi-channel approaches exist that additionally incorporate information from the cell nuclei. The most frequently method used for fluorescent micrograph segmentation is the seeded watershed transform. But methods based on level sets and graph cuts {{can also be used}} as alternatives to the watershed transform based splitting of cells. In this work we investigate if segmentation results obtained by one of the named methods are superior in terms of segmentation performance. Therefore, a hybrid watershed transform based method, a very efficient fast marching <b>cell</b> <b>splitting</b> method and a <b>cell</b> <b>splitting</b> method based on graph cuts are described and investigated. For performance comparison the parameters of each method are automatically optimized toward a manual ground truth including cross validation techniques.

40|$|Abstract—Embedding pico/femto base-stations and relay nodes in a macro-cellular {{network is}} a {{promising}} method for achieving substantial gains in coverage and capacity compared to macroonly networks. These {{new types of}} base-stations can operate on the same wireless channel as the macro-cellular network, providing higher spatial reuse via <b>cell</b> <b>splitting.</b> However, these base-stations are deployed in an unplanned manner, can have very different transmit powers, and may not have traffic aggregation among many users. This could potentially result in much higher interference magnitude and variability. Hence, such deployments {{require the use of}} innovative cell association and inter-cell interference coordination techniques in order to realize the promised capacity and coverage gains. In this paper, we describe new paradigms for design and operation of such heterogeneous cellular networks. Specifically, we focus on <b>cell</b> <b>splitting,</b> range expansion, semi-static resource negotiation on third-party backhaul connections, and fast dynamic interference management for QoS via over-the-air signaling. Notably, our methodologies and algorithms are simple, lightweight, and incur extremely low overhead.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Int. J. Thermal. Sci., vol. 47, pp. 1382 - 1392, 2008), the authors performed a detailed numerical {{investigation of the}} linear instability of the thermal boundary layer flow over a vertical surface by introducing unsteady thermal disturbances near the leading edge and by solving numerically the fully elliptic linearized stability equations. The main aim of the present paper is to extend those results into the nonlinear regime by seeding the boundary layer with similar disturbances of finite amplitude. The ensuing nonlinear waves are found to exhibit a variety of behaviours, depending on the precise amplitude and period of the forcing. When the amplitude is sufficiently small, the linearized theory of the previous work is reproduced, but for larger amplitudes, <b>cell</b> <b>splitting</b> or cell merging may occur as waves travel downstream. <b>Cell</b> <b>splitting</b> takes place when disturbance frequencies are somewhat smaller than the most strongly amplified nondimensional disturbance frequency of 0. 4 for which the boundary layer response, is at its greatest {{in terms of the}} surface rate of heat transfer (see Fig. 8 in previous paper).

In this paper, we propose an adaptive Lazy-Update Grid-based index (LUGrid, for short) that minimizes the cost of object updates. LUGrid is designed with two important features, namely, lazy insertion and lazy deletion. Lazy insertion reduces the update I/Os by adding an additional memory-resident layer over the disk index. Lazy deletion reduces update cost by avoiding deleting single obsolete entry immediately. Instead, the obsolete entries are removed later by specially designed mechanisms.
