Crossing the River Thames, linking Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in {{the east of the}} city, the <b>cable</b> <b>car</b> is {{integrated}} with London's Oyster Card ticketing system, although special fares are charged. Costing £60 million to build, it carries over 3,500 passengers every day, although this is very much lower than its capacity.

Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid {{indigenous}} to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River while under attack from Drax's forces; he eventually finds Drax's base near Iguazu Falls. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole the loaned shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead escape and pose as pilots on Moonraker 6. The shuttles dock with Drax's space station, hidden from radar by a cloaking device.|$|E

Only the <b>cable</b> <b>car</b> interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (roughly 1000 hours by each of the crew on average). They were shot at three of France's largest film studios in Épinay and Boulogne-Billancourt.|$|E

5|$|After quickly {{growing into}} a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic {{transportation}} system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6km) of <b>cable</b> <b>car</b> service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system {{was built to}} create a park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led {{to the construction of}} many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station.|$|E

5|$|In 1867 Ezra Millard, Andrew J. Hanscom, and Augustus Kountze {{formed the}} Omaha Horse Railway Company to provide horsecar {{service in the}} city. By the late 1870s the line had five miles (8km) of track, 10 cars, 70 horses, 20 {{employees}} and 495,000 passengers annually.

In 1896 the new company disbanded as competitors moved in. An electric car was built by Eurastus Benson between Omaha and Benson specifically to promote that suburbs development during this time.|$|E
