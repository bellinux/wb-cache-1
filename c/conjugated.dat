In this study, to clarify the enhancing mechanism for high gene transfer activity of GUG-β-CDE <b>conjugate</b> (DS 1. 8), we investigated the physicochemical properties, cellular uptake, endosomal escape and nuclear translocation of the plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexes as well as pDNA release from the complexes. The particle size, ς-potential and cellular uptake of GUG-β-CDE <b>conjugate</b> (DS 1. 8) /pDNA complex were mostly {{comparable to those of}} α-CDE <b>conjugate</b> (DS 1. 2) and β-CDE <b>conjugate</b> (DS 1. 3).

CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E

For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are <b>conjugated</b> to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E

The prototype N1 was {{the only member of the}} class constructed before the SECR became part of the Southern Railway at the Grouping in 1923, and featured a variant of the Gresley <b>conjugated</b> valve gear designed by Harold Holcroft.

50|$|In {{the above}} description, {{the product of}} two <b>conjugate</b> {{variables}} yields an energy. In other words, the <b>conjugate</b> pairs are <b>conjugate</b> with respect to energy.

50|$|What {{makes this}} {{approach}} particularly useful is if one uses <b>conjugate</b> priors: individual <b>conjugate</b> priors have easily computed posteriors, {{and thus a}} mixture of <b>conjugate</b> priors is the same mixture of posteriors: one only needs to know how each <b>conjugate</b> prior changes.Using a single <b>conjugate</b> prior may be too restrictive, but using a mixture of <b>conjugate</b> priors may give one the desired distribution {{in a form that}} is easy to compute with.This is similar to decomposing a function in terms of eigenfunctions - see <b>Conjugate</b> prior: Analogy with eigenfunctions.|$|R
5|$|Operational {{experience}} with the Nclass prototype demonstrated that it was capable of coping with peacetime passenger and freight traffic on the mainline between London and Ramsgate, but Maunsell anticipated an increase in traffic that would require a more powerful locomotive capable of hauling longer trains. The use of larger engines was prevented by low permitted axle loadings on parts of the SECR network, caused by economies in track construction by using flint beach pebbles as track ballast; this material failed to hold the track in place when under strain and could not support heavy locomotives. In the meantime Maunsell settled upon producing a 3-cylinder version of the Nclass 2-6-0, which provided the opportunity to test {{a variant of the}} Gresley <b>conjugated</b> valve gear developed by his assistant, Harold Holcroft.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ornithine decarboxylase can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a <b>conjugated</b> imine, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|The 1470-class Pacific was {{the third}} Great Northern {{locomotive}} type to incorporate Gresley's universal 3-cylinder layout. All three cylinders drove the middle coupled axle. The outside cranks were set at 120°, with the inside crank displaced by about 7 degrees {{to allow for the}} 1:8 inclination of the inside cylinder. Gresley <b>conjugated</b> valve gear derived the motion of the inside valve spindle from the two outside valve spindles: this eliminated an inaccessible middle set of valve gear between the frames. A feature of the K4 that had soon been abandoned by the Pennsylvania Railroad was an unusual three-bar version of the Laird slide-bar. However, Gresley adopted this type of slide-bar for all his locomotives and it was later taken up by Bulleid for his Pacifics and by Riddles for the British Railways standard designs.|$|E

5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of <b>conjugated</b> valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
