5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the <b>critical</b> <b>density,</b> then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
5|$|The {{flatness}} problem (also {{known as}} the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW). The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial curvature depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative, if its density {{is less than the}} critical density; positive, if greater; and zero at the <b>critical</b> <b>density,</b> in which case space is said to be flat.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the <b>critical</b> <b>density</b> grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E

Since the many specimens in present stage are not single crystals, {{there are two kinds of}} <b>critical</b> current <b>density</b> observed in the specimens which are so-called local and global <b>critical</b> current <b>densities.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate both kinds of <b>critical</b> current <b>densities.</b> The history effect in which the global <b>critical</b> current <b>density</b> shows different values in increasing and decreasing magnetic field is also observed when the specimens have the local and the global <b>critical</b> current <b>densities.</b> The wire which critical current is 180 A is successfully developed with using the knowledge of abovementioned characteristics of two kinds of <b>critical</b> current <b>densities</b> and the history effect...|$|R
40|$|We discuss various <b>critical</b> <b>densities</b> in sandpile models. The {{stationary}} {{density is}} the average expected height in the stationary state of a finite-volume model; the transition <b>density</b> is the <b>critical</b> point in the infinite-volume counterpart. These two <b>critical</b> <b>densities</b> were generally assumed to be equal, but this {{has turned out to}} be wrong for deterministic sandpile models. We show they are not equal in a quenched version of the Manna sandpile model either. In the literature, when the transition density is simulated, it is implicitly or explicitly assumed to be equal to either the so-called threshold density or the so-called <b>critical</b> activity <b>density.</b> We properly define these auxiliary densities, and prove that in certain cases, the threshold density is equal to the transition density. We extend the definition of the <b>critical</b> activity <b>density</b> to infinite volume, and prove that in the standard infinite volume sandpile, it is equal to 1. Our results should bring some order in the precise relations between the various densities...|$|R

5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the <b>critical</b> <b>density,</b> the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} Big Bang {{nucleosynthesis}} predicts the observed abundance {{of the chemical}} elements. If there are more baryons, then there should also be more helium, lithium and heavier elements synthesized during the Big Bang. Agreement with observed abundances requires that baryonic matter makes up between 4–5% of the universe's <b>critical</b> <b>density.</b> In contrast, large-scale structure and other observations indicate that the total matter density is about 30% of the <b>critical</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractUsing a {{scanning}} Hall-probe microscopy, we {{have investigated}} in-plane distribution of <b>critical</b> current <b>density</b> in TFA-MOD processed YBCO coated conductors. We compared the distributions of <b>critical</b> current <b>density</b> for {{two kinds of}} coated conductors processed with different directions of gas flow at the calcinations. As a result, {{it was found that}} the direction of the gas flow largely influenced the distribution of <b>critical</b> current <b>density.</b> For example, the maximum value of <b>critical</b> current <b>density</b> was 1. 5 times higher than the average for a sample processed with a gas flow in width direction. On the other hand, the distribution of <b>critical</b> current <b>density</b> was relatively uniform for the one with a gas flow in axial direction perpendicular to the surface of the conductor. These findings will be very important information for the optimization of the manufacturer processes for the conductors.

25|$|Guth's {{first step}} to {{developing}} his theory of inflation occurred at Cornell in 1978, when he attended a lecture by Robert Dicke about the flatness problem of the universe. Dicke explained how the flatness problem showed that something significant was missing from the Big Bang theory at the time. The fate of the universe depended on its density. If {{the density of the}} universe was large enough, it would collapse into a singularity, and if the actual density of the matter in the cosmos was lower than the <b>critical</b> <b>density,</b> the universe would increasingly get much bigger.|$|E

For those traffic flow models that admit the wide cluster solution, the relationship between two important control parameters and the <b>critical</b> <b>densities</b> that divide an equilibrium solution into stable and unstable regions is thoroughly discussed in detail.

40|$|The signalized {{ring road}} is an {{important}} model to understand the properties of signal setting on road networks. Stationary states exist on signalized ring road with a minimum period of multiple times of the cycle length. In this study, we extend the homogeneous one-signal ring road to the rotationally symmetric two-signal ring road, and set offsets between signals to reveal coordination effects. First, we apply link transmission model (LTM) to solve bound- ary flows at signals under stationery states, which is an equilibrium state of the dynamics networks. Then, we derive the <b>critical</b> <b>densities</b> influenced by signal settings, including the cycle length and the green ratio, to determine the conditions for maximum flow-rates of networks. Based on <b>critical</b> <b>densities,</b> an approximate macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is obtained, relating average flow-rate and density of networks. The capacity drop of networks caused by offsets is also analyzed for different ratios of road length and cycle length. We then find the optimal cycle length for various congestion conditions based on the approximate MFD and properties of <b>critical</b> <b>densities.</b> Numerical LTM simulations are run to verify theoretical results and further explore the minimum periods of stationery states...|$|R
