5|$|Paris is {{provided}} in electricity through a 'periphery' grid fed by multiple sources., around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France comes from <b>cogeneration</b> energy plants located near the outer limits of the region; other energy sources include the Nogent nuclear power plant (35%), trash incineration (9% – with <b>cogeneration</b> plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh). A quarter of Paris's district heating is {{to come from a}} plant in Saint-Ouen, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and 140,000 tonnes of wood pellets from USA per year.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the former}} meat market {{buildings}} have now changed use. For example, the former Central Cold Store, on Charterhouse Street is now, most unusually, a City centre <b>cogeneration</b> power station operated by Citigen. Other former cold storage warehousing (The Metropolitan Cold Stores)has been converted into the acclaimed nightclub Fabric.|$|E
5|$|In 1986–87, a <b>cogeneration</b> {{facility}} {{was added to}} the central heating plant to generate electricity from the plant's waste heat. A Cornell Combined Heat & Power Project, which was completed in December 2009, shifted the central heating plant from using coal to natural gas and enable the plant to generate all of the campus's non-peak electric requirements.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT {{for violating}} the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its {{hazardous}} waste storage and disposal procedures. MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission <b>cogeneration</b> plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E
5|$|The initial event {{caused a}} number of wood framed homes in Scotia to come off their {{foundations}} while the porches of some other homes became detached. The 25MW <b>cogeneration</b> plant there that used wood waste products to power both the lumber company and the town suffered damage and both lumber mills were shut down for several weeks. In Rio Dell, across the Eel River from Scotia, glass store fronts along the main street were shattered and numerous buildings slipped into a culvert along Monument Road. In Petrolia (the small community closest to the epicenter) the general store (combined with a post office and gas station) was destroyed by fire, and in Fortuna, damage totaled $4 million. A six figure portion of that figure was due to losses at the high school's gymnasium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cogeneration</b> {{is popular}} in new {{commercial}} buildings. In current <b>cogeneration</b> systems small gas turbines or stirling engines powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an absorptive chiller.|$|E
25|$|The Ontario Power Authority anticipates {{that the}} {{contribution}} of <b>cogeneration</b> to electricity conservation will be between 47 and 265 MW depending upon how aggressively it is pursued in Ontario. However, these projections are controversial, as {{there is still much}} debate about the real-life potential of widespread <b>cogeneration</b> projects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cogeneration</b> can {{be applied}} to any fuel which is combusted for energy. Fossil fuels, biomass and biogas can all be used in CHP plants. Transporting heat over long {{distances}} is impractical, so <b>cogeneration</b> plants are usually small and located close to the energy load. Hence, <b>cogeneration</b> is inherently linked to distributed generation. The urban location of CHP plants makes them very compatible with clean-burning fuels such as natural gas. The health concerns associated with other fossil fuels (see coal above) make them less suitable for areas with high population densities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a fossil fueled <b>cogeneration</b> plant, the heat output is {{typically}} sized to meet half of the peak heat load but over the year will provide 90% of the heat supplied. The boiler capacity will be able to meet the entire heat demand unaided and can cover for breakdowns in the <b>cogeneration</b> plant. It is not economic to size the <b>cogeneration</b> plant alone to be able to meet the full heat load. In the New York City steam system, that is around 2.5 GW. Germany has the largest amount of CHP in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In Germany {{district}} heating has a {{market share of}} around 14% in the residential buildings sector. The connected heat load is around 52.729MW. The heat comes mainly from <b>cogeneration</b> plants (83%). Heat-only boilers supply 16% and 1% is surplus heat from industry. The <b>cogeneration</b> plants use natural gas (42%), coal (39%), lignite (12%) and waste/others (7%) as fuel.|$|E
25|$|As a whole, the European Union {{currently}} generates 11% of its electricity using <b>cogeneration,</b> saving Europe {{an estimated}} 35 Mtoe per annum. However, {{there are large}} differences between the member states, with energy savings ranging from 2% to 60%. Europe has the three countries with the world's most intensive <b>cogeneration</b> economies: Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland.|$|E
25|$|Sudbury, Ontario has a {{district}} heating <b>cogeneration</b> system in its downtown core, {{as well as}} a standalone <b>cogeneration</b> plant for the Sudbury Regional Hospital. In addition, Naneff Gardens, a new residential subdivision off Donnelly Drive in the city's Garson neighbourhood, features a geothermal district heating system using technology developed by a local company, Renewable Resource Recovery Corporation.|$|E
25|$|According to the IEA 2008 {{modelling}} of <b>cogeneration</b> expansion for the G8 countries, {{expansion of}} <b>cogeneration</b> in France, Germany, Italy and the UK alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030. This would increase Europe's savings from today's 155 TWh to 465 TWh in 2030. It would also {{result in a}} 16% to 29% increase in each country's total cogenerated electricity by 2030.|$|E
25|$|Amherst College is {{reducing}} its energy consumption through a computerized monitoring system for lighting {{and the use}} of an efficient <b>cogeneration</b> facility. The <b>cogeneration</b> facility features a gas turbine that generates electricity in addition to steam for heating the campus. Amherst also operates a composting program, in which a portion of the food waste from dining halls is sent to a farmer in Vermont.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{heat from}} {{nuclear power plants}} is {{sometimes}} used for district heating. The principles for a conventional combination of <b>cogeneration</b> and district heating applies the same for nuclear as it does for a thermal power station. Russia has several <b>cogeneration</b> nuclear plants which together provided 11.4 PJ of district heat in 2005. Russian nuclear district heating is planned to nearly triple within a decade as new plants are built.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark, a net {{electric}} {{efficiency of}} >47% has been obtained at the coal-fired Nordjyllandsværket CHP Plant and an overall plant efficiency {{of up to}} 91% with <b>cogeneration</b> of electricity and district heating. The multifuel-fired Avedøreværket CHP Plant just outside Copenhagen can achieve a net electric efficiency as high as 49%. The overall plant efficiency with <b>cogeneration</b> of electricity and district heating can reach as much as 94%.|$|E
25|$|The core {{element of}} many {{district}} heating systems is a heat-only boiler station. Additionally a <b>cogeneration</b> plant (also called combined heat and power, CHP) is often added {{in parallel with}} the boilers. Both have in common that they are typically based on combustion of primary energy carriers. The {{difference between the two}} systems is that, in a <b>cogeneration</b> plant, heat and electricity are generated simultaneously, whereas in heat-only boiler stations – as the name suggests – only heat is generated.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CH) facilities, often called <b>cogeneration</b> plants, produce both {{electric}} power and heat for process heat or space heating, such as steam and hot water.|$|E
25|$|Many {{companies}} operate district <b>cogeneration</b> {{facilities that}} provide steam and/or hot water {{to many of}} the office buildings. Also, most operators in the Greater Tokyo serve district cooling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cogeneration</b> plants {{generate}} both {{electricity and}} heat from the same power source, thus improving upon the energy efficiency of most power plants, which waste the energy generated as heat.|$|E
25|$|The {{companies}} also own and operate the public Gowanda Airport. The companies are {{also involved in}} {{oil and natural gas}} exploration, maintain a real estate division, and are copartners in an electric <b>cogeneration</b> plant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cogeneration,</b> or {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP), {{refers to the}} concurrent generation of power and heat from the same energy source. The heat is then used in local applications such as heating homes.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} form of {{coal combustion}} is as coal-water slurry fuel (CWS), which {{was developed in}} the Soviet Union. Other ways to use coal are combined heat and power <b>cogeneration</b> and an MHD topping cycle.|$|E
25|$|An {{increasing}} number of commercial buildings use a combined cycle with <b>cogeneration</b> to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas reciprocating engine, gas turbine or stirling electric generator.|$|E
25|$|Before {{widespread}} {{power distribution}} from central stations, many factories, large hotels, apartment and office buildings {{had their own}} power generation. Often this was economically attractive because the exhaust steam {{could be used for}} building and industrial process heat, which today is known as <b>cogeneration</b> or combined heat and power (CHP). Most self-generated power became uneconomical as power prices fell. As late as the early 20th century, isolated power systems greatly outnumbered central stations. <b>Cogeneration</b> is still commonly practiced in many industries that use large amounts of both steam and power, such as pulp and paper, chemicals and refining. The continued use of private electric generators is called microgeneration.|$|E
25|$|The Conservation Law Foundation {{opposes the}} permit given to Mirant for the Veolia Energy North America Kendall <b>Cogeneration</b> Station, an {{electricity}} plant near Kendall Square, {{charging that the}} water it releases causes blooms of hazardous microorganisms because of its warm temperature.|$|E
25|$|Other nuclear-powered heating from <b>cogeneration</b> {{plants are}} in Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Switzerland, {{producing}} {{up to about}} 100MW per power station. One use of nuclear heat generation was with the Ågesta Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden closed in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Lansing Board of Water and Light, a {{municipal}} utility system in Lansing, Michigan operates a heated and {{chilled water system}} from their existing coal plant. They have announced their new natural gas <b>cogeneration</b> plant will continue to provide this service.|$|E
25|$|In {{many cases}} large {{combined}} heat and power district heating schemes {{are owned by}} a single entity. This was typically the case in the old Eastern bloc countries. However, for many schemes, the ownership of the <b>cogeneration</b> plant is separate from the heat using part.|$|E
25|$|Denver's {{district}} {{steam system}} is the oldest continuously operated commercial district heating system in the world. It began service November 5, 1880 and continues to serve 135 customers. The system is partially powered by the Xcel Energy Zuni <b>Cogeneration</b> Station, which was originally built in 1900.|$|E
25|$|A {{request for}} {{proposals}} was sent out by the OPA in 2005 for up to 1,000 MW of new <b>cogeneration.</b> As a result, seven new CHP generating stations are currently being developed in Ontario under contracts executed in 2006 with a combined total capacity of 414 MW.|$|E
25|$|Recent <b>cogeneration</b> {{technology}} {{plants are}} being designed to produce from 200 to over 300 kWh of electricity per tonne of bagasse. As sugarcane is a seasonal crop, shortly after harvest {{the supply of}} bagasse would peak, requiring power generation plants to strategically manage the storage of bagasse.|$|E
25|$|By 2025, {{installed}} {{natural gas}} and <b>cogeneration</b> capacity is targeted to increase from the current 4,976 MW to 11,000 MW—roughly 27% of system generation capacity. That said, due to its predominant use only in high-value energy applications, natural gas is only expected to account for 6% of Ontario's overall electricity production.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} part of energy transition is reducing consumption by energy conservation and improvements in energy efficiency, an example is improved insulation for buildings; an example of improved energy efficiency is <b>cogeneration</b> of heat and power. Smart meters can schedule energy consumption for times when electricity is less expensive.|$|E
25|$|Examples are Warsaw {{which has}} such split {{ownership}} with PGNiG Termika owning the <b>cogeneration</b> unit, the Dalkia Polska owning 85% {{of the heat}} distribution, {{the rest of the}} heat distribution is owned by municipality and workers. Similarly all the large CHP/CH schemes in Denmark are of split ownership.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} signed one {{natural gas}} <b>cogeneration</b> agreement for 507 MW in 2003, three forest biomass deals (47.5 MW) in 2004 and 2005, and ten contracts for wind power (2,994 MW) in 2005 and 2008, all with private sector producers. It also signed two flexible contracts with Hydro-Québec Production (600 MW) in 2002.|$|E
