The ABS-CBN television network in particular is the largest contributor to the group's revenue, generating about 50 to 60 percent of the group's total annual revenue mainly from selling airtime to advertisers. The remaining revenue is generated from consumer sales, mainly from ABS-CBN Global Ltd. which distributes international television channels such as The Filipino Channel and Myx TV and from pay TV and broadband internet provider Sky.

40|$|We discuss net {{neutrality}} regulation {{in the context}} of a two-sided market model. Platforms sell Internet access services to consumers and may set fees to content - and application providers on the Internet. When access is monopolized, for reasonable parameter ranges, {{net neutrality}} regulation (requiring zero fees to <b>content</b> <b>providers)</b> increases the total industry surplus as compared to the fully private optimum at which the monopoly platform imposes positive fees on <b>content</b> <b>providers.</b> However, there are also parameter ranges for which total industry surplus is reduced. Imposing net neutrality in duopoly with multi-homing <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> and single-homing consumers increases the total surplus as compared to duopoly competition with positive fees to <b>content</b> <b>providers.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{economic}} {{analysis of the}} static and dynamic effects of copyright levies on hardware used to access original content. An immediate effect {{of this type of}} levy is to decrease the total consumption of content (both original and copied) by consumers since their available income decreases. We show that, in a competitive environment, the net revenue of <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> increases with the levy only if the proportion of taxes retained by <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> exceeds the proportion of consumers using licensed content; condition that {{does not seem to be}} satisfied in reality. Hence, from a static perspective, levies on hardware do not seem to compensate <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> for copy-ing by consumers. This is because the levy is not targeted, contrary to other types of levies on support explicitly used for copying like CDs, tapes or flash drives. We then extend the basic model to allow for differentiated <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> and show that in a dynamic setting of reputation building, less “reputable ” <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> suffer more from levies on hardware. Finally, we allow for market power by <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> and show that the difference in profits between a subscription scheme and a uniform pricing strategy is decreasing in the level of the levy; this suggests that high levels of taxes will deter <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> from adopting subscription systems. This may happen despite the fact that subscription systems may bring back into licensed consumption “pirates” and benefit licensed consumers. ...|$|R

Our model reveals that rules that prohibit efficient commercial transactions between content and broadband service providers could be bad for all participants – consumers would pay higher prices, the profits of the broadband service provider would decline, and the sales of internet <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> would also decline. Moreover by shifting costs to consumers that are more efficiently borne in the exchange between <b>content</b> and broadband <b>providers,</b> such rules may shift sales from <b>content</b> <b>providers</b> to the broadband <b>provider's</b> <b>content</b> affiliate. network neutrality; regulation; internet content; broadband providers; market transactions; foreclosure; transaction limits; commercial transactions; <b>content</b> <b>providers.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|Such Let's Plays are monetized by ad {{revenue from}} the video hosting site.

Providers can also join various content networks like Maker Studios, which offer promotion and advertising for content providers in exchange for a share of the ad revenue. PewDiePie's monthly revenue from his Let's Plays are estimated between $140,000 and $1.4 million, while smaller channels can still earn between $500 and $1000 a month; the Wall Street Journal reported that PewDiePie made over $4 million in 2013, while Forbes ranked him the highest YouTube personality in 2015, earning over $12 million a year before taxes. Several of these individual Let's Players, as they are called, have transformed this into a full-time career while learning skills such as communications and video editing that can be used for future jobs. More popular broadcasters often share part of their revenue for charitable efforts, or hold charity drives while they play through games for a live audience. Pewdiepie's contribution in this area led to him being listing as one of thirty most influential people on the Internet in a March 2015 list, and as one of the top 100 influential people overall in an April 2016 list, both compiled by Time magazine. [...] Business Insider reported that eleven of the top twenty most-subscribed, independent YouTube publishers as of November 2014 are those that produce Let's Play videos. An October 2017 report from SuperData Researched estimated that between Let's Play videos and live streaming content of game video content, there were more people watching such videos than compared to all subscribers of HBO, Netflix, ESPN and Hulu combined, with over 517 million YouTube users and 185 million Twitch.tv users.|$|E
