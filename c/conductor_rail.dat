5|$|In 2008, the old {{section of}} Nationaltheatret Station was renovated, {{including}} tracks 1 and 2 {{and the two}} original entrances. Upgrades included new lighting, a new public address system, new escalators which have lighting that changes color, a more powerful fire safety system, improved emergency exits and replacement of cables and baldachin. The upgrade made the old section lighter, and visually similar to the new section, as it was previously painted in dark red. Between 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration performed a major upgrade to the section between Lysaker and Etterstad, including the permanent way past Nationaltheatret. Among the upgrades are axle counters, mounting of an overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail,</b> new switches and new tracks.|$|E

5|$|The District {{found an}} {{investor}} {{to finance the}} upgrade in 1901, American Charles Yerkes. On 15 July 1901, Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company with himself as managing director and raised £1million {{to carry out the}} electrification, including construction of the generating station and supplying the new rolling stock. Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and his experiences in the United States led him to favour DC with a track level <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted.|$|E

50|$|In December 2004, {{the tracks}} {{at the station}} were {{equipped}} with overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> for electric trains. Since that time, train sets hauled by electric locomotives have run to airport instead of DMUs.|$|R
5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E
25|$|The {{lines are}} {{electrified}} with a four-rail DC system: a <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> between the rails is energised at−210V and a rail outside the running rails at +420V, giving a potential difference of 630V. On {{the sections of}} line shared with mainline trains, such as the District line from East Putney to Wimbledon and Gunnersbury to Richmond, and the Bakerloo line north of Queen's Park, the centre rail is bonded to the running rails.|$|E
25|$|Fragility and vulnerability: {{overhead}} electrification {{systems can}} suffer severe disruption due to minor mechanical faults or {{the effects of}} high winds causing the pantograph of a moving train to become entangled with the catenary, ripping the wires from their supports. The damage is often {{not limited to the}} supply to one track, but extends to those for adjacent tracks as well, causing the entire route to be blocked for a considerable time. Third-rail systems can suffer disruption in cold weather due to ice forming on the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E

50|$|While the 3rd & 4th <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> {{were removed}} {{by the new}} owners, the line still hosts {{electric}} style units, though without the electrification they are hauled by a diesel locomotive. Due to cost, safety issues and legislation {{it is not possible}} to re-electrify the branch.|$|R
25|$|Until summer 2018 {{there will}} be major track, {{signalling}} and station remodelling works at London Bridge station {{as part of the}} Masterplan project (some works within the station building started during Key Output 1). A grade-separated junction is being created at Bermondsey. New permanent way (track level, in this case including both plain rail and junctions) and overhead line equipment will be laid out in the new Canal Tunnels just north of St Pancras between the Thameslink route and the East Coast Main Line, thereby opening up the Thameslink network to new destinations north of London. An overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> replaced the traditional Mk3b solid wire between the former King's Cross Thameslink station to St Pancras International station.|$|E
25|$|One oddity is that, {{almost from}} its opening until 1917, the Bakerloo {{operated}} with the polarity of the conductor rails reversed, the outside rail negative and the centre rail positive. This {{came about because}} the Bakerloo shared a power source with the District Railway. On the Bakerloo, the outside <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> tended to leak to the tunnel wall, whereas on the District Railway, the centre rail shared a similar problem. The solution was to reverse the polarity on the Bakerloo line, so that the negative rail leaked on both systems. In 1917, the two lines were separated when the LNWR began its 'New Line' service between Euston and Watford Junction, which the Bakerloo would share north of Queens Park. As a result, normal operation was restored.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 21st-century {{modernisation}} of the Great Western Main Line, {{the tunnel}} was prepared for electrification. It has good clearances and was relatively easy to electrify, although due to its age, the seepage of water from above in some areas provided an engineering challenge. The options of using either normal tunnel electrification equipment or a covered solid beam technology were considered and {{the decision was made}} to use a solid beam. Over the length of the tunnel, an aluminium <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> holds the copper cable, which is not under tension. A six-week closure of the tunnel started on 12 September 2016. During that time, alternative means of travel were either a longer train journey via Gloucester, or a bus service between Severn Tunnel Junction and Bristol Parkway stations. Also during that time, and possibly later, there were direct flights between Cardiff and London City Airport. The tunnel was reopened on 22 October 2016.|$|E
5000|$|In London the Great Northern & City Railway was a 3+1/2 mi {{underground}} line from [...] to [...] EMUs with BTH electrical equipment were used {{from the opening}} on 14 February 1904; these picked up traction current from <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> {{both sides of the}} running rails.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "DC" [...] in {{the title}} refers {{to the fact that}} the line is {{electrified}} using direct current. This was done in the early twentieth century with <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> (giving compatibility with the London Underground's four-rail system and the contemporary North London Line electrification), hence its name in contrast to the more modern overhead alternating current system on the adjacent WCML.|$|R
50|$|The end ramps of <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> (where {{they are}} interrupted, or change sides) present a {{practical}} limitation on speed {{due to the}} mechanical impact of the shoe, and 160 km/h (100 mph) is considered the upper limit of practical third-rail operation. The world speed record for a third rail train is 174 km/h attained on 11 April 1988 by a British Class 442 EMU.|$|R
500|$|The committee's {{preferred}} {{system was}} a 3,000volt, three-phase alternating current system proposed by Hungarian electrical engineering company Ganz. The system delivered current by overhead conductor wires and was cheaper than alternatives using power rails and required fewer electrical sub-stations. An experimental line had been constructed by Ganz in Budapest, although the system {{had not yet}} been adopted for the full-scale operation of a railway. Before the appointment of Ganz could be finalised, Yerkes took control of the DR. He and his engineers preferred the low voltage direct current <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> system they had worked with in the United States and were intending to use on the tube lines when they were constructed; they rejected the Ganz system putting the DR and the MDETC into dispute with the MR which wanted to proceed with the Ganz system. [...] After some acrimonious debate between the two companies, some of which was carried out in public through the letters pages of The Times newspaper, the dispute went to arbitration at the Board of Trade. The decision was made in December 1901 to use the four-rail system, although the arbitrator, Alfred Lyttelton, was critical of the DR's unilateral decision.|$|E
500|$|The line is {{electrified}} with a four-rail DC system: {{a central}} <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is energised at−210V and a rail outside the running rails at +420V, giving a potential difference of 630V. Much of the [...] double-track railway from the Hammersmith terminus to Westbourne Park station is on a [...] high brick viaduct. After Westbourne Park the line passes beneath the Great Western main line re-surfacing at Royal Oak station and running alongside the main lines to Paddington station. The line enters a cutting {{just west of}} the station and a cut-and-cover tunnel {{at the end of the}} platforms. It meets the Circle line from Bayswater at Praed Street Junction before passing through Edgware Road station in a cutting. After King's Cross St Pancras the line is in cutting, passing under the Ray Street Gridiron that carries the City Widened Lines used for Thameslink services. There are bay platforms at Moorgate. Just before Aldgate the line diverges from the Circle and Metropolitan lines to Aldgate East. The line passes over the London Overground at Whitechapel station continuing on the [...] former Whitechapel & Bow Railway to Bow Road where it surfaces, and then to Bromley-by-Bow, where it runs alongside the London, Tilbury and Southend line from Fenchurch Street. At the next station, West Ham, there is interchange with the Jubilee line, the Docklands Light Railway and c2c. There is a bay platform at the next station, Plaistow, and the line terminates after two more stations at Barking.|$|E

50|$|A fourth {{line was}} added to the {{extension}} in 1874. Broad Street originally had seven platforms, extended to eight in 1891 and nine in 1913. The lines were electrified with two <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> at 600V DC, with services beginning on 1 October 1916, using Oerlikon rolling stock. However, only the western five platforms at Broad Street served electrified lines, the remaining lines being unelectrified. Electric services to Watford did not begin until 10 July 1922.|$|R
25|$|In 2015, Alstom {{announced}} SRS, {{an energy}} storage system that charges supercapacitors on board a tram by means of ground-level <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> located at tram stops. This allows trams to operate without overhead lines for short distances. The system has been touted {{as an alternative to}} the company's ground-level power supply (APS) system, or can be used in conjunction with it, as in the case of the VLT network in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which opened in 2016.|$|R
50|$|When Alstom {{withdrew from}} the United Kingdom train-building market, the track was {{threatened}} with closure before being leased to Metronet in 2007 to test and commission London Underground S Stock trains being manufactured by Bombardier in Derby. To facilitate this, the former Up line was equipped with approximately 4 km of London Underground-style <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> from Old Dalby (milepost 111) to a point near milepost 114. Testing of 'S' stock began {{at the end of}} March 2009. The former Down line retains its 25 kV OHLE.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Southern Region Class 70 and Class 71 electric locomotives, these {{did not have}} a booster to maintain traction power over gaps in the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail.</b> However, [...] they could move forward onto an electrified section under diesel power.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> was a steel {{inverted}} channel placed centrally, {{with its}} upper surface {{at the same}} level as the upper surface of the running rails. At pointwork a hardwood ramp was provided to raise the collector shoes [...] above running rail level.|$|E
2500|$|The trains {{were run}} in five-car formations, Motor coach + trailer + trailer + trailer + motor coach, with spares for overhaul. They were {{constructed}} of welded steel, and were styled in an Art Deco appearance. The motor coaches had cabs at each end, enabling single-car operation by them; {{they had two}} axle-hung traction motors rated at [...] for one hour. The new trains had on-board compressors for the air brakes, and interior lights were in two circuits, one fed from the motor car {{at one end of}} the unit, and one from the other, avoiding total lighting loss in passing <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> gaps. The <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> was altered to the outside position normal for the third-rail system. There was no train power line, and each motor coach collected its own electric supply. (This new stock was eventually classified Class 487.) ...|$|E
50|$|Because of the jointly {{operated}} Inner Circle co-operation {{with the}} District Railway was essential. A jointly-owned experimental train of six coaches was tested on passenger service on an Earl's Court to High Street Kensington shuttle in 1900. Composed of four trailers and two motor cars this had pick up shoes which {{made contact with}} <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> energised at 600 V DC {{on both sides of}} the track. Although the motor cars were connected by a bus line, there was no multiple working, meaning only the leading motor car was powered.|$|R
50|$|Where {{there is}} limited {{clearance}} such as in tunnels, the overhead wire may be replaced by rigid overhead rail. An early example was in the tunnels of the Baltimore Belt Line, where a ∏ section bar (fabricated from three strips of iron and mounted on wood) was used, with the brass contact running inside the groove. When the overhead line {{was raised in the}} Simplon Tunnel to accommodate taller rolling stock a rail was used. A rigid overhead rail may also be used in places where tensioning the wires is impractical, for example on moveable bridges. Short overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> are also installed at tram stops as for the Combino Supra.|$|R
2500|$|All {{electrical}} equipment was shipped from the US, including power system plant equipment. A power station was {{built at the}} Shore Road pumping station and was designed, anticipating extension of the electrification to the Wirral Railway, although this was not to occur until 1938. The <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> were fed direct, without any distribution. Four rail 600V DC electrification was installed, the positive outer rail set [...] from the running rail. The new multiple units had British wooden bodies on US bogies; 24 motor cars and 33 trailer cars were provided and trains were initially 2-car or 4-car sets. The driving positions controlled all the motors on the train by the means of a low voltage control signal.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to supply power to an electric train by inductive coupling. This allows {{the use of a}} high-voltage, insulated, <b>conductor</b> <b>rail.</b> Such a system was patented in 1894 by Nikola Tesla, US Patent 514972. [...] It requires the use of high-frequency alternating current. Tesla did not specify a frequency but George Trinkaus suggests that around 1,000Hz would be likely.|$|E
2500|$|The Central line is [...] {{long and}} serves 49 stations. The line is {{predominantly}} double track, widened to three tracks for short sections south of Leytonstone {{and west of}} White City; no track is shared with any other line though some sections do parallel other routes. Total track length is , of which [...] is in tunnel; this track is electrified with a four-rail DC system: a central <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is energised at−210V and a rail outside the running rail at +420V, giving a potential difference of 630V.|$|E
2500|$|The Circle line is [...] {{long with}} 36 {{stations}}. Much of its track {{and all of}} its stations are shared with the other London Underground sub-surface lines: the Hammersmith & City line from Hammersmith to just before Aldgate; the Metropolitan line from Baker Street to Aldgate; and the District line from Tower Hill station to Edgware Road station. The line is electrified with a four-rail DC system: a central <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is energised at [...] and a rail outside the running rail at , giving a potential difference of [...] The running rails are not electrified. Much of the [...] double track railway from the Hammersmith terminus to Westbourne Park station is on a [...] high brick viaduct.|$|E
50|$|Sleet {{locomotives}} were redundant London Underground cars {{converted to}} help with the removal of ice that built up on the <b>conductor</b> <b>rails.</b> The main batch of eighteen tube-gauge locomotives were built between 1938 and 1941 from motor cars originally built in 1903. They were refurbished in the 1960s using equipment removed from redundant T-stock vehicles, and were joined by a pair of surface-gauge locomotives in 1961. In addition to de-icing duties, some of them were also used for experiments in clearing leaves from the running rails. They had all ceased to operate by 1985. One of the tube-gauge locomotives subsequently went to the London Transport Museum, and the surface-gauge cars went to the Spa Valley Railway.|$|R
