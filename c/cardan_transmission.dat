5000|$|With the {{oil crisis}} of 1973, {{it no longer}} seemed {{economically}} viable to power the future high-speed train with fossil fuels. The requirements were changed to fully electric operation, which resulted in an extensive redesign and test program. In April 1974, the Z7001 experimental electric railcar, nicknamed [...] "Zébulon", began trials. Zébulon was rebuilt from the Z7115 which had been wrecked. Using this vehicle, the new Y226 long-wheelbase power truck (precursor of the Y230 of the production TGV) was developed and tested, with its body-mounted traction motors and tripod <b>cardan</b> <b>transmission.</b> Body mounting of the traction motors was a major innovation; it allowed a considerable (3300 kg) reduction in {{the mass of the}} power truck, giving it a very high critical speed and exceptional tracking stability. Zébulon also served to develop a two-stage high speed pantograph, which later became the AM-PSE pantograph of the TGV Sud-Est, as well as a new type of eddy current rail brake. The eddy current rail brake exerts a magnetic retention effort, without ever making contact with the rail. The promise of high efficiency and low wear was however outweighed by problems with overheating in the rail, and the design was dropped. Zébulon's suspension, of a non-pneumatic design, was completely satisfactory so it was adopted for the new high speed train, instead of the TGV 001's pneumatic suspension.|$|E

For this, {{it is necessary to}} develop a flexible informational system that would connect the constructive design of cardan transmissions to the technological design within a unitary structure. Due to the typodimensional diversity of cardan transmissions, the design and manufacturing of the various components for a certain application domain (medical aparature, dental and agricultural machines, lifting and transportation machines etc.) has been typified. In order to study the problems that occur in the practice of using cardan transmissions, there has been realised a questionnaire-based descriptive research. We insisted on calculation of the <b>cardan</b> <b>transmission</b> for Dacia 1304 / 1307...|$|E

The paper {{presents}} in {{its first}} part the need for analysing {{the functioning of the}} cardan cross within the <b>cardan</b> <b>transmission,</b> both {{from the point of view}} of its shape and from the point of view of the material. In the second part there are described the main elements for analysing the test samples, the employed testing machine, as well as the manner of processing the obtained information. The last part contains the conclusions resulted from this analysis...|$|E

For the determination of these changes {{it is first necessary}} to identify these deviations and give them a geometrical interpretation. By having as a purpose the identifying of both angular and axis deviations, over the kinematic parameters of the cardan joint mechanism, it is necessary to consider the cardan joint, not as a spherical quadrilateral but as a particular case of RCCC mechanism where by C, R was noted the cylindrical kinematic pair respectively the rotation kinematic pair...|$|R
40|$|The shafts {{transmissions}} {{that can}} be treated as the elastic linkage systems of various sections, length and specific weights, suspended on elastic supports. The average fiber elastic deforms under the action of own weight static, generating a mass eccentric to the axis of rotation of its own. The eccentric mass during the even rotation produces a centrifugal force, which increases the elastic deformation leading to the occurrence of bending vibration. The own pulses of this vibrations depend on the mechanic and constructiv caracteristic of the <b>cardan</b> <b>transmissions.</b> This paper presents the influence these characteristic over the frequencies and vibration modes inherent at bending and based on numerical simulations will draw conclusion...|$|R
