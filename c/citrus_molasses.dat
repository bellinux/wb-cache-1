40|$|Aims: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to obtain {{improved}} strains of pectinolytic yeasts adapted to the conditions of an industrial fermentation process, which was continuously operated to convert <b>citrus</b> <b>molasses</b> into ethanol. Methods and Results: the starter yeast of the industrial fermentation process was a commercial baker's yeast, which was capable of growing without forming any secretion halo of pectinase activity on solid medium. Nevertheless, isolates showing secretion of pectinolytic activity on plates were obtained from the fermentation process. The secretion of pectin-degrading activity by isolates on plates was repressed by galactose and improved as the result of colony aging on polygalacturonic acid plates at 30 degrees C. Liquefaction of polygalacturonate gels as well as the splitting of the pectin-degrading activity into a wall-linked and a supernatant fraction were also observed when the starter yeast was propagated under agitation in liquid medium containing pectin. Conclusions: Isolates capable of secreting pectinolytic activity on plates were predominant at the end of the <b>citrus</b> <b>molasses</b> fermentation. Nevertheless, the sizes of the secretion haloes on plates were not necessarily an indication of the levels of pectinolytic activity secreted in the liquid medium. Significance and Impact of the Study: Improved pectinolytic strains of Saccharomyces can be used as a source of pectinases for a variety of applications. This organism also participates in plant deterioration processes...|$|E
40|$|Samples of midseason Florida <b>citrus</b> <b>molasses</b> from 10 {{different}} {{manufacturing plants}} were studied during 2 years of production for suitability as fermentation substrates. They were analyzed for degrees Brix, pH, percentage of protein, and {{free amino acid}} content. The following ranges of values were obtained: degrees Brix, 65. 4 to 73. 0; pH, 4. 2 to 6. 4; and protein, 3. 3 to 5. 1 %. Although the general characteristics of all samples were quite similar, the total free amino acid content {{and the number of}} amino acids differed from year to year and from plant to plant. The free amino acids consistently present were asparagine, aspartic acid, alanine, γ-amino-butyric, glycine, glutamic acid, proline, serine, and threonine. Occasionally found were arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and valine. An extremely high level of proline was detected in all samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{conditions}} required for production of levo 2, 3 -butylene glycol by Bacillus polymyxa from <b>citrus</b> <b>molasses</b> were studied. Starter cultures required acclimatization to the substrate prior to inoculation of the fermentation medium. Maximal production of butylene glycol with minimal residual sugar was obtained with a medium consisting of molasses, diluted to 20 ° Brix, and 0. 4 % urea. Optimal environmental conditions included aeration at 0. 11 volumes of air per volume of medium per minute, maintenance of pH at 6. 0 to 6. 2, a fermentation temperature of 30 C, and a stirring rate of 420 rev/min. The concentration of butylene glycol {{obtained in the}} fermentation beer ranged from 2. 3 to 4. 4 %. The optical rotation of the glycol ranged from [α]D 23 ° = - 1. 01 ° to - 10. 45 °. The variation in rotation was {{probably due to the}} presence of contaminating substances in the distillate...|$|E
40|$|Filtered {{stillage}} {{from the}} distillation of ethanol made by yeast fermentation of sugarcane <b>molasses,</b> <b>citrus</b> waste, and sweet whey was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and by high-performance liquid chromatography. Nearly {{all of the}} major peaks representing low molecular weight organic components were identified. The major components in cane stillage were, in decreasing order of concentration, lactic acid, glycerol, ethanol, and acetic acid. In citrus stillage they were lactic acid, glycerol, myo-inositol, acetic acid, chiro-inositol, and proline. Finally, in whey stillage the major components were lactose, lactic acid, glycerol, acetic acid, glucose, arabinitol, and ribitol...|$|R
50|$|This {{grass is}} grown in {{pastures}} for grazing and is cut for fodder, including hay and silage. It {{is often used}} for grazing beef cattle, {{and it is also}} used to raise dairy cattle, sheep, and goats. It is not a very nutritious grass, so it is generally supplemented with legumes for nitrogen and <b>molasses,</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp, or bran for energy. One experimental supplement for goats is a mix of groundnut cake and wheat bran. Legumes that have been added as supplements include Cratylia argentea, Erythrina poeppigiana, Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena leucocephala. The protein content and digestibility of the grass are lowest in the dry season.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if feeding carbohydrate supplements with faster degradation rates than corn to dairy cows grazing ryegrass would improve nitrogen capture, milk production, and components. Treatments were grain supplements based on: 1) corn (CORN), 2) barley and molasses (BM), or 3) <b>citrus</b> pulp and <b>molasses</b> (CM). For BM and CM, the diet composition was the same as that of CORN except that a portion of the corn was replaced with barley and <b>molasses</b> or <b>citrus</b> pulp and <b>molasses,</b> respectively, on a dry matter basis. Cows grazed ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) pasture. Yield of milk, 3. 5 % fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, and milk fat, as well as milk fat percentage, were not different among treatments. True milk protein percentage was higher for CORN (2. 81 %) compared with CM (2. 70 %), but was not different for BM (2. 77 %). However, true milk protein yield was not different among treatments. Milk urea N was higher for BM(11. 43 mg/dL) compared with both CORN and CM (average: 9. 95 mg/dL). There were no differences among CORN, BM, and CM treatments for overall BUN (average: 10. 60 mg/dL). At 0400 h, however, cows on CORN had higher BUN than cows on CM(11. 43 vs. 9. 96 mg/dL), but there were no differences between CORN and BM (average: 11. 21 mg/dL) or BM and CM (average: 10. 48 mg/dL), and there were no differences among treatments at other time points. The CM diet might have shown more advantage if the pasture crude protein content was higher. Partial replacement of corn with citrus pulp for grazing cows should be further studied using pasture with higher crude protein content. Although cows receiving CM and BM did not produce more milk than cows on CORN, if barley or citrus pulp is less expensive than corn, they may be viable replacements for a portion of the corn supplement for grazing cows...|$|R
40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are widely recognized as {{an important source of}} beneficial compounds for the human nutrition. Citrus and juices are widely consumed in the world. Their health benefits have been recognized {{for a long time now}} since first cultivated in Asia. The market of oranges is growing constantly, because consumers have become more convenience-oriented and health conscious. Consequently, efforts by researchers and industrial organizations have been made to develop processes more efficient, putting emphasis in food quality and safety. In addition, with the increasing emphasis on water pollution control, industries are establishing programs that will permit disposal of their wastewater without damaging the environment. The citrus fruit industry is no exception. Citrus wastes, such as wet peels and whole rejected fruit, which a great amount of organic matter that can be associated with environmental and health problems due to water runoff and uncontrolled fermentation. Therefore, the development of optimized systems for the treatment of citrus wastes is a crucial factor in the rationalization of the traditional industrial cycle. Membrane operations in the last years have shown their potentialities in the rationalization of production systems. Their intrinsic characteristics of efficiency, operational simplicity and flexibility, relatively high selectivity and permeability for the transport of specific components, low energy requirements, good stability under a wide spectrum of operating conditions, environment compatibility, easy control and scale-up have been confirmed in a large variety of applications and operations in the food industry. Recent R&D efforts aim to convert the potential of wastes into profitable products creating new segments of production and offsetting the disposal costs. Orange peels and pulp contain several bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, recognized for their beneficial implications in human health due to their antioxidant activity and free radical scavenging ability. These semi-solid wastes can be pressed to obtain a liquid rich in soluble sugars, named press liquor, that can be concentrated up to <b>citrus</b> <b>molasses</b> grade or alternatively exploited as a natural source for the extraction of phenolic compounds which can be used as natural antioxidants mainly in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and foods industry. This PhD dissertation is based on the opportunity to develop a technical alternative to solve some problems related to the disposal of citrus wastes from an economic and environmental point of view, specifically in terms of recovery of attractive compounds present in orange press liquor. The general aim of the work was devoted to the recovery of phenolic compounds by using an integrated membrane process, in which microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and osmotic distillation (OD) processes were involved. MF or UF processes were used for the clarification of the press liquor in order to separate macromolecules, such as pectins, and to obtain a clarified press liquor as permeate stream. In the second step the clarified press liquor obtained from the MF/UF process was treated by NF in order to obtain a retentate stream enriched in phenolic compounds with a low content of sugars. Finally, OD was used as final step to concentrate the NF retentate stream. In the first Chapter, a general overview of membrane operations, including methodologies to evaluate their performance, is reported. The industrial transformation of citrus fruits and the associated production of citrus wastes is reported in Chapter 2. In this Chapter the chemico-physical characterization of citrus press liquor used for the experimental activities performed on membrane laboratory plants is also included. Chapter 3 is focused on the experimental activities concerning the clarification of citrus press liquor by using MF or UF processes. In Chapter 4 the fractionation of clarified press liquor by using NF membranes is analysed and discussed. Experimental activities related to the concentration of the NF retentate by using OD are described in Chapter 5 Scuola di Dottorato di Scienza e Tecnica "Bernardino Telesio", Organic Materials of Pharmaceutical interest XXVI Ciclo, a. a. 2013 Università della Calabri...|$|E
