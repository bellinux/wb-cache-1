5000|$|On July 7 First deputy Prosecutor General Yury Buiryukov resigned. On September 13, 2006, the Prosecutor General's Office under Yury Chaika {{announced}} that it had attained the dismissals of 19 unnamed high-rank state employees involved in the furniture smuggling cases as well as illegal imports of consumer goods from China, although unlike employees of furniture companies, no official has ever been charged with this. Mass media revealed that the officials dismissed around that time {{had worked in the}} Moscow and federal offices of FSB, [...] Prosecutor General's Office, [...] Moscow Regional Prosecutor's Office, Federal Customs Service and Presidential Executive Office. Deputy heads of the FSB Internal Security Department also figured in the report authored by Viktor Cherkesov. The purge has occurred while FSB head Nikolai Patrushev was on vacations. Vladimir Vdovin, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Federal Property Fund, has also resigned after 12 years in office on September 19, 2006, officially because of a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>job,</b> but it was rumored that his dismissal was linked to the Three Whales case.|$|E
30|$|At {{the same}} time, {{an erosion of}} the normal {{employment}} conditions with respect to standard labour 1 conditions and contracts can also be observed.

30|$|Second, {{there are}} {{different}} kinds <b>of</b> <b>job</b> mobility, and also <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> employer can occur in different ways. Previous works have shown the importance of rationale and volition with respect to employer <b>changes.</b> Involuntary <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> seem to decrease income whereas changing job voluntarily appears to increase income (Keith and McWilliams 1995 : 133). According to some authors this is only or especially the case {{when there is no}} intervening episode of unemployment (Keith and McWilliams 1999 : 473; Schmelzer 2012 : 93), but others have reported that indirect job mobility (i.e. when there is an intervening episode of unemployment) has a stronger beneficial effect on income (Antel 1991 : 305).|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, we {{estimate}} fixed effects regression models {{which account for}} anticipation and adaptation <b>of</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction to <b>job</b> <b>changes</b> independent <b>of</b> a <b>change</b> in self-employment. Due to our data base, anticipation encompasses not only a lookahead to self-employment but also other influences prior to becoming self-employed. Our results show that negative anticipation effects are a general and pronounced effect preceding any <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs.</b> Individuals who become self-employed experience less distinctive negative anticipation. A positive effect <b>of</b> self-employment on <b>job</b> satisfaction lasting 3 years {{is also found in}} this model. In the long run we find that the self-employed are not better off than employees; put more precisely, we cannot reject the hypothesis that job satisfaction is ceteris paribus the same for the self-employed and employees.|$|R
50|$|Mercer {{was born}} in Bradford, Yorkshire, in March 1891. He {{was the son of}} William and Martha Mercer, and his father was a {{clothing}} manufacturer. Nothing is yet known about his musical education, but he was an accomplished solo pianist, giving concerts with the Bradford Permanent Orchestra, in Bradford in 1913, 1914 and 1922. He served in World War I, and he married Annie M. Chew in 1924 in the parish church of Wyke, Yorkshire. They had no children. By 1931, he had joined the music department of the North Western Polytechnic, Kentish Town, London, where he taught piano. He must have spent much time preparing his edition of Burney's General History of Music, which was published in 2 volumes in 1935. In 1939, he was living with his wife at an address in Fulham Road, Chelsea, London. They came to Bristol in 1944, perhaps because of a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>job,</b> and moved to a house in Sefton Park Road. This was very near his brother and sister in law, James and Amy Briggs. Mercer was involved with the Bristol Amateur Operatic Society as musical director until the early 1950s when he resigned due to ill-health. As well as his work on Burney he also wrote a Record of Concerts in the 17th and 18th Centuries which was unpublished. As far as can be discovered he published nothing more. He died at Bristol, 17 January 1955, aged 64, after a long illness, and was cremated at Arno's Vale crematorium. He left no will. His widow died in March 1967.|$|E

50|$|Social {{mobility}} is {{the movement}} along social strata or hierarchies by individuals, ethnic group, or nations. There {{is a change}} in literacy, income distribution, education and health status. The movement can be vertical or horizontal. Vertical is the upward or downward movement along social strata which occurs due to <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> or marriage. Horizontal movement along levels that are equally ranked. Intra-generational mobility is a social status change in a generation (single lifetime). For example, a person moves from a junior staff in an organization to the senior management. The absolute management movement is where a person gains better social status than their parents, and this can be due to improved security, economic development, and better education system. Relative mobility is where some individual are expected to have higher social ranks than their parents.|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to perform a {{population-based}} follow-up of people with childhood atopic dermatitis with respect to the possible influence on their worklife. Methods Medical records of the school health care services in Stockholm, Sweden, were reviewed for people born between 1960 and 1969. Altogether 600 persons with signs of atopic dermatitis ('' cases '') and 600 matched controls without eczema ('' controls '') were identified. Of these people, 405 cases and 378 controls answered a postal questionnaire focusing on choice of job, occupational exposure, past and present skin disease, and <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> due to eczema. Results The proportions of cases and controls in jobs with a high risk of hand eczema were similar, as was the exposure to water, detergents, chemicals, and hand washing. The self-reported cumulative prevalence of hand eczema was 42 % for the cases and 13 % for the controls (P < 0. 001). The 1 -year prevalence was 24 % for the cases and 9 % for the controls (P < 0. 001). Among the cases, 9 % reported a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> due to eczema compared with 2 % of the controls (P < 0. 001).
