50|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>long-horned</b> <b>beetle</b> (Anoplophora chinensis) is a long-horned beetle {{native to}} Japan, China and Korea, {{where it is}} {{considered}} a serious pest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>long-horned</b> <b>beetle</b> poses an {{unprecedented}} {{threat to the}} environment in North America because it attacks healthy trees and has no natural enemies. Not only are greenbelts, urban landscapes and backyard trees at jeopardy, but also orchards, forests, and endangered salmon, and wildlife habitat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>long-horned</b> <b>beetle</b> (A. chinensis syn. A. malasiaca) {{has been}} {{introduced}} from Asia to Europe and North America. It is a pest of citrus and other fruit and nut trees. It infests forest trees and ornamentals. It attacks over 100 species of trees, shrubs, and herbs from many plant families. Damage from its wood-boring larvae can kill trees.|$|E

50|$|Each female <b>citrus</b> <b>long-horned</b> <b>beetle</b> {{can make}} up to 200 eggs after mating, and each egg is {{separately}} deposited in tree bark. After the beetle larvae hatches, it chews into the tree, forming a tunnel that is then used as a place for beetle pupation (the process of growing from larvae to adult). From egg-laying to pupation and adult emergence can take twelve to eighteen months.|$|E
50|$|Examples of more recent, and {{sometimes}} unwelcome, arrivals are the Asian tiger mosquito from Southeast Asia, the <b>citrus</b> <b>long-horned</b> <b>beetle</b> from China, the citrus pest cottony cushion scale, the pumpkinseed fish, the mosquitofish, the Louisiana crayfish, the zebra mussel, the strawberry finch, the Eastern grey squirrel, Finlayson's squirrel and the coypu. Two introduced parrot species, the monk parakeet and the rose-ringed parakeet, {{are found in}} city parks.|$|E
50|$|Figs are {{keystone}} species in many rainforest ecosystems. Their fruit {{are a key}} resource for some frugivores including fruit bats, capuchin monkeys, langurs and mangabeys. They are even more important for some birds. Asian barbets, pigeons, hornbills, fig-parrots and bulbuls are examples of taxa that may almost entirely subsist on figs when these are in plenty. Many Lepidoptera caterpillars feed on fig leaves, for example several Euploea species (crow butterflies), the plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes), the brown awl (Badamia exclamationis), and Chrysodeixis eriosoma, Choreutidae and Copromorphidae moths. The <b>citrus</b> <b>long-horned</b> <b>beetle</b> (Anoplophora chinensis), for example, has larvae that feed on wood, including that of fig trees; it can become a pest in fig plantations. Similarly, the sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is frequently found as a pest on figs grown as potted plants and is spread through the export of these plants to other localities. For a list of other diseases common to fig trees, see List of foliage plant diseases (Moraceae).|$|E

25|$|In September 1998, US customs {{regulations}} were changed to require wooden packing materials from China be chemically treated or kiln-dried {{to prevent further}} infestations of the Asian <b>long-horned</b> <b>beetle</b> from arriving.

50|$|Dinoptera is a genus of the Lepturinae {{subfamily}} in <b>long-horned</b> <b>beetle</b> family.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>long-horned</b> <b>beetle</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the U.S. in April 1999, when a single beetle {{was found in a}} nursery greenhouse in Athens, Georgia on certain bonsai trees imported from China. More seriously, the beetle was later discovered on 9 August 2001, at a Tukwila, Washington nursery near Seattle in a shipment from Korea of 369 bonsai maple trees. Three of the beetles were captured at the nursery, including a mated female ready to lay eggs, but when the bonsai trees were dissected, eight larvae exit tunnels were found, indicating that five more might have escaped into the surrounding community. Those five could lead to thousands of others because females lay 200 eggs at a time beneath the bark of trees. Because this beetle may have other outlying infestations that are yet to be discovered, {{it is important not to}} move firewood [...] even in areas with no known pest infestations.|$|E
