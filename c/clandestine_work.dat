5|$|The {{day after}} this tragedy, {{workers in the}} unorganized leather {{industry}} of Topsia area held protest rallies demanding compensation for the relatives of the deceased workers, better working conditions and a probe into the fire mishap. The mayor of Kolkata convened an all-party meeting to discuss the incident and also promised to initiate a drive demolish illegal constructions in the area. The labour inspectors inspected the building and declared the factory as illegal. Even though the building was declared illegal and unsafe, a month later, the police raided the house and found that another leather factory was operating behind closed doors in {{the ground floor of}} the building. The civic officials issued a notice to stop any work in the building. Though local residents alleged that <b>clandestine</b> <b>work</b> started in the building with the help of local MLA, Javen Khan, Khan himself blamed it rather on the police.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Eastern theatre, {{members of}} the Berlin Committee, {{including}} Har Dayal and M. P. T. Acharya, were sent on missions to Baghdad and Syria {{in the summer of}} 1915, tasked to infiltrate the Indian Expeditionary Force in southern Mesopotamia and Egypt and to attempt to assassinate British officers. The Indian effort was divided into two groups, one consisting of a Bengali revolutionary P.N. Dutt (alias Dawood Ali Khan) and Pandurang Khankoje. This group arrived at Bushire, where they worked with Wilhelm Wassmuss and distributed nationalist and revolutionary literature among Indian troops in Mesopotamia and Persia. The other group, working with Egyptian nationalists, attempted to block the Suez Canal. These groups carried out successful <b>clandestine</b> <b>work</b> in spreading nationalist literature and propaganda amongst the Indian troops in Mesopotamia, and on one occasion even bombed an officer's mess. Nationalist work also extended at this time to recruiting Indian prisoners of war in Constantinople, Bushire, Kut-al-Amara. M. P. T. Acharya's own works were directed at forming the Indian National Volunteer Corps with the help of Indian civilians in Turkey, and to recruiting Indian prisoners of war. He is further known to have worked along with Wilhelm Wassmuss in Bushire amongst Indian troops. The efforts were, however, ultimately hampered by differences between the Berlin committee members who were predominantly Hindus, and Indian revolutionaries already in Turkey who were largely Muslims. Further, the Egyptian nationalists distrusted the Berlin Committee, which was seen by the former as a German instrument.|$|E

40|$|Miguel Benitez : Enlightenment and elitism in <b>clandestine</b> <b>works.</b> The {{existence}} of clandestine literature indicates {{a desire to}} spread Enlightenment; this desire {{is evident in the}} simple structure of these treatises, in the repeated attacks on obscure scholastic terminology and in the deliberate use of simple language. The Philosophe's duty was to teach the truth and he must write for the people. Yet we often find elitist declarations which cannot be explained by fear of persecution; the belief that the people must be left in ignorance does not disappear as the century progresses, despite a relative liberalization of society. Apart from a radical minority, generally {{to be found in the}} first thirty years of the century, the aim of <b>clandestine</b> <b>works</b> was not to enlighten the people. Benítez Miguel.

25|$|The fourth congress, held in July 1946, {{pointed to}} massive popular {{struggle}} {{as the only}} way to overthrow the regime, and stated the policies that would help the party lead that same popular movement. This, along with the consolidation of the <b>clandestine</b> <b>work,</b> was the main conclusion of the congress. A brief report of the conclusions of this congress were published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At this time, Álvaro Cunhal travelled to Yugoslavia with the aid of Bento de Jesus Caraça to improve relations with the Socialist Bloc. Later, in 1948, he travelled to the Soviet Union to speak with Mikhail Suslov, after which the bonds between the PCP and the International Communist Movement were reestablished. Soon after returning from the Soviet Union, Cunhal was arrested by the PIDE.|$|E

500|$|Voltaire {{published}} Candide {{simultaneously in}} five countries {{no later than}} 15 January 1759, although the exact date is uncertain. Seventeen versions of Candide from 1759, in the original French, are known today, {{and there has been}} great controversy over which is the earliest. More versions were published in other languages: Candide was translated once into Italian and thrice into English that same year. The complicated science of calculating the relative publication dates of all of the versions of Candide is described at length in Wade's article [...] "The First Edition of Candide: A Problem of Identification". The publication process was extremely secretive, probably the [...] "most <b>clandestine</b> <b>work</b> of the century", because of the book's obviously illicit and irreverent content. The greatest number of copies of Candide were published concurrently in Geneva by Cramer, in Amsterdam by Marc-Michel Rey, in London by Jean Nourse, and in Paris by Lambert.|$|E

25|$|In the Victorian period, {{the quality}} of erotic fiction was much below that of the {{previous}} century—it was largely written by 'hacks'. Some works, however, borrowed from established literary models, such as Dickens. It also featured a curious form of social stratification. Even {{in the throes of}} orgasm, the social distinctions between master and servant (including form of address) were scrupulously observed. Significant elements of sado-masochism were present in some examples, perhaps reflecting the influence of the English public school, where flagellation was routinely used as a punishment. These <b>clandestine</b> <b>works</b> were often anonymous or written under a pseudonym, and sometimes undated, thus definite information about them often proves elusive.|$|R

40|$|The main {{merit of}} Deslandes' account of Epicureanism, {{faithful}} to Roman and Greek texts and indebted to Gassendi' s rehabilitation of Epicurus, {{is to remove}} biographical innuendo and abusive ideological usage {{from the study of}} his conceptions. This article shows however that Deslandes, libertine and free¬ thinker, does not present a militant Epicureanism in this banned work. While praising the ethic of moderate pleasure and above all Epicurus' s religious practice, he rejects the physics of the clinamen (contrary to natural laws) and the gnoseology of simulacri (contrary to optics). This article attempts to show, by an analysis of the text, that the history of the censorship of <b>clandestine</b> <b>works</b> and conjectures concerning their authors' hidden' philosophy should not make one forget their conceptual content.
