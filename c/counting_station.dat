40|$|Abstract: We used point count {{data from}} a 3 -year {{experiment}} measuring the impact of firewood cutting on an oak woodland bird community to recommend a sampling design for detecting environmental impacts on bird population trends. The optimal allocation of sampling effort to <b>count</b> <b>stations</b> and visits varied from two to seven visits per station depending on the bird species. When the number of <b>count</b> <b>stations</b> was constrained by logistics, additional visits increased statistical power to detect an effect to acceptable levels (> 0. 5) for some species. Depending on the species, 14 to 920 <b>count</b> <b>stations</b> per treatment level were necessary to detect a 50 percent difference in {{the mean number of}} birds counted with power = 0. 8. As California’s oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands come under increasing pressure from human activities, so increases the need for the reliable detection of impacts on wildlife. In an experimental framework, the challenge is to isolate the effects of interest from natural spatial and temporal variability using an appropriate statistical test (Osenberg and others 1994). The power of a statistical test is the probability that it will find an effect of a specified size to be significant (Cohen 1988). Thus, power is critical in studies evaluating the impacts of environmenta...|$|R

5000|$|For {{the local}} {{government}} elections held on 7 May 1989 a number of East German opposition groups co-ordinated their activities to evaluate {{the fairness of the}} process, through simple observation at the polling stations and counting. The implausibility of reported election results in East Germany was nothing new, but the mood of openness openness and the increase in citizen dissatisfaction with the system supported a move to identify and publicise what was done. Although observation and analysis took place across the country, the election monitoring undertaken by citizens in the Berlin quarter of Weißensee was particularly detailed, due in part to Evelyn Zupke's careful organisation of it and in part to the number of people participating in the exercise. In contrast to other towns and districts, in Weißensee there were observers at virtually every polling station. Of the 66 polling stations only one operated unobserved. [...] This was the polling station at the prestigious Weißensee Arts Academy where, as Zupke later observed, the opposition groups had no contacts. [...] "Students did not belong to the opposition circles" [...] ("Studenten gehörten nicht zum oppositionellen Milieu."). [...] Elections in the German Democratic Republic were organised according to a [...] "Single list" [...] system. Voters were given a piece of paper listing the officially approved candidates and could endorse it by placing their voting slip in the appropriate ballot box. For voters not wishing to endorse the candidates listed there was a separate ballot box {{at the far end of}} the polling station. This was intended to discourage people from voting the wrong way, but it also made it relatively easy for observers to count the votes, independently of any officially declared results. In Zupke's apartment there was a parallel <b>counting</b> <b>station</b> operated by the Peace Circle. [...] Actual results were communicated by the opposition groups to western media, as a result of which the election details were reported widely in West Germany.|$|E
