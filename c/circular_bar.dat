40|$|AbstractTorsion of elastic <b>circular</b> <b>bars</b> of {{radially}} inhomogeneous, cylindrically orthotropic {{materials is}} studied {{with emphasis on}} the end effects. To examine the conjecture of Saint-Venant’s torsion, we consider torsion of <b>circular</b> <b>bars</b> with one end fixed and the other end free on which tractions that results in a pure torque are prescribed arbitrarily over the free end surface. Exact solutions that satisfy the prescribed boundary conditions point by point over the entire boundary surfaces are derived in a unified manner for cylindrically orthotropic bars with or without radial inhomogeneity and for their counterparts of Saint-Venant’s torsion. Stress diffusion due to the end effect is examined {{in the light of}} the exact solutions...|$|R
40|$|Three bar of {{revolution}} theories are developed. The most inclusive theory {{is equivalent to}} the Mindlin-McNiven theory for <b>circular</b> <b>bars</b> in that it includes radial, axial shear, and longitudinal modes. By removing the axial shear mode in the foregoing, a theory equivalent to the Mindlin-Herrmann theory for <b>circular</b> <b>bars</b> is obtained. Finally, by eliminating all the radial effects in this latter theory, a simple theory incorporating only longitudinal effects is obtained. Each of these three theories is then specialized for a conical geometry and solved by the method of characteristics for the case of a longitudinal impact. The solutions for each of these theories are then compared to published surface meridional strain and internal strain data. In addition, the importance of impact pulse duration in establishing the validity of the approximate bar theories for impact problems is analytically indicated...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the quality and}} its improvement of friction welded joints between a rectangular section <b>bar</b> and a <b>circular</b> section <b>bar.</b> Three kinds of rectangular section bars with different aspect ratio {{were used for the}} experiment. The rectangular section <b>bars</b> and <b>circular</b> section <b>bars</b> were joined by using a continuous drive(brake type) friction welding machine with an electromagnetic clutch in order to prevent a braking deformation during rotation stop. 　The low heat input friction welding method (LHI method) was used for joining. 　　The following conclusions were given. 　　(1) The first phase of the friction stage was composed of wear and seizure stages. 　This result was similar to the join of <b>circular</b> section <b>bars</b> of same diameter. 　　(2) When the areas of the weld faying surfaces were same each other，the initial torque and the elapsed time for initial torque hardly changed in spite of the aspect ratios of rectangular section bars. 　　(3) The welded joints obtained only the first stage (up to initial torque) had 100 ％ joint efficiency， but fractures occurred between the welded interface and base metal. When small aspcct ratios of rectangular section <b>bars</b> and a <b>circular</b> section <b>bar</b> were welded， several joints fractured at the base metal although they had a little defect in the welded interface. 　　(4) When the joints were made by the LHI method in Ar atmosphere， the welded joints had 100 ％ joint efficiency, but fractures occurred between the welded interface and base metal. 　　(5) The welded joints had 100 ％joint efficiency and fractured at the base metal when the joints were made by the LHI method with adding forge pressure (improving LHI method). 　On the other hand，most of the welded joints made by the conventional method with forge pressure had fractures occurred between the welded interface and base metal. 　　(6) The improving LHI method has more advantages than those welded by the conventional method,I. e. ，less burn-off,less burr and less deformation of welded interface area. As a conclusion，it was clarincd that the improving LHI method is the most effective friction welding method for rectangular section <b>bars</b> and <b>circular</b> section <b>bars...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cracks {{that are}} {{developed}} in pipes, pressure vessels and <b>circular</b> <b>bars</b> due to improper welding are often idealized to be circumferential, penny-shaped or flat toroidal. Based on the three-dimensional Navier's equations in cylindrical coordinates, we derive the general displacement functions {{for both the}} penny-shaped and circumferential cracks by eigenfunction expansion method. We find that only those terms of the first order displacement and stress {{are similar to the}} case of three-dimensional straight plane cracks and that the higher order terms are coupled through the equilibrium equations. The strength of coupling depends on the ratio r̄ = r/a where r is the radius normal to the crack front and 2 a is the diameter of the circular crack tip.

First, for a specified geometry the twelve governing differential equations of equilibrium and deformations are presented within the framework of linear elasticity. Then the method of variation of parameters and the method of dynamic stiffness matrix are outlined as two alternative methods for solving the resulting equations. Finally, the dynamic stiffness matrix procedure is introduced as a more practical numerical procedure to solve the boundary value problem. The procedure is developed starting from the dynamic transport matrix and is used to develop a true helicoidal finite element.

40|$|Large elastic-plastic torsion {{of uniform}} <b>circular</b> <b>bars</b> is {{investigated}} numerically, using special finite elements. Two end conditions corresponding to fixed-end torsion and free-end torsion, resp., are considered, taking full {{account of the}} axial effects.

Either linear hardening or power law hardening uniaxial stress-strain curves are assumed in the analysis. Results are presented in terms of predicted torque vs. twist curves for all eases. Furthermore, we present axial force vs. twist curves for fixed-end torsion or elongation vs. twist curves for free-end torsion. Special attention is paid to the so-called plastic spin, a concept which has recently been identified to {{play a key role in}} the description of induced anisotropy.

40|$|Inserting fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) strips into pre-cut grooves is {{an emerging}} technique for the retrofit of unreinforced masonry (URM) structures. This method, known as near surface mounting (NSM), provides significant advantages over externally bonded FRP strips {{in that it}} has less of {{an effect on the}} aesthetics of a structure and can sustain higher loading before debonding. As this technique is relatively new, few studies into the behaviour of masonry walls strengthened using this technique are available. Marshall and Sweeney have used carbon FRP (CFRP) NSM strips to improve the in-plane flexural behaviour of masonry shear walls, but they did not use the strengthening technique to prevent sliding or diagonal cracking failure. Tinazzi and Nanni strengthened URM shear panels using NSM <b>circular</b> glass FRP <b>bars,</b> but not strips. Thin rectangular strips are more efficient than <b>circular</b> <b>bars,</b> because the confinement around the strip is maximised. An experimental investigation was conducted to study the in-plane shear behaviour of masonry walls strengthened with NSM CFRP strips. As part of the study four URM walls and seven strengthened walls were tested in diagonal tension/shear (ASTM E 519 - 93). Different reinforcement orientations were used, including: vertical; horizontal; and a combination of both. The effect of nonsymmetric reinforcement was also studied...|$|R

40|$|Round {{conductive}} bars {{embedded in}} semi-closed slots are frequently {{used in the}} construction of electric machinery, for instance in the squirrel cage of induction motors. Frequently, such as in the study of induction motor steady-state performance at rated slip, it is useful to estimate the slot leakage inductance of these conductors under the hypothesis of no eddy currents and no magnetic saturation. This is usually done through simple approximated analytical formulas available in the literature. In this paper, an improved explicit ready-to-use leakage inductance expression for <b>circular</b> <b>bars</b> embedded in semi-closed slots is derived by solving Poisson's equation in the slot domain. The precision of the proposed formulation is assessed against Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for various slot geometries and is shown to always give very accurate results, with errors below 2 %. Conversely, approximated simplified formulas available from the literature are demonstrated to possibly give large errors, which exceed 20 % for some explored slot geometries...|$|R

40|$|The work {{investigates the}} stress {{concentrations}} produced by periodic notches (i. e. uniformly repeated) in elastic solids under different loading conditions. Neuber's criterion, which likens {{the effect of}} a periodic notch to a single notch of similar profile but lesser depth, is critically examined. The criterion simply correlates the depth reduction factor to the ratio between the depth and the pitch of the original periodic notch, regardless of its shape. By examining literature results in periodic notches on <b>circular</b> <b>bars</b> and plane strips under torsion or axial loads, the work proves the accuracy of the Neuber's method for the ideal configuration of a sharp and shallow notch under shear stresses. By contrast, for real notches with a large root radius and finite depth, the accuracy is very poor, in particular for normal stresses. However, it is found that by simply ‘repairing’ the expression of the depth reduction factor and distinguishing between notches under shear or normal stresses, the criterion provides very accurate results, and becomes quite useful for real geometries...|$|R
