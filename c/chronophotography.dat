25|$|Eadward Muybridge {{published}} his first <b>chronophotography</b> pictures in 1878. These sequential pictures were soon mounted in zoetropes by several people (including Muybridge himself) and were also published as strips for the zoetrope in the 1880s. This {{paved the way}} for the development of motion pictures. Muybridge's own Zoopraxiscope (1879) was an early moving image projector and one of several inventions made before the breakthrough in 1895.|$|E
25|$|While Marey's {{scientific}} {{achievements in}} {{the realms of}} cardiology and aerodynamics (as well as pioneering work in photography and <b>chronophotography)</b> are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, {{in some of his}} published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).|$|E
25|$|A {{predecessor}} to cinematography {{and moving}} film, <b>chronophotography</b> involved a series or succession of different images, originally created {{and used for}} {{the scientific study of}} movement. These studies would directly influence Marcel Duchamp's Nu descendant un escalier n° 2 and could also be read into Metzinger's work of 1910-14, though rather than simultaneously superimposing successive images to depict the motion, Metzinger represents the subject at rest viewed from multiple angles; the dynamic role is played by the artist rather than the subject.|$|E
25|$|In the composition, Metzinger depicts motion, not of {{the subject}} matter as the Futurists {{relative}} to the observer, but by successive superimposed images captured by the artist in motion relative to (or around) the subject matter. The <b>Chronophotography</b> of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey that directly influenced Marcel Duchamp's 1912 Nu descendant un escalier n° 2 could also be read into Metzinger's work of 1911–12, though here, rather than simultaneously superimposing successive images to depict the motion of the horse, Metzinger represents a horse at rest viewed from multiple angles; the dynamic role is played by the artist.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 the {{photographic}} motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey particularly interested {{artists of the}} Section d'Or, including Jean Metzinger, Marcel Duchamp and Albert Gleizes. A predecessor to cinematography and moving film, <b>chronophotography</b> involved a series or succession of different images, originally created and used for {{the scientific study of}} movement. These chronophotographs included a series of dancers and women washing. Though Gleizes may not have seen these specific photographs he was likely interested in the same idea, as were the Futurists. The motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing too at the time.|$|E
500|$|McCay was {{concerned}} with depicting the seldom-perceived minutiae of movement, though his was not the scientific curiosity found in the <b>chronophotography</b> of Eadweard Muybridge, Étienne-Jules Marey, and Georges Demenÿ. [...] McCay emphasizes the lack of order and irrational unpredictability of the human body. [...] McCay's concern was to culminate in his pioneering animated films such as Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). [...] Comic strips as early as A.B. Frost's incorporated the repetition of backgrounds inspired by <b>chronophotography,</b> {{and by the time}} of Sammy Sneeze had become a standard comic-strip trope—one comics historian Thierry Smolderen suggests McCay may have deliberately parodied.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the posed, static figures typical of paintings of the period, Bruegel suggests the trajectory {{of time and space}} through the accelerated movement of the figures. [...] Critics Charcot and Richer wrote that the concept of visualizing movement was not formulated until the 17th century, and that Bruegel prefigures motion pictures and Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2. [...] Karcioglu sees the painting as anticipating the 19th-century <b>chronophotography</b> of Étienne-Jules Marey.

5000|$|<b>Chronophotography</b> {{is defined}} as [...] "a set of {{photographs}} of a moving object, taken {{for the purpose of}} recording and exhibiting successive phases of motion". The term <b>chronophotography</b> was coined by French physiologist Étienne-Jules Marey to describe photographs of movement from which measurements could be taken and motion could be studied. It is derived from the Greek word χρόνος chrónos ("time") combined with photography.|$|E

50|$|The Lumière Brothers {{were not}} the only ones to claim the title of the first cinematographers. The {{scientific}} <b>chronophotography</b> devices developed by Eadweard Muybridge, Étienne-Jules Marey and Ottomar Anschütz in the 1880s were able to produce moving photographs, as was William Friese-Greene's 'chronophotographic' system, demonstrated in 1890.Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope (developed by W K-L Dickson), premiered in 1891.|$|E
5000|$|In the Nineteenth century, {{there was}} a debate about the {{inaccuracy}} in the way artists represented movement. This was spurred by the invention of <b>chronophotography</b> and the assumption that this new technology {{would be able to}} change the habits of human and animal locomotion from a more aesthetic and [...] "conventional" [...] (incorrect) locomotion to a more natural one.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chronophotography</b> is {{an antique}} {{photographic}} technique from the Victorian era (beginning about 1867-68), which captures movement in several frames of print. These prints can be subsequently arranged either like animation cels or layered {{in a single}} frame. It is a predecessor to cinematography and moving film, involving a series of different cameras, originally created and used for {{the scientific study of}} movement.|$|E
