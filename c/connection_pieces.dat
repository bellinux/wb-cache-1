40|$|Cold formed thin plated elements, {{often with}} typical Z or  cross section shape, serve as basic {{component}} to construct standard industrial halls, Figure 1. Their advantages are multifold: an economic construction is obtained since the proper {{weight of the}} structure is limited and thus also the steel consumption and transport towards the construction area. Construction is simple since easy to handle subcomponents are used that does not require heavy cranes. Because columns and beams consist of several subcomponents with basic class 4 Z or -members and intermediate <b>connection</b> <b>pieces</b> bolted together, their behavior will differ from traditional H-sections. In addition, the use of profiled wall and roof sheeting results in additional strength and stiffness. These elements are looked at in more detail, both from a numerical and experimental point of view. More specifically, the experimental behavior of a full-scale 3 D-structure, constructed of Z 300 / 2. 0 without and with sheeting is subjected to 4 different loading types, Figure 1. The obtained load-displacement diagrams are compared with numerical results. Based on these findings an optimized 3 D-structure Z 300 / 3. 0 without wall and roof sheeting is tested to validate the changes made to several connection parts and overall layout. This contribution focuses on the structural behavior of 3 D-structures made of thin plated cold formed sections, discrepancies in between the numerical and experimental results {{and the impact of}} detailing on the overall structural behaviorstatus: publishe...|$|E

To {{review the}} literature {{to establish the}} factors which have traditionally been regarded as most crucial {{to the design of}} effectlve exhaust ventilation systems. 2. To design, construct, install and calibrate a wind tunnel. 3. To develop procedures for air velocity measurement followed by a comprehensive programme of aerodvnamic data collection and data analysis for a variety of conditions. The major research findings were:- a) The literature in the subject is inadequate. There is a particular need for a much greater understanding of the aerodynamics of the suction flow field. b) The discrepancies between the experimentally observed centre-line velocities and those predicted by conventional formulae are unacceptably large. c) There was little agreement between theoretically calculated and observed velocities in the suction zone of captor hoods. d) Improved empirical formulae for the prediction of centre-line velocity applicable to the classical geometrically shaped suction openings and the flanged condition could be (and were) derived. Further analysis of data revealed that: - i) Point velocity is directly proportional to the suction. flow rate and the ratio of the point velocity to the average face velocity is constant. ii) Both shape, and size of the suction opening are significant factors as the coordinates of their points govern the extent of the effect of the suction flow field. iii) The hypothetical ellipsoidal potential function and hyperbolic streamlines were found experimentally to be correct. iv) The effect of guide plates depends on the size, shape and the angle of fitting. The effect was to very approximately double the suction velocity but the exact effect is difficult to predict. v) The axially symmetric openings produce practically symmetric flow fields. Similarity of <b>connection</b> <b>pieces</b> between the suction opening and the main duct in each case is essential in order to induce a similar suction flow field. Additionally a pilot study was made in which an artificial extraneous air flow was created, measured and its interaction with the suction flow field measured and represented graphically...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a study including testing, analysis and design on beam-to column connections for the frames of pultruded glass {{fibre reinforced plastic}} profiles. The research consists of the two principal aspects of a laboratory test programme to determine connection behaviour and the formulation of a plane frame analytical tool to determine the effect of real connection on frame behaviour. The laboratory tests involved three different 10 inch beam-to-column connections which can be categorised as having a moment-rotation behaviour that is pinned. These connections had web cleats and the method of connection was by bolting, or bolting combined with adhesive bonding. The test configuration had a central column and two beams in a cruciform arrangement. Loading was applied at the ends of the cantilever beams {{in such a way that}} the two identical connections experienced the same moment and shear force. The non-linear moment-rotation characteristics for the connections were determined and the modes of failure established. Another four tests were conducted on different 8 inch beam-to-column connections which can be categorised as being semi-rigid. Two of these connections used steel cleats for the top and bottom seat cleats while the other two had these pieces manufactured of pre-preg glass FRP using a pressure moulding process. The details and the results of these connection tests are presented. The results of the three tests on pinned connections confirmed conclusions previously reported on similar tests where the beams and column were of the 8 inch wide flange profile. The current practice of recommending that the cleated webs have combined bonding and bolting is shown to provide little additional benefit over that when the connection is bolted. It is found that a semi-rigid connection with an acceptable moment-rotation behaviour can be obtained using steel angles for the <b>connection</b> <b>pieces.</b> One of the two 'all' FRP connections was also found to have an acceptable moment-rotation characteristic but would be too complicated for real applications. The search therefore continues for the all FRP connection details giving suitable connection behaviour. Combining the results from these experiments and the analysis of the failure modes, a number of futuristic connection designs are proposed. They include a thin shell cleat piece with curvature to increase its stiffness, six connection details using pieces that connect together by interlock and bonding (this approach reduces the need for bolting) and a radically novel system which does not mimic current steelwork practice. A new analytical method is presented which predicts the static response of nonlinear elastic plane frames of polymeric composite members. Options allow for horizontal and vertical loading, second-order deflections and connections with nonlinear moment-rotation characteristics. The matrix stiffness method uses a new approach to cope with the real connection behaviour. The other novel aspects of the analysis are shear deformable members and new stability functions which account for the shear deformation when determining second-order deflections. A number of new (<p) functions are derived to group the new stability functions, and these can readily be employed in the computing analysis. The analysis is successfully benchmarked against known semi-rigid frame problems of steelwork and with the limited results from a single experiment on a pultruded single bay frame. A serviceability beam line is presented for beam design and a moment equalized connection stiffness is obtained. Two unbraced and one braced frame problems are analysed in a parametric study to determine the effect on frame response of having connections with various properties. Live loading is vertical with a horizontal component. Results of overall sway deflection showed how the frames respond when the connection properties are changed from pinned, through semi-rigid, to fully fixed. The sensitivity of the connection stiffness on the overall frame behaviour is demonstrated by the sway and the midspan deflections results, and by the moment distribution in the members. The analysis is shown to provide useful information in our quest for the optimised connection design and their performance when viewed as an integral part of a whole frame. To establish which connection details are best suited to pultruded frame construction recommendations for further research and development work are given...|$|E

With the objective of reducing filtrate flow pressure losses and ensuring continuous high filtration performance, in particular by the homogeneous loading of the individual membrane channels, an integrated membrane module was developed consisting of a ceramics body which is externally s ealed, e. g. by glazing.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} are well-renown for their {{strength to weight}} ratios and are widely used in many industries where high strength and low weight is required. Although steel is the traditional material of choice in the mining industry, and particularly for conveyor support structures, the strength and weight advantages offered by composite materials has prompted this investigation into the feasibility of using composite materials in underground mining conveyor support structures. The {{first phase of the}} project centred on establishing and applying selection criteria for the materials and processes which could be used in such a structure. Key concerns include fire performance, electrical conductivity, cost, availability and manufacturability. Based on these considerations, the project identified a phenolic-glass laminate manufactured using the RTM method (for moulded components) or the pultrusion process (for tube sections) as a possible basis for a composite conveyor support structure. The second phase of the project developed a set of design criteria for the use of composite materials in conveyor support structures and a series of preliminary designs based on current conveyor configurations. After analysing each preliminary design against key design criteria, in particular cost, weight, assembly time, susceptibility to damage and torsional loading, the Linestand Suspended - Beam configuration was selected as the preferred option. The third phase of the project used the findings of the preliminary design analysis and the key design criteria to develop a prototype final design. The prototype design is based on a hybrid style of frame. The majority of the structure is constructed from a custom pultruded beam connected with a composite <b>connection</b> <b>piece,</b> while the interface between the rollers and the frame utilises a steel bracket {{to reduce the risk of}} damage to the composite frame.

In this chapter, we consider a methodology to find such bisociations using a BisoNet as a representation of knowledge.

To achieve this, we introduce a procedure to link nodes of a BisoNet and to endow such links with weights, which is based on a new measure for comparing text frequency vectors. In a second step, we try to rediscover known bisociations, which were originally found by a human domain expert, namely indirect relations between migraine and magnesium as they are hidden in medical research articles published before 1987. We observe that these bisociations are easily rediscovered by simply following the strongest links. ...|$|R

IMO´s attempts to enforce the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) are pushing ship operators to develop energy saving devices. These devices are meant to fulfil the requirements imposed by rules and regulations to avoid possible legislative consequences to ship operators. In addition, those devices become very attractive when their installation reduces the fuel consumption. Due {{to the lack of}} rules and guidelines on the matter of fin structural assessment, a practical process is proposed to perform a Pre-swirl stator attachment design. Hence, the overall target of this thesis is to state a sequence of steps to develop and improve the design of the Pre-swirl stators attachment. This report seeks to describe a framework methodology that can be applied to any ship and its usability is applied to a case study. By means of a project planning steps it was possible to identify the factors involved {{in the design of the}} fin attachment. The process was applied at the very beginning of the project design phase to understand the fin connection context. This method was used first to state the problem definition. Then, project goals and requirements were formulated. With those in mind, several alternatives were studied. The alternatives were considered or dismissed based on selected evaluation criteria that brought a set of optimal solutions. Finally, with a compromise between all the possible solutions, the most convenient option was selected. Design rules for a similar structure such as rudder were used to create the design process for the fin attachment. Notice that the design process proposed in this thesis considers certain aspects that are not considered in new build ships. Performance time and harmless manufacturing procedures (for the surrounding systems) are examples of factors that are included in this process and are not stated on similar design methodologies. The process outlines all substantial factors concerning reliability, performance, quality and manufacturing time of the fin connection. In order to satisfy these aspects, the ultimate strength and fatigue of the <b>connection</b> <b>piece</b> needs to be assessed. In addition, immense attention is focused on the welding technique as this determines the time and cost of the fin installation procedure. Furthermore, the welding affects the reliability and performance in terms of joint connection strength and potential shaft misalignment due to excess heat induced in the area. The main factors affecting the attachment design are evaluated using several design alternatives to better understand how the different factors affect the overall outcome...|$|R
