A 3 -DOF attitude measuring method using linear variable differential transformers (LVDT) is designed to adjust the relation of position and attitude between the spherical mirror and the resonator. A micro vision feedback system is set up to extract the light beam and the diaphragm, which can achieve the coarse positioning of the spherical mirror in the optical assembly process.

40|$|Recently, phase shifted control (PSC) {{and pulse}} density {{modulation}} control (PDM) have evolved {{as the most}} versatile schemes to control and regulate the output power for inverter based Induction Heating Systems.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{elaborate}} and to investigate the automatic control system of pressure in front of evaporators of the multifunctional heat pump, which has several condensers and several evaporators. The control system must reduce the value of pressure perturbations acting on evaporators and decrease the value of pressure pulsations before them. To solve this problem, a hydraulic scheme has been developed in which this parameter is stabilized by using fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>adjustment</b> valves in hydraulic circuits of condensers and compressors using a pressure control system for a static flow mixer. The system {{for control of the}} flow of the refrigerant consists of two groups of compressors with automatic control drives installed in the lines of each of the condensers. The pressure control system uses a model of control valve with proportional-integral – derivative (PID) controller in the direct line of the controller loop. This solution allowed simplifying the heat pump control system by eliminating the necessity of matching the pressure and flow control valves in each line and controlling the flow in the line over a wider range as well. A mathematical model of the static mixer of flows installed after the pressure control valves is obtained. The proposed pressure control system gives a possibility to reduce the amplitude of pulsations of pressure before the evaporators up to 14 - 16 times...|$|E
40|$|The {{main part}} of the work {{presented}} in this thesis deals with the extension of tunnelling microscopy to the temperature interval below one kelvin. Several microscopes have been designed and manufactured, one for ultra high vacuum at room temperature and two for sub-kelvin cooling. The latest millikelvin instrument is arranged for immersion into the coolant to secure the best possible heat transfer from substrate and probe. A mechanical <b>coarse</b> <b>adjustment</b> arrangement manoeuvrable from outside the cryostat was constructed to circumvent the difficulties associated with refrigerated step-by-step mechanisms that have been experienced by other designers. A dilution refrigerator insert for an older cryostat was designed with special care to ensure mechanical stability and the easiest possible maintenance. The mixing chamber, where the actual cooling takes place, was designed to accommodate the immersion microscope. To minimise the vibration level at the instrument site the entire cryostat was mounted on a pneumatic suspension system; the calculations for this arrangement is given in an appendix. To isolate the cryostat from vibrations travelling along the pumping lines, a new type of bellows based flexible link was designed. This component, the "saddle tube compensator " is described together with the necessary formulae. In addition to instrument characterisation measurements, two specific problems are studied. First the problem of mapping penetrating magnetic flux through technical type II superconductors were studied. The surface contamination problem was partially overcome by applying a thin protective gold overlayer immediately after the surface was cleaned. It proved possible to monitor proximity induced superconductivity through this top layer. Results not forming a regular lattice but with a clear field dependence are presented from a lead bismuth alloy film sample. In another experiment one example of a mesoscopic phenomenon is studied, the conductance variations in a small section of a semi-metal thin film due to fluctuations in scattering centra. It is shown that such centra can be affected in a predictable way by scanning the microscope probe above the surface. A special, self aligning technique was developed to fabricate a mesoscopic object at the accessible part of the sample...|$|E
40|$|Membranes play an {{increasingly}} important role in water recycling, with the proven ability to produce high purity water from a highly contaminated source (wastewater). The effectiveness of a membrane system depends on the intactness of that system. Integrity monitoring is thus {{an important part of}} managing membrane systems. Currently used integrity monitoring techniques, while diverse, have inherent weaknesses that limit the sensitivity of detecting integrity breaches in a membrane. A fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) method was optimised in order to produce consistent and reliable measurements from fluorescent organics in RO permeate samples. A benchtop fluorescence spectrophotometer was used for this purpose and operational parameters adjusted to optimise fluorescence EEMs. Adjusting slit width settings act as a <b>coarse</b> <b>adjustment</b> for sensitivity. Further refinement in resolution and quality was achieved by adjusting scan speed, photomultiplier tube voltage and introducing signal averaging. Results indicated optimum EEM spectra could be achieved at excitation and emission monochromator slits at 10 nm, PMT voltage setting producing an intensity of Raman peak (&# 955;Ex/Em = 348 / 393 nm) in the blank at 270 ± 8 a. f. u (Typically this was between 840 - 900 V), scan speed of 9600 nm min- 1 and 3 signal averages. Treatment processes from five advanced water recycling plants in Australia were studied using fluorescence and other established water quality parameters which included dissolved organic carbon, turbidity, electrical conductivity and ultraviolet absorption (UV 254). Treatment processes scrutinised at these plants were media filtration using either sand or anthracite, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, ultraviolet disinfection and chlorine disinfection. Fluorescence intensities were reduced by anthracite filters, ultrafiltration in one plant only, and reverse osmosis. Correlations with other water quality parameters failed to show any trends; illustrating the complexity of fluorescent organics in wastewater and the difficulty in predicting its behaviour based on moderate changes to other water quality parameters. From the three membrane processes studied, it was established that reverse osmosis was the only membrane process that consistently reduced fluorescence intensities and was thus the only practically suitable membrane system for fluorescence based membrane integrity monitoring. The fluorescence region of &# 955;Ex/Em = 320 - 340 / 410 - 430 nm (Peak C) was selected as the best indicator for integrity loss after further scrutiny of results using probabilistic (Monte-Carlo simulation) analysis showed this peak was consistently rejected (> 99 %) at all operational stages of RO systems compared to other fluorescence peaks. An impaired membrane was also identified in this study using fluorescence and conductivity. A flow-rig was designed to blend reverse osmosis feedwater and permeate to simulate integrity loss. Cyclops 7 CDOM fluorescence sensor (Turner Designs) was used to measure fluorescence. Several experiments were conducted to identify the impacts of flowrate, temperature, pH, antiscalant usage and dosage, free chlorine and dechlorination on fluorescence-based detection of integrity loss. Integrity loss was simulated by blending RO feed with permeate at defined ratios. The sensor was capable of detecting approximately 0. 2 % of the RO feed depending on RO feed CDOM concentration. It was found that the sensitivity of the sensor was not affected by any of the tested variables. A 1 % RO feed intrusion in the permeate was shown to still contain very low level of fluorescence, and any changes to fluorescence intensities due to tested variables were too small to be determined. Trials were undertaken using the fluorescence-based sensor to conduct real-time, online monitoring of reverse osmosis membranes from two Australian municipal advanced water recycling plants. The sensor measured at &# 955;Ex/Em= 350 / 430 nm and was able to detect differences between permeates from staged reverse osmosis systems and responded to changes in membrane performance. The measured membrane rejections for fluorescence were below 99 %. This was because the group of chemicals measured was rejected by less than 99 % and was not a limitation of the sensor's measurement range. The results also revealed an increase in permeate fluorescence due to an underperforming membrane that was suspected to have an integrity breach. Another important observation was the opposing trend of permeate electrical conductivity and fluorescence from the underperforming membrane. Decreasing feed electrical conductivity resulted in an increase in flux when operated under constant pressure conditions. While the permeate electrical conductivity displayed the same trend as the feed electrical conductivity, the fluorescence of the RO permeate was observed to increase in response to flux increase and RO feed electrical conductivity decrease, giving an impression of improving water quality (low conductivity) while organic content (as fluorescence) increased in the permeate. This illustrated the limitations of relying solely on electrical conductivity as an online monitoring tool for RO underperformance. In the second plant a relationship between transmembrane pressure and permeate fluorescence was established in stage 1 membranes, with an observed increase in permeate fluorescence coinciding with transmembrane pressure increase. This was believed to be related to membrane fouling and flags another potential application of the fluorescence sensor for detecting the onset of membrane fouling. The overall results show fluorescence spectroscopy is sensitive to subtle changes in reverse osmosis permeate water quality and can thus effectively detect integrity loss in reverse osmosis membrane systems, specifically in regard to organic chemical substances...|$|E

In all cases, the reference frame adjustments provided by the navigator echoes substantially improved the alignment of the latter exam and performed well compared to retrospective imagebased registration.
