5|$|For many {{diseases}} of the heart, including atrial fibrillation and valvular disease, and after a heart operation, anticoagulation {{in the form of}} aspirin, warfarin, <b>clopidogrel</b> or novel oral anticoagulants is often given simultaneously, because of an increased risk of stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted heart vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Having {{experienced}} a stroke, {{a person may}} be admitted to a stroke unit, and treatments may be directed as preventing future strokes, including ongoing anticoagulation (such as aspirin or <b>clopidogrel),</b> antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering drugs. A multidisciplinary team including speech pathologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists plays {{a large role in}} supporting a person affected by a stroke and their rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as <b>clopidogrel,</b> aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as <b>clopidogrel,</b> prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, <b>clopidogrel,</b> and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
5|$|Some of a patient's single {{nucleotide}} polymorphismsslight {{differences in their}} DNAcan help predict how quickly they will metabolise particular drugs; this is called pharmacogenomics. For example, the enzyme CYP2C19 metabolises several drugs, such as the anti-clotting agent <b>Clopidogrel,</b> into their active forms. Some patients possess polymorphisms in specific places on the 2C19 gene that make poor metabolisers of those drugs; physicians can test for these polymorphisms and {{find out whether the}} drugs will be fully effective for that patient. Advances in molecular biology have helped show that some syndromes that were previously classed as a single disease are actually multiple subtypes with entirely different causes and treatments. Molecular diagnostics can help diagnose the subtypefor example of infections and cancersor the genetic analysis of a disease with an inherited component, such as Silver-Russell syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as <b>clopidogrel</b> (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E
25|$|This {{interaction}} is possible because omeprazole is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. <b>Clopidogrel</b> is an inactive prodrug that partially depends on CYP2C19 for conversion to its active form. Inhibition of CYP2C19 may block the activation of <b>clopidogrel,</b> which could reduce its effects.|$|E
25|$|Important drug {{interactions}} are rare. However, {{the most significant}} major drug interaction concern is the decreased activation of <b>clopidogrel</b> when taken together with omeprazole. Although still controversial, this may {{increase the risk of}} stroke or heart attack in people taking <b>clopidogrel</b> to prevent these events.|$|E
25|$|Codeine, <b>clopidogrel,</b> tamoxifen, and {{warfarin}} a {{few examples}} of medications that follow the above metabolic pathways.|$|E
25|$|In {{cardiovascular}} disorders, {{the main}} concern is response to drugs including warfarin, <b>clopidogrel,</b> beta blockers, and statins.|$|E
25|$|Esomeprazole is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2C19, and may therefore interact with drugs {{that depend on}} it for metabolism, such as diazepam and warfarin; the concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with esomeprazole. Conversely, <b>clopidogrel</b> (Plavix) is an inactive prodrug that partially depends on CYP2C19 for conversion to its active form; inhibition of CYP2C19 blocks the activation of <b>clopidogrel,</b> thus reducing its effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clopidogrel</b> is used {{to prevent}} {{heart attack and stroke}} in people who are at high risk of these events, {{including}} those with a history of myocardial infarction and other forms of acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and those with peripheral artery disease.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{anticoagulants}} such as warfarin {{have been}} the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several {{studies have shown that}} aspirin and antiplatelet drugs are highly effective in secondary prevention after a stroke or transient ischemic attack. Low doses of aspirin (for example 75–150mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown. Thienopyridines (<b>clopidogrel,</b> ticlopidine) might be slightly more effective than aspirin and have a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but are more expensive. <b>Clopidogrel</b> has less side effects than ticlopidine. Dipyridamole can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect. Low-dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after having a myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{interactions}} with drotrecogin {{have not been}} systematically studied in patients with severe sepsis. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs that affect hemostasis concomitantly with drotrecogin (e.g. aspirin, warfarin, <b>clopidogrel).</b> However, the use of low dose prophylactic Heparin did not affect safety when given concurrently with drotrecogin.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, nausea, easy bruising, itching, and heartburn. More severe side effects include {{bleeding}} and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. While {{there is no}} evidence of harm from use during pregnancy, such use has been poorly studied. <b>Clopidogrel</b> is in the thienopyridine-class of antiplatelet agent. It works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12, on platelets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clopidogrel</b> {{was first}} written about in 1982 and was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.77 to 31.59 USD per month. In the United States a month of treatment costs less than 25 USD.|$|E
25|$|People with presumed ACS are {{typically}} treated with aspirin, <b>clopidogrel</b> or ticagrelor, nitroglycerin, {{and if the}} chest discomfort persists morphine. Other analgesics such as nitrous oxide are of unknown benefit. Angiography is recommended in those who have either new ST elevation or a new left bundle branch block on their ECG. Unless the person has low oxygen levels additional oxygen {{does not appear to}} be useful.|$|E
25|$|Among {{patients}} with nonvalvular AF, anticoagulation with warfarin can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%. The combination of aspirin and <b>clopidogrel</b> reduced {{the risk of}} stroke by 25%, but increased the risk of major bleeding by 57%, which means that this combination is inferior to warfarin, and is not an alternative for patients who are judged to be {{at high risk of}} bleeding on warfarin therapy.|$|E
25|$|ADP on {{the other}} hand binds to purinergic receptors on {{platelet}} surface. Since the thrombocytic purinergic receptor P2Y12 is coupled to Gi proteins, ADP reduces platelet adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP production, leading to accumulation of calcium inside the platelet by inactivating the cAMP calcium efflux pump. The other ADP-receptor P2Y1 couples to Gq that activates phospholipase C-beta 2 PLCB2, resulting in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)generation and intracellular release of more calcium. This together induces platelet activation. Endothelial ADPase degrades ADP and prevents this from happening. <b>Clopidogrel</b> and related antiplatelet medications also work as purinergic receptor P2Y12 antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} {{haemostasis}} evaluating method, TEM (and thrombelastography) have limitations which {{need to be}} considered when interpreting the results. The typical assays are not responsive for the effect of von Willebrand factor or platelet antagonists such as aspirin or thienopyridines (e.g. <b>clopidogrel),</b> and only supratherapeutic doses of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists may influence results. The sensitivity for coagulation factor deficiencies, including those induced by oral anticoagulation, is less pronounced as compared to clotting assays. Therefore, TEM is not meant to replace laboratory assays such as prothrombin time (PT) or factor assays. However, due to the rapid availability of differential diagnostic information, TEM has become an established method in surgical procedures where blood losses can be expected.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulants and anti-platelet {{agents are}} amongst the most {{commonly}} used medications. Anti-platelet agents include aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, <b>clopidogrel,</b> ticagrelor and prasugrel; the parenteral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are used during angioplasty. Of the anticoagulants, warfarin (and related coumarins) and heparin are {{the most commonly}} used. Warfarin affects the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and protein C and protein S, whereas heparin and related compounds increase the action of antithrombin on thrombin and factor Xa. A newer class of drugs, the direct thrombin inhibitors, is under development; some members are already in clinical use (such as lepirudin). Also under development are other small molecular compounds that interfere directly with the enzymatic action of particular coagulation factors (e.g., rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban).|$|E
25|$|Given {{the disease}} burden of strokes, {{prevention}} {{is an important}} public health concern. Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year). Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke. In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended. In {{people who have had}} a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a first stroke. In those who have previously had a stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, <b>clopidogrel,</b> and dipyridamole may be beneficial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.|$|E
500|$|Aspirin use {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although some enteric-coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being [...] "gentle to the stomach", in one study, enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk. Combining aspirin with other NSAIDs has also been shown to further increase this risk. Using aspirin in combination with <b>clopidogrel</b> or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment with <b>clopidogrel</b> or {{a related}} drug is {{recommended}} by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology for people who: ...|$|E
2500|$|Current {{scope of}} practice: [...] All {{of the above}} plus [...] manual defibrillation, {{synchronised}} cardioversion, IV cannulation, IV fluid administration, IV glucose, morphine, fentanyl, naloxone, ondansetron, adrenaline (IV) for cardiac arrest, amiodarone (IV) for cardiac arrest, ceftriaxone, naloxone, midazolam (IM) for seizures, oxytocin, ceftriaxone, <b>clopidogrel,</b> lignocaine (SC) for ring blocks ...|$|E
2500|$|Adjuvant therapy {{during an}} {{angioplasty}} includes intravenous heparin, aspirin, and <b>clopidogrel.</b> [...] Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors {{are often used}} {{in the setting of}} primary angioplasty {{to reduce the risk of}} ischemic complications during the procedure. [...] Due to the number of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants used during primary angioplasty, the risk of bleeding associated with the procedure is higher than during an elective procedure.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Clopidogrel,</b> sold as the brandname Plavix among others, is a {{medication}} {{that is used}} {{to reduce the risk of}} heart disease and stroke in those at high risk. It is also used together with aspirin in heart attacks and following the placement of a coronary artery stent (dual antiplatelet therapy). It is taken by mouth. Onset of effects is about 2 hours and lasts for 5 days.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{difficulties}} with coronary stents included {{a risk of}} early thrombosis (clotting) resulting in occlusion of the stent. Coating stainless steel stents with other substances such as platinum or gold did not eliminate this problem. [...] High-pressure balloon expansion of the stent to ensure its full apposition to the arterial wall, combined with drug therapy using aspirin and another inhibitor of platelet aggregation (usually ticlopidine or <b>clopidogrel)</b> nearly eliminated this risk of early stent thrombosis.|$|E
2500|$|If the ECG {{does not}} show typical changes, the term [...] "non-ST segment {{elevation}} ACS" [...] is applied. The patient may still have suffered a [...] "non-ST elevation MI" [...] (NSTEMI). The accepted management of unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome is therefore empirical treatment with aspirin, a second platelet inhibitor such as <b>clopidogrel,</b> prasugrel or ticagrelor, and heparin (usually a low-molecular weight heparin), with intravenous glyceryl trinitrate and opioids if the pain persists. The heparin-like drug known as fondaparinux appears {{to be better than}} enoxaparin.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, {{case reports}} started being {{published}} regarding late stent thrombosis. [...] At the 2006 {{annual meeting of}} the American College of Cardiology, preliminary results of the BASKET-LATE trial were presented, which showed a slight increase in late thrombosis associated with drug eluting stents over bare metal stents. [...] However, this increase was not statistically significant, and further data would have to be collected. [...] Further data published over the following year had conflicting results, and it was unclear whether stent thrombosis was truly higher when compared to bare metal stents. [...] During this time of uncertainty, many cardiologists started extending the dual antiplatelet regimen of aspirin and <b>clopidogrel</b> in these individuals, as some data suggested that it may prevent late thrombosis.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the results}} of the first trials of {{drug-eluting}} stents were published, there was a general feeling in the interventional cardiology community that these devices would be part of the perfect revascularization regimen for coronary artery disease. [...] With the very low restenosis rates of the RAVEL and SIRIUS trials, interventions were performed on more complex blockages in the coronary arteries, under the assumption that the results in real life would mimic the results in the trials. [...] The antiplatelet regimens that were advised for the drug eluting stents were based on the early trials of these stents. [...] Based on these trials, the antiplatelet regimen was a combination of aspirin and <b>clopidogrel</b> for 3 months when Cypher stents were used, and 9 months when Taxus stents were used, followed by aspirin indefinitely.|$|E
2500|$|Platelet {{transfusion}} is {{most frequently}} used to correct unusually low platelet counts, either to prevent spontaneous bleeding (typically at counts below (10×109/L) or in anticipation of medical procedures that will necessarily involve some bleeding. For example, in patients undergoing surgery, a level below 50×109/L is associated with abnormal surgical bleeding, and regional anaesthetic procedures such as epidurals are avoided for levels below 80×109/L. [...] Platelets may also be transfused when the platelet count is normal but the platelets are dysfunctional, such as when an individual is taking aspirin or <b>clopidogrel.</b> [...] Finally, platelets may be transfused {{as part of a}} massive transfusion protocol, in which the three major blood components (red blood cells, plasma, and platelets) are transfused to address severe hemorrhage. [...] Platelet transfusion is contraindicated in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), as it fuels the coagulopathy.|$|E
2500|$|Though less {{frequent}} with drug-eluting stents, neointimal proliferation can still occur in DES and cause restenosis. Stent occlusion because of thrombosis may occur during the procedure, {{in the following}} days, or later. [...] The presence of thrombi around the stent may, in turn, affect the drug-eluting performance of the stent. [...] Treatment with the antiplatelet drugs aspirin and <b>clopidogrel</b> {{appears to be the}} most important factor reducing this risk of thrombosis, and early cessation of one or both of these drugs after drug-eluting stenting markedly increases the risk of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. A recent histopathology study showed very late DES thrombosis is associated with histopathological signs of inflammation and intravascular ultrasound evidence of vessel remodeling. Compared with other causes of myocardial infarction, eosinophilic infiltrates are more common in thrombi harvested from very late DES thrombosis and correlate with the extent of stent malapposition.|$|E
2500|$|The FDA held {{an expert}} panel in December 2006 {{to go over}} the data {{presented}} by Cordis and Boston Scientific to determine if drug eluting stents should be considered less safe than bare metal stents. [...] It became evident at the meeting that with all the data published there were varied definitions of late thrombosis and key differences in the types of lesions in different studies, hampering analysis of the data. [...] It was also noted that with the advent of drug eluting stents, interventional cardiologists began performing procedures on more complex lesions, subsequently using the drug eluting stents in [...] "off label" [...] coronary artery lesions, which would otherwise go untreated or for bypass surgery. [...] The FDA advisory board reiterated the ACC guidelines that <b>clopidogrel</b> should be continued for 12 months after drug eluting stent placement in individuals who are at low risk for bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|Ketorolac can {{interact}} with other medications. Probenecid can increase the probability of having an adverse reaction or experiencing a side effect when taken with ketorolac. Pentoxifylline can {{increase the risk of}} bleeding. When aspirin is taken {{at the same time as}} ketorolac, the effectiveness is decreased. Problematic GI effects are additive and become more likely if potassium supplements, aspirin, other NSAIDS, corticosteroids, or alcohol is taken at the same time. The effectiveness of antihypertensives and diuretics can be lowered. [...] The use of ketorolac can increase serum lithium levels to the point of toxicity. Toxicity to methotrexate is more likely if ketorolac is taken at the same time. The risk of bleeding increases with the concurrent medications <b>clopidogrel,</b> cefoperazone, valproic acid, cefotetan, eptifibatide, tirofiban, and copidine. Anticoagulants and thrombolytic medications also increase the likelihood of bleeding. Medications used to treat cancer {{can interact}} with ketorolac along with radiation therapy. The risk of toxicity to the kidneys increases when ketorolac is taken with cyclosporine.|$|E
