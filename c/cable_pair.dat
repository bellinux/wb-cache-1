5000|$|Bridged tap or {{bridge tap}} is a long-used method of cabling for {{telephone}} lines. One <b>cable</b> <b>pair</b> (of wires) will [...] "appear" [...] {{in several different}} terminal locations (poles or pedestals). This allows the telephone company to use or [...] "assign" [...] that pair to any subscriber near those terminal locations. Once that customer disconnects, that pair becomes usable {{at any of the}} terminals. In the days of party lines, 2, 4, 6, or 8 users were commonly connected on the same pair which appeared at several different locations.|$|E
5000|$|Digital {{subscriber}} lines (DSL) can {{be affected}} by a bridged tap, depending on where the tap is bridged. DSL signals reflect from the discontinuities, sending the signal back through the <b>cable</b> <b>pair,</b> much like a tennis ball against a brick wall. The echoed signal is now out of phase and mixed with the original, creating, among other impairments, attenuation distortion. The modem receives both signals, gets confused and [...] "takes errors" [...] or cannot sync. If the bridged tap is long, the signal bounces back only in very attenuated form. Therefore, the modem will ignore the weaker signal and show no problem.|$|E
50|$|Early DSL service {{required}} a dedicated dry loop, {{but when the}} U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required ILECs to lease their lines to competing DSL service providers, shared-line DSL became available. Also known as DSL over Unbundled Network Element, this unbundling of services allows a single subscriber to receive two separate services from two separate providers on one <b>cable</b> <b>pair.</b> The DSL service provider's equipment is co-located in the same central office (telephone exchange) {{as that of the}} ILEC supplying the customer's pre-existing voice service. The subscriber's circuit is rewired to interface with hardware supplied by the ILEC which combines a DSL frequency and POTS signals on a single copper pair facility.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} solve these {{problems}} FPD-Link which uses low-voltage differential signaling, or LVDS, were adopted into LCDs. LVDS, defined by the ANSI/TIA/EIA-644-A standard, is a differential signaling system that can run at high speed. LVDS works in serial data transmission. As the main applications had 18 bits color depth in early adoption of FPD-Link, a 7-bit wide differential <b>cable</b> <b>pair</b> for each of 3 channels with another channel for clock became used. By this adoption of FPD-Link, internal interface systems of LCDs could reduce the 22 pair cables into 8 pairs with high-speed serial transmission. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) adopted this as a video standard specification and FPD-Link has penetrated wider as LCD interface.|$|E
50|$|To {{transport}} 1 Gbit {{of traffic}} full duplex (1 Gbit {{in each direction}} simultaneously) a very complex signal is used to reach the desired performance and quality. In case of Gbit Ethernet the signal is called PAM 5 modulation, meaning that each <b>cable</b> <b>pair</b> transports 5 bits simultaneously in both directions. The PHY chips {{at each end of}} the cable have a very complex task at hand, because they must separate the two signals from each other. This is only possible because they know their own signal, so they can deduct their own send signals from the mixed signals on the line and then interpret the information sent by their link partners.|$|E

A larger analog pair gain system made by Anaconda in the 1960s provided seven lines. Some pair gain units can expand the number of subscriber lines available over a single copper pair {{to as many as}} sixty. Large pair gain units are stored in serving area interfaces or metal cabinets typically resembling small apartment-sized refrigerators alongside or near roadways that overlie communications rights-of-way.|$|E

40|$|The {{local cable}} network (cable plant) {{is a part}} of public {{switched}} telephone network (PSTN) which connects local telephone exchanges with customerâ€™s premises equipment (CPE). It is built up of multipair twisted <b>cables.</b> <b>Cable</b> <b>pairs</b> are twisted to avoid mutual influence (crosstalks) among the <b>pairs.</b> <b>Cable</b> construction is developed for transmission of voice frequencies and it remains almost the same for some decades. This cable plant works well for telephone transmission even if all <b>cable</b> <b>pairs</b> are active. In the eightees ISDN technology appeared which transmitted signals up to 60 kHz and soon it became clear that only 70 % to 80 % of <b>cable</b> <b>pairs</b> met technical requirements for this technology.

40|$|Personnel {{living in}} a space {{environment}} as well as technicians and engineers preparing spacecraft for launch can potentially be exposed to small amounts of hazardous gases. It is therefore important {{to be able to}} detect, identify and quantify the presence of a gas especially when its presence could lead to a fatal situation. The use of small and sensitive sensors can allow for the placement of these devices over a large area, thus allowing for a more precise and timely determination of a gas leak. ASRC Aerospace and its research partners are developing nano sensors for detection of various gases, including but not limited to: H 2, NH 3, N 2 O 4, hydrazine and others. Initial laboratory testing has demonstrated the capability to detect the gases in concentrations lower than parts per million. Testing and development is continuing to improve the response and recovery times, to increase the sensitivity of the devices. Different coatings and electrodes are currently being evaluated to determine the optimum configuration of a variety of gases. The small footprint of the Nano sensors allows for several devices, each responsive in a different way to different gases, to be placed into a single substrate. Multiple devices embedded into a single substrate results in increased reliability and in a decrease for periodic calibrations. The use of different coatings will result in a small electronic nose capable of distinguishing between different gases. A multi-channel signal conditioner amplifier built on a small multi chip module is used to process the output of the sensors and to deliver a signal that can be remotely monitored. All the data is digitized and transmitted over the same <b>cable</b> <b>pair</b> used to power the amplifier. Multiple outputs can be connected to a single <b>cable</b> <b>pair</b> in order to minimize the added weight and expense associated with cabling in a spacecraft.

Motivated by the inherent shortcomings of the common single-body section models, the paper presents a flexible multi-body model able to describe â€“ in the cross-section plane â€“ the linear and nonlinear terms of geometric coupling between a principal body, whose rigid roto-translations simulate the global components of the bridge deck motion, and two secondary bodies, with small point masses, whose displacements simulate the transversal component which dominates the local motion of a <b>cable</b> <b>pair.</b> Different aspects of the multi-body model dynamics are investigated, by means of perturbation techniques. First, a multi-parametric sensitivity analysis of the linear modal properties is performed, with particular regard to internal (1 : 1) resonance conditions which may give rise to multiple veering phenomena between two or more frequencies, associated to a complete hybridization process of the corresponding global and local modes. Second, the nonlinear mechanisms which determine high-amplitude low-frequency oscillations in the cable local motion are analyzed, with focus on the autoparametric excitation given by the low-amplitude high-frequency global vibrations if sub-harmonic (2 : 1) resonance conditions occur between a global and a local mode. Third, the aeroelastic stability of the dynamic system when a stationary wind flow acts on the doubly-symmetric cross-section of the principal body is studied, especially in respect to the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of internal resonance conditions on the critical wind velocity which may cause the onset of torsional galloping phenomena...|$|E

Future {{astrophysics}} and {{cosmic microwave}} background space missions operating in the far-infrared to millimetre part of the spectrum will require very large arrays of ultra-sensitive detectors in combination with high multiplexing factors and efficient low-noise and low-power readout systems. We have developed a demonstrator system suitable for such applications. Methods. The system combines a 961 pixel imaging array based upon Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) with a readout system capable of reading out all pixels simultaneously with only one readout <b>cable</b> <b>pair</b> and a single cryogenic amplifier. We evaluate, in a representative environment, the system performance in terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, optical efficiency, cosmic ray rejection, pixel-pixel crosstalk and overall yield at an observation centre frequency of 850 GHz and 20 % fractional bandwidth. Results. The overall system has an excellent sensitivity, with an average detector sensitivity measured using a thermal calibration source. At a loading power per pixel of 50 fW we demonstrate white, photon noise limited detector noise down to 300 mHz. The dynamic range would allow the detection of ~ 1 Jy bright sources {{within the field of}} view without tuning the readout of the detectors. The expected dead time due to cosmic ray interactions, when operated in an L 2 or a similar far-Earth orbit, is found to be < 4 %.
