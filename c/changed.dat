40|$|From Integrative Summary: This {{research}} paper comprises {{of three sections}} that include: an evaluation report, a literature review and the research methodology. The first section assesses the management of resistance to <b>change</b> as encountered during the ELIDZ structural re-alignment initiative. The assessment was done after the <b>change</b> initiative had been implemented to see what could be learnt from the exercise, {{in order to be}} better prepared for future <b>change</b> programmes. The implemented <b>change</b> was initiated by the CEO of the ELIDZ but its criticality in terms of purpose, or the need for the <b>change</b> was unclear to many employees at the time of initiation. An examination of the literature on <b>change</b> management highlighted the importance of managing resistance to <b>change</b> as part of a <b>change</b> initiative, so as to ensure a successful transition. The review of the literature on management of resistance to <b>change</b> in section 2 of this paper examines the definition of management of resistance to <b>change</b> and in particular, covers key factors like <b>change</b> readiness, participation in <b>change</b> and <b>change</b> communication. These key concepts underpin effective management of resistance during <b>change.</b> The literature on management of resistance to <b>change</b> with respect to the role of <b>change</b> readiness, participation in <b>change</b> and <b>change</b> communication was used to develop a questionnaire that was used to assess the ELIDZ <b>change</b> initiative. The questionnaire was developed in a Likert Scale format with questions across the spectrum of <b>change</b> readiness, <b>change</b> participation and <b>change</b> communication. Section 3 of this paper describes how the quantitative research was provided to the population sample of employees from the ELIDZ where the questions on <b>change</b> readiness, <b>change</b> participation and <b>change</b> communication was used to assess the effectiveness of management of resistance to <b>change</b> during the ELIDZ <b>change</b> initiative. In addition section 3 provides an explanation of how the results of the research were derived. The results on <b>change</b> readiness suggest that the ELIDZ <b>change</b> initiative did not address <b>change</b> readiness adequately. There is therefore a risk of resistance to <b>change</b> that could manifest. This also indicates that <b>change</b> readiness must be planned more thoroughly in future <b>change</b> endeavours. Most of the population sampled did not feel that they participated in the <b>change</b> initiative, suggesting that the ELIDZ did not address participation in the <b>change</b> initiative adequately. Not enabling employees to actively participate in the <b>change</b> is tantamount to decreasing the potential for acceptance of <b>change</b> and increasing the risk of resistance to <b>change.</b> In order to ensure that future <b>change</b> initiatives are not met with employee resistance to <b>change,</b> the ELIDZ should plan for employee participation throughout the <b>change</b> process. The extent to which <b>change</b> communication was addressed in the ELIDZ <b>change</b> initiative was demonstrated by very poor results. The results from the population sampled suggest that the <b>change</b> was not well communicated to employees. As <b>change</b> communication is known to reduce the potential for resistance to <b>change,</b> it is imperative for the ELIDZ to plan for comprehensive communication strategies to cover the <b>change</b> process for future <b>change</b> action...|$|R

To study the relation between focused attention and aware/unaware perception of <b>change,</b> we recorded Event Related Potentials (ERPs) from subjects performing a <b>change</b> blindness task.
