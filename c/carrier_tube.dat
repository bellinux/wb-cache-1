50|$|The {{amplifier}} {{was usually}} configured as a grounded-cathode, carrier-peak amplifier using two vacuum tubes in parallel connection, {{one as a}} class B <b>carrier</b> <b>tube</b> and the other as a class B peak tube (power transistors in modern implementations). The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through + and - 90 degree phase shifting networks. Alternate configurations included a grounded-grid <b>carrier</b> <b>tube</b> and a grounded-cathode peak tube whereby the driver power was effectively passed-through the <b>carrier</b> <b>tube</b> and {{was added to the}} resulting output power, but this benefit was more appropriate for the earlier and less efficient triode implementations rather than the later and more efficient tetrode implementations.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{classical}} Doherty amplifier (a Class B [...] "carrier" [...] tube and a Class C [...] "peak" [...] tube), 50,000 watts {{could be achieved}} using only two 6697s, but the drive requirement was about 5,000 watts, so the driver was often a complete 5,000-watt transmitter. The driver power could be [...] "passed through" [...] (i.e., was not dissipated as heat) if the <b>carrier</b> <b>tube</b> was operated with a grounded grid and, as before, the peak tube was operated with a grounded cathode.|$|E
50|$|Sainton's 317C series {{consisted}} of a class C <b>carrier</b> <b>tube</b> in parallel connection with a class C peak tube. The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through + and − 90-degree phase-shifting networks as in a Doherty amplifier. The unmodulated radio frequency carrier {{was applied to the}} control grids of both tubes. Carrier modulation was applied to the screen grids of both tubes but the screen grid bias points of the carrier and peak tubes were different and were established such that the peak tube was cut off when modulation was absent and the amplifier was producing rated unmodulated carrier power and both tubes were conducting and each tube was contributing twice the rated carrier power during 100% modulation as four times the rated carrier power is required to achieve 100% modulation. As both tubes were operated in class C, a significant improvement in efficiency was thereby achieved in the final stage. In addition, as the tetrode carrier and peak tubes required very little drive power, a significant improvement in efficiency within the driver was achieved as well. The commercial version of the Sainton amplifier employed a cathode-follower modulator, not the push-pull modulator disclosed in the patent, and the entire 50,000-watt transmitter was implemented using only nine total tubes of four tube types, all of these being general-purpose, a remarkable achievement, given that the 317C's most significant competitor, RCA's BTA-50H, was implemented using thirty-two total tubes of nine tube types, nearly one-half of these being special-purpose, employed only in the BTA-50H. Over 200 CE 317C transmitters were installed in North America alone, easily outdistancing all competitors combined.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients with {{invasive}} bladder cancer {{often need}} radical cystectomy with its implications on {{quality of life}}. Bladder preservation combining surgery and radiotherapy could maintain quality of life without compromising tumor control. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-eight selected patients with different stages of invasive bladder cancer were treated with preoperative external beam radiotherapy in a dosage depending on the tumor stage. Subsequently they underwent surgical exploration with or without partial cystectomy and insertion of source <b>carrier</b> <b>tubes</b> for afterloading with iridium- 192. A close follow-up consisted of 3 -monthly urine cytology, cystoscopy and yearly CT scan. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (57 %) are alive with no evidence of disease. Five patients (18 %) have died of non-cancer-related causes without evidence of recurrent tumor. Tumor progression was seen in 7 patients (25 %). CONCLUSIONS: Interstitial radiation can result in long-term complete remission in patients with small solitary invasive bladder tumors. The afterloading technique is safe and effective. The selection of patients is the most relevant key to success. status: publishe...|$|R

It is felt that frequent changing of cotton wicks {{can be avoided}} by developing metallic wicks using powder metallurgy techniques. Conventional stove cannot accommodate these metallic wicks. To accommodate them the wick carrier is slightly modified. Existing lifting mechanism in stove is modified {{for the sake of}} simplicity. The wick <b>carrier</b> <b>tubes</b> are slightly enlarged and shortened. According to literature survey much work is not carried out in this direction. Hence the present work is taken up to study the efficiency of metallic wick stove using kerosene and compare it with conventional cotton wick stove. Fabricated Metallic wicks are fitted in the fabricated wick carrier. Further the performance characteristics using metallic wick such as fuel consumption, fuel tank temperature, flame height, capillary action are studied. The efficiency of metallic wick is compared withs conventional stove and the results are compared. An attempt has been made to explore the suitability of seed oil (bio fuel) as a fuel in substituting Kerosene. This oil has a very high viscosity and as a result, cannot flow through capillary in a lamp and hence, requires viscosity reduction by a transesterification process to convert it into biodiesel. Hence, the project work is undertaken to develop metallic wick stove similar that of stove commercially used, fuelled by 100 % biodiesel for its heating and its comparative performance with respect to a standard kerosene lamp...|$|R

40|$|For {{understanding}} {{the effect of}} powder feeding fluctuation on coating structure, in-flight particles were investigated by means of image analyzing. Particle behavior was estimated through numerical calculation {{on the base of}} force equilibrium. High definition videos were captured focusing on the in-flight particle stream and transparent <b>carrier</b> <b>tube.</b> Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) coating was prepared with vacuum plasma spraying for clarifying the effect of powder feeding instability on coating structure. Optic micro-morphology of coating was obtained for porosity ratio estimation. An imaginary ring of bent tube was proposed for understanding particle behavior when unavoidable bends exist. Results indicate that periodic fluctuations exist in in-flight particle trajectory and in powder feeding. A transition region was found for particles with different diameters in regions between 0 ° and 180 ° within which particles with large sizes are difficult to transport. As a consequence, accumulation of powder was thus found both on upslope and downslope. The effective cross-section of the <b>carrier</b> <b>tube</b> for powder carrying was found reduced. According to the calculation, reducing equivalent diameter and increasing carrier gas flowrate have the same effect on powder carrying. A threshold was proposed to understand the slug behavior as: growing, maturity and breaking. Due to the break of slug, ‘powder flooding’ happens and may cause mutation in in-flight particle stream. Obvious increase was found in injected particle quality to induce the threelayer structure of coating. An empirical equation was proposed to describe slug behavior as a synthesis of growth rate and loss rate...|$|E

Sophisticated epitaxy techniques with precisely controlled growth conditions {{are often used}} to prepare high quality III-V nanowires. The growth process and cost of these experiments are therefore dedicated and very high. Here, we report a simple but generic method to synthesize III-V nanowires with high crystal quality. The technique employs a closed evacuated tube vessel with a small <b>tube</b> <b>carrier</b> containing a solid source of materials and another small <b>tube</b> <b>carrier</b> containing a growth substrate inside. The growth of nanowires is achieved after heating the closed vessel in a furnace to a preset high temperature and then cooling it down naturally to room temperature.

The as-grown nanowires are analyzed by SEM, TEM and Raman spectroscopy and {{the results show that}} the nanowires are high quality zincblende single crystals.

Intergroup comparative analyses were carried out, the BRCA 1 gene carriers subgroup was subjected to detailed analysis, and ROC curves were determined {{for the assessment of}} diagnostic usefulness of HE 4 in ovarian and endometrial cancer. Results. Statistically lower serum HE 4 and CA 125 levels were observed in BRCA 1 gene mutation premenopausal <b>carriers.</b> Occult ovarian/fallopian <b>tube</b> cancer was found 3. 6 %. Each of those patients was characterized by slightly elevated levels of either CA 125 (63. 9 and 39. 4 U/mL) or HE 4 (79 [*]pmol/L). The ROC-AUC curves were 0. 892 and 0. 894 for diagnostic usefulness of ovarian cancer and 0. 865 for differentiation of endometrial cancer from endometrial polyps. Conclusions. Patients with BRCA 1 gene mutations have relatively low serum HE 4 levels. Even the slightest elevation in HE 4 or CA 125 levels in female BRCA 1 carriers undergoing prophylactic surgery should significantly increase oncological alertness.

40|$|Abstract. Power {{transformer}} on-line monitoring on {{dissolved gas}} in oil {{is one of}} the effective and technical means to achieve the transformer state detection and fault diagnosis, and oil-gas permeability {{is one of the}} core technologies to implement transformer on-line monitoring. The traditional methods of oil-gas separation such as vacuum method and mechanical oscillation method were unable to satisfy the requirements of transformer on-line monitoring; and the methods which were used commonly in recent years, like dynamic headspace separation, corrugated <b>tube,</b> <b>carrier</b> gas elution etc, have a high rate of gas-separation and have already been used in some on-line monitoring products. However, the problems still exist: easy formation of oil pollution, so the oil can not be recycled and the device structure is relatively complex. This paper based on the separation principle of polymer membrane, proposes mixed hollow fiber membrane made by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyhexafluoropropylene (PHFP), and designs an oil-gas separation test platform formed by the storage tank, oil-gas permeability tank, temperature controller and gas chromatographic analyzer etc, does laboratory research on the oil-gas permeability of the mixed hollow fiber membrane at different temperatures. The results show that, the permeability of the mixed hollow fiber membrane is obviously better than the commonly used single fluoride film or rubber film, seven fault gases H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 H 6, C 2 H 4, and C 2 H 2 can be separated efficiently form transformer oil within 24 hours. More to the point, the equilibrium time is short, the gas permeability is high and the test platform structure is simple, all of these advantages provide a strong guarantee for the development of on-line monitoring technology on dissolved gas in transformer oil...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} Coulomb blockade phenomena and single-electron charging effects in two nanoscale structures: Long semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and gold nanoparticles that {{are linked to}} a CNT by an organic molecule. While gold nanoparticles naturally exhibit single-electron charging at low temperature, it is disorder that causes the formation of quantum dots in long semiconducting CNTs at low carrier density. Our instrument of choice is a lowtemperature atomic force microscope (AFM) that is sensitive to electrostatic sample forces. A theory of the interactions between single-electron charging of a quantum dot and the AFM tip and cantilever is worked out in linear response. In semiconducting CNTs we resolve single-electron charging events in the resonance frequency of the AFM cantilever. The AFM?s spatial resolution allows us to locate the quantum dots and address them individually. We extract {{the size of the}} quantum dots, their gate couplings, and exemplify how to extract their charging energy from the AFM measurements. We frequently observe interaction between neighboring quantum dots and characterize their interdot coupling. The evolution of the quantum dots in CNTs with gate voltage reflects the underlying potential energy landscape for the <b>carriers</b> on the <b>tube.</b> We observe the CNT band structure and extract quantitative information about the disorder potential. On the gold nanoparticle sample, we combine dissipation and frequency shift measurements by our AFM. In addition to the electrostatic gate couplings and the charging energy, this combination allows us to characterize the tunnel coupling between the gold nanoparticle and the CNT, which is acting as a lead. The power of the demonstrated force probe techniques lies largely in the local nature of the measurement. Sensitive, spatially resolved information on electron transport is available {{even in the absence of}} device conduction. This advantage is apparent in the single-contact geometry of the gold nanoparticles, but also demonstrated on CNTs...|$|R
