50|$|<b>Cefotiam</b> was {{launched}} as Pansporin in February 1981 by Takeda Pharmaceutical of Japan {{and has been}} available as a generic since February 1993.|$|E
50|$|In {{clinical}} use, {{high concentrations}} of <b>cefotiam</b> are observed in several tissues (kidney, heart, ear, prostate, and genital tract), {{as well as in}} fluids and secretions (bile, ascitic fluid).|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefotiam</b> is a {{parenteral}} second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It has broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. As a beta-lactam, its bactericidal activity {{results from}} the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefotiam</b> has a broad {{spectrum}} of activity and has been used to treat infections caused by a number of enteric bacteria and bacteria responsible for causing skin infections. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefotiam</b> {{inhibits}} final cross-linking {{stage of}} peptidoglycan production, thus inhibiting {{bacterial cell wall}} synthesis. It has similar or less activity against Gram-positive staphylococci and streptococci, but is resistant to some beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative bacteria. It is more active against many of the Enterobacteriaceae including Enterobacter, E. coli, Klebsiella, Salmonella and indole-positive Proteus species.|$|E
50|$|Early second {{generation}} cephalosporins {{are very similar}} in basic structure to the first generation. Loracarbef however {{does not have the}} normal dihydrothiazin ring but is a carbacephem that has a carbon atom in the ring instead of a sulfur atom making it a tetrahydropyridine ring. This chemical property gives Loracarbef better stability in plasma while retaining oral absorption characteristics and affinity for binding to PBP. The 7-phenyl-glycine makes it orally available and the chlorine at position C-3 makes it as active as Cefaclor. An important structural change in the development of {{second generation}} cephalosporins was the introduction of an α-iminomethoxy group to the C-7 side chain. This gave an increased resistance to β-lactamases due to stereochemical blocking of the beta-lactam ring. Cefuroxime was the first cephalosporin to incorporate this side chain. Another very important group in the second generation is the aminothiazole ring to the C-3 side chain. This development drastically increased binding affinity to PBP and increased antimicrobial activity. The aminothiazole ring {{can be seen in the}} structure of <b>Cefotiam.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of the {{addition}} of the bacteriostatic agent, netilmycin, to <b>cefotiam</b> treatment as prophylactic antibiotics against infection for grade III open tibial fractures. From 45 eligible cases, assigned randomly to a control group that receive only <b>cefotiam,</b> and the treatment group that receive netilmycin in addition to <b>cefotiam.</b> We observed that the clearing of infection occurred earlier in the <b>cefotiam</b> /netilmycin group. We found that 3 -day administration of cefotiam-netilmycin is superior to 3 -day administration of <b>cefotiam</b> only. It is equivalent to 5 -day treatment with <b>cefotiam</b> alone...|$|E
40|$|Imipenem-induced {{autolysis}} and {{the activity}} of imipenem plus <b>cefotiam</b> were studied in 16 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The degree of imipenem-induced autolysis {{and the rate of}} synergistic action of imipenem plus <b>cefotiam</b> varied among strains and did not correlate with susceptibility to either imipenem or <b>cefotiam.</b> However, the degree of autolysis correlated well with susceptibility to the synergistic action of imipenem plus <b>cefotiam.</b> In methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains, both imipenem-induced autolysis and the synergistic activity of the combined drugs were less than those observed in MRSA strains. Differences in the degree of autolysis were not due to differences in autolytic enzyme production. The autolysis of imipenem-pretreated MRSA was enhanced further by <b>cefotiam,</b> while treatment of cells in the reverse order did not enhance autolysis. These findings indicate that cell wall impairment in MRSA is caused by exposure to imipenem but not to <b>cefotiam</b> and that this difference in drug actions results in synergism between imipenem and <b>cefotiam.</b> The possible participation of penicillin-binding proteins PBP 2 ' and PBP 4 in the observed effect is discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefotiam</b> hexetil is a pro-drug of <b>cefotiam</b> {{available}} for oral administration. To evaluate <b>cefotiam</b> concentrations at the active site in skin and soft-tissue infections, drug levels in skin suction blister fluid (SBF), cantharides blister fluid (CBF) and serum were determined. Six healthy subjects received oral <b>cefotiam</b> 400 mg as <b>cefotiam</b> hexetil. On an other day 200 mg was injected intravenously. Following the oral dose, the bioavailability of <b>cefotiam</b> was 45. 5 %, and the maximum concentration in serum of 2. 6 mg. l- 1 was obtained at 2. 1 h. Peak concentrations in {{both types of}} blister fluid (0. 9 mg. l- 1) were significantly lower than after the iv dose (SBF 1. 4 mg. l- 1, CBF 1. 5 mg. l- 1), and the peak levels occurred later (3. 3 versus 1. 5 h in CBF). Despite the delay, the extent of penetration was about 100 % following either mode of administration (SBF, iv dose 112 %, oral dose 117 %). The <b>cefotiam</b> level in skin blister fluids declined significantly more slowly than the serum level. Following the oral dose, the mean terminal half life was serum 0. 8 h, SBF 2. 6 h and CBF 4. 6 h. <b>Cefotiam</b> concentrations in the blister fluids were close to the MIC 90 of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis and H. influenzae and exceeded the MIC 90 of Streptococci, E. coli and Proteus mirabilis. Thus, the oral administration of <b>cefotiam</b> 400 mg t. i. d. should be curative {{in the majority of}} bacterial infections of the skin and soft-tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} effect of <b>cefotiam</b> on experimental urinary tract infections with Proteus mirabilis IFO 3849 in mice was {{compared with that}} of cefazolin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of <b>cefotiam</b> and cefazolin against the test organism were 1. 56 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Beginning 3 days after infection, various doses of each cephalosporin were given subcutaneously twice a day for 5 days. Doses of 100 mg of <b>cefotiam</b> per kg or more sterilized the urine within 3 days and effected a marked reduction or complete eradication of bacteria in the bladder walls and kidneys of mice sacrificed the day after treatment was terminated. A dose of cefazolin greater than 800 mg/kg was required for equivalent therapeutic results. Clearance of bacteria from urinary tract organs was as rapid or more rapid with 50 -mg/kg doses of <b>cefotiam</b> as with 200 -mg/kg doses of cefazolin. Much more rapid clearance was attained with 200 -mg/kg doses of <b>cefotiam.</b> The concentrations of <b>cefotiam</b> attained in plasma, kidney, and urine were lower than the cefazolin levels achieved at an equivalent dose. The superiority of <b>cefotiam</b> over cefazolin in treatment of experimental urinary tract infections appears to be due to its greater activity against the test organism...|$|E
40|$|The efficacies {{of several}} dosage schedules, {{productive}} of plasma levels of <b>cefotiam</b> and cefazolin of {{short and long}} duration and starting at three levels of <b>cefotiam</b> and cefazolin of short and long duration and starting at three different times (3, 18, and 30 h) after infection, were examined in experimental pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae DT-S in mice. With each of the multiday regimens {{there was a large}} segment of the day when plasma levels fell below assayable concentrations. In all cases, <b>cefotiam</b> proved about eight times as active as cefazolin, indicating that the potent in vitro antibacterial activity of <b>cefotiam</b> was well reflected in the therapeutic effect in this model infection. As judged by the total dose administered, the regimen of <b>cefotiam</b> producing a low but sustained plasma level gave better therapeutic effects than that exhibiting a high but transient plasma level. The <b>cefotiam</b> levels in the plasma of mice that received the regimen effective when initiated at 18 h after infection were less than the expected levels in humans after intravenous infusion of the usual clinical dose...|$|E
40|$|The {{in-vitro}} {{activities of}} cefmetazole, flomoxef, imipenem, vancomycin and enra-mycin alone and {{in combination with}} <b>cefotiam</b> against eighteen clinically isolated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. <b>Cefotiam,</b> cefmetazole, flomoxef and imipenem inhibited the growth of clinical isolates at concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>cefotiam,</b> a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, was {{compared with that}} of cefazolin by the agar dilution method against 289 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of <b>cefotiam</b> for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were about ten times lower than those of cefazolin. Moreover, <b>cefotiam</b> had a potent activity against indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes and Citrobacter spp., which had low susceptibility to cefazolin. In contrast, the effect of <b>cefotiam</b> on the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in cell free enzyme system from E. coli K 12 was almost identical with that of cefazolin. The possible mechanisms of the discrepancy between the antibacterial activity and the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis were discussed...|$|E
40|$|After {{intravenous}} bolus {{injections of}} 0. 5, 1, and 2 g of <b>cefotiam</b> to three healthy volunteers, the mean (+/- standard deviation) total plasma clearances measured for each dose were, respectively, 26. 8 +/- 2. 7, 22. 8 +/- 0. 8, and 17. 8 +/- 0. 9 liters/h; the terminal elimination half-lives were 54. 0 +/- 0. 1, 68 +/- 15, and 98 +/- 36 min; and the renal clearances were 16. 0 +/- 2. 9, 13. 3 +/- 1. 4, and 11. 3 +/- 2. 6 liters/h. The 24 -h urinary recovery was {{independent of the}} dose and averaged 53 % of the dose. After intramuscular administration of 1 g of <b>cefotiam</b> to three healthy volunteers, a mean (+/- standard deviation) peak concentration of 16. 6 +/- 5. 1 micrograms/ml was reached at 0. 75 to 1 h post dosing. The concurrent intramuscular administration of lidocaine and <b>cefotiam</b> did not modify the kinetics of <b>cefotiam.</b> During a constant-rate infusion, the steady-state plasma clearance decreased slightly when the infusion rate was increased. There was no trend towards accumulation of <b>cefotiam</b> in plasma during chronic treatment with 1 g intravenously every 12 h for 10 days...|$|E
40|$|Three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and <b>cefotiam,</b> were {{evaluated}} in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities {{were compared with}} those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. All three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against Streptococcus ssp. <b>Cefotiam</b> and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against Streptococcus aureus. Ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except Enterobacter spp. Ceftizoxime was active against all, except Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although <b>cefotiam</b> was quite active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp, and P. aeruginosa. The in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli...|$|E
40|$|Doses of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 g of <b>cefotiam</b> were infused {{intravenously}} over a 15 -min {{period in}} a crossover fashion to eight volunteers. Doses of 1. 0 and 2. 0 g were infused intravenously over periods of 30 and 60 min {{in a double}} crossover fashion to another eight volunteers. Serum concentrations fell rapidly from peak levels between 30 and 170 micrograms/ml {{at the end of}} the infusion to less than 1. 0 micrograms/ml within 6 h after all regimens. The terminal half-life in plasma varied between 0. 6 and 1. 1 h. The slopes of the time-concentration curves with the different regimens showed different half-life data. The urinary excretion of <b>cefotiam</b> was mostly completed within 4 h of the beginning of drug administration. The pharmacokinetics of <b>cefotiam</b> were dose dependent. With the 2 -g dose, the peak plasma concentrations and the values for the area under the curve were more than twice the values observed with 1 g; decreasing values of plasma clearance were observed with higher doses. Injection of <b>cefotiam</b> caused no immediate discomfort or reaction at the infusion site...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefotiam,</b> a parenteral cephalosporin, at intravenous doses of 0. 5, 1, and 2 g and intramuscular doses of 0. 5 and 1 g in {{two groups of}} eight healthy adult volunteers. The concentrations of <b>cefotiam</b> in plasma were determined {{over a period of}} 5 or 6 h and in urine over 24 h, using high-pressure liquid chromatographic procedures. Plasma concentration-time data were fitted to a three-exponential equation for the intravenous administration, and after intramuscular administration, the data were analyzed by a two-compartment or a one-compartment open model. Over the above dosing range and routes of administration, <b>cefotiam</b> pharmacokinetics were essentially linear, with plasma clearances varying from 19. 6 to 22. 5 liters/h. No significant differences were observed with respect to the terminal half-life (1 h) and the area under the curve versus the dose. Intramuscularly injected <b>cefotiam</b> was 63 to 74 % available. The fraction of dose excreted unchanged in urine (0. 50 to 0. 67) indicated a substantial nonrenal mechanism of elimination. The apparent volume of distribution (about 30 liters) was higher than those of other parenteral cephalosporins...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} ursodeoxycholate {{administration}} on the biliary excretion of the antibiotics <b>cefotiam</b> and sulbenicillin were studied in five patients with stable hepatic function receiving percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage for obstructive jaundice. <b>Cefotiam</b> (I g) and sulbenicillin (2 g) were administered intravenously {{before and after}} ursodeoxycholate administration, and the maximum concentrations of the antibiotics in the bile and total amounts excreted in the bile during the 4 h after administration were determined. After ursodeoxycholate administration, both the maximum concentration of <b>cefotiam</b> in the bile and the amount excreted increased significantly. Ursodeoxycholate also increased the peak concentration and total excretion of sulbenicillin. For both <b>cefotiam</b> and sulbenicillin, the amount of antibiotic excreted in the bile during the 4 h after administration showed a significant correlation {{with the amount of}} bile acids excreted in the bile. This strongly suggests a common mechanism for the biliary excretion of these antibiotics and bile acids. Ursodeoxycholate administration is a benign way to increase both the concentration and the total amount of antibiotic excreted in the bile. Therefore, it may be useful in the treatment of serious biliary tract infections, especially in patients receiving biliary drainage...|$|E
40|$|Four new {{beta-lactam}} antimicrobials, ceftriaxone, <b>cefotiam,</b> cefonicid, and mecillinam, {{were evaluated}} in vitro against 72 beta-lactamase-negative and 26 beta-lactamase-positive isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ceftriaxone {{was the most}} active of the antimicrobials tested. It inhibited all isolates, regardless of beta-lactamase activity, at a concentration of {{less than or equal}} to 0. 015 microgram/ml. <b>Cefotiam</b> and cefonicid were also active against both groups but not as active as ceftriaxone. Both groups of N gonorrhoeae showed a high degree of resistance against mecillinam...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{clinically}} used cephalosporins: cephalothin, cefotaxime and <b>cefotiam</b> to induce lipid peroxidation (LPO) and renal damage was {{compared to that of}} nephrotoxic cephaloridine under in vivo conditions. Glutathione was measured in rat liver or in renal cortex as non-protein sulfhydryls. LPO was measured in plasma, renal cortex and liver by the generation of malondialdehyde or as the increase in renal cortical concentration of conjugated dienes. Impairment of renal function was measured as the decrease in renal cortical accumulation of the organic anion p-aminohippurate (PAH). Administration of cephalosporins to rats as a single dose (2000 mg/kg, ip) induced a significant glutathione-depletion in the renal cortex with cephaloridine, and in the liver with cephaloridine, cephalothin and <b>cefotiam.</b> Treatment of rats with cephaloridine, cephalothin and <b>cefotiam</b> (200, 500, or 1000 mg kg- 1 day- 1, ip) for 5 days resulted in a dose-dependent increase of LPO in the renal cortex. While cephaloridine induced the highest concentration of conjugated diene, cefotaxime had no effect. Measurements of PAH accumulation in renal cortical slices from cephalosporin-treated rats showed a dose-dependent decrease in the renal cortical accumulation of PAH. Pretreatment with the antioxidants vitamin E or cyanidanol (400 mg kg- 1 day- 1, ip) 1 h before treatment with cephaloridine, cephalothin or <b>cefotiam</b> (1000 mg kg- 1 day- 1, ip) for 3 days inhibited cephalosporin-induced LPO and significantly reduced the impairment of renal cortical accumulation of PAH. The potential of different cephalosporins for inducing LPO and reducing PAH accumulation was ranked as follows: cephaloridine > cephalothin > <b>cefotiam</b> > cefotaxime...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefotiam</b> was {{evaluated}} by a comparative open-label randomized trial with cephalothin in the therapy {{of skin and}} soft tissue infections in 39 patients. The most common organism isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (78 %). We established evidence of primary infection with gram-negative bacilli in four patients, three of whom were diabetic. Eight patients had mixed infections or superinfections. No patient {{was evaluated}} as a treatment failure; for 10 of 39 patients {{we were unable to}} recover an etiological agent but demonstrated a clinical cure. <b>Cefotiam</b> was found to be as effective as cephalothin in the therapy of skin and soft tissue infections...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefotiam,</b> a new cephalosporin, was {{evaluated}} {{in the treatment}} of lower respiratory tract infections in 29 patients. The bacteria isolated from the sputum of these patients included Streptococcus pneumoniae (31 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (31 %), and Haemophilus influenzae (28 %). Satisfactory response was observed in 90 % of the patients. There were three treatment failures, two superinfections, and four colonizations with gram-negative organisms resistant to the drug. Superficial phlebitis was noted in two patients. The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>cefotiam</b> is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to susceptible organisms...|$|E
40|$|The serum {{levels of}} Cefsulodin and <b>Cefotiam,</b> new semisynthetic cepharosporines, in uremic {{patients}} were determined during blood purification. Cefsulodin {{was given in}} a single intravenous dose of 0. 5 g to uremic patients before blood purification. Serum levels were 12. 3 - 32. 3 mcg/ml after 30 minutes, 7. 2 - 17. 6 mcg/ml after 2 hours and 3. 4 - 8. 9 mcg/ml after blood purification. The half-life of Cefsulodin during hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration and hemofiltration was 3. 05 hours, 1. 37 hours and 2. 28 hours respectively. <b>Cefotiam</b> was given by the same method as Cefsulodin to uremic patients before blood purification. Serum levels were 23. 2 - 49. 7 mcg/ml after 30 minutes, 13. 4 - 20. 0 mcg/ml after 2 hours and 5. 9 - 10. 0 mcg/ml after blood purification. The half-life of <b>Cefotiam</b> during hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration and hemofiItration was 1. 85 hours and 1. 23 hours and 2. 13 hours, respectively. These two new antibiotics were well dialysed or filtrated by. blood purification...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the influence of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic regimen on the antibacterial effect in vivo, we compared three cephalosporins, <b>cefotiam,</b> cefmenoxime, and ceftriaxone, in a rabbit model of experimental Escherichia coli endocarditis after 4 days of treatment. The MBCs of <b>cefotiam,</b> cefmenoxime, and ceftriaxone for the E. coli strain were 0. 5, 0. 125, and 0. 06 microgram/ml, respectively. Killing curves at 10 times the MBC were similar for the three cephalosporins. In serum, the elimination half-life of ceftriaxone was twice as much as the elimination half-life of <b>cefotiam</b> or cefmenoxime (2. 8 +/- 0. 45 versus 1. 4 +/- 0. 25 or 1. 3 +/- 0. 4 h, respectively). Ceftriaxone was much more effective than <b>cefotiam.</b> The bacterial titer in the vegetations (log 10 CFU per gram of vegetation) was 7. 56 +/- 1 with <b>cefotiam</b> and 2. 41 +/- 2. 6 with ceftriaxone, as their concentrations were 18 and 466 times higher, respectively, than their MBCs. Although ceftriaxone and cefmenoxime exhibited a similar rate of killing and percentage of protein binding, ceftriaxone was more effective than cefmenoxime at the same regimen of 15 mg/kg twice a day (3. 08 +/- 1. 1 versus 4. 82 +/- 3. 2 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation). When antibiotic was given as a single daily injection of 30 mg/kg, the antibacterial effect persisted for ceftriaxone, but not for cefmenoxime. The longer elimination half-life and the higher local concentration/MBC ratio of ceftriaxone explained these results. The bacterial titer measured 24 h after the fourth injection of 30 mg of ceftriaxone per kg confirmed that this regimen prevented regrowth of bacteria. These results suggest that the local antibiotic level/MBC ratio roughly correlated with the antibacterial effect and could represent an adequate basis to explain the differences observed between the drugs in vivo. They also demonstrate that, provided that the dose is sufficient, a long-acting broad-spectrum cephalosporin may be effective in severe gram-negative infections, even when given at relatively long dosing intervals, in contrast with a rapidly cleared drug with the same intrinsic activity...|$|E
40|$|The electrophoretic {{mobility}} of Staphylococcus aureus 209 P treated with cefodizime or <b>cefotiam</b> was examined by microscopic electrophorcsis, {{and the production}} of oxygen-derived radicals by human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) was measured by a luminol-chemiluminescence assay. 5. aureus cells moved from the negative to the positive electrode. Treatment with more than 0 - 039 mg/L (1 / 256 MIC) cefodizime or 0 - 313 mg/L (1 / 4 MIC) <b>cefotiam</b> significantly reduced the mean mobility compared with the untreated bacterial cells. The decrease of the electrophoretic {{mobility of}} antibiotic treated bacteria indicated the decrease of the negative charge of the cell surface. Chemiluminescence of PMN when stimulated by S. aureus treated with more than 0 - 156 mg/L cefodizime (1 / 64 MIC) or 1 - 25 mg/L <b>cefotiam</b> (MIC) increased significantly compared with the untreated cell*. These results suggested that the antibiotics caused a decrease of negative charge density on the cell surface of S. aureus, followed by an increase of phagocytic activity of PMN for S. aureus. Furthermore, cefodizime showed this effect even at the low drug-concentration which did not influence the growth of the bacteria cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefotiam</b> {{were investigated}} after intravenous adminis-tration of 1 g to 2 healthy volunteers with normal renal function and to 16 patients whose creatinine clearance ranged from 4 - 7 to 01 1 /h (78 to 1 - 66 ml/min). The elimination half-life varied from 1 • 1 h in normal subjects to 13 h in patients {{and the total}} plasma clearance from 21 to 0 - 6 1 /h (350 to 10 ml/min). The urinary recovery decreased from 62 % of the dose in normal subjects to 1 - 1 % in patients, and the renal clearance from 15 to 0 - 03 1 /h (250 to 0 - 5 ml/min). Plasma and renal clearances of <b>cefotiam</b> correlated well with the creatinine clearance. The dosage schedule for <b>cefotiam</b> in patients with normal renal fiinction {{can be used in}} the presence of renal failure when the creatinine clearance is equal to or greater than 1 1 /h (16 - 6 ml/min). For patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 1 1 /h, the dose must be decreased to 75 % of that for a patient with normal renal function only when it is given every 6 or 8 h...|$|E
40|$|Antibacterial {{activity}} of FK 749 against ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates of Escherichia coli was {{compared with those}} of other newly developed cephalosporins. FK 749 was the most active against strains possessing R-plasmids specifying ampicillin resistance and those whose resistance was chromosomally determined. The susceptibility of ampicillin-susceptible E. coli to FK 749 was not decreased by transduction of ampicillin resistance-specifying plasmids. However, most of the transconjugants acquired a high level of resistance to cefoperazone and cefamandole and a moderate level of resistance to cefoperazone and cefamandole and a moderate level to <b>cefotiam.</b> FK 749 was highly stable to both penicillinase- and cephalosporinase-type beta-lactamases, including R-plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase. Its level of resistance to beta-lactamases was comparable to those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, and cefotaxime, slightly superior to that of cefuroxime, and much superior to those of <b>cefotiam,</b> cefamandole, and cefoperazone...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} {{the activity of}} rosoxacin, fosfomycin, <b>cefotiam,</b> and spectinomycin against 51 isolates of beta-lactamase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae, {{all of which were}} susceptible to each drug at sufficient concentrations. The development of strains of penicillinase producing N gonorrhoeae (PPNG) which are resistant to spectinomycin can therefore be avoided, as there are alternative drugs...|$|E
40|$|An {{adequate}} {{protocol for}} antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) in radical prostatectomy (RP) {{has not been}} established. We retrospectively compared the occurrence of perioperative infection following RP between two different AMP protocols. This study included 340 cases with prostate cancer who underwent RP at our institution between January 2005 and December 2008. The 1 -day group consisting of 93 cases received a second generation cephem, <b>cefotiam,</b> intravenously {{during and after the}} operation on the operative day. The single dose group consisting of 247 cases received <b>cefotiam</b> during the operation only. The incidence of surgical site infection (SSI）and remote infection (RI) was retrospectively investigated. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of SSI and RI occurrence between the 1 -day group (2. 2, 0 %) and single dose group (3. 6, 0. 4 %) (p= 0. 52). The single dose protocol of AMP seems sufficient for prevention of perioperative infection in RP...|$|E
40|$|TOC- 39, a new {{parenteral}} cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC- 39 {{was evaluated}} for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC- 39 had excellent activity, stronger {{than that of}} methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC {{comparable to that of}} vancomycin (the MICs of TOC- 39 and vancomycin for 90 % of the strains tested were 3. 13 and 1. 56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC- 39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC- 39 was twice as active as or more active than <b>cefotiam,</b> ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC- 39 was superior to <b>cefotiam,</b> ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC- 39 was equal to or greater than that of <b>cefotiam,</b> ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC- 39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC- 39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC- 39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC- 39 was comparable to that of vancomycin...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefotiam</b> {{were studied}} after a single intravenous 1. 0 -g dose to 18 subjects grouped {{according to their}} creatinine clearances (CLCR); CLCR was above 75, 75 to 20, and below 20 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. <b>Cefotiam</b> obeyed two-compartment model kinetics in all three groups. The volume of distribution based on the area under serum concentration-time curve (Varea) was renal function independent, the average value being 0. 350 +/- 0. 159 liters/kg. The elimination-phase half-life (t 1 / 2 beta) was 0. 916 +/- 0. 090 h in group 1, 2. 03 +/- 1. 62 h in group 2, and 7. 09 +/- 3. 06 h in group 3. Cumulative 24 -h urinary excretion accounted for 65 to 93 % of the dose in four subjects with CLCRS above 80 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 and 19 to 41 % in three subjects with CLCRS below 20 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2. We give recommendations for dosage adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency. The effect of hemodialysis on <b>cefotiam</b> pharmacokinetics was studied in six patients in end-stage renal failure; hemodialysis shortened the average t 1 / 2 beta from 8. 02 +/- 4. 04 h to 2. 74 +/- 2. 15 h. We estimated that in a hypothetical anephric patient with a body weight of 60 kg, 6 -h hemodialysis would remove 49. 7 % of the drug present in the body {{at the start of}} dialysis...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{treatment}} with clarithromycin inhibited {{the expression of}} the matrix metalloproteinase- 9, transforming growth factor β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha genes in 13762 NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Transient enhancement, rather than inhibition, was observed for the interleukin- 6 gene, and no significant change was observed for the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 2 gene. Such an effect was not observed for <b>cefotiam</b> or gentamicin...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of 10 antimicrobial agents against 159 bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobic isolates from pregnant Japanese and Thai women were determined. Clindamycin, imipenem, cefmetazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and metronidazole were highly active against all anaerobic isolates except Prevotella bivia and Mobiluncus species, which were resistant to amoxicillin and metronidazole, respectively. <b>Cefotiam,</b> ceftazidime, and ofloxacin were variably effective, while cefaclor {{was the least}} effective agent...|$|E
40|$|FK 749 {{is a new}} {{parenteral}} cephalosporin derivative {{which is}} more active against various gram-negative bacilli, including the opportunistic pathogens such as Enterobacter, Citrobacter species, and Serratia marcescens, than cephalosporins and cephamycins such as <b>cefotiam,</b> cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and cefmetazole. FK 749 was especially active against gram-negative organisms resistant to these related antibiotics. FK 749 was more potent in bactericidal activity than the other antibiotics, and the activity was clearly enhanced {{in the presence of}} 90 % defibrinated rabbit blood. The therapeutic effect of subcutaneously injected FK 749 in mice infected with various gram-negative bacilli was far superior to that of <b>cefotiam,</b> cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefmetazole and was almost {{the same as that of}} cefmetazole in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus and that of ticarcillin in mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. FK 749 has, in general, nearly the same in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities as cefotaxime. The former had more potent bactericidal activity in the presence of the blood than the latter and showed more excellent therapeutic effect than cefotaxime against infections caused by large inoculum sizes...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{influence of}} the concomitant administration of <b>cefotiam</b> and cefsulodin on their respective pharmacokinetics was studied in 15 patients with renal insufficiency and 10 anuric patients. Linear relations {{were found between the}} clearance of creatinine and the total clearance, as well as the renal clearance, of each drug. These relations for each cephalosporin were not significantly different from previous results obtained after separate administration. In hemodialyzed patients, the two cephalosporins were readily eliminated from the blood after simultaneous administration: ca. 35 % of the dose of <b>cefotiam</b> and 30 % of the dose of cefsulodin was recovered in the dialysate over 5 h. These results suggest that the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs are not modified by their simultaneous administration and that the dosing schedule previously proposed for administration of the two cephalosporins alone in the presence of renal insufficiency can be applied without modification when they are given together. Patients on hemodialysis should receive a loading dose after each dialysis period, and then reduced doses according to recommendations for anuric patients...|$|E
