25|$|Shortly after {{purchasing}} the Global network following Canwest's bankruptcy in 2010, Shaw Communications realigned a small station it already owned, CTV affiliate CJBN-TV in Kenora, with Global. However, the station retained its local branding {{and continued to}} be managed by Shaw's Kenora <b>cable</b> <b>operation.</b> When Shaw sold its Shaw Media arm to Corus Entertainment in 2016, CJBN {{was not included in}} the sale. CJBN thus transitioned from a Global O to an affiliate; however, both Shaw and Corus are controlled by the family of JR Shaw, which means that CJBN was thereafter considered a de facto Global O Shaw ultimately decided to close CJBN entirely later in 2016.|$|E

50|$|Cable {{television}} {{is a system}} of delivering television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables, or in more recent systems, light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.Analog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital <b>cable</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Asianet channel {{company and}} a cable company bearing the same name were {{promoted}} by Sashi Kumar with seed capital provided by Reji Menon.

While Sashi Kumar, who held half the shares, resisted their overtures, Reji Menon, who held the remaining half, struck a deal with them. Under the deal, the Rahejas got full control over the cable company. An attempt by Zee Group to acquire Asianet from Menon fell through apparently because the severance agreement with the cable company prohibits the channel's takeover by a company with interest in <b>cable</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R

50|$|For the Mondial t, {{the engine}} and {{transmission}} were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shafts parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined transaxle arrangement fitted {{to the rear of}} the engine block, using a design originally derived from Ferrari's 312T Formula 1 car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by bevel gears to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel crownwheel with integral limited-slip action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via <b>cable</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

The nearest match to the 1932 Hornet Special was the MG F-type, although the chassis details were less similar, as the Hornet had hydraulic brakes while the MG had <b>cable</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
50|$|When the FCC held {{a lottery}} for {{cellular}} licenses {{in the early}} 1980s, many ordinary Americans got rich by winning the right to establish cellular systems in cities across America.

Using the same tactic he'd used in cable TV, McCaw financed an aggressive cellular expansion by borrowing against and selling shares in the <b>cable</b> <b>operation.</b> Through continued borrowing and smart management of only the most useful licenses, this wireless land grab put McCaw's operation {{in the position of}} a competitive nationwide cellular carrier before the incumbent landline telephone industry took serious notice of the field.|$|E
