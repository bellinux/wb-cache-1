5000|$|For a {{cable bundle}} between two devices but {{grounded}} at only one device, in general a ferrite sheath current filter is not effective. With such an arrangement, a ferrite bead {{would only be}} effective to reduce sheath current standing waves. When used to eliminate standing waves, the ferrite sheath current filter must be placed at a <b>current</b> <b>antinode,</b> but not at standing wave nodes.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{parametric}} amplification of a microwave signal in a Kerr medium formed from superconducting qubits. Two mutually coupled flux qubits, {{embedded in the}} <b>current</b> <b>antinode</b> of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator, are used as a nonlinear element. Shared Josephson junctions provide the qubit-resonator coupling, resulting in a device with a measured gain of about 20 dB. We argue, that this arrangement represents a unit cell which can be straightforwardly extended to a quasi one-dimensional quantum metamaterial with a large tunable Kerr nonlinearity.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{a new type}} of microwave circuit for the generation of frequency-scaled Josephson voltages useful for the representation of highly accurate reference voltages. The circuit consists of a superconducting microstrip resonator and series arrays of Josephson junctions integrated within its rf <b>current</b> <b>antinodes.</b> The circuit is designed to operate at low frequencies of about 10 GHz to simplify the microwave techniques. At a resonator circuit with four Josephson junctions driven at 10. 9 GHz we have obtained stable overlapping Shapiro steps up to 4. 6 mV at a step width of about 70 µA. A more advanced double-resonator circuit with altogether 216 junctions allows to generate scaled reference voltages up to 0. 16 V at steps of about 25 µA in width and at a microwave frequency of 11. 1 GHz...|$|R
40|$|Vortices {{trapped in}} {{thin-film}} superconducting microwave resonators {{can have a}} significant influence on the resonator performance. Using a variable-linewidth geometry for a weakly coupled resonator {{we are able to}} observe the effects of a single vortex trapped in the resonator through field cooling. For resonant modes where the vortex is near a <b>current</b> <b>antinode,</b> the presence of even a single vortex leads to a measurable decrease in the quality factor and a dispersive shift of the resonant frequency. For modes with the vortex located at a current node, the presence of the vortex results in no detectable excess loss and, in fact, produces an increase in the quality factor. We attribute this enhancement to a reduction in the density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in the resonator due to the suppressed gap from the vortex.
