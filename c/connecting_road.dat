5|$|M-183 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It serves Fayette State Park as an access route from US Highway 2 (US2). The highway runs through rural farmlands of the Garden Peninsula {{and next to}} Big Bay de Noc, a bay of Lake Michigan. The community at Fayette {{dates back to the}} 1860s. It has been a state park since the late 1950s, and the <b>connecting</b> <b>road</b> has been a state highway since the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{hamlet of}} Port Kent and the <b>connecting</b> <b>road</b> were {{originally}} built in 1823. The village was planned {{to act as}} a source of labor for iron manufacturing and to provide for the industrial needs of Essex County. The hamlet grew and eventually became connected to Burlington, Vermont, via an hour-long ferry across Lake Champlain. The road that accessed Port Kent originally began in Keeseville, but became part of the longer Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike in the 1830s. The highway that is now NY373 was also designated as part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Route 37 {{was defined}} as the {{proposed}} Winchester By-Pass by 1963, and was included in the statewide Arterial Network when it was created in 1964. When I-81 opened past Winchester in November 1965, it included an interchange south of Winchester, taking traffic between I-81 and US 11 along a short <b>connecting</b> <b>road.</b> The north half of the bypass, from US 50 west of Winchester north and east to US 11 north of the city, opened in the late 1960s, and the semicircle was completed in the late 1970s, with the linking of Route 37 to the existing I-81/US 11 connection. A new bridge carrying southbound SR 37 over I-81 was built, but otherwise the diamond interchange was not modified. The only change to the major bypass since it was constructed has been a new trumpet interchange serving the Winchester Medical Center; construction began in September 2000 and was completed in November 2001. A single ramp from SR 37 north to Cives Lane, allowing traffic {{at the north end of}} the bypass to access US 11 south, was built in about 2000.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as Cerezeda was {{establishing}} a new base of operations in the west, Cristóbal de la Cueva entered Honduras from Guatemala with 40 men, under orders from Jorge de Alvarado, brother of Pedro de Alvarado, who was acting as governor while Pedro was fighting in Ecuador. De la Cueva was looking to establish a suitable Caribbean port and a <b>connecting</b> <b>road</b> to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. Cerezeda intercepted the Guatemalan captain, and the two came to an arrangement whereby Cerezeda would take command of de la Cueva's detachment of soldiers, who would assist him in his efforts to explore and conquer the area around Buena Esperanza. In return, Cerezeda would establish the port and road inland to Santiago de Guatemala. The original plan was to reestablish either Puerto de Caballos or San Gil de Buena Vista, but de la Cueva changed his mind, and instead argued for a new inland colony, which was opposed by Cerezeda. De la Cueva's men became rebellious and refused to recognise Cerezeda's command, and de la Cueva abandoned Higueras and marched south to reinforce San Miguel (in modern El Salvador), near the Gulf of Fonseca. This brought San Miguel within the jurisdiction of Guatemala; Cerezeda considered it to be within the territory of Honduras-Higueras, and vociferously protested to the Crown. Jurisdiction over San Miguel remained a source of contention between Honduras and Guatemala for some years to come.|$|E

PA 903 was designated in 1928 to run from US 209/US 309 in Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe) northeast to an unimproved <b>connecting</b> <b>road</b> south of Blakeslee. At this time, all the route was unpaved except for a small portion to the northeast of Mauch Chunk. By 1930, the route was paved southwest to East Mauch Chunk while the state highway was under construction northeast to Christmans. The entire length of PA 903 was paved during the 1930s, at which point PA 115 was designated along the intersecting road at the northern terminus.|$|E

The Portishead Railway was closed in the Beeching Axe but was relaid between 2000–2002 as far as the Royal Portbury Dock with a Strategic Rail Authority rail-freight grant.

The two bridges PA669 uses to cross waterways in Salisbury and West Salisbury have both been deemed structurally deficient by the United States Department of Transportation. The one over the Casselman River in Salisbury was constructed in 1922 and handles an average of 1,469 vehicles per day.

25|$|On 1 March, {{the newly}} arrived Soviet 59th Army, {{supported}} by the fire of 2500 assault guns and more than 100 tanks, attacked the 214th Infantry Division from the Krivasoo bridgehead twenty kilometres south west of Narva. The goal of the attack was the nearest <b>connecting</b> <b>road</b> in Kuremäe village. After three days of fierce battle, the Soviet army broke through the defense and advanced towards the highway to Jõhvi. The 59th Army encircled the strong points of the 214th Infantry Division, and the Estonian 658th and 659th Eastern Battalions, which continued resisting. Lieutenant General Ivan Korvnikov {{in charge of the}} Soviet 59th Army delayed the advance, referring to the lack of artillery support and scarcity of manpower. This gave time for Frießner to move in all available forces and stop the Soviet advance. German losses in these battles were in thousands.|$|E
25|$|During the {{republic}} the tomb {{stood in a}} cemetery for notables and their families located in the angle between the Via Appia and the Via Latina on a <b>connecting</b> <b>road</b> joining the two just past the branch point. It was originally outside the city {{not far from where}} the Via Appia passed through the Servian Wall at the Porta Capena. In subsequent centuries new construction changed the landmarks of the vicinity entirely. The wall was expanded to become the Aurelian Wall through which the Porta Appia admitted the Via Appia. The cemetery was now inside the city. The Appian gate today is called the Porta San Sebastiano. Before it is the so-called Arch of Drusus, actually a section of aqueduct. The Via Appia at that location was renamed to the Via di Porta San Sebastiano. It passes through the Parco degli Scipioni where the cemetery once was located. The via is open to traffic. Most of it is lined by walls.|$|E
25|$|In a 1962 {{government}} report, the park’s {{area was}} identified {{for use as}} future open space. A golf course was proposed, as were other sporting facilities. The course was re-proposed in 1981 {{and again in the}} 1990 management plan. The park was purchased by the Government of South Australia in 1970, as part of a program preserving open space for recreation. The park's location was chosen to provide a development-free buffer between the existing suburbs of Salisbury and the proposed Golden Grove development. It was owned and managed by the State Planning Authority until 1982 when control passed to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Cobbler Creek was declared a recreation park in 1989, at which point some of the land remained leased for agriculture. The Golden Grove Indenture Act (1984) committed the government to build certain access roads to the new suburb of Golden Grove. Based on the provisions of section 7A-1 in the act, in June 1987 cabinet approved the building of Grove Way. The road is a 4-lane divided <b>connecting</b> <b>road,</b> begun in September 1988 and completed in 1990.|$|E
