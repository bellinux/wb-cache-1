In the opening bars of Litany, for Michael Vyner (first movement), a reconstruction from memory by Takemitsu of Lento in Due Movimenti (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is clearly visible in the upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis. The pitches of the opening melody combine to form the constituent notes of the ascending form of the Japanese in scale.|$|E

They culminate in the promontory of Brean Down, only to <b>crop</b> <b>up</b> again in the Bristol Channel as the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. Steep Holm is part of Somerset while Flat Holm is the most southerly point of Wales. The Mendips are composed of Carboniferous Limestone and water erosion has created gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and caves as well as various karst features.|$|E

5|$|West Avenal {{departed}} Norfolk on {{a voyage}} to Leith, Scotland on 9 April 1919, but {{was forced to}} return to port after suffering an engine breakdown. Following repairs, she made several voyages between the East Coast of the United States and various destinations in South America, Spain, France and England. A few mentions of the ship <b>crop</b> <b>up</b> in contemporary news accounts. In August 1919, for example, The New York Times shows West Avenal slated for departure to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 12 August. The following January, the newspaper reported that West Avenal was rammed by the British Leyland Line cargo ship Lacastrian. Departing New York in a dense fog {{on the morning of}} 9 January 1920 for Antwerp, Lacastrian rammed into the port side of West Avenal, which was inbound with a load of onions from Valencia, Spain. The damage was severe enough that West Avenals captain ordered her grounded to avoid sinking in New York Harbor. More than two weeks later, The Washington Post printed a photograph of West Avenal, still grounded off the Red Hook flats. Another report in the Times a year later showed her arrival in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 August 1920.|$|E

Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable a priori.

Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to <b>crop</b> <b>up.</b> This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.|$|E

Berengar was not the undisputed leading magnate in Italy at the time, but he may have made an agreement with his former rival, Guy of Spoleto, whereby Guy would have West Francia and he Italy on the emperor's death. Both Guy and Berengar were related to the Carolingians in the female line. They represented different factions in Italian politics: Berengar the pro-German and Guy the pro-French.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Prentice Kettell, {{former editor}} of the Democratic Review, was another {{commentator}} popular in the South to enjoy a great degree of prominence between 1857 and 1860. Kettell gathered an array of statistics in his book on Southern Wealth and Northern Profits, to show that the South produced vast wealth, while the North, with its dependence on raw materials, siphoned off the wealth of the South. Arguing that sectional inequality resulted from the concentration of manufacturing in the North, and from the North's supremacy in communications, transportation, finance, and international trade, his ideas paralleled old physiocratic doctrines that all profits of manufacturing and trade come out of the land. Political sociologists, such as Barrington Moore, have noted that these forms of romantic nostalgia tend to <b>crop</b> <b>up</b> whenever industrialization takes hold.|$|E

Delano's run was characterised by his political satire, taking on late 1980s and 1990s tropes such as with city financiers being literal demons, and Constantine meeting with Freemasons from the Houses of Parliament. He also had environmentalist issues <b>crop</b> <b>up,</b> especially in [...] "The Fear Machine" [...] (issues #15-22), where John fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists.

500|$|List was an {{accountant}} and World War II and Korean War veteran who murdered his wife, three teenage children, and 85-year-old mother in Westfield, New Jersey, 15 {{days before the}} Cooper hijacking, withdrew $200,000 from his mother's bank account, and disappeared. He {{came to the attention}} of the Cooper task force due to the timing of his disappearance, multiple matches to the hijacker's description, and the reasoning that [...] "a fugitive accused of mass murder has nothing to lose." [...] After his capture in 1989, List admitted to murdering his family, but denied any involvement in the Cooper hijacking. While his name continues to <b>crop</b> <b>up</b> in Cooper articles and documentaries, no substantive evidence implicates him, and the FBI no longer considers him a suspect.

500|$|Heseltine's {{surviving}} {{body of work}} includes about 150 songs, {{mostly for}} solo voice and piano. He also wrote choral pieces, some with instrumental or orchestral accompaniment, and a few purely instrumental works. Among lost or destroyed works the musicologist Ian Copley lists two stage pieces: sketches for the abandoned opera Liadain and Curither, and the draft of a mime-drama Twilight (1926) which Heseltine destroyed {{on the advice of}} Delius. Music historian Stephen Banfield described the songs as [...] "polished gems of English art song forming a pinnacle of that genre's brilliant brief revival in the early 20th century ... intensity, consistency and unfailing excellence". According to Delius's biographer Christopher Palmer, Heseltine influenced the work of fellow-composers Moeran and Orr, {{and to a lesser extent}} Lambert and Walton, primarily by bringing them within the Delius orbit. In the case of the latter pair, Palmer argues, [...] "those reminiscences of Delius which <b>crop</b> <b>up</b> from time to time in [...] music ... are more probably Delius filtered through Warlock".|$|E
