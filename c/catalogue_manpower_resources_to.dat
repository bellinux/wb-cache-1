Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the utilization of VM in other CT programs across the United States (US). Subjects and Methods: A cover letter was sent to the program directors of all accredited CT programs in the US (excluding our program), requesting their participation in an online survey. After 2 days, the participants were sent an online link to the survey. The survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: There were a total of 25 respondents to the survey. Among the 25, three CT programs use VM. Two of the three programs have been using VM for < 2 years while another program for " 2 - 4 " years. The respondents found that VM′s side-by-side comparison feature helped to demonstrate differences between diagnoses and preparation methods, and VM helped to preserve the important slides by digitizing them. Respondents believed that teaching with glass slides was very important. The reasons for not using VM were that VM is expensive and time-consuming to incorporate into the program, and lack of <b>manpower</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> create digitized teaching files. Conclusions: The CT programs that use VM found it to be a valuable educational tool.

Yet, plant growing occupies the leading place in agriculture; the development of animal husbandry also depends on the state of plant growing.

40|$|Background: Skilled birth attendance, usually {{available}} by promoting childbirth at health care institutions in low-resource settings, {{is known to}} prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. While institutional childbirths in India have increased at an exponential rate, the infrastructure, material and <b>manpower</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> support this practice are lagging, raising concerns {{about the quality of}} childbirth services. Methodology: A mixed-method approach was used in this project: in-depth interviews with women (n= 13); and focus-group-discussions with the care providers (n= 27) were conducted and analysed using Grounded Theory. A cross-sectional survey (n= 1004) assessed prevalence of Fear of Birth (FoB) and postnatal depressive symptoms (PND), along with satisfaction with childbirth services among women in the immediate postpartum period. Results: The system of cashless childbirth provided at the public health facilities, in the women’s experiences, came at the hidden cost of them having to make themselves subordinate to the offered services. The prevalence of FoB and PND was 13. 1 % and 17. 1 %, respectively, and these were significantly associated (p < 0. 001). Among women with vaginal births (VB), 41. 2 % had experienced a perineal wound and 59 % of them underwent repair without local anaesthesia. While the majority of the women were satisfied (VB 68. 7 %; Caesarean births 79. 2 %) with the services; women having VBs at Community Health Centres (nearly 81 %) were more commonly satisfied compared to those at the District Hospitals (nearly 60 %) (p < 0. 001). From the care providers’ perspective, maintaining quality of childbirth services was like a balancing act between the realities of low-resource settings with stakeholders’ expectations. While the providers remained proud and committed; the challenges often left them fatigued, disillusioned, irritable and sceptical. Conclusion: There is a need to improve the sensitivity with which childbirth services are being delivered to women coming to public health facilities; as well as towards improving the care providers’ work conditions. Suboptimal birth experiences are associated with the women’s perinatal mental health and satisfaction, while perpetual work challenges may make the care providers frustrated and/or apathetic. Improving <b>manpower</b> <b>resources</b> could reduce work-stress in care providers and thereby improve childbirth processes...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this study is, ‘How important {{is the role of}} community organisers in the success and failure of a people’s organisation in achieving the community-based forest management objectives within its implementation in the Leyte Province, the Philippines’? The study revealed that community organisers, within their two-year community organising contract, were effective in forming people’s organisations, motivating people to participate in voluntary activities organised by people’s organisations, and encouraging cohesiveness among members of people’s organisations. However, the two-year community organisers contract was not enough to establish mature and cohesive POs prepared to assume management on their own, including managing the tree plantations. The issues of the lack of training and funding support, very low wages, delayed salaries, and the limited time for community organisers to work with people’s organisations as well as the pressure to produce tangible outputs such the establishment of large tree plantations, prevented them from putting more emphasis on the development and empowerment of the people. The two years that the community organisers worked with the people’s organisations were focused on preparing <b>manpower</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> establish tree plantations. Hence, the people felt that they were only used as labourers in the tree planting project implemented by the DENR and not as partners or co-managers of forest resources. In addition, this investigation indicates that the desire to earn income and to obtain project benefits were the primary motivating factors for members to continue with their participation in PO activities. PO members believed that if people were organised, with substantial skills, knowledge, capabilities and abilities – in short if they were developed and empowered – they would have the capacity to protect, manage, monitor and rehabilitate forest areas.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to relate the {{qualified}} <b>manpower</b> <b>resources</b> development <b>to</b> the economic development in a linear optimization model. The essence of the model is a simultaneous optimization of investment both in physical and human capital. The author assumes that the question can be reduced to optimization of the set of production techniques. Reducing substitutability of particular factors of production to substitutability of the whole groups of factors, the model takes into account its technological limitations. In the long-term perspective, education appears the strategic factor of qualified <b>manpower</b> <b>resources</b> development. Thus in the model the problem of investment in human capital is reduced to inputs in education, and the level of skills is, in principle, identified with the level of education. The model includes various institutional forms of education and training, also adult education joined or not with a part-time employment. The objective function of the model is the maximization of the final product for non-investment purposes in the whole planning period (with a required aggregate composition given every year), subject to several balance constrains and to required minimal year-by-year rates of its own growth and the growth of the average level of education of manpower. The terminal conditions relating to education and investment in physical capital are the exogenous variables of the model.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{publication}} is {{the analysis of the}} situation of women in the labour market in terms of lowering the retirement age. The reinstatement of quite a low retirement age threshold which makes women eligible for retirement indicates a change in their position in the area of employment. Manipulating the retirement age is a basic instrument of influence on pension schemes and the formation of human resources for labour markets in European countries, the latter affected by the ageing of the population. A dominant trend is to raise the age limit in order <b>to</b> increase <b>manpower</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>to</b> cut back public expenditure on benefits. Without a doubt, the lowering of the retirement age in Poland will have a number of socioeconomic consequences, which will include an outflow of women from the labour market, and a depletion of <b>manpower</b> <b>resources,</b> which in turn may result in lessened migratory pressure. However, the thesis can be advanced that the amount of benefits received, due to a shorter input period, will arouse a greater interest in the option of combining benefit receipt with gainful employment. The solutions adopted in this respect will not only impact the situation of women, but other social groups as well, which will be clearly visible in the response from the labour market. The “Annales.
