5|$|Delta Photos was {{dissolved}} in 1972 but other {{organizations such as}} Morten Bo's Ragnarok and Henrik Saxgren's 2. Maj sought to promote more <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> social and political objectives. Some photographers, such as Viggo Rivad and Krass Clement, chose instead to become freelancers.|$|E
5|$|The west front {{rises in}} three {{distinct}} stages, each <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> by a horizontal course. This horizontal emphasis is counteracted by six strongly projecting buttresses defining the cross-sectional divisions of nave, aisles and towers, and are highly decorated, each having canopied niches containing the largest statues on the façade.|$|E

5|$|There is no <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> {{end to the}} ironclad, {{besides the}} {{transition}} from wood hulls to all-metal. Ironclads continued {{to be used in}} World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century, the descriptions 'battleship' and 'armored cruiser' came to replace the term 'ironclad'.|$|E
5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, {{it is most}} <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant {{based his}} ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|As Hitler {{went from}} being a {{stateless}} street politician to supreme leader of Nazi Germany, the responsibilities of his bodyguard expanded enormously. The bodyguard leaders in the Führer's inner circle eventually established a routine and by 1939 the roles were more <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> as to what duties each unit would undertake.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{majority}} of medieval cathedrals, those of England are cruciform. While most are of the Latin Cross shape with a single transept, several including Salisbury, Lincoln, Wells and Canterbury have two transepts, which is a distinctly English characteristic. The transepts, unlike those of many French cathedrals, always project strongly. The cathedral, whether of monastic or secular foundation, often has several <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> subsidiary buildings, in particular the chapter house and cloister.|$|E
5|$|The {{common name}} of {{firewood}} banksia {{was a result}} of its quick-burning properties. Other names recorded include Menzies banksia, firewheel banksia, port wine banksia, flame banksia, and in the cut flower industry, strawberry banksia and raspberry frost banksia. The Beeloo Whadjuk Noongar people of the Perth region knew it as the Mungyt. Despite its variation across its range, George noted that B.menziesii was a <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> species, and no formal division into subspecies was warranted.|$|E
5|$|To defuse {{tension with}} the Burgundians a second double {{marriage}} was arranged in 1409. Isabeau's daughter Michelle married John the Fearless' son Philip the Good; Isabeau's son, Dauphin Louis, married John's daughter Margaret. Before the wedding, Isabeau negotiated a treaty with John the Fearless {{in which she}} <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> family hierarchy and her position {{in relation to the}} throne.|$|E

5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|Following the election, Mat Herben {{was chosen}} as LPF party leader as Fortuyn's successor. Together with the CDA and the VVD, the party formed part of the {{governing}} coalition, and supplied several members for the Balkenende cabinet. The party was granted four of fourteen cabinet seats, for immigration, economics, health and sports. But without its original leader and lack of a <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> organisational structure, the LPF soon succumbed to highly public internal squabbles. By October2002, the break-up of the government coalition was triggered by the bickering of LPF Ministers Eduard Bomhoff and Herman Heinsbroek.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E

5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show {{to host a}} {{spin-off}} series entitled The Colbert Report, {{a parody}} of personality-driven political pundit programs such as Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor that center largely on the personal views of their hosts. Because of this enlarged role, the personality and beliefs of the Stephen Colbert character have become more <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> {{over the course of}} the show, complete with a fictitious backstory that has been revealed piecemeal in short monologues accompanying a part of the program.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prepared}} speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain {{and the free}} and unfree Internet. Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it and the speech garnered attention as {{the first time a}} senior American official had <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy. In July 2010, she visited Korea, Vietnam, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all the while preparing for the July 31 wedding of daughter Chelsea amid much media attention.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominance}} of the emperor {{was based on the}} consolidation of certain powers from several republican offices, including the inviolability of the tribunes of the people and the authority of the censors to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society. The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as Pontifex Maximus, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders. While these functions were <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate.|$|E
5|$|The {{respective}} remits of the National and Tate Galleries, {{which had}} long been contested by the two institutions, were more <b>clearly</b> <b>defined</b> in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection {{were given to the}} Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by Gauguin and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls.|$|E
5|$|The species inhabits a {{strip of}} 25 {{equatorial}} African countries, very nearly ranging from the east to west coasts of the continent. The exact boundaries of this strip are not <b>clearly</b> <b>defined,</b> as the species' territory overlaps with that of other baboon species. In many places, this has resulted in cross-breeding between species. For example, considerable hybridization has occurred between the olive baboon and the hamadryas baboon in Ethiopia. Cross-breeding with the yellow baboon and the Guinea baboon has also been observed. Although this has been noted, the hybrids have not as yet been well studied.|$|E
