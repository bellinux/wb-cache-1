5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in <b>conversation</b> with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in <b>conversation,</b> but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a <b>conversation.</b>|$|E

30|$|Twitter {{is both a}} microblogging {{service and}} a {{conversational}} environment that enables people to interact, engage in daily chatter and join <b>conversations.</b> <b>Conversations</b> are key element in such service. Almost a quarter of Twitter users hold <b>conversations</b> with other users through this platform [14] and huge percentage of Twitter posts are conversational [21]. The public aspect of <b>conversations</b> makes Twitter one of the available publicity available resources of naturally occurring <b>conversations.</b> The huge volume of <b>conversations</b> produced everyday makes it an interesting information source. Thus, exploiting Twitter <b>conversations</b> to provide context for a given tweet is the main contribution of this paper.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examined}} how {{the structure of}} mother-adolescent <b>conversations</b> differs by ethnic group, age, and dyadic and individual factors. Mother-adolescent dyads of European or Latino descent participated in <b>conversations</b> and reported on their relationship and AIDS knowledge. Latina American mothers dominated <b>conversations</b> more than European American mothers, independent of socioeconomic status. Mothers dominated <b>conversations</b> about sexuality and AIDS more than <b>conversations</b> about conflicts. Mothers of older adolescents reacted more negatively, and older adolescents reported less satisfaction, less openness, and more sexual discussions with persons other than their mothers. Latino American adolescents whose mothers dominated <b>conversations</b> more reported fewer sexual discussions. Latina American mothers who dominated <b>conversations</b> more reported more openness and satisfaction. When mothers dominated <b>conversations</b> more, adolescents had lower AIDS knowledge. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the <b>conversation</b> in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the <b>conversation</b> towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the <b>conversation</b> with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} improving the naturalness of a social dialogue system, Talkie, by adding disfluencies and other content-independent enhancements to synthesized <b>conversations.</b> We investigated whether listeners perceive <b>conversations</b> with these improvements as natural (i. e., human-like) as human-human <b>conversations.</b> We also assessed their ability to correctly identify these <b>conversations</b> as between humans or computers. We find that these enhancements can improve the perceived naturalness of <b>conversations</b> for observers “overhearing ” the dialogues. ...|$|R

5|$|In October 1995, Sirivudh {{talked about}} his desire to assassinate Hun Sen during an {{interview}} with So Naro, who was the secretary-general of the Khmer Journalists Association. A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun Sen, called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun Sen over the phone. The phone <b>conversation</b> was recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone <b>conversation</b> to CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun Sen learnt of the <b>conversation</b> and became enraged at Sirivudh's comments, and pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his parliamentary immunity {{so that he could}} be arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E

5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene-like <b>conversation</b> mode where the player advances the <b>conversation</b> by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E
