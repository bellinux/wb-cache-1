5|$|Montreal is {{classified}} as a humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen climate classification: Dfa/Dfb).|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a <b>continental</b> <b>climate,</b> {{with hot}} summers and cold winters. Minnesota's {{location}} in the Upper Midwest allows it to experience some of the widest variety of weather in the United States, {{with each of the}} four seasons having its own distinct characteristics. The areas near Lake Superior in the Minnesota Arrowhead region experience weather unique {{from the rest of the}} state. The moderating effect of Lake Superior keeps the surrounding area relatively cooler in the summer and relatively warmer in the winter, giving that region a smaller yearly temperature range. On the Köppen climate classification, much of the southern third of Minnesota—roughly from the Twin Cities region southward—falls in the hot summer humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> zone (Dfa), and the northern two-thirds of Minnesota falls in the warm summer great <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> zone (Dfb).|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul has a <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> {{typical of}} the Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to hot and humid. On the Köppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> zone (Dfa). The city {{experiences}} {{a full range of}} precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Continental</b> <b>climates</b> {{are defined}} in the Köppen climate {{classification}} as having a coldest month mean temperature below -3 C (26.6 F) or 0 °C depending on which isotherm used for the coldest month and four months above 10 °C. In the Köppen <b>climate</b> system, <b>Continental</b> <b>climates</b> are bordered to the south by Temperate climates or C climates (coldest month above 0 C, but below 18 C) and to the north by Boreal climate or E climates (only 1 to 3 months with a mean temperature of 50 F). Köppen also defined <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> as having more than 30 days with continuous snowcover on the ground.|$|R
5|$|St. John's has a humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen Dfb), {{with lower}} {{seasonal}} variation than normal for the latitude, which {{is due to}} Gulf Stream moderation.|$|E
5|$|Utica has a <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> {{with four}} {{distinct}} seasons {{and is in}} the humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> (or warm-summer climate: Köppen Dfb) zone, characterized by cold winters and temperate summers. Summer daytime temperatures range from 70–82°F (21-28°C), with an average winter daytime temperature below -3°C (27°F). The city is in USDA plant hardiness zone 5a, and native vegetation can tolerate temperatures from -10°F to -20°F (-28.9°C to -26.1°C).|$|E
5|$|Mountains {{close to}} the coast prevent Mediterranean {{influences}} from extending inland, giving the central Anatolian plateau of the interior of Turkey a <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> with sharply contrasting seasons.|$|E
50|$|In climatology, {{the term}} microthermal {{is used to}} denote the <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> of Eurasia and North America.|$|R
50|$|Species from cool <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> {{hibernate}} {{at temperatures}} from 0 to 4 °C. Some species {{will not survive}} hibernation at temperatures that exceed 4 °C.|$|R
5000|$|Dfb and Dwb climates are {{immediately}} poleward of hot summer <b>continental</b> <b>climates,</b> generally {{in the high}} 40s and low 50s latitudes in North America and Asia, and also extending to higher latitudes {{in central and eastern}} Europe and Russia, between the maritime temperate and <b>continental</b> subarctic <b>climates,</b> where it extends up to 65 degrees latitude in places.|$|R
5|$|The current {{name was}} given in 1354 AD, as Hisar-e-Firoza by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi from 1351 to 1388. The Ghaggar and Drishadvati Rivers once flowed through the city, but they have now changed their course. Hisar has a <b>continental</b> <b>climate,</b> with very hot summers and {{relatively}} cool winters. The most commonly spoken languages are Hindi, Haryanvi, and Bagri.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota has a humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> in {{the east}} and in the Black Hills, and a {{semi-arid}} climate in the west outside of the Black Hills, featuring four very distinct seasons, and the ecology of the state features plant and animal species typical of a North American temperate grassland biome. A number of areas under the protection of the federal or state government, such as Badlands National Park, Wind Cave National Park, and Custer State Park, are located in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Japan is {{predominantly}} temperate, but varies greatly {{from north to}} south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.|$|E
50|$|Humid <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> tend to {{be found}} between latitudes 40° N and 60° N, within the central and northeastern {{portions}} of North America, Europe, and Asia. They are much less commonly found in the Southern Hemisphere due to the larger ocean area at that latitude and the consequent greater maritime moderation. In the Northern Hemisphere some of the humid <b>continental</b> <b>climates,</b> typically in Scandinavia, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland are heavily maritime-influenced, with relatively cool summers and winters being just below the freezing mark. More extreme humid <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> found in southern Siberia and the American Midwest combine hotter summer maxima and colder winters than the marine-based variety. In some areas there are both strong subtropical and subarctic air mass influences depending on season, like the humid and hot summers and the frigid winters of Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the Upper Midwest of the United States.|$|R
50|$|Wine {{regions with}} <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> are characterised {{by the very}} marked {{seasonal}} changes that occur throughout the growing season, with hot temperatures during the summer season and winters cold enough for periodic ice and snow. This is generally described as having {{a high degree of}} continentality. Regions with this type of climate are often found inland on continents without a significant body of water, such as an inland sea, that can moderate their temperatures. Often during the growing season, <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> will have wide diurnal temperature variations with very warm temperatures during the day that drop drastically at night. During the winter and early spring months, frost and hail can be viticultural hazards. Depending on the particular macroclimate of the region, irrigation may be needed to supplement seasonal rainfall. These many climatic influences contribute to the wide vintage variation that is often typical of <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> such as Burgundy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Continental</b> <b>climates</b> exist where {{cold air}} masses {{infiltrate}} {{during the winter}} and warm air masses form in summer under conditions of high sun and long days. Places with <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> are as a rule either far from any moderating effects of oceans (examples: Omaha, Nebraska and Kazan, Russia) or are so situated that prevailing winds tend to head offshore (example: Boston, USA). Such regions get quite warm in the summer, achieving temperatures characteristic of tropical climates but are colder than any other climates of similar latitude in the winter.|$|R
5|$|The north-south {{extent of}} the {{province}} (46°36'N to 60°22'N), prevalent westerly winds, cold ocean currents and local factors such as mountains and coastline combine to create the various climates of the province. Northern Labrador is classified as a polar tundra climate, southern Labrador {{is considered to be}} a subarctic climate while most of Newfoundland would be considered to be a cool summer subtype of a humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aarhus is in {{the humid}} <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> zone (Köppen: Dfb) and the weather is {{influenced}} by low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.|$|E
5|$|Denver {{lies within}} the semi-arid, <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> zone (Köppen climate {{classification}} BSk). It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest {{amount of precipitation}} spread throughout the year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, {{at the foot of}} the Rocky Mountains, Denver, like all cities along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, is subject to sudden changes in weather. Contrary to the popular belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the city can actually expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly cloudy days, and 120 cloudy days each year.|$|E
50|$|In <b>Continental</b> <b>climates,</b> Precipitation {{tends to}} be {{moderate}} in amount, concentrated mostly in the warmer months. Only a few areas, {{in the mountains of}} the Pacific Northwest of North America and in Iran, northern Iraq, adjacent Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia show a winter maximum in precipitation. A portion of the annual precipitation falls as snowfall, and snow often remains on the ground for more than a month. Summers in <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> can feature thunderstorms and frequent cool temperatures, however summer weather is more stable than winter weather.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Continental</b> <b>climates</b> {{often have}} a {{significant}} annual variation in temperature (hot summers and cold winters). They tend {{to occur in the}} middle latitudes (40 to 55 north), where prevailing winds come from over land, and temperatures are not moderated by bodies of water such as oceans or seas. <b>Continental</b> <b>climates</b> occur mostly in the Northern Hemisphere which has the large landmasses required for this type of climate to develop. Most of northern and northeastern China, eastern and southeastern Europe, and the central and upper eastern United States have this type of climate.|$|R
5000|$|In Central Europe, a {{small area}} of humid {{subtropical}} climates are located in transitional areas between the oceanic and <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> in areas where higher summer temperature do not quite qualify it {{for inclusion in the}} Oceanic climate schema (but, in the Trewartha climate classification, this type of climate is included in that typical of the other areas of central-west Europe, classified as Do -the Temperate Oceanic climate-) and mild winters don't allow their inclusion into <b>Continental</b> <b>climates.</b> Average summer temperatures in areas of Europe with this climate are generally not hot as most other subtropical zones around the world.|$|R
5|$|In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, {{northwest}} winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, {{the region}} is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate,</b> with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake and also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E
5|$|The {{complex of}} {{refining}} and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia. While in 2011 {{the city had}} {{the highest level of}} particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has since dropped down to 30th. About 60 percent of the particulate matter, however, comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate,</b> which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from Arctic air blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.|$|E
50|$|Daytime {{temperature}} average ranges normally goes between 20 C {{in summer}} to -6 C in winter, with winters being milder than many <b>continental</b> <b>climates.</b> Due to summer temperatures rapidly dropping once daylight diminishes, Haparanda does not reach such a classification.|$|R
25|$|<b>Continental</b> <b>climates</b> {{are usually}} seen in areas further inland from the coastal {{influences}} of oceans and large bodies of water. The {{difference from the}} average mean temperature of its coldest and hottest months can be quite significant with moderate precipitation that usually occurs {{in the winter and}} early spring. Depending on the water retaining ability of the soil the grapevine may receive enough water during this period to last throughout the growing season with little if any irrigation needed. For soils with poor water retention, the dry summer months may require some supplemental irrigation. Examples of <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> that use supplemental irrigation include the Columbia Valley of Washington State and the Mendoza wine region of Argentina.|$|R
50|$|Garmisch-Partenkirchen leans {{towards an}} oceanic climate. It has colder winters {{than the rest}} of Bavaria; due to its higher {{altitude}} it is very close to the winters associated with <b>continental</b> <b>climates.</b> It has a relatively wet and snowy climate with high precipitation year-round.|$|R
5|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Boston has a humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen Dfa or Dfb) {{that borders}} a humid {{subtropical}} climate or a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen Cfa or Cfb) with some maritime influence. Despite its climate, the city {{lies at the}} transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize {{the influence of the}} Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{is home to}} most of the state's population, and the area's {{fertile soil}} is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, {{ranching}} is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate <b>continental</b> <b>climate,</b> with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American grassland biome.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is in a humid {{subtropical}} region. Oklahoma lies in {{a transition}} zone between humid <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern portions of the state. Most of the state {{lies in a}}n area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth. An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Ice fishing - is the {{practice}} of catching fish with lines and hooks through {{an opening in the}} ice on a frozen body of water. It is practised by hunter-gatherers such as the Inuit and by anglers in other cold or <b>continental</b> <b>climates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Zhmerynka has the <b>continental</b> European <b>climate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Under the Köppen climate {{classification}} system, Old Saybrook, {{along with}} much of the eastern Connecticut coast, lies in the broad transition zone from the colder <b>continental</b> <b>climates</b> of New England and New York, to the temperate climates of the Middle Atlantic states to the south.|$|R
