5|$|Maia {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court, because Maia could not easily meet her children. On May 14, 2013 the Supreme Court decided that the children <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> themselves since the children were considered capable to make a decision. Dhani agreed with it.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} secure a {{position}} as a teacher, erudite in the capital, or government official, a student <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> one of several paths to become well educated. Perhaps the most prestigious path was enrollment in the Imperial University. Students had to be above the age of eighteen to enroll, and were selected by the Minister of Ceremonies from those recommended by local authorities. Other students <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> to enroll in a school sponsored by the local commandery government. A professional teacher who opened a private school {{in a small town}} or village could sometimes gather a following of several hundred to over a thousand students. Students were expected to pay tuition, thus a teacher enjoyed a significant salary. His standing in the local community was usually paramount, and was even sought as an arbiter in disputes. Although the size of the Imperial Academy was greatly expanded in Eastern Han, private schools grew in importance as the imperial government lost authority and its academy's persecution of Old Text tradition drove many to pursue Old Text studies in private institutions.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{destroying}} confiscated ivory, a government <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> to sell it, {{and put the}} funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used {{to improve the quality of}} life for human citizens.|$|E
5000|$|... 1999 - 23 {{years after}} her death, the readers of Politiken <b>could</b> <b>chose</b> a book as [...] "Danish book of the Century". Ditlevsen's book Barndommens gade was number 21.|$|R
60|$|Lady Ashton <b>could</b> not <b>choose</b> but courtesy; {{but there}} was in her obeisance an air of haughtiness {{approaching}} to contemptuous repulse. Ravenswood <b>could</b> not <b>choose</b> but bow; but his manner returned the scorn with {{which he had been}} greeted.|$|R
50|$|In two-player mode, players {{drove in}} a {{head-to-head}} race against another human opponent, {{or any of}} the games' computer opponents. Two computer opponents <b>could</b> also be <b>chosen</b> to race against one another. Any of the sixteen courses <b>could</b> be <b>chosen</b> by the players, and any of the four cars <b>could</b> be <b>chosen</b> by the players. Race distance was chosen by the competitors, ranging from one to ten laps.|$|R
5|$|Season mode was {{replaced}} with Road to WrestleMania in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, and remained in the games until WWE '12. In this mode, players <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player storylines. The difference is that each storyline is tailor made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode is a more authentic experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} of Spitfires to Australia was kept secret {{so that the}} Japanese were not alerted to their presence, and the Australian Government directed that the aircraft {{be referred to as}} Capstans (after the brand of cigarettes) and their Merlin engines as Marvels. General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, agreed that the Australian Government <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> when to announce the presence of the Spitfires, but warned against exaggerating the impact they were likely to have.|$|E
5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish. Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E
50|$|At {{the top of}} Table Mountain, teams {{needed to}} {{photograph}} the Cape of Good Hope. If their photograph was satisfactory, they <b>could</b> <b>chose</b> a postcard and after placing the postcard in a post box for Kiev, a postman would give them their next clue.|$|R
50|$|The six contestants <b>could</b> <b>chosen</b> {{the best}} of their songs in the {{previous}} rounds to perform one by one, with their tutor or their tutor guest.

5|$|The storyline {{over the}} WWE United States Championship began when Booker T, Orlando Jordan, and Christian each {{explained}} why {{they thought they}} deserved a title match against the champion, Chris Benoit. Theodore Long, SmackDown!'s on-screen general manager/authority figure, then announced that Benoit <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> who he wanted to face for the title. After Jordan won a standard wrestling match between three wrestlers, also involving Booker and Christian, Benoit {{decided that he would}} face all three men in a match between the four at No Mercy.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Conviction, {{the game}} {{would have no}} {{interactive}} torture sequences. Instead, players <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and {{it was hoped that}} players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray and there are no right or wrong choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.|$|E
5|$|Using touch controls, {{the player}} would aim {{with one of}} their {{characters}} and shoot them towards enemies like billiards, with the character bouncing off upon contact with enemies or walls until it ran out of momentum. After the player's turn was over, the enemies {{would do the same}} thing, and attack the player's characters. With a certain number of turns passed, the player <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> to activate their characters' individual special attacks.|$|E
50|$|In the 5th {{edition of}} the race, the organisers in {{association}} with SplitSecondPix offered each participant one free race day photo which was searchable by their BIB number. Each participant <b>could</b> <b>chose</b> and download 1 free photo of their choice and in case they wanted more, they could do so by paying a nominal fee.|$|R

5|$|Alfa Romeo {{dominated}} {{the rest of}} the Grand Prix season. Nuvolari and Campari drove the newly introduced Alfa Romeo P3 at the Italian Grand Prix, while Borzacchini and Caracciola drove much heavier 8Cs. Caracciola was forced to retired when his car broke down, but he took over Borzacchini's car when the Italian was hit by a stone, and came third, behind Nuvolari and Fagioli. In the French Grand Prix, Caracciola, now driving a P3, battled Nuvolari for the lead early on. Alfa Romeo's dominance was so great and their cars so far ahead the team <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> the top three finishing positions, thus Nuvolari won from Borzacchini and Caracciola, with the two Italians ahead of the German. The order was different at the 1932 German Grand Prix, where Caracciola won from Nuvolari and Borzacchini.|$|E
5|$|At {{seventeen}} years of age, Watts entered the 2008 season primarily playing school football with Brighton Grammar in the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS) competition, instead of under-18 {{level in the}} TAC Cup with the Sandringham Dragons. He was completing year eleven and <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> to nominate for the AFL draft in either 2008 or 2009; touted as a likely early draft pick despite being a year younger than most of his fellow draft prospects, he spent {{the majority of the}} season undecided on whether he would nominate for the 2008 draft. He did, however, state that he would remain in Victoria in 2009 to complete year twelve at Brighton Grammar even if he was recruited by an interstate team.|$|E
5|$|Emperors <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> {{whether to}} {{supervise}} the policy bureaucracy or to pursue scholarship, cults, hobbies, or women instead. However, Frederick W. Mote argues that most Song emperors – who spent much of their childhood confined and isolated within a luxurious palace – were aloof conformists detached {{from the world of}} normal affairs and thus relied on officialdom to administer the government. While the mainstream view is that the Song court exercised the highest degree of restraint and courtesy towards civil officials, the new protocol of enhanced deferential treatment by officials towards the emperor during conferences and meetings further eroded the emperor's close contact with his ministers.|$|E

5|$|He {{also sought}} to build ties with {{continental}} churches. Cenwald was a royal priest before his appointment as Bishop of Worcester, and in 929 he accompanied two of Æthelstan's half-sisters to the Saxon court so that the future Holy Roman Emperor, Otto, <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> one of them as his wife. Cenwald went on to make a tour of German monasteries, giving lavish gifts on Æthelstan's behalf and receiving in return promises that the monks would pray for the king and others close to him in perpetuity. England and Saxony became closer after the marriage alliance, and German names start to appear in English documents, while Cenwald kept up the contacts he had made by subsequent correspondence, helping the transmission of continental ideas about reformed monasticism to England.|$|E
5|$|In special {{elections}} held in June 1861, Unionists captured nine of Kentucky's ten congressional {{seats and}} obtained two-thirds majorities {{in both houses}} of the state legislature. Despite Magoffin's strict adherence to the policy of neutrality, the Unionist legislature did not trust him and routinely overrode his vetoes. Unable to provide effective leadership due to a hostile legislature, Magoffin agreed to resign as governor in 1862, provided he <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> his successor. Lieutenant governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and Magoffin refused to allow Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk to succeed him as governor. Accordingly, Fisk resigned and the Kentucky Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, as speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson ascended to the governorship, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Life on Brook Farm {{was based}} on {{balancing}} labor and leisure while working together {{for the benefit of}} the greater community. Each member <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> to do whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.|$|E

5|$|On July 14, 2012, Barr came in second, {{losing the}} {{nomination}} to Jill Stein. Stein chose Cheri Honkala as her running-mate despite suggestions that she <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> Barr. Barr {{was given a}} prime speaking role at the Green Party National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, but decided to instead send a surrogate, (Farheen Hakeem), to speak on her behalf. Barr's surrogate reportedly chided the party for not respecting Barr's candidacy. A shouting match in a hallway reportedly ensued. Barr repeatedly criticized Jill Stein after losing the Green Party nomination, and caused controversy by using alleged transphobic words in statements about Stein on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|Spins {{earned in}} this round could be {{passed to the}} {{opponent}} with the higher total (if they were tied, the contestant passing the spins <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> the recipient). Contestants were required to use all spins passed until they used their spins or hit a Whammy; in the latter case, any remaining passed spins were transferred to their earned spin total. If a contestant using passed spins hit a space that awarded a spin (e.g., $3,000 + One Spin), that spin {{was added to the}} earned total. The contestant in the lead {{at the end of the}} game kept any cash and/or prizes in their bank at that time. Unlike Press Your Luck, three new contestants appeared on each episode.|$|E
5|$|The act {{has also}} faced {{challenges}} and opposition. In 2009, Senator Ted Kennedy died, {{and the resultant}} special election cost the Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof Senate majority before the ACA had been fully passed by Congress. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in 2012 that states <b>could</b> <b>choose</b> {{not to participate in}} the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole. The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim plurality of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained plurality support by 2017.|$|E
