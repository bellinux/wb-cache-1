The ceramic panels used for the facade were chosen for their longevity.

50|$|The {{adaptive}} {{model is}} {{based on the idea that}} outdoor climate influences indoor comfort because humans can adapt to different temperatures during different times of the year. The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors, such as having access to environmental controls, and past thermal history can influence building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. Numerous researchers have conducted field studies worldwide in which they survey building occupants about their thermal comfort while taking simultaneous environmental measurements. Analyzing a database of results from 160 of these buildings revealed that occupants of naturally ventilated buildings accept and even prefer a wider range of temperatures than their counterparts in sealed, air-conditioned buildings because their preferred temperature depends on outdoor conditions. These results were incorporated in the ASHRAE 55-2004 standard as the adaptive comfort model. The adaptive chart relates indoor <b>comfort</b> <b>temperature</b> to prevailing outdoor temperature and defines zones of 80% and 90% satisfaction.|$|E

This demands development of new set of comfort models based on local environmental parameters, socio-cultural setup and behavioral action. Analysis shows that four major variables like indoor and outdoor temperature, relative humidity and clothing pattern plays an important role in defining comfort and greatly influence the occupant’s perception and acceptance on thermal comfort. In this study, comfort models are developed based on these variables. The computed neutral temperatures based on the models are compared with the <b>comfort</b> <b>temperatures</b> obtained through <b>comfort</b> survey. The models are developed using the measured data of January and July months and validated with the measured data of April and October months.

50|$|Heating {{glass is}} mostly used for heating of windows. It is {{especially}} useful for rooms where people {{spend much time}} by the windows, at home or at work. The most common usage of heating glass—windows of cottages, office buildings and also big areas—leaded panes, translucent roofing, garret windows, canopies and so on. Heating glass is used for defogging and prevention of frosting of windows of pools, saunas and other buildings of such kind. Insofar as heatable glass has a current-carrying coating, {{it can be used}} as the sensor of alarm systems. When the glass is destroyed the system of protection is activated and it results in activation of alarm system. This kind of product is widely used on objects of tightened standards in questions of protection: nuclear power plants, stations of air navigation control, museums, special storehouses, etc. Heatable glass is also used in production of windows for different kinds of vehicles: electric and diesel locomotives, vessels and boats, various kinds of aircraft and automobiles. One of well-known examples of application of heating glass is armored windows, because the protective glazing is very thick and is disposed to frosting. The usage of heating glass is especially urgent in terms of being the part of armored multiple glass of Smart Glass of switchable transparency, because the heating significantly decreases the period of reaction of liquid crystals structure. The power consumed by products depends on the type of use. Power of about 50-100 watts per square meter of the window is generally enough for maintenance of <b>comfort</b> <b>temperature</b> in the room and for maintenance of glass surface temperature at the rate from +20 degrees to +30 degrees. When the heatable glass is used as the only source of heat it is necessary to maintain the glass surface temperature at the rate from +30 degrees to -45 degrees and provide the power of 100 to 300 watt for 1 square meter of the window. The power needed for vehicle windows reaches 1.5 kilowatts per square meter or more, which is why there are such tight standards in terms of sputtering of current-carrying components. Heat power of about 500-700 watts per square meter of glazing is necessary for snow unloading and taking ice-covering off the outside protective translucent constructions in low temperatures and windy environments.|$|E

This paper explores these challenges more deeply by employing a mixed methods approach. We provide in-situ insights from a Living Lab experiment on the effect of smart home systems and traffic light feedback on heating energy consumption in private households. Our results from an interrupted time series analysis of logged data on indoor room temperature, CO 2 concentration and consumption of natural gas show that the interventions do not affect heating as expected, neither for automating behaviour via high-tech smart home systems nor via low-tech traffic light feedback. Smart home systems do not promise a significant reduction of heating energy consumption and a traffic light feedback on indoor air quality does not lead to a reaction of indoor CO 2 concentrations, but may reduce heating energy consumption. Qualitative interviews on heating practices of participants suggests that <b>comfort</b> <b>temperatures,</b> lack of competences and inert heating systems do override expected effects of the feedback interventions.
