40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of share reacquisitions by U. K. firms over the period January 1995 to December 2000.

Further analysis reveals that the <b>surplus</b> <b>cash</b> effect is more pronounced for firms characterised by low leverage and a limited investment opportunity set. Limited evidence also indicates that the association between share reacquisitions and <b>surplus</b> <b>cash</b> is stronger in the presence of poor contemporaneous share returns, consistent with the view that distributions of excess cash are timed to create further value for shareholders.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role that excess cash plays in {{explaining}} actual open market share reacquisitions and examines the impact of agency problems on the payout decision. Using data from the U. K., where disclosure regulations {{make it possible to}} directly measure the volume and value of shares reacquired, we find that repurchase activity clusters in cash generative industries where investment opportunities are scarce. Holding investment opportunities constant at the firm level, we find that abnormally high cash flows from operating and (to a lesser extent) investing activities drive both the probability of a repurchase and the amount spent reacquiring shares. Comparing a subset of repurchases that are unambiguously driven by the desire to distribute <b>surplus</b> <b>cash</b> with a cash-matched sample of nonrepurchasing firms, we find that repurchasers are characterized by lower managerial entrenchment. Repurchasers also report superior improvements in postrepurchase operating performance and are less likely either to fail or be targeted in corporate control contests during the two-year period following the payout decision. Our results support the view that managers use share reacquisitions as flexible tool for distributing transitory <b>cash</b> <b>surpluses,</b> but only in the absence of serious agency problems betwee...|$|R

Maximizing shareholder value requires managers {{to be able to}} balance capital funding between investments in projects that increase the firm's long term profitability and sustainability, along with paying excess cash in the form of dividends to shareholders. Managers of growth companies (i.e. firms that earn high rates of return on invested capital) will use most of the firm's capital resources and surplus cash on investments and projects so the company can continue to expand its business operations into the future. When companies reach maturity levels within their industry (i.e. companies that earn approximately average or lower returns on invested capital), managers of these companies will use surplus cash to payout dividends to shareholders.

40|$|Social Security {{traditionally}} has operated on a pay-as-you-go basis ó that is, current taxes pay for current benefits. The 1977 and 1983 Amendments to the Social Security Act provided {{for a temporary}} departure from this approach ó with the buildup of a significant trust fund. Currently the Social Security trust funds hold $ 1. 7 trillion in special Treasury bonds. The question is whether this buildup of assets has been economically meaningful. Has it increased national saving and investment and thereby created additional future income? In some sense this may seem like an antiquated question since 2016 is the last year when annual <b>cash</b> <b>surpluses</b> are expected to contribute to fund balances. But, in fact, the question is still very relevant because any attempt to restore solvency will likely again produce large surpluses for several decades.

It then looks at the debate about whether the accumulation of assets in the trust funds since 1983 has increased national saving.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} current status and {{prospects}} of pensions systems in Central America. Pensions systems in the region differ widely on the date of their creation, ranging from 1941 (Costa Rica) to 1977 (Guatemala). Common characteristics of these systems are low fraction of population covered (with the exception of Costa Rica) and low rates of contribution charged, reflecting {{that most of them}} were created relatively recently. Most systems show small <b>cash</b> <b>surpluses</b> and while they still have some reserve funds, projections for all indicate that these reserves will not last for long. This paper reports that systems in the region also suffer from a series of other problems: 1) proliferation of parallel programs, which introduces multiple sources of demands on the government and situations of inequity; 2) inadequate provision of benefits, meaning that benefits are given to people that have not fulfilled the requirements; 3) poor investment performance of the reserve fund. The authors argue that, to a large extent, these problems result from the incentives embedded in pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems, where property rights over contributions to the system are poorly defined. Prospects for PAYG systems are poor, given the projected increase in the ratio of the number of people over 65 years of age to the number of working age people...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} of physical and financial aspects of farming operations in a Nucleus Estate Smallholder (NES) VI Cikaso, West Java, Indonesia. The general objective was to evaluate the prospects and economic worth of the project to blockholders and to assess {{the state of the}} farming operations after tenure of the farms had been converted to individual freehold title. Particular attention was paid to farm net income from all sources in the short term, and to longer term economic and financial viability of the investment in the smallholder coconut project. The case study approach was used. Six farmers, representing a range of different farm operations and management skills, were interviewed to obtain primary data. Secondary data were collected from institutions related to the NES project. The Nucleus Estate and Smallholder (NES) VI project is one of the NES group of projects, in which PTP (Estate Crop. Limited Company) XII is the nucleus company which provides credit to farmers by establishing coconut palms up to bearing age and other facilities. Participants in this project mostly came from West Java, and had a range of different backgrounds. The project was started in 1982 / 1983. Results of the study indicated that these farmers spent more time on farm activities than off-farm activities. However, the higher income received from off-farm activities may cause some farmers in the future to spend time less on their own farms: The physical conditions of the site are suitable for coconut production, as well as for other farming activities. The effects of different management approaches by different farmers on coconut production cannot be detected yet since the ownership and management of the palms has only recently converted from government control to farmer control. If farmers do not apply the recommended management practices for coconuts, this may cause production to decline in the future. From the viewpoint of society at large, the investment in the project is profitable. This is not only true for the whole farm investment but also for the investment in coconut production which is predicted to earn attractive rates of return even without the associated returns from other fanning activities. For the year 1990, most farmers had positive cash balances. Looking at the current financial situation and future prospects of the farmers, {{it seems likely that the}} case study farmers will be able to repay the initial debt over a 20 year period, which is probably less than the economic life of the coconut trees.

40|$|Most {{bankruptcy}} procedures {{attempt to}} reorganize a financially-distressed firm’s debts to a serviceable level through negotiations overseen by courts. Markets {{have been suggested}} {{as an alternative to}} such negotiations. This paper develops such a market-based approach that is appropriate if claimants are severely cash-constrained and there is merit in having existing owners-managers remain in control. The scheme arranges creditors in a queue to be serviced in sequence from the firm’s operating cash flows. Creditors bid for their position in this queue, and those accepting a greater proportionate reduction in the face value of their claims are placed ahead of the others. A pre-existing hierarchy of claims is honored by having claimants bid for their positions within the relevant segment of the queue. No one in the queue (including owners who are last) is paid anything until the (reduced) debts of the first in line are fully discharged using the firm’s operating <b>cash</b> <b>surpluses.</b> The queue then moves up and the next claimant in line is serviced. The paper shows that, in equilibrium, the aggregate debts of the firm are reduced to a level that is more serviceable and that provides the owner-manager with a positive expected residual return.
