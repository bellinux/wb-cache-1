50|$|It is {{important}} to note that unlike subject heading or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work, in library classification systems, each work can only be placed in one class. This is due to shelving purposes: A book can have only one physical place. However, in <b>classified</b> <b>catalogs</b> one may have main entries as well as added entries. Most classification systems like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress Classification also add a cutter number to each work which adds a code for the author of the work.|$|R

El folleto se analiza a partir de distintas aproximaciones. En primer término se estudia el marco teórico de esta clase de estudios. Luego se pasa revista al comercio librero de ese entonces, al contexto cultural, y al desarrollo de dicha Librería. En un segundo momento se abordan los temas siguientes: la presencia de un gabinete de lectura, la evolución histórica de otros catálogos de la época, y el análisis estadístico de los títulos ofrecidos en venta. A continuación se realiza un estudio cualitativo de la colección, basándose en las 'marcas' dejadas por un lector de la época. Finalmente se elabora un catálogo razonado que comprende 508 asientos bibliográficos. El artículo se cierra con un conjunto de conclusiones. Se considera la importancia de este impreso en el ámbito de la {{historia de}} la lectura y de sus prácticas.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{a method for}} using spatially referenced regressions of contaminant transport on watershed attributes (SPARROW) in regional water-quality assessment. The method is designed to reduce the problems of data interpretation caused by sparse sampling, network bias, and basin heterogeneity. The regression equation relates measured transport rates in streams to spatially referenced descriptors of pollution sources and land-surface and stream-channel characteristics. Regression models of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) transport are constructed for a region defined as the nontidal conterminous United States. Observed TN and TP transport rates are derived from water-quality records for 414 stations in the National Stream Quality Accounting Network. Nutrient sources identified in the equations include point sources, applied fertilizer, livestock waste, nonagricultural land, and atmospheric deposition (TN only). Surface characteristics {{found to be significant}} predictors of land-water delivery include soil permeability, stream density, and temperature (TN only). Estimated instream decay coefficients for the two contaminants decrease monotonically with increasing stream size. TP transport is found to be significantly reduced by reservoir retention. Spatial referencing of basin attributes in relation to the stream channel network greatly increases their statistical significance and model accuracy. The method is used to estimate the proportion of watersheds in the conterminous United States (i. e., hydrologic cataloging units) with outflow TP concentrations less than the criterion of 0. 1 mg/L, and to <b>classify</b> <b>cataloging</b> units according to local TN yield (kg/km 2 /yr). 1...|$|R

In this research the data was analyzed by reduction data then the data was tested the validity by the credibility and confirmability test. The result of the research were: (1) from six libraries, there were four school libraries: SDN Ngawen I Library, Sekar Mekar Library of SDN Ngawen II, Ngawen IV Library, and Pustaka Ilmu Library of SDN Pagerjurang which the system of processing their collection had included five activities: recording, <b>classifying,</b> <b>cataloging,</b> labeling, and shelving. The two other libraries SDN Ngawen III and SDN Beji library had not included five activities, because there was no labeling activity. (2) Every library had different problem, but on the head line the problem was lack carefulness of the librarian in inputting the inventories number. (3) To solve the problem there are many was to do, but on the big line the librarian must recheck and be more careful in processing the library collection. From this research, the researcher suggest that the need of carefulness, and patience in inputting and processing the library collection in order to avoiding the mistakes.

5|$|As {{a result}} of a new {{emphasis}} on observing, <b>classifying,</b> and <b>cataloging</b> nature, 16th century natural philosophers in Europe began to establish extensive collections of fossil objects (as well as collections of plant and animal specimens), which were often stored in specially built cabinets to help organize them. Conrad Gesner published a 1565 work on fossils that contained one of the first detailed descriptions of such a cabinet and collection. The collection belonged to a member of the extensive network of correspondents that Gesner drew on for his works. Such informal correspondence networks among natural philosophers and collectors became increasingly important {{during the course of the}} 16th century and were direct forerunners of the scientific societies that would begin to form in the 17th century. These cabinet collections and correspondence networks played an important role in the development of natural philosophy.|$|R
