The life <b>consumption</b> <b>monitoring</b> process involves continuous or periodic measurement, sensing, recording, and interpretation of physical parameters associated with a system's life cycle environment to quantify the amount of degradation. This thesis explains a life <b>consumption</b> <b>monitoring</b> methodology for electronic products, which includes failure modes, mechanisms and effects analysis (FMMEA), virtual reliability assessment, monitoring product parameters, data simplification, stress and damage accumulation analysis and remaining life estimation. It presents two case studies to estimate the remaining life of identical circuit card assemblies in an automobile underhood environment using the life <b>consumption</b> <b>monitoring</b> methodology. Failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis along with virtual reliability assessment is {{used to determine the}} dominant failure mechanism in the given life cycle environment.

Temperature sensor and accelerometers are used along with a data logger to monitor and record the environmental loads during the experiment. A data simplification scheme is used to make the raw sensor data suitable for further processing. Stress and damage models are used to estimate the remaining life of the circuit card assembly based on the simplified data. Performances of the test board assemblies are monitored through resistance monitoring. The life cycle environment and results for the case studies are compared with each other.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model that}} enables the determination of when scheduled maintenance makes sense, and how to optimally interpret Prognostic Health Management (PHM) results for electronic systems. In this context, optimal interpretation of PHM results means translating PHM information into maintenance policies that minimize life cycle costs. The electronics PHM problem is characterized by imperfect and partial monitoring and a significant random/overstress failure component {{must be considered in}} the decision process. Specifically the model enables determining on an application-specific basis when the reliability of electronics has become predictable enough to warrant the application of PHM-based scheduled maintenance concepts. Given that the forecasting ability of PHM (whether health monitoring or life <b>consumption</b> <b>monitoring</b> based) is fraught with uncertainties in the sensor data collected, the models applied, the material parameters assumed in the models, etc., the model in this paper addresses how PHM results can be interpreted so as to provide value to the system.

The model provides the type of information needed to construct a business case showing the application-specific usefulness of health monitoring and/or life <b>consumption</b> <b>monitoring</b> for electronic systems...|$|E
