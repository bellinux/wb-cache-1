Nikau-Isesi was an official who started his career during the reign of Djedkare Isesi, lived through that of Unas and died as overseer of Upper-Egypt under Unas' successor Teti. Nikau-Isesi is known to have died on the year of the eleventh <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> during Teti's reign, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom and every year during the later Middle Kingdom (c.2055–c.1650 BC). Thus Nikau-Isesi would have lived for 22 years after Teti took the throne and together with the 30 years of reign credited to Unas, would have died past 70 years old. However, forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of no more than 45 years old. This suggests that the <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> occurred more than once every two years during Unas and Teti's time, possibly irregularly. If so, Unas' 30-year figure on the Turin canon, understood to mean 15 cattle counts, could translate into as little as 15 years, which together with just 11 years during Teti's reign would account for Nikau-Isesi's death at around 40 to 45 years of age.|$|E
25|$|In {{attempt to}} solve the riddle around Khufu's true length of rulership, modern Egyptologists point to Sneferu's reign, when the <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> was held every second year of a king's rulership.

25|$|Egyptologists such as Thomas Schneider, Michael Haase, and Rainer Stadelmann {{wonder if}} the {{compiler}} of the Turin Canon actually took into account that the <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> was performed biennially {{during the first half}} of the Old Kingdom period, whilst tax collection during the 19th dynasty was held every year. In sum, all these documents would prove that Khufu ruled for at least 26 or 27 years, and possibly for over 34 years, if the inscription in the relieving chambers point to a biennial <b>cattle</b> <b>count.</b> Indeed, if the compiler of the Turin Canon did not take into account a biennial <b>cattle</b> <b>count,</b> it could even mean that Khufu ruled for 46 years.|$|E

Michel Baud and Vassil Dobrev estimate at least 12 years of reign for Teti, 2-4 years for Userkare, 49-50 years for Pepi I and, at least, 11-13 years for Merenre based on an estimate {{on the size of the}} preserved year the size of each year blocks and the location of certain <b>cattle</b> <b>counts</b> (such as the Year of the 18th and 25th counts for Pepi I and his Year after the 23rd count, or the Year of and the Year after the 2nd count for Merenre) within this document.|$|R

The stone also gives the exact date of a ruler's accession to the throne.

25|$|The 24-year Turin Canon {{figure for}} Sneferu's reign is {{considered}} today {{to be an}} underestimate since this king's highest-known date is an inscription discovered at the Red Pyramid of Dahshur and mentioning Sneferu's 24th <b>cattle</b> <b>count,</b> corresponding to at least 24 full years. Snefru, however, was known to have a minimum {{of at least three}} years after the <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> dates: his years after the 10th, the 13th and the 18th count are attested at his Meidum pyramid. This would mean that Sneferu ruled Egypt a minimum of 27 full years.|$|E
25|$|There {{are very}} few archaeological sources {{contemporaneous}} with Neferefre, a fact which is now seen by Egyptologists, including Miroslav Verner, to witness a very short reign. In particular, as of 2017, only one inscription dated to his rule is known. It was left by the builders of his pyramid on a corner block {{at the end of}} the corridor leading down to the pyramid substructures. The inscription was written on the fourth day of the Akhet season in the year of first occurrence of the <b>cattle</b> <b>count,</b> an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom although recent reappraisals have led Egyptologists to posit a less regular and somewhat more frequent count. Therefore, the inscription is likely to refer to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne, and his third year at the very latest. Finally, a few artefacts dated to Neferefre's rule or shortly after have been uncovered in his mortuary complex and elsewhere in Abusir, such a clay seals bearing his Horus name.|$|E

The higher estimate is close to Manetho's 44-year figure credited to Tancherês, the Hellenized name of Djedkare, although this may just be coincidental. Modern estimates thus put Djedkare's reign length as certainly more than 33 years and, if the <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> was regularly biennial, at least 42 to 44 years. This makes Djedkare the longest reigning king of the Fifth Dynasty.|$|E

Djedkare's time on the throne is well documented by the Abusir papyri, numerous royal seals and contemporary inscriptions; taken together, they indicate a fairly long rule for this king.

Several artefacts and inscriptions have been uncovered relating to Djedkare's rejuvenation or [...] "sed" [...] festival, normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign.

500|$|The {{relative}} {{chronology of}} Sahure's reign {{is well established}} by historical records and contemporary artefacts, showing that he succeeded Userkaf and was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai. The Turin canon, a king list written during the 19th Dynasty in the early Ramesside era (12921189 BC), credits him with a reign of 12 years [...] 5 months and 12 days. In contrast, the near contemporary annal of the 5th Dynasty known as the Palermo Stone preserves his 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th years on the throne {{as well as his}} final year of reign and even records the day of his death as the 28th of Shemu II (9th month). The document notes six or seven cattle counts, which would indicate a reign of at least 12 full years if the Old Kingdom <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> was held biennially (i.e. every 2 years) as this annal document implies for the early 5th Dynasty. If this assumption is correct and Sahure's highest attested date was the year after the 6th count rather than his 7th count as Wilkinson believes, then this date would mean that Sahure died in his 13th year and should be given a reign of 13 years 5 months and 12 days. This number would be only one year more than the Turin Canon's 12-year figure for Sahure. It is also closer to the 13 years figure given in Manetho's Aegyptiaca, a history of ancient Egypt written in the 3rd century BC.|$|E

Newer evidence from Wadi al-Jarf however, give a third clue about the true length of reign: Several papyrus fragments contain handwritten reports from a royal harbour at modern-day Wadi al-Jarf. The inscription describes the arrival of royal boats with precious ore and turquoise in the [...] "year after the 13th <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> under Hor-Medjedw".

2500|$|An {{analysis}} of the damaged Dynasty 6 South Saqqara Stone Annal document gives him a reign of c. 48–49 years {{but this is not}} confirmed by the Turin King List which apparently assigns him 44 years, according to the Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt's {{analysis of}} this document. There has been some doubt regarding whether the <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> dating system was strictly biennial or slightly more irregular. That the latter situation appeared to be the case was suggested by the famous Year after the 18th Count, 3rd Month of Shemu day 27 inscription from Wadi Hammamat No. 74-75 which mentions the [...] "first occurrence of the Heb Sed" [...] in that year for Pepi. as well as a Year after the 18th Count, 4th Month of Shemu day 5 date in Sinai graffito No. 106 as the French Egyptologist Michel Baud noted in a 2006 book on Egyptian chronology. This would be the year 36 if the biennial dating system was used. This information is significant because the Heb Sed Feast was always celebrated in a king's Year 30. If Pepi I was using a biennial counting system during his reign, these heb sed inscriptions should have been dated to the Year after the 15th Count instead. This could imply that the <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> during the 6th dynasty was not regularly biennial.

This column must, therefore, be dated to the year after the 6th count of Sneferu. Hence, Sneferu's reign would be a minimum of 28 years. Since there are many periods in Snefru's reigns for which Egyptologists have few dates—only the years of the 2nd, 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 23rd and 24th count are known for Sneferu before one considers the years after his cattle counts—this pharaoh is most likely to have had a reign in excess of 30 years to manage to build three pyramids in his long rule but not 48 years since the <b>cattle</b> <b>count</b> was not regularly biannual during his kingship.
