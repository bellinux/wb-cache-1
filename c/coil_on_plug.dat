2500|$|Other {{innovations}} {{are currently}} available on various cars. In some models, {{rather than one}} central coil, there are individual coils on each spark plug, sometimes known as direct ignition or <b>coil</b> <b>on</b> <b>plug</b> (COP). This allows the coil a longer time to accumulate a charge between sparks, and therefore a higher energy spark. A variation on this has each coil handle two plugs, on cylinders which are 360 degrees out of phase (and therefore reach TDC at the same time); in the four-cycle engine this means that one plug will be sparking during {{the end of the}} exhaust stroke while the other fires at the usual time, a so-called [...] "wasted spark" [...] arrangement which has no drawbacks apart from faster spark plug erosion; the paired cylinders are 1/4 and 2/3.

In 2000, the first J series replaced the G, increasing power to 112 BHP by increasing the compression ratio from 11.8:1 to 12.8:1.

5000|$|MS1/Extra is a {{firmware}} modification to {{the original}} Bowling and Grippo MegaSquirt written by Philip Ringwood and James Murray (with contributions from many more).

Hardware modifications are required to run ignition and the learning curve is steeper than a fuel-only implementation, but many hundreds of users use the [...] "MS1/Extra" [...] firmware. The firmware was very actively developed and is now a stable alternative to the base MS code. Most MegaSquirt vendors ship the MS1/Extra firmware as standard on MS1 boards. The firmware is designed to operate using either a supported ignition system, such as GM HEI, or Ford EDIS, or it can decode certain trigger wheel signals from crank/cam sensor pickups and directly run wasted spark or <b>coil</b> <b>on</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|E
