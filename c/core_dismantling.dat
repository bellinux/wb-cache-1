50|$|The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is {{responsible}} for the decommissioning of the UK Magnox power plants, at an estimated cost of £12.6 billion. There is currently debate about whether a 25 or 100 year decommissioning strategy should be adopted. After 80 years short-lifetime radioactive material in the defuelled core would have decayed to the point that human access to the reactor structure would be possible, easing dismantling work. A shorter decommissioning strategy would require a fully robotic <b>core</b> <b>dismantling</b> technique.|$|E
40|$|The first {{generation}} of UK research and production reactors were graphite moderated and operated at low temperatures, below 150 °C. The graphite in these reactors now contains {{a significant amount of}} stored (Wigner) energy that may be relatively easily released by heating the graphite above the irradiation temperature. This exothermic behaviour has lead to a number of decommissioning issues which are related to characterization of graphite samples, long term "safe-storage", reactor <b>core</b> <b>dismantling,</b> graphite waste packaging and the final disposal of this irradiated graphite waste. The release of stored energy can be modelled using kinetic models linked to classical kinetic analysis theory. These models rely on Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) data obtained either from graphite samples irradiated in material test reactors or data obtained from small samples trepanned from the reactors themselves. Data from these experiments can be used to derive activation energies and characteristic functions used in kinetic models for application to practical situations using suitable modelling techniques. In this paper the classical theory of kinetic analysis is used as the basis for models applied to the study of stored energy release in irradiated graphite components. The use of an independent parallel reactions model is proposed and several possible kinetic model scenarios are tested. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
50|$|It {{took four}} {{years for the}} reactor to be repaired, and then {{performance}} was poor. In 1972, the reactor <b>core</b> was <b>dismantled</b> and the reactor was decommissioned. America's first effort at operating a full-scale breeder had failed.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} Earth <b>core</b> is <b>dismantled</b> {{to build}} the shells that lie in the pole regions. During this process, the massive heat radiation of the core accelerates plant growth and therefore aids the process of establishing a functioning biosphere.|$|R
50|$|Earth's crust, mantle {{and core}} are {{gradually}} excavated, transported outwards and then transformed to larger strength and reduced density. While the crust is mined from open pits in the continents' centers, magma and the liquid mantle are pumped across transfer hoses. The <b>core</b> is <b>dismantled</b> from the surface.|$|R
25|$|The {{financial}} costs of every {{nuclear power plant}} continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as greenfield status. After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor <b>core</b> materials are <b>dismantled</b> and {{cut into small pieces}} to be packed in containers for interim storage or transmutation experiments. The consensus on how to approach the task is one that is relatively inexpensive, but {{it has the potential to}} be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.|$|R
50|$|Still, the Kings {{finished}} the season {{second in the}} Pacific Division with a 55-27 record. Miller and Peja Stojaković were both selected for the 2004 NBA All-Star Game. In {{the first round of}} the playoffs, the Kings got the last laugh as they defeated their archrivals the Dallas Mavericks in five games, before falling to Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round as Webber missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer in Game 7. This ended the Kings' attempt at a championship as their <b>core</b> would be <b>dismantled</b> the following season, which included Vlade Divac re-signing as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers, Peeler signing with the Washington Wizards, and Gerald Wallace leaving for the 2004 NBA Expansion Draft.|$|R
40|$|International audienceArgillaceous {{formations}} {{are thought}} to be suitable natural barriers to the release of radionuclides from a radioactive waste repository. However, the safety assessment of a waste repository hosted by an argillaceous rock requires knowledge of several properties of the host rock such as the hydraulic conductivity, diffusion properties and the pore water composition. This paper presents an experimental design that allows the determination of these three types of parameters on the same cylindrical rock sample. The reliability of this method was evaluated using a core sample from a well-investigated indurated argillaceous formation, the Opalinus Clay from the Mont Terri Underground Research Laboratory (URL) (Switzerland). In this test, deuterium- and oxygen- 18 -depleted water, bromide and caesium were injected as tracer pulses in a reservoir drilled in the centre of a cylindrical core sample. The evolution of these tracers was monitored by means of samplers included in a circulation circuit for a period of 204 days. Then, a hydraulic test (pulse-test type) was performed. Finally, the <b>core</b> sample was <b>dismantled</b> and analysed to determine tracer profiles. Diffusion parameters determined for the four tracers are consistent with those previously obtained from laboratory through-diffusion and in-situ diffusion experiments. The reconstructed initial pore-water composition (chloride and water stable-isotope concentrations) was also consistent with those previously reported. In addition, the hydraulic test led to an estimate of hydraulic conductivity in good agreement with that obtained from in-situ tests...|$|R
