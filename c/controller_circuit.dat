40|$|Abstract — Articulated robots are {{generally}} driven by electric motors where proper controlling signal with proper time synchronism {{are needed to}} have control over {{the movement of the}} robot. Electric motors employed for the motion control must be operated sequentially and with certain time duration. This paper discusses the motion control of an articulated robot which can be used for precise positioning having applications in various industries. Necessary conditions for the precise positioning of an articulated robotic arm are determined, and ways to control the hand based on these conditions are proposed. A <b>controller</b> <b>circuit</b> is designed which is based on ATmega 32 L microcontroller for controlling the motion of the motors. It ensures greater accuracy, better speed, flexibility, reduced circuit size and more economical operation than any other control circuit.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a single-phase five-level photovoltaic (PV) inverter topology for grid-connected PV systems {{with a novel}} pulse width-modulated (PWM) control scheme. Two reference signals identical to each other with an offset equivalent to the amplitude of the triangular carrier signal were used to generate PWM signals for the switches. The inverter offers much less total harmonic distortion and can operate at near-unity power factor. This paper presented a single-phase multilevel inverter for PV application. It utilizes two reference signals and a carrier signal to generate PWM switching signals. The circuit topology, modulation law, and operational principle of the proposed inverter were analyzed in detail. A FUZZY control is implemented to optimize {{the performance of the}} inverter.

We consider generating efficient <b>controller</b> <b>circuits</b> from descriptions written in Esterel.

We hoped the high-level structure of Esterel would suggest inexpensive, effective optimizations, but our results are mixed. In the five examples we considered, many optimizations clearly could be automated cheaply, but we needed more global information to match {{the quality of the}} existing automatic techniques. This suggests an effective solution would have to combine both local and (potentially costly) global techniques...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{reducing}} the power consumption in asyn-chronous micropipeline-based circuits is presented. The method is based around a new design for latch control-lers in which the operating mode of the pipeline latches (normally open/transparent or normally closed/opaque) can be selected according to the dynamic processing demand on the circuit. Operating in normally-closed mode prevents spurious transitions from propagating along a static pipeline, {{at the expense of}} reduced throughput. Tests of the new latch <b>controller</b> <b>circuits</b> on a pipelined multiplier datapath show that reductions in energy per operation of up to 32 % can be obtained by changing to the normally-closed operating mode.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 68 - 69). The project is about the designing {{and implementation of the}} electrical drive system of a solar powered car. The solar panel collects energy from the sun during the day time and stores this in a lead-acid battery through a charge controller that to drive the motor of the car. The charge <b>controller</b> <b>circuit</b> has been used to supply the battery with the maximum amount charge possible, while protecting it from overcharge by the solar panels or the electric source as well as over discharge by the motor. Functionality of both the driver circuit and the charge <b>controller</b> <b>circuit</b> are controlled by the PIC 16 F 876 A microcontroller. For the charge <b>controller</b> <b>circuit,</b> the PIC detects the current and voltage of the battery and thereby, according to the state of the battery, it feeds back a Pulse-Width Modulated (PWM) flow of charge from the panel to the battery. As the whole thesis project is based on Direct Current Power System, Direct Current (DC) motors are worthier in this case. DC motor has become familiar as an essential drive configuration or pattern for many applications widely in terms of power and speed. The number of applications implemented by DC motor will continue grow for the predictable future because of the quality of easy controlling and the outstanding performance of the DC motors. The main motive of this thesis project is to design a speed controller system or driver circuit for DC motor in both the theoretical and practical way. Karima KhatunRadita ChowdhuryMd.

40|$|The CCDs {{are widely}} used in astronomical {{observations}} either in direct imaging use or spectroscopic mode. However, the areas of available sensors are too small for large imaging format.
