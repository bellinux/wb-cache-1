5000|$|This contradicts what George Gamow {{writes in}} his book Mr. Tompkins; there, Gamow {{suggests}} that if a dimension-dependent universal constant such as c changed significantly, we would easily notice the difference. The disagreement is better {{thought of as the}} ambiguity in the phrase [...] "changing a physical constant"; what would happen depends on whether (1) all other dimensionless constants were kept the same, or whether (2) all other dimension-dependent constants are kept the same. The second choice is a somewhat confusing possibility, since most of our units of measurement are defined in relation to the outcomes of physical experiments, and the experimental results depend on the constants. (The only exception is the kilogram.) Gamow does not address this subtlety; the thought experiments he conducts in his popular works assume the second choice for [...] "changing a physical constant". And Duff or Barrow would point out that ascribing a change in measurable reality, i.e. α, to a specific dimensional <b>component</b> <b>quantity,</b> such as c, is unjustified. The very same operational difference in measurement or perceived reality could just as well be caused by a change in h or e if α is changed and no other dimensionless constants are changed. It is only the dimensionless physical constants that ultimately matter in the definition of worlds.|$|E

40|$|International audienceShort interfering RNAs (siRNAs) {{appear to}} be a {{promising}} tool to treat various human diseases, such as cancer via the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism. Since the systemic administration of siRNAs is limited by their capacity to attain the site of action, novel delivery systems are needed. Previously, we reported the formulation of magnetic siRNA nanovectors (MSN) using electrostatic assembly of the following components: (1) functionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) able to act as agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or thermal therapy, (2) siRNAs as active molecules and (3) chitosan to protect siRNAs and to enhance their transfection efficacy. In this work, experimental design was used to further improve the formulation protocol and to optimize the <b>component</b> <b>quantities.</b> The aim was to obtain response surface plots that will help to optimize and predict the <b>component</b> <b>quantities</b> of the MSNs regarding their hydrodynamic diameter (DH). The influent parameters of the formulation process were determined using a Plackett-Burman design. The results show that the order of incorporation of the components is the most influent parameter on the DH of MSNs. A Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the <b>component</b> <b>quantities.</b> The model equations provided the parameters to obtain MSNs with DH smaller than 100 nm to allow their systemic administration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} shown that judicious {{integration}} of SMA wires or strips within composite components of certain geometries can lead to substantially enhanced dynamic effects within the component. These effects relate to natural frequency placements, mode shapes, and forced response characteristics, in particular. One application area of considerable interest involves the installation of bespoke technology exploiting this controllability within rotor systems, and this {{is the subject of this}} paper. It is shown that for a laboratory rotor system supported on two bearings, one of which is an active component comprising a cylindrical sleeve with specially configured and integrated SMA strips, the critical speeds can be usefully shifted about their nominal values. The paper shows how such an active bearing installation can be designed and discusses the many trade-offs required to optimise the performance in a useful way. It is shown that the principal compromises relate to stress in the composite host, physical size and shape of this <b>component,</b> <b>quantity</b> and distribution of SMA, and the local operating dynamics. It is also shown that glass-epoxy is superior to graphite-epoxy in terms of dynamic controllability for the composite cylindrical sleeve host component when used as an active support for one of the bearings, and that this useful performance can be accentuated by means of careful design. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Center for Financial Stability (CFS) has {{initiated}} a new Divisia monetary aggregates database, maintained within the CFS program called Advances in Monetary and Financial Measurement (AMFM). The Director {{of the program}} is William A. Barnett, who is the originator of Divisia monetary aggregation and more broadly of the associated field of aggregation-theoretic monetary aggregation. The international section of the AMFM web site is a centralized source for Divisia monetary aggregates data and research for over 40 countries throughout the world. The components of the CFS Divisia monetary aggregates for the United States reflect closely those of the current and former simple-sum monetary aggregates provided by the Federal Reserve. The first five levels, M 1, M 2, M 2 M, MZM, and ALL, are composed of currency, deposit accounts, and money market accounts. The liquid asset extensions to M 3, M 4 -, and M 4 resemble in spirit the now discontinued M 3 and L aggregates, including repurchase agreements, large denomination time deposits, commercial paper, and Treasury bills. When the Federal Reserve discontinued publishing M 3 and L, the Fed stopped providing the consolidated, seasonally adjusted components. Also the Fed no longer provides the interest rates on the components. With so much of the needed <b>component</b> <b>quantity</b> and interest-rate data no longer available from the Federal Reserve, decisions about data sources needed in construction of the CFS aggregates have been far from easy and sometimes required regression interpolation.

5000|$|Here, {{reporting}} {{quantity and}} allocation disagreement is informative while Kappa obscures information. Furthermore, Kappa introduces some challenges in calculation and interpretation because Kappa is a ratio. It {{is possible for}} Kappa’s ratio to return an undefined value due to zero in the denominator. Furthermore, a ratio does not reveal its numerator nor its denominator. It is more informative for researchers to report disagreement in two <b>components,</b> <b>quantity</b> and allocation. These two components describe {{the relationship between the}} categories more clearly than a single summary statistic. When predictive accuracy is the goal, researchers can more easily begin to think about ways to improve a prediction by using two <b>components</b> of <b>quantity</b> and allocation, rather than one ratio of Kappa.Some researchers have expressed concern over κ's tendency to take the observed categories' frequencies as givens, which can make it unreliable for measuring agreement in situations such as the diagnosis of rare diseases. In these situations, κ tends to underestimate the agreement on the rare category. For this reason, κ is considered an overly conservative measure of agreement. Others contest the assertion that kappa [...] "takes into account" [...] chance agreement. To do this effectively would require an explicit model of how chance affects rater decisions. The so-called chance adjustment of kappa statistics supposes that, when not completely certain, raters simply guess—a very unrealistic scenario.|$|R

High sample temperatures during analysis likely contributed to positive results for all component predictions compared to references.
