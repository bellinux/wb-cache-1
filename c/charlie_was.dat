5|$|Testing program staff {{originally}} {{set test}} Charlie for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep {{under the surface}} {{in the lee of}} the atoll to test the effect of nuclear weapons as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test Baker prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant that there were no uncontaminated target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling <b>Charlie</b> <b>was</b> that the program staff felt it was unnecessary due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests. The deep ocean effects testing that <b>Charlie</b> <b>was</b> to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with Operation Wigwam.|$|E

5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of the season, Able, formed {{prior to}} the official start of the season; before reanalysis in 2015, it was once listed as the earliest major hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. It formed on May16 and executed a counterclockwise loop over the Bahamas; later it brushed the North Carolina coastline. Hurricane <b>Charlie</b> <b>was</b> a powerful Category4 hurricane that struck Jamaica as a major hurricane, killing hundreds and becoming the worst disaster in over 50years. The hurricane later struck Mexico twice as a major hurricane, producing deadly flooding outside of Tampico, Tamaulipas. The strongest hurricane, Easy, spent its duration over the open Atlantic Ocean, briefly threatening Bermuda, and was formerly listed {{as one of a}} relatively few Category5 hurricanes on record over the Atlantic Ocean.

5|$|Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sawyer, who at the time {{was supposed to be a}} suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead. When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had. After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally <b>Charlie</b> <b>was</b> an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.|$|E
