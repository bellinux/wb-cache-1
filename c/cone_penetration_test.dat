40|$|Many {{embankments}} on the soft, highly variable, recent {{alluvial deposits}} along the South African coast have suffered large settlements necessitating ongoing costly repairs. Due to the soft variable soils, borehole sampling is difficult and laboratory testing requires to be extensive for adequate subsoil modelling; <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> {{was considered to be}} a potential means to overcome these problems. Twenty five years ago in South Africa, as elsewhere, <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> equipment was relatively crude and the methods of interpretation were simplistic. The application of <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> to {{recent alluvial deposits}} therefore required improvements to both the equipment and the derivation of soil parameters. The equipment was upgraded by introducing strain gauge load cells capable of measuring cone pressures in soft clays with adequate accuracy. Hence, correlations of cone pressures with compressibility and shear strength became possible. Predictions of settlement times and magnitudes are of equal importance and a consolidometer-cone system was developed to assess both of these.

Subsurface exploration usually involves in-situ testing (two common examples of in-situ tests are the standard penetration test and <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>test).</b> In addition site investigation will often include subsurface sampling and laboratory testing of the soil samples retrieved. The digging of test pits and trenching (particularly for locating faults and slide planes) may {{also be used to}} learn about soil conditions at depth.

Whilst conventional circular rollers {{are able to}} compact layer thicknesses typically {{in the range of}} 200 mm to 500 mm, thicker layers are able to be compacted using RDC.

In order to obtain a high strength modelling silty clay for use in centrifuge model tests of soil-pipeline interaction, direct shear tests, shear vane <b>tests</b> and <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted to investigate its shear strength behaviour. [...] This thesis first presents some background on the shear strength of soils and measurement techniques. The details of the direct shear tests, the shear vane <b>tests,</b> the <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>tests</b> and centrifuge modelling are also discussed. The silty clays used in this study were kaolin and a kaolin-silt mixture; the plasticity indices were 30. 6 % and 19. 5 % respectively. The kaolin-silt mixture (K-S) was obtained by mixing equal amounts of kaolin and silt by weight. [...] Direct shear and shear vane tests were conducted on both clays at different vertical stresses under various overconsolidation ratios (OCR's). This thesis presents these test procedures and the <b>test</b> results. <b>Cone</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>tests</b> were also conducted in a centrifuge at 50 gravities to verify the results from the direct shear and shear vane tests and to correlate the <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> resistance to the undrained shear strength from shear vane and direct shear tests. Centrifuge modelling principles and the current methods to convert cone tip resistance to shear strength are also presented.

Shear strengths of heavily overconsolidated clays obtained from the shear vane tests are higher than those obtained from the direct shear tests.
