50|$|The <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> <b>{{tarantula}}</b> is {{a medium}} size tarantula with a leg span of approximately 13 cm (5 in). The <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tarantula</b> is {{noted for its}} iridescent blue legs and light gray prosoma and opisthosoma, the latter of which may contain darker gray chevrons. Males and females look the same until the ultimate (final) molt of the males. At this point the male will exhibit sexual dimorphism {{in the form of}} a light tan or bronze coloration and legginess. Additionally males will gain a palpal bulb on the pedipalps and tibial apophyses (mating hooks). The female will eventually become larger than the male and live years longer. The <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tarantula</b> is a fossorial species and spends nearly all of its time in deep burrows of its own construction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> is a blue pigment made by {{sintering}} cobalt(II) oxide with alumina at 1200 °C. Chemically, <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> pigment is cobalt(II) oxide-aluminium oxide, or cobalt(II) aluminate, CoAl2O4. <b>Cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> {{is lighter}} and less intense than the (iron-cyanide based) pigment Prussian blue. It is extremely stable and {{has historically been}} used as a coloring agent in ceramics (especially Chinese porcelain), jewelry, and paint. Transparent glasses are tinted with the silica-based cobalt pigment smalt.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> in impure forms {{had long}} been used in Chinese porcelain, but it was {{independently}} discovered as a pure alumina-based pigment by Louis Jacques Thénard in 1802.

The leading world manufacturer of <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> in the 19th century was Benjamin Wegner's Norwegian company Blaafarveværket, ("blue colour works" [...] in Dano-Norwegian).

40|$|<b>Cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> pigment {{has been}} used to {{decorate}} ceramics as early as the New Kingdom (the 16 th century BC - 11 th century BC) in ancient Egypt. The blue decoration ceramics have re-flourished since the Islamic Abbasid dynasty (750 AD- 1258 AD). The large quantity Abbasid overglaze painted earthenware used the <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> for decoration. In the same period, the ceramics with <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> painting decoration also appeared in Chinese Tang dynasty (618 AD- 907 AD). It is a great innovation in Chinese ceramic history since the aesthetic taste of Chinese ceramics was influenced by jade culture and consequently the monochrome decorative style was appreciated. The blue-and-white porcelain declined when Tang dynasty collapsed. However, the blue decoration ceramics has developed continuously in the Islamic lands. The <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> were decorated on Minai wares, Lustre wares, underglaze painting wares and tiles from iz" to 19 th centuries. The Chinese Blue-and-white porcelain re-blossomed in the Yuan dynasty (1271 - 1368 AD) in China. It gradually became the main stream product in Chinese ceramics industry during the is" - 17 th century. Large quantities blue-and-white porcelains were exported to West Asia and further to Europe during the Ming (1368 - 1644 AD) and Qing (1644 - 1911) dynasties. This thesis mainly focuses on the chemical composition of the <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> used on Islamic and Chinese ceramics and then the provenance, manufacturing process and the spread route of the <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> were discussed base on the composition analysis. The research includes the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) experiments and the ancient literature analysis. The chemical composition of the <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> pigment was obtained by the XRF examination and then the mineral of raw cobalt ores and further its provenance was discussed. The manufacture process and the trading route of the <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> were also discussed through comparing the previous scholars blue ceramics and glasses results and analyzing the ancient literature. Based on the scientific experiments, the seven groups of <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> for Islamic ceramics and glasses were summarized. Each of the groups has the distinctive compositionaJ distribution. Meanwhile, there are two main cobalt sources for Islamic ceramics and glasses in history, which are Persian Kashan sulaimani and German Schneeberg smalt. Most of the blue groups were originated from the two main cobalt sources. The different compositional distribution is due to the different manufacture processes. The <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain was depended on import in the early period. However, the imported <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> could not meet the demand when the Chinese blue-and-white porcelain industry rose in the is" century. The manufacture had to use the Chinese local cobalt ores since the is" century. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
