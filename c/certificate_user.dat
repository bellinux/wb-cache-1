This paper provides a PKI equivalent of these basic bootstrap services that provides automatic, transparent configuration and setup of certificate information, with the user needing to supply no more than their user name and password.

Even though implementation of such E-Certificate have been implemented around the globe, it has not been implemented for workshops in UiTM. User who owes an E-Certificate is able to retrieve from a web page and can be printed out. In order to handle the integrity issue, each certificate must be digitally signed by a signatory, and equivalent to hand signature. Digital Signature was encrypted by RSA Algorithm, a very powerful asymmetrical encryption. The system consist of a central database and organized into web page application which can be accessed by system admin, <b>certificate</b> <b>user,</b> and employer. In order to maintain the integrity of the E-Certificate, employers are allowed to verify the certificate in a specially made webpage to authenticate it.

The application was programmed by JAVA FX. The system was developed stage by stage as it is consist of many small components to form a large system.

Security is the heart of IT revolution and more specifically user authentication and key establishment are the rudimentary services in secure communications. Though many systems, schemes bank on public key digital <b>certificate</b> <b>user</b> authentication and key establishment, failed in getting authenticated due to some forgery attacks. Public key Digital certificate though gained popularity in the public key infrastructure (PKI) in providing authentication to user public key, itself cannot be used to safeguard an authenticate user. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using GDC for user authentication and key establishment. A GDC is a kind of Digital Certificate which contains user’s public information and Digital signature which is issued and signed by the trusted Certificate Authority. The advantage of GDC is that, unlike the public key Digital Certificate, it does not contain user’s public key. So, the digital signature can never be revealed to the verifier and this is where a digital signature of GDC becomes a security factor {{that can be used for}} user authentication. Using this phenomenon, we have implemented a Discrete Logarithm Protocol which satisfies in achieving user authentication and secret key establishment. In addition to this, by using the shared-secret key, we have also exchanged the data between the entities through AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) o...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. PKIs {{are complex}} {{distributed}} {{systems that are}} responsible for giving users enough information to make reasonable trust judgments about one another. Since the currencies of PKI are trust and <b>certificates,</b> <b>users</b> who make trust decisions (often called relying parties) must do so using only some initial trust beliefs about the PKI and some pile of certificates (and other assertions) they received from the PKI. Given a certificate, a relying party needs to conclude that the keyholder described by the certificate actually possesses the properties described by the certificate. In this paper, we present a calculus that allows relying parties to make such trust judgements. Our calculus extends Maurer’s deterministic model, and is focused on real world issues such as time, revocation, delegation, and heterogeneous certificate formats. We then demonstrate how our calculus can be used to reason about numerous situations that arise in practice. ...|$|R

Our main objective is to study {{one of the most}} recent security issue, discovered in the well-known OpenSSL cryptographic software library, named “the Heartbleed Bug”. This is a serious vulnerability of the Heartbeat Extension for the transport layer security protocols (TLS/DTLS) implementation in OpenSSL. This weakness allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (secret keys used for X. 509 <b>certificates,</b> <b>user</b> credentials, instant messages, emails and other critical documents and communication) for applications such as web, email, instant messaging and some virtual private networks, which should be protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS encryption. Further, “Cupid”, shows that the bug can be used, with the same effect, against any device which implies Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication mechanisms and a vulnerable version of OpenSSL. In addition we present guidelines, fixes and methods for preventing and managing possible attacks against vulnerable systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} a monopolistic {{certifying}} party can have incentives to disclose revealing information about the agent he is certifying. Using a three-person gametheoretic model and allowing <b>certificate</b> <b>users</b> (buyers) to have noisy estimates of the quality level of the agent being certified (seller), a disclosure {{in the form of}} ordered ranking of levels is predicted. This contrasts with previous results in certification theory stating that monopolistic certifiers disclose a minimum amount of information (with no informational value) about the party being certified, in order to extract all informational rents from the market. The predicted disclosure is consistent with real life observations of certification disclosure as found in debt ratings (notches) and hotels listings (using a discrete system of stars). The model is robust enough to explain the results of previous models.

40|$|To {{decide whether}} or not to trust a <b>certificate</b> of a <b>user,</b> the {{certification}} path from the root CA (RCA) to the end CA (ECA) should be verified together with the <b>user</b> <b>certificate</b> itself. Because CAs are a kind of stable and responsible entities, path validation can be treated in a special way different from the veri cation of end <b>user</b> <b>certificates.</b> In this paper we propose two efficient offline path validation schemes using trusted entities. In the first scheme, ECA has additional role of executing the path validation operation by himself and publishing the result as a self path validation statement (SPVS). In the second scheme, a trusted server executes the path validation operations for all CAs in the domain of RCA and publishes the result as a revoked CA certificate list (RCACL). End users can skip path validation operation if he can trust SPVS or RCACL. We discuss the efficiency and trust issues of proposed schemes compared with previous ones...|$|R
