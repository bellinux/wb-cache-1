2500|$|The T1E5, {{introduced}} {{around the}} same time as the T1E4, was yet another conversion of a T1E1, in this case with a new steering system. All previous T1 versions used a simple <b>clutch-brake</b> steering system which led to a loss of power while turning. The T1E5 replaced this with a controlled differential steering system from the Cleveland Tractor Company (a so-called [...] "Cletrac" [...] system). The engine was also replaced with the same [...] version as in the T1E4. Testing showed the controlled differential steering to be clearly superior to the <b>clutch-brake</b> system, and the Ordnance Department recommended its use for all tracked vehicles that could exceed [...]|$|E
50|$|These {{mechanisms}} {{were found}} in some types of synchronous-motor-driven electric clocks. Many different types of synchronous clock motors were used, including the pre-World War II Hammond manual-start clocks. Some types of self-starting synchronous motors always started when power was applied, but in detail, their behaviour was chaotic and they were equally likely to start rotating in the wrong direction. Coupled to the rotor by one (or possibly two) stages of reduction gearing was a wrap-spring <b>clutch-brake.</b> The spring did not rotate. One end was fixed; the other was free. It rode freely but closely on the rotating member, part of the clock's gear train. The <b>clutch-brake</b> locked up when rotated backwards, but also had some spring action. The inertia of the rotor going backwards engaged the clutch and wound the spring. As it unwound, it restarted the motor in the correct direction. Some designs had no explicit spring as suchâ€”but were simply compliant mechanisms. The mechanism was lubricated and wear did not present a problem.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{casualties in}} the engineering plant while {{on the east coast}} of Chile, the crew had to repair in place the pneumatic <b>clutch-brake</b> assemblies on the two forward gas turbine engines, the second repair having to be completed at sea en route Montevideo, Uruguay. Once in port, the damaged LM-2500 Gas Turbine Main Engine was replaced in 82 hours, using a large floating crane in the port facility.|$|E
50|$|Some {{commercial}} applications use non-synchronized manual transmissions {{that require}} a skilled operator. Depending on the country, many local, regional, and national laws govern operation {{of these types of}} vehicles (see Commercial Driver's License). This class may include commercial, military, agricultural, or engineering vehicles. Some of these may use combinations of types for multi-purpose functions. An example is a power take-off (PTO) gear. The non-synchronous transmission type requires an understanding of gear range, torque, engine power, and multi-functional clutch and shifter functions. Also see Double-clutching, and <b>Clutch-brake</b> sections of the main article. Float shifting is the process of shifting gears without using the clutch.|$|E

40|$|New {{developments}} in solid-state electronics {{applied to the}} Centrifugal Fast Analyzer {{have resulted in a}} prototype portable instrument with several unique improvements, yielding expanded analytical versatility and the capability to operate from 110 V ac or a rechargeable battery pack. The analyzer, contained in an 47 X 28 X 30 cm box and weighing 25. 4 kg, utilizes a self-contained microprocessor to control some analyzerfunctions as well as to perform data acquisition and analysis. Hardcopy output is produced by an integral thermal printer. Several analysis options are available, including determination of reaction rate. by linear regression analysis. Temperature is controlled at one of three set points (25, 30, or 37 #{ 176 }C) by means of a thermo-electric heat pump located in the rotor holder.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to analyse the {{physical}} properties of the systemic arterial circulation by a standard engineering approach (transient analysis). This involved giving a square wave infusion of blood and interpretation of the pressure response. Development of a technique to give a square wave infusion of blood was required. This resulted in an infusion-giving apparatus which was composed essentially of a syringe whose action was controlled by a large, servo-controlled motor. The square wave effect was achieved by an electro-magnetic <b>clutch-brake</b> combination. The latter was capable of full activation within a 30 millisecond time interval. The whole apparatus was able to give a perfect square wave within the tolerance of these limits. Approximately 5 % of the animals blood volume was slowly withdrawn into the infusion giving apparatus through a cannula in the right carotid artery. On activation of the electro-magnetic clutch, this blood was returned to the rabbit {{in the form of a}} square wave over a 2 - 3 second period. During this period, the heart was transiently arrested by vagus nerve stimulation. The pressure response of the arterial system to this square wave infusion of known flow rate was monitored in the right femoral artery with a pressure transducer. By relating the input flow pattern to the output pressure response, information could be obtained about the physical properties of the system. Direct pressure-flow studies across the whole systemic arterial circulation were found to be linear in the range of 90 to 40 mm Hg pressure. A 'critical closing pressure' was invariably present, and found to vary in value from 10 to 50 mm Hg. This necessitated a modification in the normal method of calculating total peripheral resistance to account for the true slope of the pressure-flow plot (herein called 'slope' resistance). It was found that the mean chord resistance value in a 5 to 6 lb. rabbit was approximately twice the magnitude of the mean slope resistance value (0. 33 to 0. 17 mm Hg/ml/min). Furthermore, these did not always vary in the same direction when a variety of different stresses were imposed on the circulation. Compliance value calculations demonstrated a hysteresis effect. The mean compliance value of the systemic arterial circulation in a 5 - 6 lb. rabbit measured during inflation was 0. 037 ml/mm Hg: measured during deflation, it was 0. 054 ml/mm Hg. There was good correlation between the compliance values measured by the square wave infusion method and by a method using excised lengths of aorta. An inertial component was found to be present which had an approximate mean value of 30 gm cm- 4 in 5 - 6 lb. rabbits. The general response of the systemic arterial circulation to square wave infusion showed that it could primarily be considered to act as a linear first order system. The transient pressure response to a step function in flow was a single exponential curve with a mean of 509 msecs in inflation and 743 msecs in deflation. More exact modelling required consideration of the systemic arterial circulation as a third order system to account for the small inertial component. An electrical model was built whose response to a simulated square wave infusion of fluid, gave good correspondence to that obtained in the living rabbit. The correlation coefficient between cardiac output values measured by the square wave infusion technique and by the Fick method was + 0. 80. The effects of various CO 2 concentrations, asphyxia, haemorrhage, nor-adrenalin infusion, and long-term cholesterol feeding on the rabbit systemic arterial circulation were investigated by this method...|$|E
