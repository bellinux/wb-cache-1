40|$|The genus Musa is not {{native to}} Africa. It evolved in {{tropical}} Asia, from southwest India eastward {{to the island}} of New Guinea. There is a growing circumstantial evidence {{which suggests that the}} East African Highland banana and the tropical lowland plantain were cultivated on the African continent since before 1 AD. It is also probable that ABB cooking and AB and AAB dessert cultivars were brought to the continent from India by Arabian traders from 600 AD, and that these were disseminated throughout East Africa. During the colonial era, the main centres of distribution for banana cultivars were botanical gardens, such as Zomba in Malawi, Entebbe in Uganda and Amani in Tanzania. It appears that the very early introductions of Highland banana and plantain arrived in Africa as a relatively clean material without the conspicuous pests and diseases that affect them in Asia. In contrast, several devastating problems now impact the crop in Africa, including nematodes, the borer weevil and diseases, most notably banana bunchy top, banana streak, Sigatoka leaf spots, Xanthomonas wilt and Fusarium wilt. We (a) provide <b>chronological</b> <b>overviews</b> of the first reports/observations of different Musa pests and pathogens/diseases in Africa, (b) highlight specific examples of when a pest or pathogen/disease was introduced via planting materials and (c) give recent examples of how the pests and pathogens spread to new regions via planting materials.

The transition from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic in Europe {{has been described as}} a radical shift from an economy dominated by marine resources to one solely dependent on farming. Both the occurrence and the geographical extent of such a drastic shift can be questioned, however. It is therefore important to start out at a more detailed level of evidence in order to present the overall picture, and to account for the variability even in such regional or <b>chronological</b> <b>overviews.</b> Fifteen Stone Age sites were included in this study, ranging chronologically from the Early Mesolithic to the Middle or Late Neolithic, c. 8300 – 2500 BC, and stretching geographically from the westernmost coast of Sweden to the easternmost part of Latvia within the confines of latitudes 55 – 59 ° N. The most prominent sites in terms of the number of human and faunal samples analysed are Zvejnieki, Västerbjers and Skateholm I–II. Human and faunal skeletal remains were subjected to stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to study diet and ecology at the sites. Stable isotope analyses of human remains provide quantitative information on the relative importance of various food sources, an important addition to the qualitative data supplied by certain artefacts and structures or by faunal or botanical remains. A vast number of new radiocarbon dates were also obtained. In conclusion, a rich diversity in Stone Age dietary practice in the Baltic Region was demonstrated. Evidence ranging from the Early Mesolithic to the Late Neolithic show that neither chronology nor location alone can account for this variety, but that there are inevitably cultural factors as well. Food habits are culturally governed, and therefore we cannot automatically assume that people at similar sites will have the same diet. Stable isotope studies are very important here, since they tell us what people actually consumed, not only what was available, or what one single meal contained. We should not be deceived in inferring diet from ritually deposited remains, since things that were mentally important were not always important in daily life. Thus, although a ritual and symbolic norm may emphasize certain food categories, these may in fact contribute very little to the diet. By the progress of analysis of intra-individual variation, new data on life history changes have been produced, revealing mobility patterns, breastfeeding behaviour and certain dietary transitions. The inclusion of faunal data has proved invaluable for understanding the stable isotope ecology of a site, and thereby improve the precision of the interpretations of human stable isotope data. The special case of dogs, though, demonstrates that these animals are not useful for inferring human diet, since, due to the number of roles they possess in human society, dogs could deviate significantly from humans in their diet, and in several cases have been proved to do so. When evaluating radiocarbon data derived from human and animal remains from the Pitted-Ware site of Västerbjers on Gotland, the importance of establishing the stable isotope ecology of the site before making deductions on reservoir effects was further demonstrated. The main aim of this thesis has been to demonstrate the variation and diversity in human practices, challenging the view of a “monolithic” Stone Age. By looking at individuals and not only at populations, the whole range of human behaviour has been accounted for, also revealing discrepancies between norm and practice, which are frequently visible both in the archaeological record and in present-day human behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Degenerative disc {{disease is}} one of the most {{frequently}} encountered spinal disorders. The intervertebral disc is a complex anatomic and functional structure, which makes the development of an efficient and reliable artificial disc a complex challenge. Not only is the disc function arduous to reproduce, but there are important consequences associated with the conception and the choice of materials that will have to bear the loads. Biochemical problems have complicated things even more. Two different principles have been applied in the realisation of a discal replacement: a metallic and/or polyethylene prosthesis allowing mainly mobility or a prosthesis enabling the reproduction of viscoelastic properties. Of course some devices attempt to combine both principles. In this paper we will try to present, in <b>chronological</b> order, an <b>overview</b> of the designs published in the literature as well as in the patents granted in this field. The very fact that such a long list of implants, based on highly varied principles, has been proposed, and that only very few have reached the level of animal models, let alone human implantation, clearly demonstrates how challenging the task of designing an intervertebral disc replacement is. Proper randomized controlled trials are now on the way, and should help in assessing the efficacy and real place of spine arthroplasty in the treatment of spinal disorders.

By drawing upon pertinent aspects of the fields of phenomenology, consciousness studies, cognitive neuroscience and play theory coupled with Csikszentmihalyi’s notion of ‘flow’, the study develops a lexicon of terminology with which to articulate and {{understand the nature of}} ‘absorption’ for the performer in the context of ‘dance theatre’. By developing a focused articulation of the actual nature of ‘absorption’ for the performer in performance, seen as necessary to an ‘optimal’ ‘mode of being/doing’, the study intends to contribute to the language of discourse in this area of performance studies, and, importantly become a useful resource for the enquiring performer and practitioner. Consequently, in developing an understanding of ‘absorption’ for the performer, in order to edge closer to articulating an ‘optimal’ ‘mode of being/doing’ for the performer, the work and actions of the performer remain the focus of the study. The study is anchored in practice through examination of the work of three companies working within the genealogy of ‘dance theatre’. This multi-company approach gives a <b>chronological</b> and genealogical <b>overview</b> of ‘dance theatre’ practices useful in understanding ‘absorption’ for the performer, whilst also facilitating examination of individual points of practice within that overview.

The United Kingdom's efforts {{in this field}} have always had close links with equivalent activities in the United States, and have often been conducted on a mutually co-operative basis. Through its description of these secret Anglo-American interactions, this study serves to highlight {{the degree to which}} the public debate in Britain over nuclear weapons has been conducted in a vacuum, as has American public policy-making over its nuclear links with the United Kingdom. This book contains descriptions of the technical evolution of British nuclear weapon designs and production models, estimates of annual output figures for fissile material and weapon types, and indications of the nature of the weapon-testing programme. Decision points are charted, such as the H-bomb development, and the factors that led to existing plans being changed are identified. The demonstrative nature of the programme until the late 1950 s is illustrated, together with the rapidity with which the stockpile targets were met at the turn of that decade. The impact of the agreements with the United States, both upon weapon development and production programmes and upon stockpiling is analysed, as well as their effects upon the nuclear submarine programme. The consequences of the mid- 1960 s termination of weapon development are discussed, as it the later decision to restart it for the Chevaline programme. The impact of these events upon Anglo-American relations is identified, together with the recent British attempts to move to a closer political association with Europe. The study concludes by evaluating the essential nature of four decades of United Kingdom military nuclear development, and identifying the practical limits imposed by past policies upon any attempt by a British government to implement a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the lacuna {{in the study}} of Greek terracotta figures and figurines corresponding to the transitional period between the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages (1200 - 700 BC). It provides a comprehensive synthesis of all available data, with particular reference to material from recently excavated sites in mainland Greece and its islands (Euboea, the Northern Aegean islands, the Dodecanese and the Cyclades). The study is framed according to the relationship between terracotta figures (those made on the potter's wheel) and figurines (those made by hand). The observation that the technological distinction between these two types is reflected in their different and separate functions has been sustained in scholarship for the past three decades, but only for the Mycenaean period. Handmade figurines and wheelmade figures occurred in different and restricted contexts in the Mycenaean world: the former in settlements, cemeteries and religious locations, and the latter exclusively in religious contexts. It is therefore inferred that they had different socially embedded values or 'meanings'. However, the extent to which such a distinction applies to figures and figurines in the Early Iron Age has hitherto not been explored. Initial evidence indicates that by the 8 th century, handmade figurines and wheelmade figures were deposited together at selected sites, suggesting that their inherent socially embedded meanings were the same, and that they represented "different levels of [financial] investment in what is essentially the same category of votive". This thesis therefore determines the levels of co-occurrence of wheelmade figures and figurines, thus identifying how distribution relates to usage. Changes are observed over time and space and between different types of functional contexts, and the meanings of these patterns are investigated. The results of this study provide a <b>chronological</b> and geographical <b>overview</b> of the distribution of figures and figurines, and also indicate that figures and figurines had consistently multivariate relevance in multiple types of contexts. The functional dichotomy of figures and figurines observed for the Mycenaean period cannot be sustained beyond 1200 BC. Moreover, study of the contexts from which the material originates indicates that the significance of secondary deposits of religious nature has been consistently overlooked, and that figures and figurines were used in an active and meaningful sense even during the act of their discard. This type of activity is a distinctive one that can be characterised and defined functionally, geographically, temporally and quantitatively. The socially embedded meaning of figures and figurines was fluid and related to an action being performed; their meaning was not linked exclusively to an aspect of the object itself, and was therefore not static.

40|$|The {{collective}} research project "Cultural {{components of the}} first pottery productions of the Early Bronze Age in Southeast France" derives from renewal of documentation on the Early Bronze Age in the southeast Rhodanian region and new approaches to the Bell Beaker period, particularly {{in the southern part}} of Southeast France. In 1998, the Riva del Garda conference constituted a high point in Bell Beaker research at a European scale, of which the consequences and questions motivated the collective project for an overview of the transition from the end of the Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age in a large southeastern quarter of France. In these regions, issues relating to the future of Bell Beaker cultures and the origin of the "Rhone civilization" and the Barbed-wire Beaker have most often been treated through examination of changes in the ceramics, metallurgical production more secondarily. Then, some cultural traits were examined locally in the aim of explaining these heritages between the Final Neolithic Bell Beaker and the Early Bronze Age, such as the symbolic foundations, architecture, the different forms of the subsistence economy and chronometry. Yet such research remained sporadic and showed a heterochrony in evolutionary dynamics for these different aspects. We have thus chosen to focus on ceramics for our analysis, which is by far the most abundant and of sufficiently broad geographic distribution to discriminate between the different cultural components playing a role in the establishment of Early Bronze Age productions along the Rhodanian axis, from the Alps to Auvergne and to the Mediterranean coast, between late manifestations of the Bell Beaker and the full Early Bronze Age, dated between ca. 2400 and 1800 BC. From the title, the term 'production' should be used in a restricted sense, no technological studies having been done, and those of the pottery concerning mainly recipients. A thematic separation was applied to isolate several descriptors for which analysis and combination of the different results enabled illustration of the geographic and cultural structures inferred during the first stages of the Early Bronze Age. The themes and research tools concern six fields: a chronometric overview provided by radiocarbon dates; morphological classification of recipients to differentiate the different cultural components involved in pottery making; detailed description of decorations made using the barbed wire technique and a classification of the different modes of execution based on the development of a specific descriptive terminology and a simple database; analysis of the decorative themes to identify the typological heritages from the Bell Beaker to the Early Bronze Age and finally, petrographic and microscopic analyses to cover the range of variability in ceramic containers. Another field considers the definition and place of the Rhodanian component. After a brief discussion of the initial research questions and a presentation of the regional chronocultural contexts, a summary of the radiocarbon dates helps to establish the temporal limits of the subject and the two phases of the Early Bronze Age considered, BzA 1 and Early BzA 2 a (fig. 4). The morphological and typological analytic data set for the pottery contains two categories of intrinsic descriptors: metric values and indices, and morphological criteria. Each is presented as a graphic synthesis. Forty-seven ceramic types were identified from the inventory of 188 profiles and 146 fragments for which the state of preservation permitted classification to typological group and often to type (fig. 7 - 9). Frequencies for each type, site or microregion grouping the lowest counts are represented by seriation in a contingency table that clearly isolates the earliest southern and Rhodanian components at each end of the graph (fig. 10). The middle of the table contained series in intermediate position, both geographically and chronologically (Early BzA 2 a). Seven typological units (A-F) can be isolated in the contingency table, most often corresponding to different productions preferentially concentrated in a defined geographic area. Following a discussion of the state of extraregional chronocultural divisions, the contribution of the different areas of this broad framework of understanding can be identified. In a <b>chronological</b> and geographic <b>overview,</b> we then return to typological issues and chronocultural heritages. The first point relates to the difficulties in applying the concept of the Rhone civilization and its rejection in the Southeast. This may appear too narrow, considering the cultural relationships demonstrated supraregionally, which put into play a Danube-Rhine-Rhone axis during the first phases of the Early Bronze Age, or too broad if we refer to specific details of the economic bases or the very particular circulation sphere of the metallic attributes of power. This situation clearly shows the multiplicity of components involved in the establishment of the two main units, medio-Rhodanian and southern, of the Early Bronze Age (fig. 26 - 29). The zones of influence are located from Bavaria to the Middle Danube and from the Po Plain to central-southern and continental Italy. Diffusion vectors are principally north and south alpine in the middle Rhone Valley, south alpine and Mediterranean in coastal regions. Based on the ceramic data, this large-scale cultural dynamic appears to have an effect on the development of local substrates in the middle Rhone Valley. One can thus speak of an eastern-Rhodanian Early Bronze Age. In Provence, the Bell Beaker component persists for a time, during the BzA 1, as shown by the survival into the Early Bronze Age of many decorative motifs and themes. The concept of Epi-Bell Beaker appears to maintain an operational value and we can keep the term Epi-Bell Beaker Early Bronze Age, with several post- or peri-Bell Beaker vectors of different geographic origins. Next, during the Early Bronze Age A 2 a, a northern impact is more marked, corresponding to a Rhodanian cultural transgression itself appearing somewhat more detached from eastern influxes. It is possible, on as yet provisional foundations, that the eastern Languedoc participated earlier in this Rhodanian circle of influence, spread via Auvergne and the southern margins of the Massif Central since the BzA 1, with some eastern markers. Unique geographic characteristics have been noted, such as the pivotal role played by the Vaucluse/Drôme/Ardèche limit in the spread of southern components, especially barbed-wire pottery, from the eastern Languedoc region and Provence toward lower Auvergne. This axis seems to have benefited, or taken into account, the location of a different entity in the middle Rhone Valley that also had a strong identity. Conversely, but at a much more reduced scale, the uniqueness of productions result from attempts to combine different support forms, decorative themes and the different modalities of variables summarized in the kinds of barbed-wire pottery. Rules proper to each descriptive criterion lead to rare preferential combinations, which however, remain partial (fig. 46). Petrographic analyses are pertinent to both the origin of the clays used and the kinds of particles that are added as temper. The sample includes 651 units, 98 to complete the earlier Bell Beaker data set and 553 for pottery from the Early Bronze Age. Raw material procurement took place most often within a radius of seven kilometers and reflects opportunistic acquisition, which is supported by the values obtained from ethnographic research. The very high variability in the petrographic groups identified reflects productions that are entirely independent or nearly so, confirming observations made following unproductive attempts to identify recurrent typological combinations. The introduction of added temper based on rules varying by region, going from the continued use of grog in some zones (Vaunage, Rhodanian Vaucluse) to the exclusive use of carbonates in others, during the BzA 1. During the Early BzA 2 a, the return to an earlier southern trait from the Final Neolithic is observed, with the widespread use of crushed carbonates in the pastes (fig. 176 and 178). A high degree of freedom of execution is thus imparted, corresponding to a structure of production that does not appear to go beyond domestic use. However, petrographic analyses clearly identify the circulation of some pottery or groups of recipients over distances ranging from a ten to sixty kilometers. The most important transfers take place in the middle Rhone Valley, from the right bank to the left of the river and to the base of the Pre-Alps. Such mobility of products and people also shows the spread of certain forms and decorations. It likely results from necessities linked to economic activities, discovery contexts in caves suggesting the possibility of the movement of relatively few individuals in the context of pastoral activities. Finally, the spatio-temporal structure and conditions for the establishment of cultures at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age can be addressed. During the BzA 1, a north-south partition between Rhodanian and southern entities is paralleled in the Midi by the existence of a mosaic of different zones that appear to reflect Neolithic cultures in central Provence, prolong earlier traits in Vaunage or, toward the southwest, be receptive to the Rhodanian influence (fig. 190). During the Early BzA 2 a, the north-south distinction still exists, but at a lower hierarchical level within a single entity of Rhodanian origin. The different themes developed throughout our research ultimately lead to an adjustment of the title to better reflect the contributions of this work: Cultural components and initial pottery productions during the Early Bronze Age in Southeast France. In conclusion, different questions are raised, whether generalized or not, during the Early Bronze|$|R
