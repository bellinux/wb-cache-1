5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or <b>chemosynthesis.</b> Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E
5|$|Within the abyssal and hadal zones, {{the areas}} around {{submarine}} hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have {{by far the}} greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area. Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic, halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such {{as those of the}} sulfide-oxidizing Beggiatoa genus), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of <b>chemosynthesis</b> is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis. These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, eelpouts, galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700meters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the deep}} sea, {{hydrothermal}} vents and cold seeps {{with high levels}} of hydrogen sulfide are home to a number of extremely specialized lifeforms, ranging from bacteria to fish. Because of the absence of light at these depths, these ecosystems rely on <b>chemosynthesis</b> rather than photosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|The first type of {{organism}} to {{take advantage}} of this deep-sea energy source is bacteria. Aggregating into bacterial mats at cold seeps, these bacteria metabolize methane and hydrogen sulfide (another gas that emerges from seeps) for energy. This process of obtaining energy from chemicals is known as <b>chemosynthesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|It thrives at 70°C (158°F), but {{can survive}} at {{temperatures}} of 50°C to 80°C (122°F to 176°F). This bacterium is a chemotroph—it performs <b>chemosynthesis</b> to obtain food. However, since its {{range of temperature}} overlaps somewhat {{with that of the}} photosynthetic cyanobacteria that share its ideal environment, it is sometimes found living jointly with its neighbors, obtaining energy for growth from their photosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|Finally, as cold seeps become inactive, tubeworms also {{start to}} disappear, {{clearing}} the way for corals to settle on the now exposed carbonate substrate. The corals do not rely on hydrocarbons seeping out of the seafloor. Studies on Lophelia pertusa suggest they derive their nutrition primarily from the ocean surface. <b>Chemosynthesis</b> plays only a very small role, if any, in their settlement and growth. While deepwater corals {{do not seem to be}} chemosynthesis-based organisms, the chemosynthetic organisms that come before them enable the corals' existence. This hypothesis about establishment of deep water coral reefs is called hydraulic theory.|$|E
25|$|These tall {{sulphide}} chimneys (hydrothermal vents) host some unique ecological communities. While most of {{the deep}} sea depends on near-surface productivity with photosynthesis as its fundamental energy source, vent communities are completely independent from the surface and sunlight. Bacteria are able to use reduced compounds from the vent effluent as an energy source (<b>chemosynthesis).</b> These bacteria can be free-living or symbiotic and are {{the base of the}} food web of these communities where 90% of the species are endemic to this special environment. The tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae grows in large colonies in diffuse venting areas, supported by the symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria developing in their cells. These worms have no mouth and rely on their internal symbiotic bacteria to survive. Other species living within hydrothermal communities include limpets, worms (scale worms and sulphide worms), fish, and sea spiders.|$|E
25|$|Chemosynthetic {{communities}} thrive where cold fluids seep {{out of the}} forearc. Cold seep {{communities have}} been discovered in inner trench slopes down to depths of 7000 m in the western Pacific, especially around Japan, in the Eastern Pacific along North, Central and South America coasts from the Aleutian to the Peru–Chile trenches, on the Barbados prism, in the Mediterranean, and in the Indian Ocean along the Makran and Sunda convergent margins. These communities receive much less attention than the chemosynthetic communities associated with hydrothermal vents. Chemosynthetic communities are located {{in a variety of}} geological settings: above over-pressured sediments in accretionary prisms where fluids are expelled through mud volcanoes or ridges (Barbados, Nankai and Cascadia); along active erosive margins with faults; and along escarpments caused by debris slides (Japan trench, Peruvian margin). Surface seeps may be linked to massive hydrate deposits and destabilization (e.g. Cascadia margin). High concentrations of methane and sulfide in the fluids escaping from the seafloor are the principal energy sources for <b>chemosynthesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Size is not {{the only}} factor in making red dwarfs {{potentially}} unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it would never see the sun. On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. Photosynthesis as we understand it would be {{complicated by the fact that}} a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the infrared, and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on <b>chemosynthesis</b> rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves toward the sun, deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a day-night cycle, including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given radiation level.|$|E
500|$|Hydrothermal vents {{were first}} {{discovered}} in the ocean depths in 1977. They result from seawater becoming heated after seeping through cracks to places where hot magma {{is close to the}} seabed. The under-water hot springs may gush forth at temperatures of over [...] and support unique communities of organisms in their immediate vicinity. The basis for this teeming life is <b>chemosynthesis,</b> a process by which microbes convert such substances as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia into organic molecules. These bacteria and Archaea are the primary producers in these ecosystems and support a diverse array of life. About 350 species of organism, dominated by molluscs, polychaete worms and crustaceans, had been discovered around hydrothermal vents {{by the end of the}} twentieth century, most of them being new to science and endemic to these habitats.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless of its source, {{this energy}} {{is used to}} {{synthesize}} complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). [...] The following two equations are simplified representations of photosynthesis (top) and (one form of) <b>chemosynthesis</b> (bottom): ...|$|E
2500|$|Gross primary {{production}} (GPP) {{is the amount}} of chemical energy as biomass that primary producers create in a given length of time. (GPP is sometimes confused with Gross Primary productivity, which is the rate at which photosynthesis or <b>chemosynthesis</b> occurs.) Some fraction of this fixed energy is used by primary producers for cellular respiration and maintenance of existing tissues (i.e., [...] "growth respiration" [...] and [...] "maintenance respiration"). The remaining fixed energy (i.e., mass of photosynthate) is referred to as net {{primary production}} (NPP).|$|E
2500|$|Following on from {{chemical}} evolution {{came the}} initiation of biological evolution, {{which led to the}} first cells. No one has yet synthesized a [...] "protocell" [...] using basic components with the necessary properties of life (the so-called [...] "bottom-up-approach"). Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to focus on <b>chemosynthesis.</b> However, some researchers work in this field, notably Steen Rasmussen and Jack W. Szostak. Others have argued that a [...] "top-down approach" [...] is more feasible. One such approach, successfully attempted by Craig Venter and others at J. Craig Venter Institute, involves engineering existing prokaryotic cells with progressively fewer genes, attempting to discern at which point the most minimal requirements for life are reached.|$|E
2500|$|In ecology, primary {{production}} is {{the synthesis of}} organic compounds from atmospheric or aqueous carbon dioxide. [...] It principally occurs {{through the process of}} photosynthesis, which uses light as its source of energy, but it also occurs through <b>chemosynthesis,</b> which uses the oxidation or reduction of inorganic chemical compounds as its source of energy. [...] Almost all life on Earth relies directly or indirectly on {{primary production}}. The organisms responsible for primary production are known as primary producers or autotrophs, and form the base of the food chain. In terrestrial ecoregions, these are mainly plants, while in aquatic ecoregions algae predominate in this role. Ecologists distinguish primary production as either net or gross, the former accounting for losses to processes such as cellular respiration, the latter not.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1970s, {{life was}} thought to depend on its access to {{sunlight}}. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was believed to obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the Galapagos Rift in the deep-sea exploration submersible Alvin, scientists discovered colonies of assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as black smokers. [...] It was soon determined that the basis for this food chain {{is a form of}} bacterium that derives its energy from oxidation of reactive chemicals, such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, that bubble up from the Earth's interior. This <b>chemosynthesis</b> revolutionized the study of biology by revealing that terrestrial life need not be Sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1970s, {{life was}} thought to be entirely {{dependent}} on energy from the Sun. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from sunlight to photosynthesize sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process that is then consumed by oxygen-respiring organisms, passing their energy up the food chain. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, {{was thought to}} obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did. The [...] world's ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to sunlight. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the Galapagos Rift in the deep-sea exploration submersible Alvin, scientists discovered colonies of giant tube worms, clams, crustaceans, mussels, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as black smokers. These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprise an entirely independent ecosystem. Although most of these multicellular lifeforms need dissolved oxygen (produced by oxygenic photosynthesis) for their aerobic cellular respiration and thus are not completely independent from sunlight by themselves, the basis for their food chain is a form of bacterium that derives its energy from oxidization of reactive chemicals, such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, that bubble up from the Earth's interior. Other lifeforms entirely decoupled from the energy from sunlight are green sulphur bacteria which are capturing geothermal light for anoxygenic photosynthesis or bacteria running chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium. This <b>chemosynthesis</b> revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life need not be sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that <b>chemosynthesis</b> may support life {{below the surface}} of Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, and other planets. <b>Chemosynthesis</b> may have also been the first type of metabolism that evolved on Earth, leading the way for cellular respiration and photosynthesis to develop later.|$|E

50|$|A 2004 {{television}} series hosted by Bill Nye named <b>chemosynthesis</b> {{as one of}} the 100 greatest scientific discoveries of all time.|$|E
50|$|In biochemistry, <b>chemosynthesis</b> is the {{biological}} conversion {{of one or}} more carbon-containing molecules (usually carbon dioxide or methane) and nutrients into organic matter using the oxidation of inorganic compounds (e.g., hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide) or methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight, as in photosynthesis. Chemoautotrophs, organisms that obtain carbon through <b>chemosynthesis,</b> are phylogenetically diverse, but also groups that include conspicuous or biogeochemically-important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing gamma and epsilon proteobacteria, the aquificaeles, the methanogenic archaea and the neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria.|$|E
50|$|In chemolithotrophs, the {{compounds}} - the electron donors - are oxidized in the cell, and the electrons are channeled into respiratory chains, ultimately producing ATP. The electron acceptor can be oxygen (in aerobic bacteria), but {{a variety of}} other electron acceptors, organic and inorganic, are also used by various species. Some lithotrophs produce organic compounds from carbon dioxide in a process called <b>chemosynthesis,</b> much as plants do in photosynthesis. Plants use energy from sunlight to drive carbon dioxide fixation, since both water and carbon dioxide are low in energy. By contrast, the hydrogen compounds used in <b>chemosynthesis</b> are high in energy, so <b>chemosynthesis</b> can take place in the absence of sunlight (e.g., around a hydrothermal vent). Other lithotrophs are able to directly utilize inorganic substances, e.g., iron, hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, or thiosulfate, for some or all of their energy needs.|$|E
50|$|The {{three main}} sources of energy and {{nutrients}} for deep sea communities are marine snow, whale falls, and <b>chemosynthesis</b> at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.|$|E
50|$|Many {{microorganisms}} in dark {{regions of}} the oceans also and use <b>chemosynthesis</b> to produce biomass from single carbon molecules. Two categories can be distinguished. In the rare sites at which hydrogen molecules (H2) are available, the energy available from the reaction between CO2 and H2 (leading to production of methane, CH4) can {{be large enough to}} drive the production of biomass. Alternatively, in most oceanic environments, energy for <b>chemosynthesis</b> derives from reactions in which substances such as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia are oxidized. This may occur with or without the presence of oxygen.|$|E
50|$|In {{most cases}} of {{biosynthesis}} and <b>chemosynthesis,</b> flake ice {{is used to}} control the reaction rate and maintain the liveness. Flake ice is sanitary, clean with rapid temperature reduction effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chemosynthesis</b> is carbon {{fixation}} {{driven by the}} oxidation of inorganic substances (e.g., hydrogen gas or hydrogen sulfide). Sulfur- and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria often use the Calvin cycle or the reductive citric acid cycle.|$|E
50|$|Buckminster Fuller first {{described}} the concept in his 1970 paper Cosmic Costing, contrasting the photosynthesis on which natural capital and sustainable infrastructural capital depend, with the <b>chemosynthesis</b> of extracting and using fossil fuels.|$|E
5000|$|... {{instead of}} {{releasing}} oxygen gas as in photosynthesis, the process produces solid globules of sulfur. In bacteria capable of <b>chemosynthesis,</b> such as purple sulfur bacteria, yellow globules of sulfur are present and {{visible in the}} cytoplasm.|$|E
50|$|Sulfate-reducing bacteria, some {{anaerobic}} microorganisms, such {{as those}} living in sediment or near deep sea thermal vents, use the reduction of sulfates coupled with the oxidation of organic compounds or hydrogen as an energy source for <b>chemosynthesis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Regardless of its source, {{this energy}} {{is used to}} {{synthesize}} complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O).

50|$|<b>Chemosynthesis</b> of {{bacteria}} provide {{the energy and}} organic matter for the whole food web in vent ecosystems. Giant tube worms can grow to 2.4 m tall because of the richness of nutrients. Over 300 new species have been discovered at hydrothermal vents.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{production}} is {{the synthesis of}} new organic material from inorganic molecules such as H2O and CO2. It {{is dominated by the}} process of photosynthesis which uses sunlight to synthesise organic molecules such as sugars, although <b>chemosynthesis</b> represents a small fraction of primary production.|$|E

Because of the absence of light at these depths, these ecosystems rely on <b>chemosynthesis</b> rather than photosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{production}} {{refers to}} the production of organic matter, i.e., chemically bound energy, through processes such as photosynthesis and <b>chemosynthesis.</b> The organic matter produced by primary producers forms the basis of all food webs. Further, it generates oxygen (O2), a molecule necessary to sustain animals and humans.|$|E

50|$|Plankton inhabit oceans, seas, lakes, ponds. Local {{abundance}} varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The {{primary cause}} of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy (but see <b>chemosynthesis),</b> confining primary production to surface waters, and to geographical regions and seasons having abundant light.|$|E
50|$|The ocean {{provides}} special marine environments {{inhabited by}} extremophiles that thrive under unusual conditions of temperature, pressure, and darkness. Such environments include black smokers and cold seeps {{on the ocean}} floor, with entire ecosystems of organisms that have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria and hydrocarbon compounds that provided energy through a process called <b>chemosynthesis.</b>|$|E
