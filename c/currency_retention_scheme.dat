40|$|The central {{issues with}} which {{this study is}} {{concerned}} revolve around the major determinants of agricultural export instability in Nigeria. Specifically, the study {{examined the relationship between}} oil export and the agricultural export performance in Nigeria. In trying to achieve this objective, an ordinary least square multiple regression approach was adopted for the data analysis. Some statistical tools were employed to determine the statistical significant relationship between these variables. The analysis started with the test of stationarity and co-integration of Nigeria’s time series data. The empirical study found that the data were stationary and co integrated. The multiple regression results showed a significant but negative relationship between oil export and the agricultural export performance in Nigeria. These results were robust to a number of econometric specifications. Our findings and conclusion support the need for the government to diversify the oil sector and encourage agriculture through incentives to farmers, mechanization and positive policy measures. In complement of the above, {{it is important for the}} government to consolidate and maintain export incentives comprising a duty draw-back scheme, explicit export bonuses, <b>currency</b> <b>retention</b> <b>scheme</b> and other direct fiscal incentives (such as the exemption of export transactions from stamp duties) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Zambian Health Workers <b>Retention</b> <b>Scheme</b> (ZHWRS) {{commenced}} in 2003. The schemes' original aim was {{to retain}} and recruit Zambian doctors in rural and remote districts. The aim of the ZHWRS subsequently expanded to also include other health workers, in either rural or urban areas. The scheme was formulated to address, in part, the drastic shortage of health workers. Objectives: To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the ZHWRS in achieving its aim. Methods: The data on the number of health workers recruited by the ZHWRS and the spatial distribution of them was reviewed. A survey of health workers was undertaken to elicit their views of their working conditions, their job satisfaction and the effectiveness of <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> in retaining or increasing the numbers of and overall satisfaction of health workers. Results: The ZHWRS has not been successful in recruiting sufficient numbers of health workers to reverse the shortage problem or even to meet the modest targets of the scheme itself. However, these improvements do not decrease the likelihood of Department of Health (DoH) workers leaving their rural based positions. Conclusions: The ZHWRS has not fully met either its original or revised aims. The drastic shortage of health workers in Zambia continues. ...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown for}} {{the example of}} Gua Bribin, {{combined}} investigation, monitoring and numeric models proved to be helpful to understand the seepage phenomena and quantities around underground barrages in karst rock. Monitoring, data acquisition and evaluation cannot be given as a fixed requirement, especially in geologically unique or partly unknown conditions. Rather are they part of a learning process reacting to progressing investigations and system behaviour. Structural interventions like grouting are also based on repeated learning and follow the “observational method”. Effective water <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> with sufficient safety and serviceability can be established by this consequent way of learning. It is important that operating crew, local and external experts work together and complement one another with their knowledge.|$|R

50|$|The APF drew {{attention}} to the US Klayman v Obama (2013) decision where Judge Leon concluded there was no single instance where the collection of mass metadata either stopped an imminent terrorist threat or otherwise assisted in achieving a time-sensitive objective, and that there were therefore ‘serious doubts as to the efficacy of the metadata collection program’. As a result of criticism of the NSA program, the US Freedom Act was introduced in 2013 in order to end mass metadata collection. In support of the Bill, Representative Sensenbrenner and Democrat Patrick Leahy stated that ‘it is simply not accurate to say that the bulk of collection of phone records has prevented dozens of terrorists’ plots’ and that their position was bi-partisan. The Law Council of Australia submitted that the ability to access telecommunications data under the Bill was not limited to national security or serious crime, as it said it should be, and also submitted that there is little evidence from comparable jurisdictions with mandatory data <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> to suggest they actually assist in reducing crime. For example, in Germany, research indicates the <b>retention</b> <b>scheme</b> led to {{an increase in the number}} of convictions by only 0.006%. Furthermore, there is a lack of Australian statistical quantitative and qualitative data to indicate the necessity of telecommunications data in securing convictions. The LCA suggested that if the proposed scheme was introduced, statistical reporting should indicate the times when access to retained data has resulted in a conviction, whether it has assisted in detecting serious criminal activity or assisted security agencies against threats to Australia’s national security.|$|R
50|$|Isolation {{cells are}} used to prevent short circuit current. As the name suggests, these cells isolate the power gated block from the normally-On block. Isolation cells are {{specially}} designed for low short circuit current when input is at threshold voltage level. Isolation control signals are provided by the power gating controller. Isolation of the signals of a switchable module is essential to preserve design integrity. Usually a simple OR or AND logic can function as an output isolation device. Multiple state <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> are available in practice to preserve the state before a module shuts down. The simplest technique is to scan out the register values into a memory before shutting down a module. When the module wakes up, the values are scanned back from the memory.|$|R

40|$|Using firm-level and {{individual}} panel data from 2008 - 2009, the paper looks at how Hungarian firms combined employment reduction with "softer" measures like short-work and wage cuts, {{in response to}} the crisis. The data suggest that the wage distribution remained practically unchanged while hours reductions did not extend beyond the scope of a government-supported job <b>retention</b> <b>scheme</b> (requiring that the subsidized workers are reclassified as part-timers). In the private sector, the burden of adjustment fell entirely on employment. Variations in the changes of employment are studied using firm-level longitudinal data and controlling for the changes in the composition of the workforce. The dominance of adjustment on the extensive margin is explained, among others, by the lack of institutions encouraging soft adjustment, minimum wage regulations, and the fact that firms brought hiring to a halt rather than engaging in mass dismissals...|$|R
40|$|The Business Rate <b>Retention</b> <b>Scheme</b> (BRRS) was {{introduced}} in England 1 st April 2013 with the intention being to provide local authorities with an incentive to grow their economy; at the same time, it transferred financial liability for backdated appeals to LAs.

30|$|Worldwide, {{there are}} very few {{examples}} of effectively sealed barrages or water <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> in karst areas. Following the experience, conventional injection strategies may fail to seal the flow paths sustainably without a systematic pre-treatment. Such pre-treatment may be the systematic flushing of karst voids using water jets in a close-spaced grid of boreholes. Its aim must be that the grout encounters an “empty” pore system rather than a system partially filled with highly mobile constituents. An alternative is the construction of continuous sealing walls (like diaphragm panels) down from the ground surface. Compared with the present design, both alternatives would require a much higher effort in terms of time and costs. For the existing Gua Bribin barrage, the residual amount of bypassing water (6 – 10  l/min) roughly equals 0.4  % of the HPP’s design output and can, thus, be accepted. Compared to the amount of water used for energy generation by the PAT, this ratio is even distinctly smaller.|$|R

Product differentiation would deter robusta-producing countries from defecting but strengthen the incentive for arabica-producing countries to cheat. Moreover, it appears that the only way to enhance the sustainability of this kind of collusion is to allow arabica-producing countries to set the retention share. In addition, the negative impact of consumer heterogeneity on the sustainability of both kinds of collusion is highlighted...|$|R

Anonymisation services and proxy servers undermine such data retention efforts, as they allow users to masquerade their IP addresses.

In this paper we analyse the effectivity of four data <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> for single-hop proxy servers which use information already stored in logs today. We assess their effectivity by applying them to the historic logs of a mid-range proxy server. According to our evaluation it is insufficient to record data on session-level.

Report structure This report consists of seven chapters: 	The first chapter sets out the context, scope and conduct of the inquiry, 	Chapter 2 {{provides an overview of}} the Committee’s consideration of the case for data retention. The chapter considers whether mandatory data retention can, in principle, be justified as a vital tool for national security and law enforcement investigations, and whether appropriate safeguards and oversight can be put in place. The chapter discusses the adequacy of the current regime, privacy and civil liberties concerns, and the security of the retained data. 	Chapters 3 to 5 discuss the main issues raised in evidence to the inquiry in relation to Schedule 1 to the Bill, and the Committee’s comments and recommendations in regard to those issues. These issues were:   	Chapter 3 – Whether the Government’s proposed data set should be contained in primary legislation, as opposed to being made in regulations; and the scope of the Government’s proposed data set. 	Chapter 4 – The proposed two-year retention period; and whether service providers should be required to destroy telecommunications data retained in accordance with proposed new Division 1 of Part 5 - 1 A {{at the end of the}} retention-period. 	Chapter 5 – The range of service providers and services to which data retention obligations are proposed to apply; the implementation arrangements for the proposed data retention regime; and the cost of the proposed data <b>retention</b> <b>scheme.</b> 	Chapter 6 discusses the main issues raised in evidence to the inquiry in relation to Schedule 2 to the Bill, and the Committee’s comments and recommendations in regard to those issues. Schedule 2 contains amendments in respect of restrictions on access to stored communications and telecommunications data. 	Chapter 7 examines specific safeguards and oversight mechanisms set out in the Bill. This includes consideration of the expanded role for the Commonwealth Ombudsman set out in Schedule 3 to the Bill, review mechanisms and reporting requirements. The chapter also examines matters raised in evidence that are outside the scope of the Bill, but which were addressed by the Committee in its 2012 – 13 inquiry, including a mandatory data breach notification scheme...|$|R
