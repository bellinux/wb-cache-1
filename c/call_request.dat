However, mobility of queued <b>call</b> <b>requests</b> were ignored in previous literature. In this paper, a detailed analysis {{on the effects of}} the mobility of queued <b>call</b> <b>requests</b> are included in the analytic model. This is important because we found that the mobiles with queued <b>call</b> <b>requests</b> are very likely to leave the cell before granted a free channel.

40|$|AbstractA graph {{coloring}} problem {{useful in}} deciding whether a set of <b>call</b> <b>requests</b> in cellular radio is compatible with frequency use constraints is introduced. Lower and upper bounds are obtained for the hexagonal cell case typical of many urban cellular systems. These bounds are {{on the number of}} frequencies needed to satisfy demand when there is an upper bound on the demand with small subsets. For example, if we have 308 frequency channels available, as for American cellular systems, then this is enough to satisfy any set of <b>call</b> <b>requests</b> when every “superhex” of 7 hexagons, 6 around 1, has at most 154 <b>call</b> <b>requests.</b> But 308 frequencies are definitely not enough if we permit some superhexes to have 206 or more <b>call</b> <b>requests...</b>|$|R

30|$|WLAN-only MSs cannot retry to the {{cellular}} network {{even though their}} <b>call</b> <b>requests</b> to the WLAN are blocked while dual-interfaced MSs in the double coverage areas can retry {{the cellular}} network. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} assign higher priority to <b>call</b> <b>requests</b> from WLAN-only MSs to avoid unfairly higher blocking/dropping of the WLAN-only calls. Similar to the WLAN-only calls, cellular-only calls can access only the cellular networks, while dual-interfaced MSs have chances to access the WLAN in the double coverage area if their <b>call</b> <b>requests</b> to the cellular network are blocked. Dual-interfaced MSs try first the WLAN in the double coverage area to utilize the larger bandwidth of the WLAN. In addition, in the WLAN, vertical handoff calls have higher priority than new calls (e.g., WLAN-only or dual access calls) since the vertical handoff call dropping causes significant degradation in user satisfaction.|$|R

[...] Calls invoking the Fast Select facility (allowing 128 bytes of data in <b>call</b> <b>request,</b> call confirmation and call clearing phases) would generally attract an extra charge, as might use of some of the other X.25 facilities. PVCs would have a monthly rental charge and a lower price-per-segment than VCs, making them cheaper only where large volumes of data are passed.|$|E

Rejection of soft handoff requests causes forced termination of an ongoing real-time call, which is a severer problem than blocking of new call attempts. An admission control scheme that can guarantee a higher QoS for the soft handoff requests of real-time services in 3 G DS-CDMA systems is proposed for delay-sensitive voice and delay-tolerant stream-type data services. The proposed scheme (P-Scheme) accommodates both voice and data services by utilizing the full bandwidth. However, voice soft handoff <b>call</b> <b>requests</b> are given priority over new voice call and stream-type data packet requests by suppressing interference from stream-type data services according to voice soft handoff requests, and by varying interference levels. Performance of the P-Scheme is evaluated using a Markovian model. Results are compared with a conventional reservation scheme (C-Scheme) that reserves resources exclusively for voice soft handoff requests. Numerical results show that system performance can be significantly improved using the proposed P-Scheme, compared with the conventional C-Scheme, when various types of service are supported in third-generation DS-CDMA systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a novel load {{balancing}} technique is proposed to handle biased <b>call</b> <b>request</b> patterns efficiently. The knowledge of <b>call</b> <b>request</b> patterns is used from trace-based analysis; call patterns {{are affected by}} {{various factors such as}} geographical context, user mobility, network usage patterns and temporal bias. A call routing system is modelled as a network of queues and a provisioning algorithm is developed. The proposed model employs a combination of predictive and reactive provisioning methods. The idea of Capacity Distribution is introduced- a heuristic for heterogeneous capacity allocation among adjacent cell pairs. The proposed model retains simplicity while being able to effectively learn from the variations in call patterns. The performance of the model is evaluated using extensive simulation techniques.

The performance evaluation for the new scheme is carried out by computer simulation of call traffic in one cell of a microcellular system. The simulation results {{have shown that the}} new scheme improves the service quality of a microcellular system by reducing call blocking probability and increasing the carried-to-offered traffic ratio.
