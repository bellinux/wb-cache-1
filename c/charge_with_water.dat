40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines fueled by hydrogen {{are among the}} most efficient means of converting chemical energy to mechanical work. The exhaust has near-zero carbon emissions and fuel efficiency exceeding fuel cells is achievable. Unfortunately, the fuel costs are high and efficient combustion of hydrogen in engines produces nitrogen oxides (NOx) that cannot be treated with conventional three-way catalysts. This work presents the results of experiments which consider changes in hydrogen engine design and/or operating strategy to improve engine performance, consisting primarily of engine efficiency and NOx emissions. Various combustion chamber designs, compression ratios, operating parameters, and injector nozzles were tested, and the relative gains found ranged from 0 to 5 %. Three research areas were considered in greater detail to reduce NOx emissions and improve hydrogen engine efficiencies. The first effort focused on injecting liquid water into a cylinder filled with a premixed fuel-air charge. The results were compared against expectations for a conventionally operated hydrogen engine. Using this approach of direct injection of water into the cylinder, NOx emissions were reduced by up to 95 %. At a threshold of 100 ppm of NOx, peak load possible increased by 17. 3 %. The second research area considered injecting water into the intake air <b>charge.</b> <b>With</b> <b>water</b> injection into the intake air charge, the NOx emissions were reduced by 87 %. At a threshold of 90 ppm of NOx, peak load possible increased by 23. 9 %. Finally, experimental data were generated and analyzed for a combustion chamber with two spark plugs. An injector was designed to preferentially stratify the fuel towards the ignition sites. Results from a metal engine and an optically accessible engine are presented. Based on the metal engine data, the new cylinder head design produced a remarkable 47. 7 % net indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) while producing only 51 ppm of NOx. Laser induced fluorescence was used in the optically accessible engine to visualize the fuel distribution during non-firing operation. The most optimal injection conditions (based on the metal engine results) showed a fuel distribution where the equivalence ratio is approximately 0. 65 near the ignition locations...|$|E

The wall temperatures of the SiC nanoparticles-coated heat pipe {{were found to be}} higher than those of an uncoated heat pipe while the thermal performance for the heat pipe using a SiC/water nanofluid was not enhanced compared to the heat pipe using water as a working fluid. Also, the heat pipes containing SiC/water nanofluids and SiC-coated wick showed slight increases in evaporator thermal resistances, but minute changes in condenser thermal resistances compared to the water-filled heat pipe. Moreover, the overall thermal resistances of the heat pipes with the SiC/water nanofluids and SiC-coated wick were similar with those of the heat pipe <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>water.</b> In terms of heat transfer performance, the boiling heat transfer of the evaporator zone is explained by changes of the number of activated nucleation sites due to nanoparticle deposition on the wick structure, whereas heat transfer characteristics of the adiabatic and condenser zones are attributed to the liquid film layer which is formed on the wick structure by capillary wicking and is considerable as additional thermal resistance. The SEM images for wicks of heat pipes with nanoparticles-coated layers support the thermal performance characteristics of three types of heat pipes investigated in the study. &# 169; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] A new disc oscillating heat pipe has been developed and tested for use in high heat flux applications with a localized heat source. The results show that the heat pipe offers a significant improvement in performance over a copper disc when <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> or acetone. Despite the improvement, the heat pipe displayed some unexpected behavior. The heat pipe required far more power input to achieve startup than expected, given the heat pipe's small size, and the heat pipe demonstrated much smaller temperature oscillation amplitude than expected. To investigate this behavior, two additional oscillating heat pipes were constructed to test the effect of heat conduction through the adiabatic section of the heat pipe. The results clearly demonstrated that the presence of heat conduction through the adiabatic section of a heat pipe required far more power to startup, between 25 and 275 W additional power depending on the working fluid, condenser temperature, and orientation. The presence of heat conduction through the adiabatic section also demonstrated reduced oscillation amplitude. It was also found that the presence of heat conduction through the adiabatic section of an oscillating heat pipe resulted in better performance than a heat pipe without conduction through the adiabatic section...|$|R
