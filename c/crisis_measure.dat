General Motors New Zealand, which still had a wide four-cylinder Vauxhall Viva/Magnum line on sale, had planned a 2850 six 'S' model with bench front seat and three-speed column manual shift and the 3300SL with bucket seats and four-speed manual or three-speed Trimatic floor shift.The New Zealand government, though, imposed a 60% sales tax (a post-first oil <b>crisis</b> <b>measure)</b> on cars with engines over two litres just as GM launched the LH in mid-'74, and only a few of each were built. The LH was then withdrawn temporarily and relaunched some months later with the Opel 1.9-litre I4 and floor-shift manual or automatic (SL only) gearboxes. Six-cylinder Toranas would never again be built in New Zealand and were only very rare imports after this. GM New Zealand also built a few unique local 'sports' special editions, but the changes were only cosmetic.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{distinct}} lack of research into the concept of acute mental health crisis. Without investigating the concept of crisis itself, {{it is not possible}} to appreciate the attributes of crisis so that it can be measured. This has hampered the development of good psychometric tools for crisis. The aim of this research was to develop the first standardised, valid and reliable measure for the assessment of people presenting to Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment (CRHT) teams. This research utilised qualitative and quantitative research techniques to develop a <b>crisis</b> <b>measure</b> starting with a comprehensive investigation into the concept of acute mental health crisis to identify an item pool and clinically credible item rating scale. A prototype <b>crisis</b> <b>measure</b> was developed and piloted in two NHS CRHTs and data collected. This data was analysed to identify the key areas of crisis assessment (the subscales), a flexible rating scale and scoring system creating a measure named the Crisis Risk and Adaptive Functioning Tool (CRAFT). The CRAFT provides patient crisis profiles highlighting areas of strength, resilience, weakness and vulnerability. A thorough investigation of crisis was completed with CRHT staff and patients through interviews and focus groups. An initial 143 item pool and clinically credible item rating scale were identified and developed into a prototype pilot <b>crisis</b> <b>measure.</b> This measure utilised a flexible rating approach encapsulating both risk and protective factors believed to reflect clinical practice. The measure was piloted and the data analysed to assess the structure of the crisis measure???s item pool using the statistical techniques of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Rasch analysis. These analyses resulted in a 66 item measure with 8 unidimensional subscales including; 1) Crisis Recovery Indicators, 2) Adaptive Decision Making, 3) Risk of Harm to Self, 4) Mediating Factors, 5) Daily Structure, 6) Risk of Harm to Others, 7) Feelings and Affect, and 8) Basic Needs.

Itâ€™s a relatively new measure undertaken in the school and both the problems in the school and this measure have been widely discussed in the public media. The theoretical sources of inspiration have come from Weber, Galbraith and Elias and include power relations and dynamics within social mobility when people establishes in new places. The method used is qualitative and the sources of data have been respondents representing different groups of personnel in the school and school documents. The language rule can be summarized as a discipline <b>crisis</b> <b>measure,</b> which the school legitimate with clear arguments, support from parents and by seeing an improvement in the school, which can be indicating obedience by the pupils.

40|$|The {{national}} politics determines {{the quality of}} education policies, programs and processes and eventually the products (results or outcomes). Government underfunding and commoditisation of education is likely to worsen the crisis in education. The current economic crisis confronting many governments is creating severe conflicts in educational sector of many nations. On the one hand they had to reduce, their budget deficits to avoid excess indebtedness. On the other hand, they had to promote education firstly to alleviate unemployment as a short run <b>crisis</b> <b>measure</b> and secondly to avoid the deterioration of human capital in the long run. High percentage of national budgets focuses on the public funding, which greatly affect the education sector. Some governments carried out overall budget cuts. These had negative effects on teachers, students and families. This research studies the impact of economic crises on education in the South-West part of Nigeria. The collected survey data shows that the current economic crisis in Nigeria had an observable impact on the education sector as many State Governments proceeded to drastic budget cuts on education. Only few State Governments, however, acknowledged the importance of the educational sector in overcoming the current economic crisis. These few States see the need of increased spending on education, supporting students, families and education providers as a way to enhance productivity and efficiency of State economy. The result of this research shows a great difference between the States cutting budget on education because of economy, economic downturn and those pumping more fund into education sector in the mist of economic crises. This research concludes that adequately funded educational system, if genuinely promoted and honestly managed is capable of creating mass-fully developed human talents whose creative thinking would get any nation out of the economic crisis and permanently shut the door to its future occurrenc...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is two-fold. First, it {{examines}} the relationship between financial development and growth. Second, it investigates the role of foreign banks, inflation and openness in the state of financial development. The above are discussed in relation to a comparative study of regional economic blocs of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and Southern African Development Community (SADC) in three essays for the period 1980 - 2011. The dissertation comprises four essays as stated below. Existing studies on financial system development usually rely on single measure of financial development which is inadequate in capturing the financial system properly and leads to mixed results. This research addresses this critical issue by constructing a composite measure of the variable. The first essay provides a comparative analysis on the impact of financial development on growth and development between the two regions. In addition, it investigates the influence of financial development through political development on growth. The motivation stem s not only from inadequate studies on regional economic blocs, but, importantly, the methods applied in previous panel studies ignored issues of heterogeneity. To address this, the study employ s a combination of methodologies, Pooled Mean Group, Mean Group and Dynamic Fixed Effect approaches. These approaches also capture both the short run and long run dynamics. The results indicate that financial development induces economic growth in both regions with the impact in SADC more than that of ECOWAS. Also, more political development robustly supports more financial sector to impact on growth positively in ECOWAS, but not in SADC. Finally, the speed of adjustment suggests that deviations from the long run equilibrium path following a shock are corrected at about 13 % per year in ECOWAS and 15 % in SADC The second essay, which is another comparative study, addresses the question of why some countries having underdeveloped financial systems after it has been established that the sector is vital for growth. SSA has one of the least developed financial systems, and, since the first essay documented that indeed the sector is crucial to growth, the main aim of this essay is to investigate whether inflation and openness to trade and financial system (that is, Rajan and Zingales Hypothesis) matter for financial development. Importantly, the effects of the growing communication infrastructure on financial development is also captured, which is a novelty. Four approaches were used: Least square dummy variable, Feasible GLS, Panel corrected standard errors and seemingly unrelated regression. The main findings provide evidence that in both regions inflation robustly reverse s financial development with the effect in ECOWAS much more. Overall, the results seem to indicate that the cost of inflation to the financial system is genuine and not explained by a sort of omitted variable bias. Access to communication indicated a strong positive effect on financial development in both regions, with the impact in SADC more. Finally, the study indicates that even though more simultaneous opening of the financial sector and trade lead to more financial development in SADC, trade openness alone still enhances development in the sector. However, more financial openness alone is detrimental to financial development in the region. Hence, this seems to provide partial support for the hypothesis in SADC. The hypothesis, however, is rejected in ECOWAS. The third essay examines the asymmetric effects of inflation on financial development. It is motivated by existing theories which posit that the detrimental effects of inflation on the financial development is only observed beyond certain threshold level. The study is {{the first of its kind}} to be conducted on SSA, especially on regional economic blocs. Using a novel Panel smooth transition regression that endogenously determines this threshold value, a comparative study is conducted between the two regions. The results suggest evidence of the existence of a robust single threshold of 17. 9 % inflation for ECOWAS and 14. 5 % for SADC. The result indicates that inflation above these thresholds presents significant detrimental effects for financial development in both regions. The last essay focuses on financial sector stability via banking sector stability. It is motivated by the evidence that the financial system of the two regions are bank based which is also over 50 % foreign bank dominated. Specifically, the essay investigates the effects of foreign banking inflows on banking crisis (financial instability) of both regions for the period 1995 - 2009. This objective is informed by the widely held conventional wisdom that foreign banks lack long term commitment to the domestic financial system and will leave at the first sign of trouble. This can stir instability in the sector. The study employs two econometric approaches, namely, the multivariate logit and the t wo-step system generalised method of moment using bank <b>crisis</b> <b>measure</b> constructed by Laeven and Valencia (2012) and bank z-score (Bankscope). The main results of the methods indicate evidence that the presence of foreign banks in the domestic banking sector reduces the probability of bank crisis. Generally, the results reveal that the benefits from the foreign banks in the financial system are unaffected by any sort of omitted variable bias. This study has significant implication for policy formulation since it is the first study on comparative analysis between two regional economic groups in SSA. The study argues that more efforts should be committed in improving the financial system and governance. Improvement in the legal system can enhance financial development and this should be coupled with good macroeconomic policies. The study recommends that price stability policies with inflation targeting framework that falls below the estimated threshold, should be the primary objective in monetary policy. Furthermore, more investment into telecommunication industry is necessary for FSD and should be given attention. In terms of foreign banking inflows, the study advocates for a cautious approach towards attracting more foreign banks as well as more opening of the financial sector...|$|E
