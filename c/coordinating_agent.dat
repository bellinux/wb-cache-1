40|$|In this thesis, {{we explore}} {{the topic of}} {{designing}} an architecture and processing algorithms for a multi-agent system, where agents need to address potential unexpected events in the environment, operating under soft real-time constraints. We first develop a classification of unexpected events into Opportunities, Barriers and Potential Causes of Failure, and outline {{the interaction required to}} support the allocation of tasks for these events. We then propose a hybrid architecture to provide for agent autonomy in the system, employing a central <b>coordinating</b> <b>agent.</b> Certain agents in the community operate autonomously, while others remain {{under the control of the}} <b>coordinating</b> <b>agent.</b> The coordinator is able to determine which agents should form teams to address unexpected events in a timely manner, and to oversee those agents as they perform their tasks. The proposed architecture avoids the overhead of negotiation amongst agent teams for the assignment of tasks, a benefit when operating under limited time and resource constraints. It also avoids the bottleneck of having one <b>coordinating</b> <b>agent</b> making all decisions before work can proceed in the community, by allowing some agents to work independently. We illustrate the potential usefulness of the framework by describing an implementation of a simulator loosely based on that used for the RoboCup Rescue Simulation League contest. The implementation provides a set of simulated computers, each running a simple soft real-time operating system. On top of this basic simulation we implement the model described above and test it against two different search-and-rescue scenarios. From our experiments, we observe that our architecture is able to operate in dynamic and real-time environments, and can handle, in an appropriate and timely manner, any unexpected events that occur. We also comment on the value of our proposed approach for designing adjustable autonomy multi-agent systems and for specific environments such as robotics, where reducing the overall level of communication within the system is crucial...|$|E

40|$|We {{address in}} this paper the problem of <b>coordinating</b> resource-bounded <b>agents</b> under time {{constraints}} in a dy-namic environment. The agent society we deal with consists of <b>coordinated</b> <b>agents</b> {{each of which has}} a goal to achieve be-fore a deadline and new agents can asynchronously appear to achieve time-constrained goals and to coordinate their plans with the already <b>coordinated</b> <b>agent</b> society. Agents use pro-gressive planning that adapt the detail of their local plans according to local deadlines and available resources. The plan consists of a hierarchy of partial plans where each par-tial plan satisfies a part of the goal. In such environments, constructing a complete plan and then coordinating it with other agents doesn’t guarantee that the planning and coordi-nation operations will finish before the given deadline. What we propose is an anytime coordination that allows an agent to return a coordinated plan at any time by using series of partial planning followed by a coordination until the com-plete plan is constructed and coordinated or the deadline is met.
