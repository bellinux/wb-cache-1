25|$|Early designs {{including}} Siemens, Westinghouse, and Combustion Engineering had {{a mostly}} can-like shape built with reinforced concrete. As concrete {{has a very}} good <b>compression</b> <b>strength</b> compared to tensile, this is a logical design for the building materials since the extremely heavy top part of containment exerts a large downward force that prevents some tensile stress if containment pressure were to suddenly go up. As reactor designs have evolved, many nearly spherical containment designs for PWRs have also been constructed. Depending on the material used, this is the most apparently logical design because a sphere is the best structure for simply containing a large pressure. Most current PWR designs involve some combination of the two, with a cylindrical lower part and a half-spherical top.|$|E
25|$|Hydration and {{hardening}} {{of concrete}} {{during the first}} three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses {{at a time when it}} has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation. Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate <b>compression</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

40|$|Geotechnical {{characteristics}} of Dublin Boulder Clay (DBC) based on detailed site investigation and site experience from some recent large projects in Dublin are presented. This paper attempts to synthesise available information {{in parallel with}} recent work by Skipper et al (2005), who provide an updated understanding of the geology of the DBC. Having assessed the effects of sampling disturbance, the paper characterises the various formations and sub-units of the DBC. The interpreted material behaviour is related to observed engineering performance. It was found from the behaviour of earth retained structures that intact, clayey, DBC formations are 2 to 3 times stiffer than assessed from high quality laboratory tests on block samples. DBC is shown to be significantly stiffer than other well-characterised tills. Relatively inexpensive Multi Channel Surface Wave techniques (MASW) can give very reliable estimates of in situ small strain stiffness. High undrained triaxial <b>compression</b> <b>strengths</b> were measured {{and it appears that}} simple UU tests on high quality specimens give good results. Significant strength anisotropy was suggested by undrained triaxial extension strengths that were only 30 % to 50 % of the triaxial <b>compression</b> <b>strengths.</b> Field horizontal permeability values of the intact clayey till units have a representative mean of about 10 - 9 m/s and when compared to laboratory values suggest that the material may exhibit some degree of anisotropy of permeability. Overall, the measured engineering parameters for the DBC are favourable for many construction projects. Further work is required {{in order to understand the}} in situ horizontal stress profile and the stiffness anisotropy of the till.
