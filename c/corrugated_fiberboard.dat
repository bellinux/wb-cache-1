40|$|Collapse of {{fiberboard}} packaging boxes, in {{the shipping}} indus-try, due {{to rise in}} humidity conditions is common and very cost-ly. A 3 D FE nonlinear model is developed to predict the moisture flow throughout a <b>corrugated</b> packaging <b>fiberboard</b> sandwich structure. The model predicts how the moisture diffu-sion will permeate through the layers of a fiberboard (medium and facings). The model predicts the deformation response, the loss of stiffness, and the creep response. The FE results are compared with an experimental set-up used at the Forest Prod-uct Laboratory in Madison, WI for a panel subjected to a swept-sine humidity function to study its response to varying humidity function. The panel modeled in this analysis consists of two facings made from liner material separated by a corrugated me-dium. The liner and medium will be assigned orthotropic stress...|$|R
40|$|According as the {{international}} definition of Flexible Scope, a laboratory must demonstrate face with the accreditation body that it has the knowledge, experience and competence {{to work within the}} full range of its flexible scope, as well as possessing suitable laboratory environments and equipment. The laboratory must also demonstrate that it has a management system in place that can control its proposed approach while continuing to comply with the requirements of ISO 17025 : 2005. In case of UKAS (Unites Kingdom Accreditation Service), prior to offering accreditation for flexible scope they must have a high degree of confidence that the staff are technically competent and that the management system controlling certain key processes as development, review, validation and authorization. LATU apply these requirements since 2004 as "Unified Tests". Until this date, LATU was doing the same type of tests in different materials departments using different equipment, personal, and testing quality control. In order to that were defined cross disciplinary groups to analyze this topic approaching in personal competence and quality control tests improvement, and resource's decrease. For example, LATU has the Unified Test Tensile Strength accredited by UKAS in: <b>corrugated</b> and solid <b>fiberboard,</b> paper board, linerboard, cork plugs, plastic bags, plastic sheeting, paper, woven fabrics, plastic woven bags and woven plastic. As a result of the Unified Tests was generated a general unified manage procedure with unified criteria's, responsibilities and actions. Was written a unique testing procedure not only with the actual flexible scope and the flexibilities limits but also the compliance requirements of ISO 17025 and the accreditations body methodology. We could decrease the amount of documentation to control. Was defined the methodology and implemented periodicaly internal inter comparisons between departments in order to valid the unified tests and has a unique calculation method of uncertainty of measurement for tests performed in different departments. The equipment joint control allows everybody to use all the equipment, optimization resources and assurance the maintenance and calibration of them. The training together lead to the polyvalence personal. <br /...|$|R
25|$|Filament tape or {{strapping}} tape is a {{pressure-sensitive tape}} used for several packaging {{functions such as}} closing <b>corrugated</b> <b>fiberboard</b> boxes, reinforcing packages, bundling items, pallet utilizing, etc. It consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material which is usually a polypropylene or polyester film and fiberglass filaments embedded to add high tensile strength.

2500|$|Some {{wines are}} {{packaged}} in thick plastic bags within <b>corrugated</b> <b>fiberboard</b> boxes, and are called [...] "box wines", or [...] "cask wine". Tucked inside {{the package is}} a tap affixed to the bag in box, or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh {{for up to a}} month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine oxidizes more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days.|$|E
