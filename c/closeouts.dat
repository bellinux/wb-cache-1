The {{primary purpose of}} this thesis is to classify contract <b>closeout</b> pathologies, identify {{the root causes of}} these pathologies, and provide a series of strategies to regain control of the contract <b>closeout</b> process all {{within the context of the}} Organizational Systems Framework Model.

40|$|In {{nearly every}} {{construction}} project, completing {{the project on}} time {{is one of the}} most critical things for everyone involved. Late project completion causes a wide variety of complications for the entire project team. This paper seeks to identify some of the causes for delay in the last phase of construction projects: the <b>closeout</b> phase. Original research was conducted to gather input from construction industry professionals about their experiences with the <b>closeout</b> phase of projects. Factors perceived to cause <b>closeout</b> delay were identified, along with perceptions about the <b>closeout</b> performance of survey participant’s firms. The research validated the study’s premise that the <b>closeout</b> phase is difficult to successfully execute, for a variety of reasons.

The {{purpose of this}} study is to streamline the contract <b>closeout</b> process through the application of continuous process improvement techniques. A methodology for the identification of procedures involved in the process and problem areas in the process was developed. Available literature was reviewed and personal interviews were conducted to develop a model of the contract <b>closeout</b> process and to identify problems in the contract <b>closeout</b> process. Continuous Process Improvement procedures were applied to the contract model and the problems identified to eliminate the problems and increase the efficiency of the process. Recommendations included: increasing the priority placed on the close out of U. S. Government contracts, development of an automated system for the close out of U. S. Government contracts, development of a training program in the contract <b>closeout</b> process, improvement of communications between organizations involved in the contract <b>closeout</b> process, and application of continuous process improvement procedures to reduce the time required to close out U.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{practical}} {{consequences of the}} bilateral counterparty risk adjustment. We point out that past literature assumes that, {{at the moment of}} the first default, a risk-free <b>closeout</b> amount will be used. We argue that the legal (ISDA) documentation suggests in many points that a substitution <b>closeout</b> should be used. This would take into account the risk of default of the survived party. We show how the bilateral counterparty risk adjustment changes strongly when a substitution <b>closeout</b> amount is considered. We model the two extreme cases of default independence and co-monotonicity, which highlight pros and cons of both risk free and substitution <b>closeout</b> formulations, and allow us to interpret the outcomes as dramatic consequences on default contagion. Finally, we analyze the situation when collateral is present. ...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>closeout</b> sale is {{the final}} sale of an item either by a {{retailer}} or sell off of a retailer inventory to a 3rd party company.

In the latter case, it is usually known as a going-out-of-business sale, and is part of a liquidation. A [...] "hail sale" [...] is a <b>closeout</b> at a car dealership after hail damage. Often, when the store is shutting down, they let people know that this is their last chance to buy the merchandise.

At issue are potentially millions of dollars that are obligated on those contracts, which could be deobligated, thus making them available for use by DoD.
