Colour facilities at Alexandra Palace were technically very limited for the next eighteen months, as it had only one RCA colour Quadruplex videotape machine and, eventually two Pye plumbicon colour telecines–although the news colour service started with just one.|$|E
40|$|<b>Colour</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>film</b> (High Speed Ektachrome ASA 160) {{has been}} used as the {{recording}} medium for emission line spectra in an attempt to facilitate visual estimation of the relative intensities of lines. Moderate overexposure of this film appears as a colour change, and the colour of a line can therefore be used as a measure of its intensity. The molecular spectrum is recorded on the same film as a series of calibration spectra of white light of different exposure times. The colour of a molecular line is matched to the same colour at the same wavelength in the calibration spectra, and the exposure time of the matched calibration {{is a measure of the}} line intensity...|$|E

He used the Department’s 16 mm camera to film {{the way of life}} and environment of Malayan Tribes, and later of the Muruts of North Borneo (Sabah). The Government there had asked him to inquire into the apparent depopulation of the Interior Tribes, and he started the work by doing extensive disease surveys of Longhouse populations. He documented this with a 16mm silent film camera loaded with Kodachrome <b>reversal</b> <b>colour</b> <b>film.</b> For sound he used a Nagra 2C tape recorder. Polunin also contributed a number of articles and book chapters in the field of medical anthropology.|$|R

5000|$|In photography, <b>reversal</b> <b>film</b> {{is a type}} of {{photographic}} film that produces a positive image on a transparent base. The film is processed to produce transparencies or diapositives (abbreviated as [...] "diafilm" [...] in many countries) instead of negatives and prints. <b>Reversal</b> <b>film</b> is produced in various sizes, from 35 mm roll film to 8×10 inch sheet film.|$|R
5000|$|Color <b>reversal</b> <b>film</b> {{produces}} positive transparencies, {{also known}} as diapositives. Transparencies can be reviewed {{with the aid of}} a magnifying loupe and a lightbox. If mounted in small metal, plastic or cardboard frames for use in a slide projector or slide viewer they are commonly called slides. <b>Reversal</b> <b>film</b> is often marketed as [...] "slide film". Large-format color <b>reversal</b> sheet <b>film</b> is used by some professional photographers, typically to originate very-high-resolution imagery for digital scanning into color separations for mass photomechanical reproduction. Photographic prints can be produced from <b>reversal</b> <b>film</b> transparencies, but positive-to-positive print materials for doing this directly (e.g. Ektachrome paper, Cibachrome/Ilfochrome) have all been discontinued, so that it now requires the use of an internegative to convert the positive transparency image into a negative transparency, which is then printed as a positive print.|$|R
