The results showed that <b>cereal</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode was of minor importance to cereal crops in this region. Even though root lesion nematodes were either absent or present at low levels within the roots of most wheat and barley crops, they were present at potentially damaging levels in 16 % of crops, and the data showed higher nematode densities following two consecutive crops than following 2 years of pasture. This suggests that with the increased intensification of cropping within the region, root lesion nematodes may become increasingly important and further studies are required to establish their importance.

40|$|The <b>cereal</b> <b>cyst</b> {{nematode}} (CCN), Heterodera avenae woll, {{has been}} reported on wheat and other cereals in many countries with different climate types throughout the world (Holdeman & Watson, 1977; Meagher, 1977; Sturhan & Rumpenhorst, 1966). In 1987, the nematode was also reported from irrigated wheat fields in Saudi Arabia (Youssif, 1987). Since then, II. avenae has been increasingly detected in Saudi Arabia year after year and has become recognized as a danmaing pathogen of wheat and barley, especially in Al-Kharj, Hail and Al-Gassim, the three major wheat producing regions. (Al-Hazmi, 1992; Al-Hazmi et al., 1994). Growth and physiology of infected wheat and barley are adversely affected (Al-Yahya et al., 1988), and yield loss is as much as 92 % in heavily infested sites of some wheat fields (Ibrahim et al., 1999). Some records of <b>cereal</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode may refer to other species other than H. avenae. For example, comparative biochemical and morphological studies made by Sturhan and Rumpenhorst (1996) on numerous H. avenae and H. avenae-resembling populations from several geographic origins in eastern Europe and west Asia proved that these populations are in fact. H. filipievi Madzhidos. However, the protein pattern of the Saudi population from Al-Kharj region closely agreed with that of typical H. avenae (Sturhan & Ruympenhorst, 1996). Cotten (1967) reported that more than three phatotypes of CCN were present in England and Wales and, since then, variations in virulence of CCN populations on different cereal genotypes have been described from Asia (Mathur et al., 1974; Shimizu et al., 1987; Dhawan, 1988; Zheng Jing et al., 1997) and many other countries Swarup & Sosa Moss, 1990; Rivoal & Cook, 1993).

A second species of <b>cereal</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode, H. filipjevi, was identified in eastern Oregon during 2008. This paper reports the discovery of H. filipjeviâ€“infested fields in eastern Washington, thereby extending the known distribution of H. filipjevi in the United States. The identity of H. filipjevi was determined and confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), sequencing, and cyst morphology. Soils that were collected from naturally infested fields in Washington were used to compare the virulence of H. avenae and H. filipjevi on six spring wheat cultivars under controlled-environment conditions. Noninfested soils from nearby fields were used as controls. Cultivars Ouyen and WB Rockland were resistant to H. avenae and susceptible to H. filipjevi.

5000|$|Infection with <b>cereal</b> <b>cyst</b> {{nematode}} {{is associated}} with a reduction in grain yield which may be of significant proportions. Thresholds of harmfulness depend on the population density of the nematode and differ among various cultivars and varieties. The weather conditions and soil types are also an important factor, with infections being increased in damp, warm growing seasons. The symptoms of infection include stunting and yellowing of the visible parts of the plant which may give the crop an uneven appearance. The presence of the disease can be established by inspecting the root system of plants and looking for abnormal development. The roots of infested plants develop a tangle of branches and swellings which are white when young but turn dark brown with age. It is the seedlings of cereals that are most readily infected with this nematode and damaged roots are often invaded by soil-borne pathogens such as root and crown rots. [...] When nematode populations are high, significant losses in yield can occur. All wheat varieties are susceptible but some cultivars do not support cyst formation.It was found in trials that direct-drilling that did not disturb the soil below seeding depth reduced the incidence of <b>cereal</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode but did not have the same effect on the other serious cereal seedling diseases of rhizoctonia root rot and take-all.

(2) From 1975, in addition to research on H. avenae, to conduct research on nematode diseases of other agricultural and horticultural crops in Victoria. My research has always been directed at achieving methods of control which are both practical, and economic to apply. Prior to 1965, <b>cereal</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode was recognised as {{a major cause of}} disease in cereals in the southern wheatbelt of Australia; its distribution was known to be related to well structured soils; knowledge of its biology and ecology under Australian conditions was limited; and, crop rotation was the only recommended method of control.

40|$|The potato {{breeding}} programme at Oak Park {{was started in}} the 1960 's and has consisted {{of a number of}} distinct phases. In the first phase the focus was on the testing of the main domestic and foreign varieties in field trials in the main potato growing areas of the country.

The process of breeding, testing and multiplying a new potato variety from the making of the initial cross until the new variety can be commercially grown takes about 15 years (see Appendix 2).

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{progressive}} yield decline observed in cereals production is the rapid build-up of populations of the <b>cereal</b> <b>cyst</b> nematode (CCN, Heterodera avenae). These nematodes secrete so-call effectors into their host plant to suppress the plant defense responses, alter plant signaling pathways and then induce the formation of syncytium after infection. However, little is known about its molecular mechanism and parasitism during incompatible infection. To gain insight into its repertoire of parasitism genes, we investigated the transcriptome of the early parasitic second-stage (30 hours, 3 days and 9 days post infection) juveniles of the CCN as well as the CCN infected tissue of the host Aegilops variabilis by Illumina sequencing. Among all assembled unigenes, 681 putative genes of parasitic nematode were found, in which 56 putative effectors were identified, including novel pioneer genes and genes corresponding to previously reported effectors. All the 681 CCN unigenes were mapped to 229 GO terms and 200 KEGG pathways, including growth, development and several stimulus-related signaling pathways. Sixteen clusters were involved in the CCN unigene expression atlas at the early stages during infection process, and three of which were significantly gene-enriched. Besides, the protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed 35 node unigenes which may play an important role in the plantCCN interaction. Moreover, in a comparison of differentially expressed genes between the pre-parasitic juveniles and the early parasitic juveniles, we found that hydrolase activity was up-regulated in pre J 2 s whereas binding activity was upregulated in infective J 2 s. RT-qPCR analysis on some selected genes showed detectable expression, indicating possible secretion of the proteins and putative role in infection. This study provided better insights into the incompatible interaction between H. avenae and the host plant Ae. varabilis.
