5|$|<b>Constellation</b> sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her bow, raking {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. <b>Constellation</b> sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while <b>Constellation</b> suffered damage to her rigging. <b>Constellation</b> again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her bow and rake her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more <b>Constellation</b> maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As <b>Constellation</b> crossed the frigate's bow again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} <b>constellation</b> of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the <b>constellation</b> was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its <b>constellation,</b> exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E

50|$|In astronomy, the {{circumpolar}} <b>constellations</b> are a {{group of}} <b>constellations</b> of stars that never set below the horizon from the viewer's perspective. Because of {{the rotation of the}} Earth and its axial tilt with respect to the Sun, the stars and <b>constellations</b> can be divided into two groups. Some stars and <b>constellations</b> never rise nor set, and they are called circumpolar. All the rest are divided into seasonal stars and <b>constellations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{families}} are organized by common location or common theme. The Ursa Major, Perseus, Hercules, and Orion families include mainly <b>constellations</b> {{in the general}} vicinity of those four <b>constellations.</b> The Zodiac family includes the traditional 12 Zodiac <b>constellations.</b> The Heavenly Waters family includes mostly <b>constellations</b> generally associated with water. The Bayer family includes southern <b>constellations</b> first introduced by Plancius and subsequently included in Johann Bayer's Uranometria in 1603.

5|$|Later, the 17th-century German {{celestial}} cartographer Johann Bayer {{called the}} <b>constellation</b> Triplicitas and Orbis terrarum tripertitus, {{for the three}} regions Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius excised three faint stars—6, 10 and 12 Trianguli—to form the new <b>constellation</b> of Triangulum Minus in his 1690 Firmamentum Sobiescianum, renaming the original as Triangulum Majus.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{about the origins}} of the <b>constellations.</b> Nowadays the IAU recognises 88 <b>constellations</b> endorsed officially in the 1928 from the Commision 3 in Leiden.

The first step is to distinguish the zodiacal and para-zodiacal <b>constellations</b> from the others. In fact, the zodiacal and para-zodiacal <b>constellations</b> seem to be formed from mesopotamic culture: many evidences come from seals, clay tablets, boundary stones and star lists. This <b>constellations</b> spread out from mesopotamic lands over mediterranean world. For others <b>constellations</b> the origin is still uncertain.

However, by early adolescence, as stereotypes become stronger, <b>constellations</b> become smaller and less flexible. Although seventh graders use more products and brands to form <b>constellations</b> than younger children, they do so in place of other ways to define roles, such as personality traits, therefore forming <b>constellations</b> with fewer elements overall.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} the preliminary {{ideas on how}} to design orbits and <b>constellations</b> associated with extended Sun-Synchronicity concepts.

By applying the Sun-Synchronicity constraint to the Flower <b>Constellations</b> theory, the Sun-Synchronous Flower <b>Constellations</b> have been derived. For these <b>constellations,</b> however, the synchronization is referring to the relative trajectory in a reference frame that rotates with Earth’s mean motion rather than to the Earth-Centered Inertial frame.

50|$|The {{paintings}} in the Tomb do not show {{the names of the}} <b>constellations,</b> nor do they show the connecting lines between the stars (but research has identified these paintings as part of the twenty-eight Chinese <b>constellations).</b> The paintings of the <b>constellations</b> in this tomb do show modifications over their Chinese depictions: the direction of the arrangement of the twenty-eight <b>constellations</b> is counterclockwise and the reversal of the east and west <b>constellations</b> (seven <b>constellations</b> of the east have been placed in the west and the seven <b>constellations</b> of the west have been placed in the east). These differences are thought to be due to an error by the painters or because the reproductions of the astronomical directions were erroneous.

There are 128 stars in total in the painting; some scholars have identified the Big Dipper and either one or several other <b>constellations.</b>|$|R
5|$|There was a {{movement}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a <b>constellation</b> named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the <b>constellation,</b> but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as a <b>constellation,</b> astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word side means pomegranate, which bears fruit while Orion, the <b>constellation,</b> can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} digital communication in a Rayleigh flat fading environment using a multiple antenna system. We assume that the transmitter doesn’t know the channel coefficients, and that the receiver has only an estimate of them. We further assume that the transmitter and receiver know the statistics of the estimation error. We will refer to this system as a partially coherent system. In an earlier work, we had derived a design criterion for the partially coherent <b>constellations</b> based on maximizing the minimum KL distance between conditional distributions. We had also designed single transmit antenna <b>constellations</b> using this criterion, which showed substantial improvement in the performance over existing and widely-used <b>constellations.</b> In this work, using the KL-based design criterion, we design partially coherent <b>constellations</b> for multiple antenna systems, and evaluate their performance through simulation. We show that, even {{with only a few}} percent channel estimation error, the new <b>constellations</b> achieve significant performance gains over the conventional <b>constellations</b> and existing multiple antenna techniques. The proposed <b>constellations</b> are multi-level, with multi-dimensional spherical <b>constellations</b> at each level. We also propose a recursive construction for the constituent spherical subsets of the multiple-antenna partially coherent <b>constellations.</b> I...|$|R
