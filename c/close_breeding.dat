60|$|Under a {{practical}} point of view, agriculturists and horticulturists may {{learn something from}} the conclusions at which we have arrived. Firstly, {{we see that the}} injury from the <b>close</b> <b>breeding</b> of animals and from the self-fertilisation of plants, does not necessarily depend on any tendency to disease or weakness of constitution common to the related parents, and only indirectly on their relationship, in so far as they are apt to resemble each other in all respects, including their sexual nature. And, secondly, that the advantages of cross-fertilisation depend on the sexual elements of the parents having become in some degree differentiated by the exposure of their progenitors to different conditions, or from their having intercrossed with individuals thus exposed, or, lastly, from what we call in our ignorance spontaneous variation. He therefore who wishes to pair closely related animals ought to keep them under conditions as different as possible. Some few breeders, guided by their keen powers of observation, have acted on this principle, and have kept stocks of the same animals at two or more distant and differently situated farms. They have then coupled the individuals from these farms with excellent results. (12/17. 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2 pages 98, 105.) This same plan is also unconsciously followed whenever the males, reared in one place, are let out for propagation to breeders in other places. As some kinds of plants suffer much more from self-fertilisation than do others, so it probably is with animals from too close interbreeding. The effects of close interbreeding on animals, judging again from plants, would be deterioration in general vigour, including fertility, with no necessary loss of excellence of form; and this seems to be the usual result.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} quotation is {{also taken}} from the Oyster Bay Pilot: We have the effort of Mr. Randolph Huntington to establish a type by mixing the blood of General Grant's Arab stallions with the mares of the Clay family. It will be recalled that when General Grant made his famous tour of the world he stopped at Constantinople, and was entertained by the Sultan, who gave the American soldier, as a souvenir of his visit, two stallions, Leopard and Linden Tree. These horses were landed in 1879, and Mr. Huntington at once began making arrangements to breed to them. Mr. Huntington has theories as to in-breeding, or <b>close</b> <b>breeding,</b> as he prefers to call it, that are more in consonance with the ideas that prevail abroad than here. Of interest to the sports enthusiast is the record of one Clay stallion with the name Cassius. Although extinct now, the Clays did contribute {{to the creation of}} another American breed, the Standardbred Trotting Horse.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} {{and structure of}} 72 Appaloosa horses belonging to a <b>closed</b> <b>breeding</b> population from an ecological reserve in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was investigated using eight microsatellite markers from the International Society for Animal Genetics panel. Our data showed that this Appaloosa horse population had an elevated degree of {{genetic diversity}} (He= 0. 746) and did not present a significant increase of homozygous individuals (F IS ~ 0). However, the short tandem repeats, AHT 5, ASB 2, HTG 10 and VHL 20, were not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P-value< 0. 05). Genetic relationships between this population and other well known horse breeds showed that Appaloosa horses from Argentina could have had their origin in the horses of the Nez Perce's people in Idaho while other Appaloosa horses may have had influences from Andalusian and Lusitano breeds. This <b>closed</b> <b>breeding</b> population conserves an important degree of Appaloosa genetic diversity and notwithstanding its particular breeding characteristics, represents a valuable genetic resource for conservation...|$|R

40|$|P>On {{the basis}} of {{simulations}} and genealogical data of ten dog breeds, three popular mating practices (popular sire effect, line breeding, <b>close</b> <b>breeding)</b> were investigated along with their effects on the dissemination of genetic disorders. Our {{results showed that the}} use of sires in these ten breeds is clearly unbalanced. Depending on the breed, the effective number of sires represented between 33 % and 70 % {{of the total number of}} sires. Mating between close relatives was also found to be quite common, and the percentage of dogs inbred after two generations ranged from 1 % to about 8 %. A more or less long-term genetic differentiation, linked to line breeding practices, was also emphasized in most breeds. F(IT) index based on gene dropping proved to be efficient in differentiating the effects of the different mating practices, and it ranged from - 1. 3 % to 3. 2 % when real founders were used to begin a gene dropping process. Simulation results confirmed that the popular sire practice leads to a dissemination of genetic disorders. Under a realistic scenario, regarding the imbalance in the use of sires, the dissemination risk was indeed 4. 4 times higher than under random mating conditions. In contrast, line breeding and <b>close</b> <b>breeding</b> practices tend to decrease the risk of the dissemination of genetic disorders...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTwo main {{paternity}} assurance {{strategies are}} generally found in birds: mate guarding and frequent copulations. The latter is expected particularly in {{species such as}} raptors that cannot guard their mates efficiently because of ecological constraints, such as frequent courtship feeding. I investigated the prelaying behaviour of red kites, in which the males courtship feed. I compared pair behaviour in situations of varying breeding density and simulated male territorial intrusions by presenting decoys. Males' certainty of paternity was likely to decrease with increasing breeding density, because of the proximity of other males and more frequent male territorial intrusions during the presumed fertile period. The percentage of time spent by males within their breeding territory during the prelaying period {{was positively related to}} the number of <b>close</b> <b>breeding</b> neighbours, suggesting territory surveillance and mate guarding. The kites copulated frequently and over a long period. Copulation frequency prior to and during laying increased with breeding density, and in isolated pairs in response to simulated male territorial intrusions. The results support the idea of paternity assurance through frequent copulations during the presumed fertile period of the female, and suggest that early copulation activity is related to functions other than fertilization, such as pair bonding or mate assessment...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} was analyzed among spotted paca (Agouti paca) from three commercial flocks located in Brazil.

40|$|Swine {{production}} {{has evolved over}} the last century resulting in the loss of biodiversity among breeds utilized by commercial producers. Only a handful of breeds are used extensively by these producers, with many swine breeds facing extinction due to lack of popularity. These breeds, often called heritage breeds, are not without value, they simply lack many traits seen by popular commercial breeds, such as fast growth rate, leanness, and large litters. Valued by small farms for hardiness and self sufficiency, heritage breeds are still at risk of extinction due to small population numbers and lack of pedigree data. Maintaining accurate pedigrees reduces the chance of producers breeding closely related individuals. Such <b>close</b> <b>breeding</b> can result in a concentration of undesirable traits that ultimately reduce the overall health of a population or breed. This research estimates levels of relationship between individuals within a breed based solely on information from an individual's DNA. Comparing results among 7 heritage breeds and 3 commercial breeds of pigs revealed higher levels of relation between individuals from heritage breeds versus commercial breeds. Inbreeding values were also higher for individuals from heritage breeds, indicating a mating between related individuals occurred somewhere in their pedigree. When access to complete pedigrees is not possible, as is the case for many heritage breeds, DNA can provide information for producers to make educated breeding decisions. Maintaining low levels of inbreeding and reducing breeding between closely related individuals can help preserve genetic diversity within a breed. By preserving genetic diversity, a breed stands a better chance of maintaining healthy genetic traits and surviving for future generations...|$|E

Estudou-se a diversidade genética de pacas (Agouti paca) de três plantéis comerciais no Brasil. Como o genoma desta espécie é desconhecido, utilizaram-se o polimorfismo de DNA amplificado ao acaso e reação em cadeia da polimerase (RAPD-PCR). Dez primers selecionados geraram 60 bandas polimórficas. A variabilidade genética inter e intrapopulações estimada pela análise de variância molecular (AMOVA) foi de 12, 55 e 87, 45 %, respectivamente. A menor distância de Nei encontrada foi de 11, 76 % entre as populações de Carangola (CG) e São Francisco do Glória (SF). Este valor pode ser explicado pelo intercâmbio de matrizes e reprodutores que já ocorre entre esses dois criatórios geograficamente próximos entre si. Na análise dos componentes principais, foram observados grupos bem estruturados e definidos, agregando indivíduos à sua população de origem, com algumas exceções. A diversidade foi menor na população São Francisco que em Carangola e Castelo (CS). Esse resultado sugere que, em criatórios com 5 a 6 dezenas de animais (CG e CS), a variabilidade se mantém melhor que naquele com cerca de uma dúzia de animais (SF). A técnica de RAPD-PCR mostrou-se informativa para quantificar a variabilidade genética entre e intrapopulações de pacas.

40|$|Wisser, Randall J. The genetic {{architecture}} underlying {{response to}} artificial selection {{has not been}} widely characterized so far. Elsewhere, an experimental framework has been proposed that combines association mapping and selection mapping (analysis of allele frequency change) to characterize the genetic basis of crop improvement in recurrently selected populations. However, the approach {{has not yet been}} applied. This study concerns the performance of the association mapping component of the framework based on extensive computer simulation. Populations subjected to short-term recurrent selection have an evident basis for coancestry (family-level genetic relatedness), which needs to be controlled for during association analysis to limit false positive associations and minimize bias in the estimation of allele effects. Armed with the knowledge of a population???s founders, a founder-adjusted identity-by-state (FAIBS) estimator was proposed herein for calculating coefficients of coancestry specifically in <b>closed</b> <b>breeding</b> populations under recurrent selection. Weights based on IBS information of the founders were used to arrive at probabilities of identity-bydescent for the derived population. A whole genome simulator was developed in R to mimic multi-generational plant breeding populations along with their genotypic and phenotypic values. Forward simulations were used to generate founders of a population based on demographic and evolutionary parameters specific to maize. Using a specified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele-frequency distribution and under different selection intensities and trait heritabilities, closed-breeding populations under recurrent selection for a fixed number of generations were generated from these founders. The SNP genotypic information for "metapopulations" formed from samples drawn across generations was used to compare the performance of FA-IBS and two other estimators of coancestry (simple IBS and Loiselle) in terms of accuracy, precision, and correlation with the expected coancestry, along with the power of QTL detection and proportion of type-I errors. Results showed that selection had a marked impact on coancestry and on association mapping inference. Relative to a defined expectation, FA-IBS and IBS produced similar results while Loiselle produced quite different results. Using FA-IBS, a maximum of ~ 85 % power was observed in selected populations for QTL that explained the greatest amount (15 - 18 %) of genetic variation. However, selection also caused a corresponding increase in false positive associations relative to populations under pure drift. In general, association mapping was found to be applicable to <b>closed</b> <b>breeding</b> populations under recurrent selection as long as the change in coancestry due to selection was accounted for. With further improvements in accuracy of coancestry estimates and consequently in model fit, better control over false positive associations could be achieved for selected populations.

40|$|Horses were domesticated {{from the}} Eurasian steppes 5, 000 - 6, 000 years ago. Since then, {{the use of}} horses for transportation, warfare, and agriculture, as well as {{selection}} for desired traits and fitness, has resulted in diverse populations distributed across the world, {{many of which have}} become or {{are in the process of}} becoming formally organized into <b>closed,</b> <b>breeding</b> populations (breeds). This report describes the use of a genome-wide set of autosomal SNPs and 814 horses from 36 breeds to provide the first detailed description of equine breed diversity. F(ST) calculations, parsimony, and distance analysis demonstrated relationships among the breeds that largely reflect geographic origins and known breed histories. Low levels of population divergence were observed between breeds that are relatively early on in the process of breed development, and between those with high levels of within-breed diversity, whether due to large population size, ongoing outcrossing, or large within-breed phenotypic diversity. Populations with low within-breed diversity included those which have experienced population bottlenecks, have been under intense selective pressure, or are closed populations with long breed histories. These results provide new insights into the relationships among and the diversity within breeds of horses. In addition these results will facilitate future genome-wide association studies and investigations into genomic targets of selection...|$|R
40|$|Five {{species of}} phocid seal of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica come ashore {{occasionally}} {{on the southern}} Australian coast but do not breed there. We document records (specimens and sightings) of visits to South Australia (SA) by southern phocids from 1883 until August 2011. We used records from the SA Museum, reports from coastal officers of SA Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the DENR fauna database, information from the public, the literature and newspapers. Thirty-six southern elephant seal records included two births, in November 1932 and October 1986. The latter pup suckled for 20 days and then stayed ashore for eight weeks; both are similar to average durations at Macquarie Island. Of 33 dated records, 31 were between August and April, when elephant seals at Macquarie Island (the <b>closest</b> <b>breeding</b> site) are ashore to breed or moult. A recognisable male on Kangaroo Island has been sighted often over 10 years to 2010. Of the ice-breeding species, there were 54 leopard seal records. All of 40 dated records were between June and December, with the maximum (12) in August, similar to the seasonal distribution in Tasmania. There were five records of crabeater seals, one of a Ross seal, and one of a Weddell seal. Peter D. Shaughnessy, Catherine M. Kemper and John K. Lin...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{growth hormone}} (GH) {{receptor}} binding was compared in normal and sex-linked dwarfs (SLD) from both Hubbard and Cornell strain chickens. At 6, 8, and 20 weeks of age, hepatic GH receptor binding in the Hubbard SLD chickens {{was significantly lower}} than that of normal fast-growing birds. At 20 weeks of age, only 2 of 22 SLD chickens in the Hubbard broiler strain showed positive binding at a high enough level to allow for Scatchard analysis. The affinity constants and binding capacities of these two SLD chickens were numerically (but not significantly) lower than those of the normal fast-growing birds. We further examined hepatic GH receptor binding in two closely related White Leghorn strains of chickens that have been maintained as <b>closed</b> <b>breeding</b> populations for many years. We observed no detectable hepatic GH binding in the Cornell SLD chickens (N= 20), as compared to the normal-growing control strain (K strain). In both SLD strains, pretreatment with 4 M MgCl 2 did not enhance GH binding, suggesting that there was no endogenous GH binding to the receptor. Based on these data, we suggest that the lack, or greatly reduced number, of GH receptors may be a major contributing factor to the dwarfism observed in these strains. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
