50|$|The {{course has}} {{undergone}} significant changes since the 1980s when a <b>chipwood</b> track {{was put in}} on the outer half of the course proper and a major redevelopment in late 2004 to become the present training centre with all training of horses ceasing at Elwick Racecourse along with the relocation of Elwick-based trainers to stables built along the back straight of the track.|$|E
50|$|Currently, One big {{industry}} {{is under construction}} which is aimed to produce triple products viz: sugar, ethanol, and <b>Chipwood.</b> This {{may be a good}} opportunity for the area as it could create vast employment opportunity. Likewise, service sector is beneficiary from this industry after its accomplishment. Arjo, has served as a capital of the area for more than 130 years. Dano Bera, the local leader (Moti) of the area had been administering the Area (Leqa Dulacha in her earlier name) making Arjo as his center. Hence, she had been among few urban center's of West Oromia. Neftegna Rulers like Ras Mekonnen Demissew had also occupied and ruled the area for longer times considering the town as a strategic for war.|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{mineralization}} was monitored in the {{humus layer}} and soil in an undisturbed and harvested beech (Nothofagus) spp. {{forest in the}} West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. To assess the effects of different harvesting regimes and intensities of burning on N mineralization, treatments applied were (i) Podocarpus spp. clear-cutting; (ii) Podocarpus spp. clear-cutting and prescribed burning; (iii) harvesting to <b>chipwood</b> standard (10 -cm dbh); and (iv) <b>chipwood</b> logging and prescribed burning. Nitrate {{was found to be}} negligible in fresh and field-incubated humus and soil samples in the undisturbed beech forest. Ammonium predominated in both the humus layer and soil. Clear-cutting, and clear-cutting and burning increased NH₄⁺-N. The burning effect was confined mainly to the humus layer...|$|E
40|$|The growth {{response}} of Pinus radiata D. Don seedlings was measured for 3 {{years after the}} clearfelling and harvesting of a Nothofagus spp. forest using the following treatments: podocarp logging only; podocarp logging and burning; logging of all tree species to <b>chipwood</b> standard (1 (} cm dbh); chip wood logging and burning; with or without fertiliser and/or herbicide treatments. Seedling mortality 3 years after planting exceeded 55 % in the unburned treatments but was less than 39 % in the burned treatments. Height and diameter growth was better in the burned than the unburned treatments, and in the <b>chipwood</b> rather than with the podocarp logged plots. Fertiliser application produced no measurable effect on seedling growth rates but herbicide application induced a small growth increase. Nutrient levels in the soil and foliage were adequate {{for the needs of}} P. radia,ta. Few of the interactions between burning, logging method, fertiliser, and herbicide application were significant...|$|E
40|$|Interest in European aspen (Populus tremula L.) has {{increased}} {{in recent years as}} a result of efforts to restore and extend native woodland, and to diversify the range of species used in forestry plantations. Aspen is a straightforward tree to manage; it is of considerable ecological value and capable of producing utilizable timber. Planting of aspen in native woodland is cur-rently limited by a shortage of plants of Scottish origin. Propagation from seed, whilst possible, has not been practised, and recent efforts to produce stock have concentrated on vegetative means. The use of aspen as a component of plantation forestry could be increased on appropri-ate sites; it is an excellent amenity species and its timber is currently acceptable as <b>chipwood</b> and could complement the production of poplar timber in the lowlands. However, on the basis of limited data, growth rates and stem form of aspen in Scotland appear to be rather poorer than on the European continent where aspen is a significant timber producing species. More would also need to be known about its susceptibility to disease before its timber production potential could be evaluated properly. Introduction is Scotland's only native poplar and an impor...|$|E
40|$|Mangrove at Bintuni bay offers various {{services}} to indigenous communities from ecology, social, and economic. Mangrove {{also could be}} harvested accordingly to optimize contributions to indigenous communities welfares. This paper highlights implementation of customary right compensation (CRC), and Forest Villages Development programs (FVDP) of mangrove company at Bintuni Bay, Papua Barat. Company reports and documents related to CRC and FVDP from 1988 to June 2013 were reviewed and analyzed. Field works were conducted to examine the implementation of both programs at four villages of two districts. Sustained mangrove harvest for <b>chipwood</b> production in Bintuni bay for more than 25 years is the most outstanding achievement of mangrove utilization and management in Indonesia. Huge amount of expenditure have been spent out, and given to indigenous communities through the CRC and FVDP programs, respectively. These cover from economic, social, and environmental related programs, manufactured public facilities, scholarships, and others. However, the indigenous communities are remained poor, and failed of being self-sufficient community. It clearly impresses that the main goals to improve the welfare, prosperity of indigenous people are considerable failed. It is presumably that social culture systems, and subsistence agriculture practices contribute to the failing these programs. Mostly, forest communities in Papua are practicing subsistence agriculture, hunting, heavily relying on their surrounding natural resources, and spending al...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the break-even price at a 6 percent and 10 percent real interest rate for "intensive " and "minimally managed" scenarios for managing eucalypt energy plantations. The break-even price {{is greater than the}} average stumpage price reported for firewood and <b>chipwood</b> by the State Board of Equalization. However, a conversion surplus approach shows that eucalypt firewood plantations are profitable for both the intensive and minimally managed scenario. For plantations producing chips for energy, only the minimally managed scenario, with yields greater than 58 dry tons per acre at harvest, appears to be profitable, assuming delivered chip prices of $ 35 per bone dry ton. The benefit-cost ratio for a commercial planting of eucalypts at the Concord Naval Weapons Station, California, showed that a return of at least 10 percent on establishment costs was highly probable with proper choice of species. An evaluation of the economic feasibility of investment in a eucalypt energy plantation must involve an assessment of the costs of the various cultural practices (planting, weed control, irrigation), the costs of processing the standing tree into a usable form (logging costs, transportation costs, chipping, cutting to firewood length) and the returns expected from the sale of the processed product (firewood, chips), all compounded or discounted to a constant point in time at an interest rate {{selected on the basis of}} management objectives. Presented below are two different analyses of eucalypt energy plantations. First, two possible management scenarios are presented, drawn from a survey of planting and cultural practices throughout California, and a "break-even " price is calculated. This break-even price is the necessary return on a cord of firewood or ton of chips, to earn a given rate of return on money invested in the plantation. The second analysis calculates a benefit-cost ratio from an actual case study of a commercial planting of eucalypts at the U. S...|$|E
