5000|$|Shaftesbury was {{the head}} of the Commission from its {{founding}} in 1845 until his death in 1885. The Lunacy <b>Commission</b> <b>was</b> made up of eleven Metropolitan Commissioners. The <b>Commission</b> <b>was</b> monumental as it was not only a full-time <b>commission,</b> but it <b>was</b> also salaried for six of its members. The six members of the <b>commission</b> that <b>were</b> full-time and salaried were made up of three members of the legal system and three members of the medical community.

5|$|The term <b>Commission</b> <b>is</b> used {{either in}} the narrow sense of the 28-member College of Commissioners (or College) or to also include the {{administrative}} body of about 23,000 European civil servants who are split into departments called directorates-general and services.

5|$|While the <b>Commission</b> <b>is</b> the {{executive}} branch, {{the candidates are}} chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the <b>Commission</b> <b>is</b> mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E

5|$|Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, {{the year}} of the portrait. He befriended Ingres either through his son Édouard Bertin, a student of the painter, or via Étienne-Jean Delécluze, Ingres' friend and the Journals art critic. In either case the genesis of the <b>commission</b> <b>is</b> unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a {{supporter}} of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists. Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.|$|E
