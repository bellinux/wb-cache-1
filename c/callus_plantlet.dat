Intan <b>callus</b> and <b>plantlet,</b> also aluminum content of L. esculentum <b>plantlet.</b> <b>Callus</b> was induced from cotyledone of L. esculentum on Murashige & Skoog (MS) media containing 10 - 7 M NAA and 10 - 6 kinetin. The callus was then transferred step wisely at 3 weeks interval to media containing 220, 275, 330, 385, 440, 550, 825, and 1100 μM AlCl 3. The callus cultures on the control media and media with the addition of 550 μM AlCl 3 were able to regenerate and produce shoots after 8 passages of subculture. The shoots from media with the addition of 550 μM AlCl 3 were transferred into the media with addition of 825 μM AlCl 3, then to the media with 1100 μM AlCl 3. The High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that Al stress <b>callus</b> and <b>plantlets</b> contained Malic acid, but no citric and oxalic acid. The content of Malic acid in callus decreased with increasing AlCl 3 concentration from 0 to 385 μM. On the other hand, the content of Malic acid in callus increased with increasing AlCl 3 concentration from 440 μM to 1100 μM. Similarly, the content of Malic acid in root increased with increasing concentration of AlCl 3 from 550 μM to 1100 μM. The result of Neutron Activation Analysis showed that Al content in root decreased as the amount of AlCl 3 increased in the media. These results suggested that L. esculentum <b>callus</b> and <b>plantlet</b> respond to the Al stress by producing higher amount of Malic acid...|$|R

Seeds of alfalfa were sown in pots, then leaves of the seedlings were separated to blades and petioles and placed in jars containing 50 ml of the modified MS medium. For callus induction and shoot formation, modified Murshig and Skoog and B 5 were used in addition to two growth regulators being 2, 4 -D and BA In order to evaluate the salt response of the in vitro <b>callus</b> and <b>plantlets,</b> the induced calli and formed shoots in Experiment I were taken and placed on modified Murshig and Skoog mineral salts and B 5. Sodium Chloride (NaCl) at four doses (0, 3000, 6000 and 9000 ppm) were used in jars. The results of this study indicates that the best concentration of 2. 4 -D and BA to obtain higher number and weight of callus and also higher values of shoot weights can be obtained from the concentration of 2 mg L - 1 in both cases. Increasing of NaCl salt concentration in the media causes significant reduction in the seedling weight but positively correlated with Na and negatively correlated with K concentration in the seedling tissues. NaCl salt concentration of 6000 ppm was high enough to induce harmful effect on the seedling fresh weight, whereas number of generated shoots formed roots was dramatically affected by increasing NaCl concentration up to 3000 ppm and there was no shoots formed roots established afterwards.

BM supplemented with naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA, 5 mg/L) also favored callus formation. IAA failed to induce callus in all 3 species. <b>Callus</b> differentiated into <b>plantlets</b> following transfer from the BM plus 2, 4 -D induction medium to either auxin-free medium or to BM plus kinetin (0. 4 mg/L). Callus subcultured on BM plus IAA (5 mg/L) {{as well as on}} BM plus IAA (5 mg/L) plus kinetin (0. 4 mg/L) also resulted in differentiation of plantlets. BM plus NAA (5 mg/L) and BM plus NAA (5 mg/L) plus kinetin (0. 4 mg/L) produced more plantlets from C. martinii callus than from callus of the other 2 species. Results demonstrated that kinetin was not essential for either callus induction or plant regeneration. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
40|$|In vitro culture {{response}} was assessed in three varieties of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) for optimum <b>callus</b> induction and <b>plantlet</b> regeneration. <b>Callus</b> induction was achieved within seven- ten days and plantlet regeneration {{was observed in}} 20 days across varieties. Presence of 2. 0 mg/l BAP and 0. 5 mg/l Kn produced maximum shootlets. N 6 medium displayed the best regeneration percentage, plantlet regeneration, maximum number and length of shootlets, while MS produced tall whole plantlets. Appropriate levels of gelling agents, phytohormones and carbon sources and adjuvents like agar and agarose (2 and 0. 8 %), Kn (2. 0 mg/l) and IAA (0. 5 mg/l), glucose and sucrose (1. 5 % each), folic acid (0. 25 mg/l), biotin (0. 5 mg/l), coconut water (5 %) and use of young hypocotyl explants were found to enhance plantlet regeneration and length of plantlets. For whole plantlet regeneration proximal end of cotyledons were most compatible. Plain half strength of MS {{was found to be}} the best rooting medium, however addition of IAA (1. 0 mg/l) was found essential to induce longer roots...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} detailed reproducible methods for {{the transformation of}} Dendranthema X grandiflora Shuhou-no-chikara (standard) and Lineker (spray) stem internode Thin Cell Layers (TCLs) and conventional stem internode explants, using intron-containing and intron-less plasmids. Discussed methodologies and results have used GUS reporter, nptII selector genes, as well as pac 1 / 2, 5 -A/RNaseL genes coding for virus/viroid resistance. Transformation efficiencies are reported at the kanamycin selection (<b>callus</b> formation and <b>plantlet</b> rooting), GUS, PCR, Southern and Western levels. Notes on regeneration improvement {{through the use of}} TCLs, as well as the effective use of sonication for both regeneration and generation of transformants, stimulation of Agro infection and elimination of Agrobacterium, are included. Protocols are provided for the use of scanning electron microscopy to confirm developmental processes, as well as flow cytometry to check for cell competence and division stages. The difficulties still experienced in the genetic transformation of chrysanthemum globally by researchers require a detailed protocol that exposes the subtleties in methodology.

40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{environmental}} factors affecting growth and yield of sorghum in arid and semi-arid areas of the world. In vitro selection of Sorghum bicolor for drought tolerance was undertaken by the use of somaclonal variation. The experiment was carried out with a collection of sixteen sorghum genotypes and tested in a completely randomized design. Data were recorded at five different PEG 6000 (polyethylene glycol) levels (0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 % (w/v) treatments)) on coleoptile length (CL), root length (RL), shoot dry weight (SDW), root dry weight (RDW), root number (RN) and statistically analyzed for significant differences. Significant differences were observed among the genotypes, treatments and their interactions for the evaluated plant traits suggesting a great amount of variability for drought tolerance in sorghum. In general, embryogenic <b>callus</b> induction and <b>plantlet</b> regeneration was found to be indirectly proportional to increased PEG concentrations. By taking into consideration all the measured traits, Mann Whitney rank sum test revealed that 76 T 1 # 23 and Teshale followed by Gambella- 1107 and Melkam showed better drought stress tolerance while Chelenko appeared to be drought sensitive...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} the USDA Biotechnology Laboratory, Biotechnology Department, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh to observe the effect of NAA and BAP on callus formation and regeneration from leaf and internodal segment explants. Five levels of each of NAA (0, 1. 25, 2. 5, 5 and 10 mg l‾ 1) and BAP (0, 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 mg l‾ 1) were applied to MS media for callus induction as well as plantlet regeneration. Twenty explants were cultured in each combination. Leaf showed better performance in <b>callus</b> induction and <b>plantlet</b> regeneration. The highest percentage of callus (95 %) was induced with 2. 5 mg l‾ 1 NAA + 2 mg l‾ 1 BAP and also minimum time (8. 13 days) was required for callus induction in the same concentrations. The percentage of regeneration showed the highest value (80 %) with 2. 5 mg l‾ 1 NAA + 2 mg l‾ 1 BAP of all the combinations. It was also observed that callus derived from leaf produced plantlets in a shortest period of time (23. 68 days) compared to that from stem (28. 96 days) ...|$|R
