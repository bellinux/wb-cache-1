5|$|After riders {{board the}} train and lower their restraint, {{attached}} to the restraint is a small screen containing the logo of the ride and five categories of songs the rider <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> from. The song that the rider picked begins as the train climbs the vertical lift hill. Depending on the song, it may not begin {{at the beginning and}} end early as the total cycle time of the roller coaster is 1 minute and 39 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Council {{activities}} include attempts to hold advertisers {{accountable for the}} content of the programs they sponsor, encouraging the development of what the council considers to be responsible, family-friendly entertainment, pressuring broadcasters to stop and/or limit television content the council claims to be harmful to children, as well as pressuring cable operators to unbundle cable channels so consumers <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> and pay for only the channels they want to watch.|$|E
50|$|Most {{people get}} their {{television}} either through Shaw Direct, Bell TV or over-the-air. Five channels <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> up reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional five channels <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> up semi-reliably. There {{are at least}} 14 channels that <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> up over-the-air only during sunny days where clouds are absent.|$|R
50|$|Klondike {{is able to}} fire {{his weapon}} {{straight}} or diagonally up or down. Some enemies are harmless, but obstructive while others cause Klondike damage on impact or with projectiles. Traps are also present throughout the levels. Canisters <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> up for health, stars <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> up for powerups (or the occasional harmful stars) and guns <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> up for ammunition.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
50|$|Transmitters {{located near}} to {{international}} borders may overspill {{into a large}} part of a neighbouring country, for example the signal from Republic of Ireland broadcaster 2RN's Clermont Carn site <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> up in a large swathe of Northern Ireland, and vice versa BBC broadcasts <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> up in the Republic.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{geographic}} {{constraints and}} the waning nature of over-the-air television, only one channel (CIII-DT) can be reliably received at all times. Four over-the-air channels <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> up semi-reliably while {{at least eight}} other channels <b>can</b> only be <b>picked</b> up on clear sunny days.|$|R
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
5|$|On-campus {{housing is}} {{guaranteed}} {{for all four}} years as an undergraduate. Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) share housing in the on-campus residence halls. First-year students usually {{live in one of}} the large residence halls situated around South Lawn: Hartley Hall, Wallach Hall (originally Livingston Hall), John Jay Hall, Furnald Hall or Carman Hall. Upperclassmen participate in a room selection process, wherein students <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> to live in a mix of either corridor- or apartment-style housing with their friends. The Columbia University School of General Studies and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is divided into}} several missions that the player has to complete while fighting enemies and completing objectives. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to exploring areas and recovering items such as keycards, explosives or laptop computers, which are useful to hack into electronic devices. The player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up new weapons, health and ammunition dropped by enemies if necessary. The game also features several mini-games, including a driving level and a sniper mission, as well as numerous boss battles that the player has to defeat in order to progress through the next level. By beating any of these mini-games, the player can access them in the game's extras menu.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} Diermot's {{movements and}} actions with a mouse or a gamepad. Diermot <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up various objects; these {{can then be}} used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. He can also engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be}} done to solve the puzzles or progress the plot. A few simple action-oriented battle scenes are also included.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout is {{a racing}} game that {{is set in}} 2052, where players compete in the F3600 anti-gravity racing league. The game allows the player to pilot one of a {{selection}} of craft in races on several different tracks. There are four racing teams to choose from, and two ships for each team. Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, mass, and turning radius. By piloting their craft over power-up pads found on the tracks, the player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up various weapons and power-ups such as shields, turbo boosts, mines, shock waves, rockets, or missiles. The power-ups allow the player to either protect their craft or disrupt the competitors' craft.|$|E
5|$|At the plantation, Northup meets Patsey, {{a favored}} slave who <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota, whom Epps {{regularly}} rapes and abuses. Some time later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable {{to work his}} fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts {{to use the money}} to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York State. Armsby agrees, and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In {{the middle of the night}} Epps wakes Solomon and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents.|$|E

5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book Guy {{to publish}} a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E
5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout the zones and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more rings. In these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players are rewarded with a Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with the best possible ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|Mario's {{abilities}} in Super Mario 64 {{are far more}} diverse than those of previous Mario games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and {{three times in a}} row, respectively), long jump and backflip. There are also special maneuvers, such as wall jumping—jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high. The player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.|$|E

5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. Artists <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.|$|E
5|$|The Last Story is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game (ARPG) incorporating elements of tactical and stealth gameplay. The player controls main protagonist Zael {{for the majority}} of the game. Zael is primarily controlled using the Wii Remote from a fixed third-person view. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, or the Classic Controller. The game's main hub is a public house on Lazulis Island, which also houses a save point for players. Lazulis City is the main setting for most of the game, which provides the player with story-related and side quests. In addition to environments within missions such as ruins and forests where enemies are encountered and fought, there is an arena where the player can improve the party and their combat abilities. If the party is victorious, the party <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up money and items from non-playable characters betting on the fight.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E
