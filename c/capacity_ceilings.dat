It includes {{the design of a}} typical middle floor structure of the building and the design of eccentric braces which carry seismic load. Apart from that, fire analysis of the typical middle floor is performed with a simple method od fire-resistant design by which a beneficial effect of the membrane on the <b>capacity</b> <b>ceilings</b> during fire was taken into account...|$|E

40|$|International audience—Radio-frequency (RF) {{impairments}} in the transceiver hardware of communication systems (e. g., phase noise (PN), high power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities, or in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalance) can severely degrade {{the performance of}} traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although calibration algorithms can partially compensate these impairments, the remaining distortion still has substantial impact. Despite this, most prior works have not analyzed this type of distortion. In this paper, we investigate the impact of residual transceiver hardware impairments on the MIMO system performance. In particular, we consider a transceiver impairment model, which has been experimentally validated, and derive analytical ergodic capacity expressions for both exact and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We demonstrate that the capacity saturates in the high-SNR regime, thereby creating a finite <b>capacity</b> <b>ceiling.</b> We also present a linear approximation for the ergodic capacity in the low-SNR regime, and show that impairments have only a second-order impact on the capacity. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of transceiver impairments on large-scale MIMO systems; interestingly, we prove that if one increases the number of antennas at one side only, the capacity behaves similar to the finite-dimensional case. On the contrary, {{if the number of}} antennas on both sides increases with a fixed ratio, the <b>capacity</b> <b>ceiling</b> vanishes; thus, impairments cause only a bounded offset in the capacity compared to the ideal transceiver hardware case...|$|R
40|$|The main {{thrust of}} the {{research}} described in this paper {{was to develop a}} simplified method of accurately estimating the impact of mixed convection on the cooling <b>capacity</b> of a <b>ceiling</b> radiant panel in mechanically ventilated spaces. The simplified correlation for mixed convection heat transfer was derived from established mixed and natural convection correlations. It was found that the total <b>capacity</b> of <b>ceiling</b> radiant cooling panels can be enhanced in mixed convection situations by 5 % to 35 % under normal operating temperatures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study performed to develop a computational model of cooling ceiling systems. This one has to be used in situ, as diagnosis tool in commissioning process {{in order to determine the}} main operating conditions of the system in cooling mode. The model considers the cooling ceiling as a fin. Only the dry regime is considered. From ceiling and room dimensions, material description of the cooling ceiling and measurement of supply water mass flow rate and air and water temperatures, the model calculates the cooling <b>ceiling</b> <b>capacity,</b> <b>ceiling</b> surface average temperature and water exhaust temperature. Fin efficiency, mixed convection close to the cooling ceiling (generated by the ventilation system) and panel perforations influence are studied. A series of experimental results (Laboratory test conditions) got on four types of cooling ceilings are used in order to validate the model...|$|R

The proposal includes the choice of the structural system, the choice of walls, windows, designing footings, staircases, numerous parking areas, flat roof drainage, management of rainwater. The specialized section is designed ventilating buildings with VRF systems heating / cooling with heat pumping. A check is a calculation of bearing <b>capacity</b> of <b>ceiling</b> construction...|$|R
30|$|The {{workload}} {{should always}} be bounded by the ceiling and the floor capacities. If the workload exceeds the <b>ceiling</b> <b>capacity</b> (i.e., under-provisioning condition), then a SLA violation occurs. In addition, if the workload {{is less than the}} floor capacity (i.e., over-provisioning condition) then, an excessive amount of VMs is being used.|$|R
30|$|However, most {{research}} in the area of satellite relaying assumes that the transceiver hardware of the network node is perfect. This cannot be achieved in practical communication systems. In practice, hardware suffers from several types of impairments, e.g., phase noise, I/Q imbalance, and high power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities [11 – 13]. The impact of hardware impairments on single-hop wireless communication was broadly investigated in [14 – 16]. In addition, as indicated in [17 – 20], there is a fundamental <b>capacity</b> <b>ceiling</b> due to the hardware impairments, which cannot be improved by increasing the transmission power. In [17], the authors analyzed the performance of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system; the capacity and the outage probability of the system were derived. In [18], the authors analyzed the system performance of the full-duplex relaying network and found that the system capacity had an upper bound in the presence of hardware impairments. In [19], the opportunistic and partial relaying selection was used in which a new way was derived to obtain the closed-form expression for the system performance. In [20], the authors analyzed the impact of hardware impairments on the fixed-gain AF relaying Nakagami-m fading channels. Above all, the system channel they analyzed was just a Rayleigh or Nakagami-m channel; there are scarcely any papers that analyzed the effect of hardware impairments on the shadowed-Rician channel.|$|R
25|$|The {{first of}} thirty Curtiss C-46 Commandos (an {{unproven}} cargo transport whose performance was significantly {{superior to the}} C-47's in cargo <b>capacity</b> and <b>ceiling)</b> arrived in India on 21 April 1943. In May the 22nd Ferrying Group began C-46 operations from the still uncompleted base at Jorhat, which had a concrete runway. In June, {{despite the fact that}} the British—and later the U.S. Army's Services of Supply—failed to complete construction of all-weather runways at Mohanbari and Sookerating, the activation of the 28th, 29th, and 30th Transport Groups proceeded, an attempt to expand the C-46's role to meet projected levels of tonnage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} network-flow {{approach}} for characterizing interim-allocation rules {{that can be}} implemented by ex post allocations. Our method {{can be used to}} characterize feasible interim allocations in general multi-unit auctions where agents face <b>capacity</b> constraints, both <b>ceilings</b> and floors.

2500|$|Four reporters left to file stories {{after the}} first two taxi runs while the {{remaining}} press stayed for the final test run of the day. After picking up speed on the channel facing Cabrillo Beach the Hercules lifted off, remaining airborne for 26 seconds at [...] off the water at a speed of [...] for about one mile (1.6km). At this altitude the aircraft still experienced ground effect. The brief flight proved to detractors that Hughes' (now unneeded) masterpiece was flight-worthy—thus vindicating the use of government funds. The Spruce Goose, however, never flew again. Its lifting <b>capacity</b> and <b>ceiling</b> were never tested. A full-time crew of 300 workers, all sworn to secrecy, maintained the aircraft in flying condition in a climate-controlled hangar. The company reduced the crew to 50 workers in 1962 and then disbanded it after Hughes' death in 1976.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{components}} {{go into the}} overall planning of a distribution center {{in order to maximize}} its efficiency. If the distribution center relies on a conveyor system suspended from the ceiling, consideration needs to be given to the weight-bearing <b>capacity</b> of the <b>ceiling</b> joists. If the conveyor system runs along the floor, then consideration needs to be given in the design stage to the placement of columns, particularly as they relate to the flue space between pallet rack frames. Other planning considerations include attention to such areas as slotting, product replenishment, storage media, and power requirements.|$|R
2500|$|The company refined the design, {{taking it}} in two {{separate}} directions. The first was a jet-powered version; [...] "Predator B-002" [...] was fitted with a Williams FJ44-2A turbofan engine with [...] thrust. It had payload <b>capacity</b> of , a <b>ceiling</b> of [...] and endurance of 12 hours. The USAF ordered two airframes for evaluation, delivered in 2007. The first two airframes delivered with prototypes B-001 and B-002 (now in the USAF museum at Wright-Patterson AFB). B-002 was originally equipped with the FJ-44 engine but it was removed and a TPE-331-10T was installed so that the USAF could take delivery of two aircraft in the same configuration.|$|R
50|$|By early 1990s {{numerous}} new nightclubs opened along Richmond Street West and Adelaide Street West {{as well as}} in adjoining streets {{within the}} area bound by Front St., Queen Street West, Bathurst St., and Simcoe St. all of which was a consequence of low rent in the said area and Khabouth's success with Stilife there. Among them were: Go-Go (a three-level superclub opened by the Ballinger brothers in 1990 across the street from Stilife at the north-west corner of Richmond & Duncan), 23 Hop (a minimalist all-ages club opened by Wesley Thuro during summer 1990 in a warehouse down the street from Stilife at 318 Richmond that would soon become a catalyst for the Toronto rave scene), Venus, Klub Max (a huge venue started in 1990 by Nick DiDonato and Angelo Belluz in a heritage building on Peter St. just south of King Street West that previously housed DiDonato's P.M. Toronto sports bar and restaurant), LimeLight (in 1993 by businessman Zisi Konstantinou at 250 Adelaide Street West near the corner with Duncan Street), My Apartment (a club in an old shoe factory building at 81 Peter Street playing Top 40 music), and Club 606. At the same time, Khabouth for his part attempted, and mostly failed, to expand into fine dining with his involvement in several restaurants — Boa Cafe, Oceans, Acrobat, and Bellair Cafe — quickly ending, either via him pulling out of the venture or the venues folding. Most of those restaurants were in the Yorkville upscale neighbourhood where in 1992 he also opened Skorpio nightclub that closed by 1994. In late 1995 after eight years of successful operation, Khabouth sold Stilife, describing the decision as being motivated by his desire to expand and the inability to do so at the Richmond and Duncan location due to space, <b>capacity,</b> and <b>ceiling</b> height constraints.|$|R
