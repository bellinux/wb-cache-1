5|$|A <b>core</b> is a graph with no {{homomorphism}} to any proper subgraph. Equivalently, a <b>core</b> can {{be defined}} as a graph that does not retract to any proper subgraph.|$|E
5|$|After {{the star}} has fused the helium of its <b>core,</b> the carbon product fuses {{producing}} a hot <b>core</b> with an outer shell of fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that parallels the other described red giant phase, {{but with a}} higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo {{a brief period of}} carbon fusion before the <b>core</b> becomes degenerate.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a <b>core</b> region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this <b>core</b> are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the <b>core,</b> resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the <b>core.</b> Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E

5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the <b>core,</b> they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the <b>core.</b> Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the <b>core.</b> Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the <b>core.</b> Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium <b>core.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} fuel at the <b>core</b> of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it {{evolved into a}} red giant. The inner <b>core</b> contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium <b>core.</b> To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the <b>core</b> reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star. That is, it belonged {{to a group of}} stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert <b>core</b> of carbon and oxygen. When helium was exhausted in the <b>core</b> a helium-burning shell formed in addition to {{the hydrogen}}-burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the asymptotic giant branch, or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.) If the star had sufficient mass, in time carbon fusion could begin in the <b>core,</b> producing oxygen, neon and magnesium.|$|E

40|$|International audienceReconfigurable <b>cores</b> support post-release updates which shortens {{time-to-market}} while extending circuits’ lifespan. Reconfigurable <b>cores</b> can {{be provided}} as hard <b>cores</b> (ASIC) or soft <b>cores</b> (RTL). Soft reconfigurable <b>cores</b> outperform hard reconfigurable <b>cores</b> by preserving the ASIC synthesis flow, {{at the cost of}} lowering scalability but also exacerbating timing closure issues. This article tackles these two issues and introduces the ARGen generator that produces scalable soft reconfigurable <b>cores.</b> The architectural template relies on injecting flip-flops into the interconnect, to favor easy and accurate timing estimation. The <b>cores</b> are compliant with the academic standard for place and route environment, making ARGen a one stop shopping point for whoever needs exploitable soft reconfigurable <b>cores...</b>|$|R
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the <b>core</b> increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium <b>core</b> becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium <b>core</b> fusion starts before the <b>core</b> becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the <b>core</b> radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the <b>core,</b> and the <b>core</b> radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} <b>core</b> within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the <b>core</b> radius.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{nearly half}} the {{hydrogen}} at the <b>core</b> has been consumed, with {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the <b>core</b> to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the <b>core</b> pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E
40|$|We analyse the {{ellipticity}} {{distribution of}} molecular <b>cores</b> {{for information on}} the underlying three-dimensional shapes and the differences between starless and protostellar <b>cores.</b> We find that starless <b>cores</b> (those without IRAS sources) are significantly more elliptical than protostellar <b>cores</b> (with IRAS sources). Starless <b>cores</b> can be well fitted with a single triaxial shape, while for protostellar <b>cores</b> it is less clear. We speculate on the reasons for the difference...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two broad}} {{applications}} for ferrite <b>cores</b> which differ {{in size and}} frequency of operation: signal transformers, which are of small size and higher frequencies, and power transformers, which are of large size and lower frequencies. <b>Cores</b> can also be classified by shape, such as toroidal <b>cores,</b> shell <b>cores</b> or cylindrical <b>cores.</b>|$|R
40|$|Classification {{problems}} have been introduced by M. Ziegler as a generalization of promise problems. In this paper we are concerned with solvability and unsolvability questions {{with respect to a}} given set or language family, especially with <b>cores</b> of unsolvability. We generalize the results about unsolvability <b>cores</b> in promise problems to classification problems. Our main results are a characterization of unsolvability <b>cores</b> via cohesiveness and existence theorems for such <b>cores</b> in unsolvable classification problems. In contrast to promise problems we have to strengthen the conditions to assert the existence of such <b>cores.</b> In general unsolvable classification problems with more than two components exist, which possess no <b>cores,</b> even if the set family under consideration satisfies the assumptions which are necessary to prove the existence of <b>cores</b> in unsolvable promise problems. But, if one of the components is fixed we can use the results on unsolvability <b>cores</b> in promise problems, to assert the existence of such <b>cores</b> in general. In this case we speak of conditional classification problems and conditional <b>cores.</b> The existence of conditional <b>cores</b> can be related to complexity <b>cores.</b> Using this connection we can prove for language families, that conditional <b>cores</b> with recursive components exist, provided that this family admits an uniform solution for the word problem...|$|R

5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being {{found in the}} largely iron-silicon-nickel <b>core.</b> Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per billion of the crust whereas its concentration in the <b>core</b> {{is thought to be}} nearly 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the <b>core</b> may generate a substantial amount of the heat that drives plate tectonics and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the <b>core</b> region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the <b>core</b> region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a <b>core</b> collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the <b>core</b> can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the <b>core,</b> a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E
40|$|Many-core CMP scaling {{is about}} to crash into the power wall. Using data {{synthesized}} from the 2008 ITRS update, the figure above shows a growing gap {{between the number of}} Nehalem-like <b>cores</b> that fit on a die (about 100 <b>cores</b> by 2022) and the number of <b>cores</b> that can operate simultaneously under a 100 W power budget (only 27 <b>cores</b> by 2022). In future designs, the majority of <b>cores</b> will necessarily be dormant at any given time {{in order to meet the}} power budget. Concerns over programmability and parallelism aside, the future literally provides more <b>cores</b> than we can possibly use. How can we exploit this surplus of <b>cores</b> to extract more performance? Solution: Expendable <b>Cores</b> Process variation in future CMPs will render some <b>cores</b> more power efficient than others. The most efficient <b>cores</b> are precious because parallel workloads can use them to run as many threads as possible under the power limit. Less-efficient <b>cores</b> can be used as “Bubble Wrap”: They accelerate the sequential phases, sacrificing themselves to defeat Amdahl’s Law by operating at higher-than-normal voltage and frequency. The elevated voltages and temperatures will quickly wear out or “pop ” BubbleWrap <b>cores,</b> but this is not a problem, as they can be replaced from a large pool of dormant spares. Meanwhile, the precious <b>cores</b> never run above nominal voltage, and so protected from the harsh conditions under which the BubbleWrap <b>cores</b> operate, lead long and efficient lives. The following figure illustrates our vision of a BubbleWrap CMP from year 2019. It includes 14 precious <b>cores</b> that operate only at nominal voltage and are guaranteed not to burn out over the service life of the chip. It also includes 35 BubbleWrap <b>cores</b> that are microarchitecturally identical to the precious ones but are destined to live fast and die young.
