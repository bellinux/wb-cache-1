40|$|This a very {{important}} paper that should be required reading for all graduates students. Meta-regression analysis is a comprehensive and rigorous statistical summary and explanation of all comparable research findings on a given subject. “(T) he central task of meta-regression analysis is to filter out systematic biases, largely due to misspecification and selection, already contained in economics research (Stanley and Doucouliagos, 2012, p. 13). Professor Paldam succeeds in accomplishing the near impossible. His paper is a very clear, readable and insightful introduction to meta-analysis, which is itself a rather complex, technical and nuanced topic. Then, at the same time, Paldam offers many profound insights about the socio-economics of economics research and what meta-analysis can reveal about both the research process and the underlying phenomena it studies. Bravo! I can only echo Professor Paldam’s overall insights about economics research and about what hundreds of meta-regression analysis in economics have found. However, I wish to <b>clarify</b> <b>one</b> possible <b>misunderstanding</b> that a student might draw from this paper’s discussion of bias. In the paragraph following equation (5), the paper seems {{to imply that the}} existence of publication bias identified in (1) must also bias the multiple meta-regression coefficients from (5) and thereby muddle its interpretation. This need not be the case. Suppos...|$|R

No. 2120 had received a clear signal from Silver Spring, so the engineer believed he was cleared through to University.
