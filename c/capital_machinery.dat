5000|$|While [...] "marginal" [...] {{in common}} usage tends to mean [...] "tangential", {{implying}} limited importance, in economics [...] "marginal" [...] means [...] "incremental". For example, the marginal {{propensity to consume}} refers to the incremental tendency to spend income on consumer goods: the fraction of any additional income which is spent on additional consumption (or conversely, the fraction of any decrease in income which becomes a decrease in consumption). Likewise, the marginal product of capital refers to the additional production of output that results from using an additional unit of physical <b>capital</b> (<b>machinery,</b> etc.). If very small increments are being considered, so that calculus is used, then this ratio of incremental amounts is a derivative (for example, the marginal propensity to consume becomes the derivative of consumption with respect to income).|$|E

When building and <b>machinery</b> <b>capital</b> are treated as separate inputs, they find that <b>machinery</b> <b>capital</b> and energy are substitutes, while building capital and energy are complements.

5000|$|Like {{the other}} post-socialist regimes in eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the {{transition}} to capitalism rather painful and not easy as expected. The anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces (in Bulgarian: СДС, SDS) took office between 1991 and 1992 to carry through the privatization of agricultural land, properties and industry issuing shares in government enterprises to all citizens, but these were accompanied by massive unemployment as industries were no longer tightened to the broken Comecon and failed in competition of the global market without the participation of Bulgaria to new regional or world trade organizations, {{at the same time}} Bulgaria's industry showed to be backward which was amendable but in the hurry of political changes neither government, nor people were ready for industrial modernization. In fact the disbandment of former State security that was tightened to the Communist party (Bulgarian: ДС, DS) although brought relief to many Bulgarian people previously feared to speak or express other than communist views, at the same time boosted criminality never seen before in Bulgaria.

The study is intended to establish the market potential of industrial <b>capital</b> <b>machinery</b> (ICM), barriers to growth and government policy support issues towards the development of ICM manufacturing SMEs. This research involved the study of manufacturing industries, case studies on the manufacture of <b>capital</b> <b>machinery</b> and designing a postal survey questionnaire which was mailed to industries, government departments and raw material suppliers in Bangladesh. The questionnaire was designed with an aim to collect, information on opportunities, barriers to manufacturing, strategy of procurement and sales of ICM, use of locally available industrial indigenous resources, strength of AMT, size and performance of the SMEs and the impact of government policy on the growth of ICM manufacturing SMEs. Based on the result of the study, a number of models have been developed for ICM in Bangladesh in terms of demand, market growth, factors affecting the manufacturing cost, government policies, contribution of the national engineering sector to the manufacturing industries and barriers to the growth. The key findings of the study show that the locally available industrial resources based strategic plan for industrial development and government policies are the dominant factors for the growth of ICM manufacturing SMEs through which engineering industries could contribute to the economy of the developing countries in general and Bangladesh in particular. The work concludes with recommendations to overcome the barriers and constraints to the growth of ICM manufacturing SMEs...|$|E

The dynamic Ex ante input demand model combines the cost of capital adjustment and Ex ante output choice to create a dynamic model that is theoretically and empirically appealing. The four input empirical model provided a tractable means of estimating a dynamic Ex ante input demand system combined with an Ex ante supply function. The application to Western Canadian agriculture resulted in model that was dynamically stable and consistent with profit maximization. The results show that agricultural <b>capital</b> (<b>machinery</b> and buildings) is a quasi-fixed input, with significant adjustment costs and a slow rate of adjustment.

A possible explanation may be that agriculture and industry generates half of the GDP of Bangladesh. During 2005 to 2009, growth rate in agriculture sector was due to growth in the sub-sectors like livestock, fisheries, and forestry but the growth has gradually declined during 2009 to 2013 from 5.24 to 2.17. Its lower growth has foster unskilled labor to move from agriculture sector and enters {{in the labor market}} of urban areas. This has gradually increased the pressure on manufacturing and service sectors. The manufacturing sector remained the highest exporting sector due to ready-made garments and textile manufacturing, but the import of <b>capital</b> <b>machinery</b> to improve the productivity of these two sub-sectors declined the employment opportunity of females in these sectors by time as well.

40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, {{a barrier to}} widespread implementation of friction stir welding (FSW) for aluminum joining is the perceived need for high cost, custom <b>capital</b> <b>machinery.</b> The reason for this perception is that the FSW process requires relatively large forces that commonly used automation machinery (e. g. an industrial robot) has difficulty producing. Further complicating the issue, {{is the need to}} perform FSW over three-dimensional contours. This further increases the cost of custom capital equipment. Industrial robots would be a preferred solution for performing FSW for a number of reasons, including; their widespread use in {{the automotive}} industry, their ability to repeatedly follow three-dimensional paths, and their low costs. For these reasons, a project was initiated to determine the capability of an industrial robot to perform the FSW process. A FSW system was integrated to an ABB robot. Initially, the robot had little success performing FSW, but welds could be made. The implementation of a force control (rather than position control) strategy greatly improved the results. Three dimensional lap welds (2 mm to 2 mm) have been made at travel speeds between 1 and 2 meters per minute. This paper will describe the robotic FSW system. In addition, a case study will be explored that involves dissimilar thickness tailor welded blanks, where at least a five-degree of freedom system is necessary to generate welds.

40|$|The {{price of}} milk depends on many factors. For example, if corn prices rise then feed costs {{will go up}} and milk prices will increase. Besides corn prices, inflation, import and export market situations, somatic cell count, natural {{disasters}} and management costs such as feed, marketing, breeding, hired labor, <b>capital,</b> <b>machinery</b> and utilities can affect milk price. Before multiple component pricing was introduced, profit increased {{in direct proportion to}} increased production. However, after multiple component pricing is used, producing more milk did not mean more profit anymore. The reason is that milk prices are decided by content of component in milk such as fat and protein. Thus, higher the percentage of fat, protein and nonfat solid, the more profit can be made. For this reason, dairymen are making an effort to produce milk with higher fat and protein content in many ways. Breed changes, genetic selections and feed rations are examples of those efforts. The objective of this research is to analyze the differences between before and after adopting new FMMO in 2000 and differences of several factors that affect milk pricing between orders. At first, trends of several factors would be analyzed and the reason for those trends would be explained. Specifically, price and milk composition part will be of interest. Then, differences between the two orders, six orders using multiple component pricing and four orders using skim-fat pricing, and causes of differences will be investigated. By determining differences between the two marketing orders, the effects of using multiple component pricing on milk price, composition, utilization and so on could be inferred. These will enable us to identify producers? strategies and changes made to production process when multiple component pricing as adopted...|$|E
