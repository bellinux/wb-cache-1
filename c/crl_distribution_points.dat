40|$|A {{number of}} {{projects}} have been developing security architectures for Vehicular Communication (VC) systems, with consensus on utilizing public key cryptography to secure communications. In spite of their advanced status on many aspects, none of these projects, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, has investigated and addressed the problem of Certificate Revocation List (<b>CRL)</b> <b>distribution.</b> As the need to evict compromised, faulty, or illegitimate nodes from the VC system is commonly accepted, our contribution here is a solution tailored to the requirements and constraints of the VC systems. Our design is scalable and efficient, and can deliver seamlessly CRLs to all nodes within a region within tenths of minutes. More general, our analysis and simulation evaluation set the basis for the design of such <b>CRL</b> <b>distribution</b> systems, showing how to configure them to achieve more stringent requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|Dedicated {{short range}} {{communication}} (DSRC) relies on secure distribution to vehicles of a certificate revocation list (CRL) for enabling security protocols. <b>CRL</b> <b>distribution</b> utilizing vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications is preferred to an infrastructure-only approach. One approach to V 2 V <b>CRL</b> <b>distribution,</b> using rateless coding at the source and forwarding at vehicle relays is vulnerable to a pollution attack in which a few malicious vehicles forward incorrect packets which then spread through the network leading to denial-of-service. This paper develops a new scheme called Precode-and-Hash that enables efficient packet verification before forwarding thereby preventing the pollution attack. In contrast to rateless codes, it utilizes a fixed low-rate precode and random selection of packets from the set of precoded packets. The fixed precode admits efficient hash verification of all encoded packets. Specifically, hashes are computed for all precoded packets and sent securely using signatures. We analyze {{the performance of the}} Precode-and-Hash scheme for a multi-hop line network and provide simulation results for several schemes in a more realistic vehicular model...|$|R
40|$|Message {{exchange}} in VANETs should be secured. Researchers have designed many methods {{to meet this}} goal. One of the ways agreed upon by most researchers, is {{through the use of}} a public-key infrastructure (PKI). An important part of any PKI system is certificate revocation. The revocation is usually done by periodically issuing a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) by the Certification Authority (CA). After the creation of a CRL by CA, the CRL should be distributed in the VC system. The important question is how we can distribute the CRL efficiently and in a timely manner throughout the system in a way that all vehicles receive a genuine copy of it. A couple of researches considered <b>CRL</b> <b>distribution</b> in the past and proposed different methods like RSU-only [1], C 2 C Epidemic [2], and Most Pieces Broadcast (MPB) [3]. We implement the aforementioned <b>CRL</b> <b>distribution</b> methods and evaluate them using a common framework. With this approach, we can compare these methods accurately and point out the limitations of each. Due to the fact that C 2 C Epidemic did not provide any packet-level implementation, we propose an implementation for it. We also propose a new method for <b>CRL</b> <b>distribution</b> called ICE (Intelligent CRL Exchange). This method uses V 2 V and I 2 V communication to distribute the CRL pieces to vehicles. ICE is an enhanced version of the MPB method and it uses semi-incremental CRL exchange. With this approach, the number of duplicate received pieces decreases in comparison to the MPB method. Moreover, ICE uses a simple approach to decrease the number of unnecessary broadcasts by RSUs. The evaluation is done through simulations. OMNET++ [4] and the MiXiM framework are used for detailed packet-level simulation. The simulation is done for both small and large scale scenarios. For the large scale simulation, we use SUMO [5] to generate mobility traces of vehicle nodes. Different criteria are defined so that we can compare <b>CRL</b> <b>distribution</b> methods. According to the simulation results, vehicles in C 2 C Epidemic, MPB and ICE receive all the required CRL pieces in less time in comparison to RSU-only, because vehicles use both I 2 V and V 2 V communications. MPB shows a better performance than C 2 C Epidemic, but the number of duplicate received pieces increases substantially. ICE tries to alleviate this by incorporating semi-incremental CRL exchange. Furthermore, the number of broadcasts by RSUs in the ICE method shows reduction...|$|R

Some of these issues, such as certificate revocation list (<b>CRL)</b> <b>distribution</b> and technological immaturity {{have been noted}} in official DOD documentation and other studies without solution. Others such as directory management and operations in a tactical environment have been examined elsewhere. Here the problems of e-mail encryption and access control are discussed. Several solutions to these problems such as policy changes and PKI architecture modification are suggested. Yet the overall conclusion is that DOD PKI in its planned configuration will not achieve its operational objectives and may introduce security vulnerabilities and bureaucratic confusion where none existed before.

40|$|Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are {{becoming}} a reality where secure communication is a prerequisite. Public key infrastructure (PKI) {{can be used to}} secure VANETs where an onboard tamper proof device (TPD) stores a number of encryption keys which are renewed upon visiting a certificate authority (CA). We previously proposed a dynamic key distribution protocol for PKI-based VANETs [1] to reduce the role of the TPD. A vehicle dynamically requests a key from its nearest road side unit. This request is propagated through network infrastructure to reach a CA cloud and a key is securely returned. A proposed key revocation mechanism reduced the number of messages needed for revocation through Certificate Revocation List (<b>CRL)</b> <b>distribution.</b> In this paper, performance evaluation and security of the proposed dynamic key distribution is investigated analytically and through network simulation. Furthermore, extensive analysis is performed to demonstrate how the proposed protocol can dynamically support efficient and cost-reduced key distribution. Analysis and performance evaluation results clearly make the case for dynamic key distribution for PKI-based VANETS...|$|R
