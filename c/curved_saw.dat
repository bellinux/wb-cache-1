40|$|Sawn {{wood from}} curved logs {{is prone to}} have cross grain and contain {{compression}} wood, both of which affect the dimensional stability. Different types of curvature can, however, have different effects on both the sawing process and board quality, which is why a stand-ard measure of bow height alone {{is not enough to}} sort logs or set the log quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the repeatability when sorting <b>curved</b> <b>saw</b> logs using a 3 D log scanner. In the study, 56 logs were categorized into five different curvature types and four different degrees of curvature severity. The logs were run through a Rema 3 D log scanner four times, and the external geometry was recorded. From the geometry data, variables describing log shapes were calculated and used to develop models using linear discriminant analysis, which was used to classify the logs according to curvature type. The accuracy and repeatability were evaluated for the classifications with Cohen’s simple Kappa coefficient. The results of this study showed that it is possible to sort logs by curve type using a 3 D log scanner, although sorting by curve type was largely dependent on curve severity. The repeatability test determined that the chance of a curved log being graded identically two consecutive times was 0. 40, measured as kappa...|$|E

40|$|University {{when working}} on this project. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The goal of this work {{was to develop a}} life cycle {{inventory}} for the production of dimension lumber manufactured in the Southeast region of the US. The target audience are those interested in further life cycle analyses which involve lumber. Approximately one third of the softwood lumber consumed in the United States is produced from southern yellow pine. An estimated 400 mills across 13 southern states currently produce between 16 and 17 billion board feet annually. Sawmill production is concentrated in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, which are described as the Southeast Region in this report. These four states account for 51 % of the lumber produced in the South. Harvesting restrictions in the western United States have shifted production and demand for softwood lumber to the South, with the result that over the last decade softwood lumber production in the South increased by 31 % while production in the West declined by 17 %. Nine sawmills were identified {{with the assistance of the}} Southern Forest Products Association as typical large production pine mills in the southeast. A large production sawmill was defined as having at least 75, 000 thousand board feet (Mbf) of production per year. Surveys following the CORRIM research guidelines were sent to each of the nine mills. Four surveys were returned, two from bandmill operations and one each from <b>curve</b> <b>saw</b> and chip and saw operations. The combined total production was approximately 555, 500 Mbf and represents 9. 4 % of the tota...|$|R

The experimental design included 18 kiln charges with three replications of three kiln schedules. Nine of the kiln charges were restrained and nine were unrestrained. Kiln schedules were high-temperature [240 / F (116 / C) dry bulb with no venting or steam spray], elevated [190 - 220 / F (88 - 104 / C) dry bulb and 190 - 165 / F (88 - 74 / C) wet bulb], and conventional [180 / F (82 / C) dry bulb and 170 - 145 / F (77 - 63 / C) wet bulb]. Restraint loading was 200 {{pounds per square}} foot (psf) (976 kg/m 2). Results showed that the high-temperature schedule consumed approximately one-third and one-half of {{the energy of the}} elevated and conventional schedules, respectively. In addition, drying time averaged 21. 1 hours with the high-temperature schedule, 42. 0 hours with the elevated schedule, and 50. 3 hours with the conventional schedule. Although there were several significant differences in bow, crook, and twist in lumber dried by the three schedules, no schedule showed significantly lower warp. Results also showed that restraint reduced warp in lumber in the high-temperature and elevated schedules, and much of the warp reduction was in lumber within the top six courses of the stack. In addition, restraint reduced the variance of warp in lumber dried by all three schedules...|$|R

40|$|Lithium niobate has {{a number}} of {{attractive}} piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties that have been exploited for several different applications. The main purpose of this work is to produce lithium niobate thin films on silicon substrates (with amorphous SiO 2 coating) and to make low insertion loss surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. For SAW devices, the insertion loss mainly relates to the electromechanical coupling coefficient (K 2) of the materials. To get low insertion loss in SAW devices, we need use high K 2 materials. Among common piezoelectric materials, lithium niobate has the highest K 2 value. Theoretical <b>curves</b> of <b>SAW</b> properties of lithium niobate bulk crystals and films on SiO 2 (amorphous) /Si(100) were obtained.
