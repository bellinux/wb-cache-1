40|$|Through the {{establishment}} of the leading manufacturer Stackelberg game model under asymmetric carbon information, this paper investigates the misreporting behaviors of the supply chain members and their influences on supply chain performance. Based on “Benchmarking” allocation mechanism, three policies are considered: carbon emission trading, carbon tax, and a new policy which <b>combined</b> carbon <b>quota</b> and carbon tax mechanism. The results show that, in the three models, the leader in the supply chain, even if he has advantages of carbon information, will not lie about his information. That is because the manufacturer’s misreporting behavior has no effect on supply chain members’ performance. But the retailer will lie about the information when he has carbon information advantage. The high-carbon-emission retailers under the carbon trading policy, all the retailers under the carbon tax policy, and the high-carbon-emission retailers under <b>combined</b> <b>quotas</b> and tax policy would like to understate their carbon emissions.

Whereas the allocation previously was decided by the long-standing coastal states, the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands, changes in the mackerel’s migration pattern in a northward direction has led to Icelandic and Faroese requests for a larger portion of the resource. The “mackerel conflict” breaks out in 2010 and entails the use of sanctions as well as the setting of unilateral quotas in addition to those following from the coastal state agreement. The <b>combined</b> <b>quota</b> demands far exceed sustainable harvesting levels and will by all likelihood lead to overexploitation. The research methods were qualitative and involved the application of two-level game theory and the consideration of “win-sets” to explain the absence of co-operative management. The main finding was that the pelagic fishers effectively enjoy veto power over the outcome of the negotiations, in particular in fishery-dependent Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but to a large extent in Norway as well. Also in the EU the affected fishers have a decisive influence, although only in political terms. The parties’ many attempts at influencing each other’s positions have so far had no discernable effects and the situation begins to bear resemblance to a “tragedy of the commons”.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{abundance}} of African lions Panthera leo has declined rapidly in recent decades, {{largely due to}} competition for space with growing human populations. The future persistence of the species in the wild therefore depends heavily on viable populations in large protected areas, where lions play key ecological and economic roles. Zambia is one of nine countries estimated to have over 1000 wild lions, and Kafue, its largest national park, is a key refuge for the species. In this thesis I aimed to address the paucity of management and conservation relevant data on Kafue's lion population. I first used a track-based occupancy survey to determine the broad-scale drivers of lion distribution in the park. My results did not support my a priori expectations of anthropogenic edge effects driving lion occupancy; instead favourable habitat emerged as {{the best predictor of}} dry season lion distribution. The lack of edge effects is likely a result of the uniform suppressive effect on prey biomass of ubiquitous illegal bushmeat hunting in Kafue. After using my occupancy results to stratify my study area, I tested the effectiveness and efficiency of two well-established survey methods, track counts and call-up surveys, by comparing the resulting density estimates with that of a reference sample of GPS-collared lions in the study area. Accuracy of the two results was comparable, but the call-up estimate was more precise. However, call-up surveys are subject to variation in response rates that is difficult to quantify. I thus recommend that track count surveys are more suitable for monitoring lion population trends in Kafue. I further provide the first robust density estimate for northern Kafue of 1. 83 lions (> 1 yr old) per 100 km 2. Understanding how animals use space is fundamental to their conservation. I therefore used GPS collars to investigate lion spatial ecology at a finer scale, and the effects thereon of the seasonal flooding of large parts of Kafue. Home range sizes were comparable to those of other lion populations in the region. However, seasonal inundation caused lions to expand home ranges, travel greater distances and shift away from favourable habitat in the wet season, potentially contributing to apparent high cub mortality rates. The combination of these factors may limit the resilience of the population in the face of identified local anthropogenic threats (i. e. illegal hunting of ungulates and lions, legal trophy hunting of lions and frequent, uncontrolled bushfires). I provide both direct and indirect evidence of such threats, and conclude that lion abundance in Kafue is limited primarily by the suppressed prey population, while the extent and regularity of bushfires may also have adverse effects. I recommend stronger enforcement of existing regulations pertaining to illegal hunting and fires, and the implementation of recently developed monitoring software to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of limited law enforcement resources. I further conclude that lion hunting quotas were excessive prior to the 2013 ban on hunting in Zambia, and suggest that the ban remain in place {{for at least three years}} to enable adequate recovery of the population. If the Zambian government elects to lift the ban, I propose a total <b>combined</b> <b>quota</b> of 5. 25 lions per annum for the hunting concessions surrounding Kafue. I further recommend the implementation of strict age-based regulations within a robust adaptive management framework, based on the best available scientific data, to ensure the sustainability of harvest. To evaluate the effectiveness of such management interventions I propose long-term monitoring of lion abundance and distribution in Kafue using annual track count surveys. This study highlights that even the largest of Africa's national parks cannot ensure the survival of flagship apex carnivores. My findings and recommendations may be applicable to other wild lion populations in large protected areas where data paucity limits management effectiveness. Understanding and managing threats to these protected areas at the appropriate scale is critical if they are to meet their conservation objectives and ultimately ensure the persistence of wild lion populations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a brief synopsis {{of the historical}} development of hybrid sampling designs that combine traditional probability based sampling techniques with non-probability based quota designs to create model-aided sampling (MAS) designs. The MAS approach is illustrated for an application to a national business establishment survey called the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) Data Collection Program. Through simulation, we provide evidence that the estimates for this survey were not substantively biased by the MAS approach while data collection costs were substantially reduced. For reference in this paper, a model-based sample design uses a model to create quotas in various categories thought {{to be related to the}} study variables of interest and then uses a non-random sampling mechanism to obtain the requisite number of respondents in each quota cell.

We simulated a hypothetical fishery loosely based on the Icelandic cod fishery, using a simple spatially explicit dynamic model.

In general, combining more than one type of primary direct control on fishing provides a greater buffer to uncertainty than any single form of fishery control alone. <b>Combining</b> catch <b>quota</b> control with a large closed area is a most effective system for reducing the risk of stock collapse and maintaining both short and long-term economic performance.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a <b>combined</b> catch <b>quota</b> and habitat credit system was explored to manage the sustainable exploitation of a mix of demersal fish species and reduce the benthic impacts of bottom trawl fisheries using a dynamic state variable model approach. The model was parameterised for the Eastern English Channel demersal mixed fishery using otter trawls or dredges. Target species differed in their association with habitat types. Restricting catch quota for plaice and cod had a limited effect on benthic impact, except when reduced to very low values, forcing the vessels to stay in port. Quota management had a minimal influence on fishing behaviour and hence resulted in a minimal reduction of benthic impact. Habitat credits may reduce the benthic impacts of the trawl fisheries at a minimal loss of landings and revenue, as vessels are still able to reallocate their effort to less vulnerable fishing grounds, while allowing the fishery to catch their catch quota and maintain their revenue. Only if they are reduced to extremely low levels can habitat credits potentially constrain fishing activities to levels that prevent the fisheries from using up the catch quota for the target species...|$|R

The model is then used for comparative analysis, focusing on the changes coming into effect from 2008, when the whole system went through major restructuring as a part of public- -finance reform. The model describes tax as a particular set of options, which allows its valuation based on sto- chastic assumptions concerning the behavior of the underlying asset. Social levies are included in the model as they represent an unusually high portion of the Czech <b>combined</b> tax <b>quota.</b> The reform has also introduced profound changes in terms of their deductibility. Effective and marginal rates are calculated as outputs, using mean income and income volatility as free variables. We find that the reform, whilst generally lowering the effective taxation of personal income, dra- matically changes its impacts at the margin. Whereas the previous system featured a zero marginal rate over low incomes, followed with a sharp rise, and then a gradual step-wise growth up to the very high income brackets, the reform makes the initial increase much more gradual with marginal rates peaking at medium incomes and declining for the top incomes. At the same time, increased income volatility gets rewarded instead of penalized over the range of incomes where it is most likely to result from entrepreneurial decisions on investments, growth and search for market oppor- tunities.

Sending refugees to countries where they don’t want to go and that don’t want to have them is not just bad policy; it is also ethically wrong if the primary goal is to provide effective protection, which includes prospects of integration, to the largest number of refugees. Standards of fairness must apply to member states’ contributions to overall refugee protection, not to the numbers of refugees each of them takes in. If a state wants to accept fewer refugees than initially allocated to it in a fair scheme, it ought to pay or transfer other resources to those states that take in more.

These include the philosophies of Karl Marx and Max Weber, followed by a detailed discussion on the dynamics of conflict. The empirical analysis utilized cross-sectional survey design, with a <b>combined</b> convenience <b>quota</b> sample of employees (n= 133) within the company taken. This consisted of top management, middle management and lower management. The empirical study utilized the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and the Rahim Organisational Conflict Inventory-II (ROCI-II). The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) provided self-determining assessments of masculinity and femininity in terms of the respondent’s self-reported control of socially desirable, stereotypically masculine and feminine personality characteristics. The Rahim Organisational Conflict Inventory-II (ROCI-II) measured the present methods of conflict management specifically within an organizational environment. Results: It was noted that there was no difference in how pure biological sex (males and females) perceived and handled conflict within the workplace; but there was a difference in how the different gender identity groups (masculine males vs. feminine males and feminine females vs. masculine females) perceived and handled conflict. Conclusion: This study highlighted the conflict-dynamics within the gender-spectrum of a large South African sugar manufacturing company. Results of the study proved that the motivation towards this study was achieved in the sense that, although there were no differences in how different genders perceive and handle conflict, differences were found in the different gender identities within each of those genders. It is recommended that further research include a comparative study between two or three manufacturing companies to see how different companies within the same industry deviate from or resemble the results of this study. Further research could also determine whether there are differences, by cross-checking all four gender identity groups (masculine males, feminine males, feminine females and masculine females) using the MANOVA statistical procedure.

Therefore, {{we set out to}} identify early predictive markers of prostate cancer with aggressive progression characteristics. We measured the expression of microRNAs (miRNA) using qRT-PCR in FFPE prostatic tissue samples from a Swedish cohort of 49 patients with prostate cancer and 25 without cancer and found eight of 14 preselected miRNAs to discriminate between the two groups. Subsequently four discriminatory miRNAs were <b>combined</b> to a <b>quota,</b> denoted the miRNA index quote (miQ); ((miR- 96 - 5 p x miR- 183 - 5 p) /(miR- 145 - 5 p x miR 221 - 5 p)). The advantage using a quote is increased discrimination, no need for house-keepings, and most important it may be an advantage considering the heterogeneity of the disease. miQ was found to successfully predict diagnosis (p< 0. 0001) with high accuracy (AUC= 0. 931) that was verified in an independent Dutch cohort and three external cohorts, and significantly outperforming PSA. Importantly, miQ also has prognostic power to predict aggressiveness of tumours (AUC= 0. 895), metastatic statues (AUC= 0. 827), and overall survival (p= 0. 0013, Wilcoxon test HR= 6. 5, median survival 2 versus 5 years), verified in the Dutch cohort. In this preliminary study we propose that miQ has potential {{to be used as a}} clinical tool for prostate cancer diagnosis and as a prognostic marker of disease progression. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
2500|$|During the Holocaust, the U.S. {{failed to}} live up to its creed about {{accepting}} the [...] "tired, poor, huddled masses" [...] of the world. The US policy towards Jews fleeing Germany and claiming asylum was restrictive. In 1939, the annual <b>combined</b> German-Austrian immigration <b>quota</b> was 27,370. A famous incident was the U.S. denial of entry to the St. Louis, a ship loaded with 938 passengers. Almost all passengers aboard the vessel were Jews fleeing from Nazi Germany. Most were German citizens, some were from Eastern Europe, and a few were officially [...] "stateless." [...] The ship's original destination was Cuba, but the Cuban government, after admitting 28 refugees, ordered the ship to leave. The ship continued to the US, sailing so close to Florida that the passengers could see the lights of Miami. Some passengers on the St. Louis cabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt asking for refuge. Roosevelt never responded, though he could have issued an executive order to admit the St. Louis refugees. A State Department telegram sent to a passenger stated that the passengers must [...] "await their turns on the waiting list and qualify for and obtain immigration visas before they may be admissible into the United States." [...] Finally, the ship was forced to return to Europe and the majority of its Jewish passengers died in the Holocaust. On 17 December 1942, the United States finally issued a statement condemning the Nazi extermination program, but this turned out to be a meaningless gesture as did the follow-on Bermuda Conference of April 1943. America did not lift its immigration restriction against Jews until after the Second World War was over.|$|R
40|$|Economic {{efficiency}} {{has to do}} {{with how}} much wealth a given resource base can generate. Equity {{has to do with}} how that wealth is to be distributed in society. Economic efficiency gets far more attention, in part because equity considerations involve value judgements that vary from person to person. The authors examine both the efficiency and the equity of different methods of pricing irrigation water. After describing water pricing practices in a number of countries, they evaluate their efficiency and equity. In general they find that water use is most efficient when pricing affects the demand for water. The volumetric, output, input, tiered, and two-part tariff schemes all satisfy this condition and can be efficient although whether efficiency is short-run or long-run, first- or second-best, varies. Pricing schemes that do not directly influence water input [...] per-unit areas fees for example [...] lead to inefficient allocation. But they are usually easier to implement and administer and require less information. The extent to which water pricing methods can effect income redistribution is limited, the authors conclude. Disparities in farm income are mainly the result of factors such as farm size and location and soil quality, but not water (or other input) prices. Pricing schemes that do not involve quantity quotas cannot be used in policies aimed at affecting income inequality. The results somewhat support the view that water prices should not be used to effect income redistribution because water prices are a poor vehicle for reducing income inequality. But pricing schemes that involve water quota rules can reduce income inequality. The authors demonstrate this with a two-rate tiered pricing scheme <b>combined</b> with equal <b>quotas</b> of the cheaper water.

40|$|This thesis summarises {{research}} {{on the use of}} economic approaches in management decision making in the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery. Lobster fisheries globally tend to be well researched and data-rich yet economics is not widely integrated in the management process. This is surprising given that they supply a luxury food market and the entire supply chain is focussed on economic benefit. Lobster fisheries also tend be resilient to recruitment overfishing (Pollock, 1993), which means the basic management objective of biological sustainability tends to be easily met so there is scope to consider other goals of management. The use of economics in lobster fishery management is reviewed for fisheries globally. In some lobster fisheries, economic benefit is formally measured and reported as “sustainable economic yield”, which is the long-run, sustainable revenue from harvests minus the costs of harvesting. Reporting of economic yield does not always imply the use of this data in management decision processes, however there are cases where maximum economic yield (MEY) is used as a formal target including in Australian and New Zealand fisheries for Panulirus cygnus, P. ornatus and Jasus edwardsii. Bioeconomic models that combine stock, cost and price information are now being used in lobster fisheries including P. interruptus, P. argus, P. cygnus, J. edwardsii and Homarus americanus to evaluate regulations such as catch limits, season length, gear limits, and type. Economic theory has also been influential in the evolution of management systems used to constrain catch, in particular through the increased use of market-based and rights-based systems. These systems aim to provide incentives and mechanisms for the transfer of catch to more efficient operators and reward for conservative stock management that protects future harvests. Economic approaches can be used to resolve resource sharing issues in lobster fisheries with most research dealing with recreational and commercial interactions. A bioeconomic analysis of the Tasmanian rock lobster Jasus edwardsii fishery was conducted using a length- and sex-based model. The model was spatially and temporally structured to account for differences in costs of fishing and price. The analysis concluded that the current total allowable commercial catch (TACC) was too high to maximise economic yield and left the industry vulnerable to temporal changes in productivity. Alternative pathways to lower TACCs were explored but although these affected economic yield, differences were minor. Despite operating under ITQ management for over a decade, the presence of tradeable catch shares was insufficient for industry to motivate changes in the TACC to target MEY. Industry and government were motivated to exercise stewardship, in terms of acting to prevent stock collapse, but were reluctant to accept that economic yield and asset values could increase with lower catches. This bioeconomic analysis of different harvest strategies proved valuable in this debate, demonstrating a need for formal economic analysis as part of the suite of information used for setting TACCs even with the incentives provided by ITQs. The bioeconomic modeling approach was also used to examine the feasibility of a novel approach to increase productivity in the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery, which was to translocate lobsters from slow growth areas to faster growth areas. Change in stocks in response to translocation was assessed in comparison to the change in TACC that would be required to produce the same effect. These operations appeared viable with strongly positive net present value. When <b>combined</b> with <b>quota</b> management, a translocation of 100, 000 lobsters per annum improved most performance measures on a similar scale as would be achieved by a reduction in the total allowable catch of around 10...|$|R
40|$|Rare earth {{elements}} are not rare at all. They {{are essential for}} the hardware of contemporary {{life as we know}} it, every contemporary industrialized society depends on them, and there are no known alternatives. Yet the geography of their production is strange. In 2009, China accounted for 97 % percent of global production, with the majority coming from the Bayan Obo mine operated by the state-owned enterprise Baotou Rare Earth Group on the southern Mongolian steppe. When gradually intensifying export <b>quotas</b> <b>combined</b> with a temporary halt of official exports in 2010, {{the rest of the world}} woke up to its near total dependence on China’s rare earth monopoly. To address this crisis, a Brazilian firm (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração) determined to capture rare earths from its niobium mine tailings in the state of Minas Gerais. Betting on the willingness of downstream firms to pay a premium for non-Chinese rare earths and subsidizing the effort with revenues from their niobium sales, they resolved to produce a steady output of rare earth oxides regardless of global market fluctuations. In 2012, CBMM successfully produced high-purity rare earth oxides. In 2013, the US, EU, and Japan won a WTO case against China’s rare earth export quotas, restoring some semblance of the global status quo. But the story does not end there. Despite the relative ubiquity of rare earth elements, the abundance of known reserves near existing infrastructure networks, and the dissolution of the 2010 crisis, global prospecting efforts—with the aid of national governments and militaries—have targeted São Gabriel da Cachoeira in the high Amazon and the Western Lunar Highlands on the Moon as the next major points on the global rare earth frontier. This dissertation addresses the question: Given that rare earth {{elements are}} both abundant and vital, why is their production driven to so few, seemingly remote places? This question immediately begets three others: through what processes did China’s Bayan Obo mine emerge as the single greatest source of rare earth elements worldwide? What provoked changes in China’s policy and practice, and how did this precipitate spatial transformations elsewhere? And for what purposes are state, military, and private actors pursuing rare earth mining in São Gabriel da Cachoeira and the Moon? This dissertation proposes that the strange geography of the global rare earth frontier can be explained by world-historical shifts in the global division of toxic labor occurring within a context of state-building and geopolitical contest. It thus advances three claims. First, China’s monopoly emerged through a convergence of long-term historical processes shaping northern China in the context of early 20 th century imperialism, Cold War politics, and the epochal global economic shifts precipitated by Deng Xiaoping’s 1978 reforms and the Reagan/Thatcher revolution. Second, the change in China’s political economic priorities from export dominance to conservation has been stimulated by the acute environmental and epidemiological harms generated by rare earth production coupled with China’s changing position in the global division of labor. Third, the contemporary geography of the global rare earth frontier is driven by more than geological determinism: although these sites are rich in rare earth elements, they are also historically contested regions and focal points for territorial agendas, for which a nationalist mandate for rare earth extraction provides a convenient pretext. These claims are based in a world-historical analysis of rare earth mining, and draw on political economy, political ecology, transnational theory to examine the convergence of Baotou, São Gabriel da Cachoeira, and the Moon in the production of the global rare earth frontier from the late 19 th to early 21 st century. I engage scientific literatures, archives, expert interviews and other perspectives across the Anglophone, Sinophone, and Lusophone world which were gathered in China, Brazil, and the United States during 2010 – 2014. The multilingual approach is central to this project. Multiple forms of knowledge are evident in the discourses on the rare earth frontier, and there is a symmetrical inaccessibility to the working rationales across language barriers even as these rationales interpenetrate to shape thought and action across global space. By examining the transnational historical production of the rare earth frontier across these sites, this dissertation refutes three dominant, yet persistent assumptions circulating in contemporary popular, policy, and academic discourse. First, that China’s rare earth monopoly emerged because it possesses more rare earth elements than any other country; second, that China and Brazil possess mutually unintelligible histories precluding grounded relational analyses, and; third, that the Moon is a space of exception, beyond the purview of global economic activities and likewise, therefore, of critical concern. The purpose of this work is to demystify the contemporary global rare earth frontier. This work therefore has three aims. The first is to equip the reader with a deeper understanding of rare earth elements—the peculiarities of their geology and production, their political economic significance and their role in geopolitics far beyond what is available in the flurry of reports and opinion pieces generated since 2009. The second is to interrogate the historical origins and ongoing ramifications of the recent ‘crisis’ not as an exceptional circumstance, but as an episode that can be understood as emerging from and indicative of global development politics. The third and broadest aim is to move beyond entrenched global imaginaries that insist on the mutual unintelligibility of ‘China’ and ‘the West,’ or which seek to explain global changes as a series of unidirectional ‘impacts’ of one place on another, of ‘center’ on ‘periphery,’ (Hart 2002) as exemplified by much recent (but important) work concerned with China and Latin America (Gallagher 2008, García-Herrero 2007, Jenkins 2008, Rodriguez 2006). Although these sites differ in many important ways, each demonstrates a particular set of frontier attributes drawing especially from their respective histories at the margins of major imperial and territorial powers. These similarities help explain their convergence as points of extraction along the contemporary global rare earth frontier, while their differences account for the temporal and technological relationalities among these three sites in the global division of toxic labor...|$|R
