This report presents findings on tourism’s modest but sustainable contribution to local and regional development. Tourism <b>in</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Sweden</b> is mainly nature-based tourism (NBT) with {{a large share of}} businesses being accommodation providers as well as a large share of activity-based businesses. Domestic tourism dominates across the seasons and the region but a four seasons approach has been developing in recent decades. This report shows why tourism is closely aligned to sustainability goals <b>in</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Sweden</b> with sustainable tourism development facing both challenges and opportunities. New tourism firms add to employment over time despite the failure of most new firms. Market segments which are geographically distant from protected areas are drawn to them because of their unique attributes. Climate change is a long-term challenge to winter tourism in particular. Food tourism is underdeveloped but growing <b>in</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Sweden</b> and has potential to contribute to sustainable local food systems and community development. Tourism should be seen not as a last resort but more as a lasting resource for community development <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>Sweden...</b>|$|R
