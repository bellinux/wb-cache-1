25|$|Silkworm {{breeding}} {{is aimed}} at the overall improvement of silkworm from a <b>commercial</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> The major objectives are improving fecundity (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better pupation rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage, shorter larval duration (shorter larval duration lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced {{are directly related to}} the pupation rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors including genetics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the long}} run the {{competition}} between map-making firms Blaeu and Janssonius resulted in the publication of an 'Atlas Maior' or 'Major Atlas'. In 1662 the Latin edition of Joan Blaeu's Atlas Maior appeared in eleven volumes and with approximately 600 maps. In {{the years to come}} French and Dutch editions followed in twelve and nine volumes respectively. Purely judging from the number of maps in the Atlas Maior, Blaeu had outdone his rival Johannes Janssonius. And also from a <b>commercial</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> it was a huge success. Also due to the superior typography the Atlas Maior by Blaeu soon became a status symbol for rich citizens. Costing 350 guilders for a non-coloured and 450 guilders for a coloured version, the atlas was the most precious book of the 17th century. However, the Atlas Maior was also a turning point: after that time the role of Dutch cartography (and Netherlandish cartography in general) was finished. Janssonius died in 1664 while a great fire in 1672 destroyed one of Blaeu's print shops. In that fire a part of the copperplates went up in flames. Fairly soon afterwards Joan Blaeu died, in 1673. The almost 2,000 copperplates of Janssonius and Blaeu found their way to other publishers.|$|E

This deal would involve 100 million lire in advance, {{in exchange for}} the distribution rights for the film in perpetuity. De Laurentiis advanced 70 million lire, and put together a co-production deal between Italy, France (Les Films Marceau-Cocinor), and Spain (A.S. Film Produccion and Impala). The first drafts of the film were written by comic book writers Pier Carpi and Corrado Farina, who also worked in television advertising. These drafts were later revised by screenwriters Giampiero Bona and Fabrizio Onofri, who were told to tone down the violence. Onofri and Bona's screenplay also added an emphasis on comedy that was present in the Fantomas films. The film was initially going to be shot by British director Seth Holt, with French actor Jean Sorel chosen to play Diabolik. Other roles included Elsa Martinelli as Eva Kant and George Raft as Diabolik's enemy, Richness. Principal photography began on September 20, 1965, in Malaga, Spain, but halted when Raft became sick on set and was replaced with Gilbert Roland. The film finished shooting on November 13. After viewing Holt's footage, De Laurentiis temporarily aborted the film's production, stating that the footage shot [...] "was of a level so low, both from an artistic and <b>commercial</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> as to make us clearly understand that to continue on that path meant heading toward disaster." ...|$|E

In this study the major non-digestible components of five edible brown and red Spanish marine seaweeds - Fucus vesiculosus. Laminaria digitata (Kombu), Undaria pinnatifida (Wakame), Chondrus crispus (Irish moss) and Porphyra tenera (Nori) - were determined under simulated physiological conditions by an in vitro enzymatic method (Sauro-Calixto F et al, J Agric Food Chem 48 : 3342 - 3347 (2000)) developed as an alternative to dietary fibre analysis. Two indigestible fractions, soluble (SIF) and insoluble (IIF), were obtained after enzymatic treatments of seaweeds. SIF amounted to 40 - 170 g kg- 1 algal dry weight. Gravimetric values of IIF were 246 - 599 g kg- 1 and its major components were resistant protein (37 - 133 g kg- 1), minerals (13 - 78 g kg- 1) and non-starch polysaccharides plus klason lignin (196 - 415 g kg- 1). The total indigestible fraction determined by colorimetry (335 - 516 g kg- 1) was similar to the total dietary fibre content of seaweeds determined previously by the AOAC method.

40|$|Computational imaging is an {{emerging}} field. Its rapid development has drawn tremendous attention from both research and <b>commercial</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Unlike traditional imaging, which separately considers the optical imaging and computational processing, computational imaging combines {{the power of}} the optical elements and signal processing techniques to achieve augmented capabilities. Previous work on various aspects of computational imaging has shown the powerful abilities that computations can bring into the imaging systems. However, the research is still in an early stage. Some drawbacks need to be conquered. For example, in compressed sensing (CS) related systems, the reconstruction quality cannot be satisfactory due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Likely, in computational photography, the systems share a major defect. That is, as four-dimensional radiance information is recorded by a regular two-dimensional sensor, an unavoidable sacrifice of the spatial resolution has to be made to resolve angular differences. This eventually causes the low spatial resolution output. To meet these challenges, more efforts have to be made in both imaging part and computational part. In this dissertation, we concentrate ourselves on a more specific form of computational imaging, i. e., mask-based coded imaging systems. In particular, {{the first part of the}} dissertation focuses on a mask-based terahertz (THz) CS imaging system. There we focus on the computational part and explore the reconstruction algorithms that can estimate the underlying scene as accurately as possible. After that, we discuss the lightfield photography and show that by combining the system modification and proper postprocessing algorithms, we can achieve a high-resolution lightfield. The corresponding simulation demonstrates the performance of our methods. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
