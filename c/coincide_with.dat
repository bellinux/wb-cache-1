50|$|The Lunar {{equatorial}} {{regions are}} likely to have higher concentrations of helium-3 (rare on Earth but much sought after for use in nuclear fusion research) because the solar wind has a higher angle of incidence. They also enjoy an advantage in extra-Lunar traffic: The rotation advantage for launching material is slight due to the Moon's slow rotation, but the corresponding orbit <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> the ecliptic, nearly <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> the Lunar orbit around Earth, and nearly <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> the equatorial plane of Earth.|$|R

5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to date recessions in America {{beginning}} in 1790. These periods of recession were not identified until the 1920s.

5|$|Completed between September and October 1941, Soeara Berbisa {{featured}} keroncong {{music and}} was shot partly in western Java. It was released to <b>coincide</b> <b>with</b> the Eid al-Fitr holiday, and rated for all ages.

5|$|Glacial {{debris and}} ice were {{probably}} {{present at the}} lake, with fan deltas at Tunupa overlapping the Lake Tauca shore. At Tunupa and Cerro Azanaques, glaciers reached their maximum size shortly before the lake level peaked and probably contributed to water levels when their retreat began. Two minor glacial advances, over 12,000 BP and about 11,000 BP, appear to <b>coincide</b> <b>with</b> Lake Tauca.|$|E
