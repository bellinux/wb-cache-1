5|$|In 2011, the <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> {{which had}} {{been built in the}} 1960s was demolished, and a new <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> was {{completed}} in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Parliament House {{is located}} in Republic Street near <b>City</b> <b>Gate,</b> the {{entrance}} to Valletta. The building is located adjacent to Saint James Cavalier and {{the ruins of the}} Royal Opera House, and opposite the <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> Shopping Arcade and Palazzo Ferreria.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the Parliament House {{was a part of}} the <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> Project, which was meant to redevelop the entrance of Valletta. The project consisted of the demolition of the fourth <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> and the Freedom Square Arcade and the construction of the fifth <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> and the Parliament House. In addition, the ruins of the Royal Opera House were converted into an open-air theatre known as Pjazza Teatru Rjal. The <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> project was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano, and the plans were revealed on 27 June 2009. The Grand Harbour Regeneration Corporation paid Piano €6.6 million for his work on the project.|$|E

5|$|This {{fountain}} was relocated {{a number}} of times throughout its history: first in 1874 when the building near which it was built was demolished to build Palazzo Ferreria, in the 1960s when the <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> was rebuilt, in 2000 when Saint James Cavalier was renovated and converted into a cultural centre, and again in the early 2010s during the <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> Project. Due to these relocations and renovations, nothing remains of the original fountain.|$|E
5|$|Between Lejontornet and the {{southern}} <b>city</b> <b>gate</b> flanked by two boats is a wooden structure, roughly triangular in plan; this is a defensive tower called Kivenäbben, built in 1520–1523 on piles in the water.|$|E

5|$|Lastly, {{next to the}} {{southern}} <b>city</b> <b>gate</b> is an open space, {{believed to be the}} precursor of present-day Kornhamnstorg, the square where ships from the Lake Mälaren region used to deliver corn and iron.|$|E

Lakshmana is unable to tolerate Sugriva breaking his vow to Rama, enjoying material and sensual pleasures, while Rama suffers alone.|$|E
5|$|A major {{restoration}} of Mdina's fortifications was {{undertaken in the}} 1720s by the French military engineer Charles François de Mondion, during the magistracy of António Manoel de Vilhena. L'Isle-Adam's palace, including the remaining parts of the Castellu di la Chitati, were demolished {{to make way for}} Palazzo Vilhena, while the main gate was walled up and a new <b>city</b> <b>gate</b> was built in the Baroque style. A Baroque portal was also added to the Greeks Gate. The remaining medieval towers in the land front were demolished and the Torre dello Standardo was built {{on the site of the}} Turri Mastra, while the entire western walls of the city were demolished to make way for a single casemated curtain wall known as Magazine Curtain. D'Homedes Bastion was modified with the addition of a bastionette, while traverse-like batteries were built at the extremities of the land front. The city was further protected with the construction of outworks, including a covertway, two places-of-arms and a glacis.|$|E

5|$|Further {{disturbances}} {{took place}} during the troubled reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542–1567), and its aftermath. In 1558 the Protestant Lords of the Congregation marched on Edinburgh against the Catholic French Regent, Mary of Guise, and were able {{to take control of the}} town without difficulty, despite the guards posted at the <b>city</b> <b>gate.</b> Following the forced abdication of Queen Mary, Scotland's nobility was divided between her supporters, and those of the infant King James VI, represented by a series of regents. Edinburgh was held for the Queen by William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and in May 1571 the town was besieged by the Regent's forces under James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. Repairs were made to the walls, and the Netherbow was barricaded. Nearby houses were pulled down to improve defences, and the siege gun Mons Meg was employed to batter houses outside the wall which were being used by snipers. Unable to make any headway, the besiegers withdrew on 20 May.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a {{detached}} fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploče Gate was built {{to the east of}} the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the <b>city</b> <b>gate</b> in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League, and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses {{in the service of the}} Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|Just {{behind the}} Greyfriars turret is the islet of Helgeandsholmen, where the {{northern}} <b>city</b> <b>gate</b> and defensive wall were located. Today {{occupied by the}} Swedish Parliament, this islet was named after the charitable institution, Helige andens holme ("Islet of the Holy Spirit"), located there from around 1300 and discernible in the painting as a building with stepped gables facing an open space perhaps indicating {{the location of the}} demolished Johannite monastery. King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries in the painting were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish influence. The {{architectural}} {{influence of}} the ruling Spanish (Illustration 13), although this was a milder influence {{than that of the}} Normans. The Spanish style, a more restrained version of French renaissance architecture, is particularly evident in eastern Sicily, where — owing to minor insurrections — the Spanish maintained a stronger military presence. Messina's monumental Porta Grazia, erected in 1680 as the entrance to a Spanish citadel, would not be out of place in any of the towns and citadels built by the Spanish in their colonies elsewhere. The style of this arched <b>city</b> <b>gate,</b> with its ornate mouldings and scrolls, was widely copied all over Catania immediately following the quake.|$|E
5|$|The streets Volden (The Rampart) and Graven (The Moat) {{testify to}} the defences of the initial Viking {{settlement}} and Allégaderingen in Midtbyen roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network {{in the inner city}} formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. Vesterport (Westward Gate) still bears the name of a medieval <b>city</b> <b>gate</b> and the narrow alleyways Posthussmøgen and Telefonsmøgen are remnants of toll stations from that time. The inner city has the oldest preserved buildings, especially the Latin Quarter, with houses dating back to the early 17thcentury in Mejlgade and Skolegade. Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in Klostergade, Studsgade and Skolegade. By far, the largest part of the present day city was built during and after the industrialization of the late 1800s and the most represented architectural styles are historicism and modernism, especially Danish functionalism of which there are many fine examples.|$|E
25|$|<b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> {{serves as}} a {{transportation}} hub for public buses and private mini-buses (locally known as maxi-taxis). <b>City</b> <b>Gate</b> is located on South Quay just south of Independence Square.
