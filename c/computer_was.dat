5|$|Kaspersky {{graduated}} from The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School in 1987 {{with a degree}} in mathematical engineering and computer technology. His interest in IT security began when his work <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> infected with the Cascade virus in 1989 and he developed a program to remove it. Kaspersky helped grow Kaspersky Lab through security research and salesmanship. He became the CEO in 2007 and remains so as of 2017.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{a zombie}} <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> a <b>computer</b> {{connected to the}} Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse {{and can be used}} to perform malicious tasks {{of one sort or another}} under remote direction. Botnets of zombie <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> often used to spread e-mail spam and launch denial-of-service attacks. Most owners of zombie <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the owner tends to <b>be</b> unaware, these <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> metaphorically compared to zombies. A coordinated DDoS attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a zombie horde attack. Many <b>computer</b> users <b>are</b> unaware that their <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> infected with bots.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} what type of <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> vulnerable, or how to tell if a <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of this}} botnet.|$|R
5|$|The <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> {{built as}} a researching and {{demonstration}} project by the ASTRA group of researchers at the Vision Lab in the University of Antwerp in Belgium, one of the researchers being Joost Batenburg. Unlike other modern supercomputers such as the Cray Jaguar and the IBM Roadrunner, which cost millions of euros, the Fastra II only uses consumer hardware, costing €6,000 in total.|$|E
5|$|The first {{machines}} {{were tested in}} 1989, after which NeXT started selling limited numbers to universities with a beta version of the NeXTSTEP operating system installed. Initially the NeXT <b>Computer</b> <b>was</b> targeted at U.S. higher education establishments only, with a base price of $6,500.|$|E
5|$|The player {{would sit}} at the stand and press the buttons to make their moves, while one panel of lights showed {{the state of the}} game, and another showed the computer's {{calculations}} during its move. The computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds, slowing down so that the demonstrator could describe exactly what the <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> doing in real time. A visual guide attached to the Nimrod explained what the <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> doing during its turn, as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by the lights. Signs stating which player's turn it was and whether one or the other had won would light up as appropriate during gameplay.|$|E

30|$|Laptop <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> {{typically}} used in early mobile AR prototypes [19] as backpack computing platforms. Compared to desktop <b>computers,</b> laptop <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> more flexible to carry; however, {{size and weight}} is still the hurdle for wide acceptance by most users. Since laptop <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> configured as a backpack setup, additional display devices such as head-mounted displays are required for display.|$|R
50|$|Embedded <b>{{computers}}</b> <b>are</b> <b>computers</b> that <b>are</b> {{a part of}} {{a machine}} or device. Embedded computers generally execute a program that is stored in non-volatile memory and is only intended to operate a specific machine or device. Embedded <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> very common. Embedded <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> typically required to operate continuously without being reset or rebooted, and once employed in their task the software usually cannot be modified. An automobile may contain a number of embedded computers; however, a washing machine and a DVD player would contain only one. The central processing units (CPUs) used in embedded <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> often sufficient only for the computational requirements of the specific application and may be slower and cheaper than CPUs found in a personal computer.|$|R
5|$|Xerox Corp. v. Apple <b>Computer</b> <b>was</b> a 1989 {{case where}} Xerox sued Apple over its {{graphical}} user interface (GUI) copyrights. A federal district court dismissed Xerox's claims without addressing whether Apple's GUI infringed Xerox's.|$|E
5|$|Bletchley Park is {{a former}} private estate located in Old Bletchley and modern Museum of Cryptography. Conveniently located at the {{junction}} of the Varsity Line with the West Coast Main Line, Bletchley Park, code-named Station X, was {{the location of the}} Allied main code-breaking establishment during World War II. Codes and ciphers of several Axis powers were deciphered there, most famously the German Enigma. Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic digital <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> put to work here as part of the codebreaking effort. The high-level intelligence produced by Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is frequently credited with aiding the Allied war effort and shortening the war, although Ultra's effect on the actual outcome of World War II is debated.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{improvements}} in computing {{technology and the}} early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed minicomputers, led to the loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to the computers. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> opened to students and employees of the university. This in turn {{led to the development}} of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> {{recycled}} from redundant hardware {{donated by}} businesses and other organisations in the UK. Currently, {{nothing less than}} a Pentium IV specification is used. CFAS works in close collaboration with IT Schools Africa and the <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> refurbished by ITSA using volunteers who make sure that the <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> checked, parts are replaced if necessary and hard drives are wiped to UK Ministry of Defence standards. The majority of the <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> refurbished by prisoners in a range of prisons throughout England as part of rehabilitation training. Once in Africa, through agreement with Microsoft, Windows operating system and Office is installed.|$|R

5|$|Folding@home {{uses the}} Cosm {{software}} libraries for networking. Folding@home was launched on October1, 2000, {{and was the}} first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems. Its first client was a screensaver, which would run while the <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> not otherwise in use. In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with David P. Anderson to test a supplemental client on the open-source BOINC framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005; however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|OK <b>Computer</b> <b>was</b> {{nominated}} for Grammy Awards as Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Album at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in 1998, winning the latter. It was also {{nominated for}} Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album was shortlisted for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognising the best British or Irish {{album of the}} year. The day before the winner was announced, oddsmakers had given OK Computer {{the best chance to}} win among ten nominees, but it lost to New Forms by Roni Size/Reprazent.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1997, Deep Blue {{became the}} first {{computer}} chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. The super <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> a specialized version of a framework produced by IBM, and was capable of processing twice as many moves per second as it had during the first match (which Deep Blue had lost), reportedly 200,000,000 moves per second. The event was broadcast live over the internet and received over 74 million hits.|$|E

All of the <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> loaded with legitimate Microsoft software, and in some cases, the cost of the <b>computers</b> <b>is</b> covered by North Coast Technical and Further Education (TAFE) financing as part of a TAFE course.|$|R
50|$|To {{intensify the}} {{academic}} programs, a <b>Computer</b> Laboratory <b>was</b> installed in 1988 and <b>computer</b> subjects <b>were</b> offered in all courses. In 1990, the Two-Year <b>Computer</b> Secretarial <b>was</b> offered {{with the new}} Bachelor of Science in Accountancy program. The <b>computer</b> facilities <b>were</b> upgraded in 1993, <b>Computer</b> Technology <b>was</b> added as a new major in the AB, BSED, BEED programs while <b>Computer</b> Management <b>was</b> added as a new major in the BSC program.|$|R
5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E
5|$|The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) {{mainframe}} <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory between 1946 and 6 May 1949, when it ran its first program, and remained in use until 11 July 1958. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human-computer interaction, Alexander S. Douglas, a doctoral candidate in mathematics at the university, used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.|$|E
5|$|The NPL did {{not have}} the {{expertise}} to build a machine like ACE, so they contacted Tommy Flowers at the General Post Office's (GPO) Dollis Hill Research Laboratory. Flowers, the designer of Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic <b>computer,</b> <b>was</b> committed elsewhere and was unable {{to take part in the}} project, although his team did build some mercury delay lines for ACE. The Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) was also approached for assistance, as was Maurice Wilkes at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in 1983, its <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> resold {{worldwide}} by Olivetti under CPS/32 brand. Then, from 1985 to 1993, its <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> resold by IBM {{under the}} IBM System/88 brand. [...] The {{company is now}} based in Maynard, Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|Before the 1920s, <b>computers</b> (sometimes computors) <b>were</b> human clerks that {{performed}} computations. They {{were usually}} under {{the lead of}} a physicist. Many thousands of <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> employed in commerce, government, and research establishments. Most of these <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> women. Some performed astronomical calculations for calendars, others ballistic tables for the military.|$|R
5|$|The NeXT <b>Computer</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} the new 25MHz Motorola 68030 central {{processing}} unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities. It included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989 a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive and few networking capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} <b>computer,</b> <b>was</b> based on the Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), {{half the size of}} the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of the <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E
