The frequency response of a <b>comb</b> <b>filter</b> consists {{of a series of}} regularly spaced notches, giving the appearance of a comb.|$|E
25|$|The {{feedforward}} <b>comb</b> <b>filter</b> {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} finite impulse response filters. Its response is simply the initial impulse with a second impulse after the delay.|$|E
25|$|Comb filters may be {{implemented}} in discrete time or continuous time; this article will focus on discrete-time implementations; {{the properties of the}} continuous-time <b>comb</b> <b>filter</b> are very similar.|$|E
40|$|<b>Comb</b> <b>filters</b> are a {{class of}} low-complexity filters {{especially}} useful for multistage decimation processes. However, the magnitude response of <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> presents a droop in the passband region and low stopband attenuation, which is undesirable in many applications. In this work, it is shown that, for stringent magnitude specifications, sharpening compensated <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> requires a lower-degree sharpening polynomial compared to sharpening <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> without compensation, resulting in a solution with lower computational complexity. Using a simple three-addition compensator and an optimization-based derivation of sharpening polynomials, we introduce an effective low-complexity filtering scheme. Design examples are presented {{in order to show}} the performance improvement in terms of passband distortion and selectivity compared to other methods based on the traditional Kaiser-Hamming sharpening and the Chebyshev sharpening techniques recently introduced in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Sensorineural hearing {{impairment}} {{is associated with}} widening of auditory filters, resulting in poor frequency selectivity with an increased susceptibility to masking. Earlier {{studies have shown that}} binaural dichotic presentation, using critical bandwidth based spectral splitting with perceptually balanced <b>comb</b> <b>filters,</b> helps in reducing the effect of spectral masking for persons with moderate bilateral sensorineural {{hearing impairment}}. In spectral splitting, the speech signal is filtered using a pair of linear phase FIR <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> with complementary magnitude responses for binaural dichotic presentation. The objective of the present study is to optimize the <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> with respect to the number of bands and bandwidth. Three different pairs of <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> are investigated: constant bandwidth filters, critical band based filters, and 1 / 3 octave bandwidth filters. Evaluation of spectral splitting schemes, using these filters, through listening tests, indicate that 1 / 3 octave band and critical band based filters are superior to constant bandwidth filters...|$|R
25|$|The {{feedback}} <b>comb</b> <b>filter</b> is {{a simple}} type of infinite impulse response filter. If stable, the response simply consists of a repeating series of impulses decreasing in amplitude over time.|$|E
25|$|Audio effects, {{including}} echo, flanging, {{and digital}} waveguide synthesis. For instance, if the delay {{is set to}} a few milliseconds, a <b>comb</b> <b>filter</b> {{can be used to}} model the effect of acoustic standing waves in a cylindrical cavity or in a vibrating string.|$|E
25|$|In acoustics, comb {{filtering}} {{can arise}} in some unwanted ways. For instance, when two loudspeakers are {{playing the same}} signal at different distances from the listener, there is a comb filtering effect on the signal. In any enclosed space, listeners hear a mixture of direct sound and reflected sound. Because the reflected sound takes a longer path, it constitutes a delayed version of the direct sound and a <b>comb</b> <b>filter</b> is created where the two combine at the listener.|$|E
40|$|Splitting {{of speech}} using <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> with {{complementary}} magnitude response and presenting {{them to the}} two ears has helped in improving the perception of speech in sensorineural hearing impaired persons. The pair of <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> with 18 bands based on auditory critical bandwidths over 5 kHz band, were designed initially with sharp transition between pass and stop bands. Further these filters were optimized to obtain minimum perceived spectral distortion and perceptual balance of intensity at band crossovers. Such <b>comb</b> <b>filters,</b> realized as 256 -coefficient linear phase FIR filters, with pass band ripple of 1 dB, stop band attenuation of 30 dB, transition width of 78 to 117 Hz and filter magnitude responses at crossovers adjusted to lie between 4 and 6 dB, provided better recognition scores than that with sharp transitions, when tested on normal subjects with simulated hearing loss. Present investigation involves evaluation of spectral splitting scheme with <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> with sharp transitions and with perceptually balanced <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> on bilateral sensorineural hearing-impaired subjects. Further evaluation was conducted by incorporating an additional filter, which partially compensates for the frequency dependent shift in hearing thresholds. The results show improvement of recognition scores, and reception of consonantal features particularly place, frication and duration, with maximum improvement for the combined scheme...|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} for tatum tempo analysis {{discussed in this}} article is based on Scheirer's multiple resonator approach [5] using <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> as resonators. His approach has been adapted and improved successfully in other work for tempo and meter detection [6, 10, 32]. The main concept is to filter the envelopes or detection functions (see Section 2) of six nonlinear frequency bands through a bank of resonators. The resonance frequency of the resonator with the highest output energy is chosen as tempo. The <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> used here are a slight variation of Scheirer's filters. In the following paragraphs, there will be a brief theoretical discussion of IIR <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> and a description of the chosen filter parameters.|$|R

40|$|<b>Comb</b> <b>filters</b> can be {{designed}} by replacing single delays in digital filters by multiple delays. These filters are `periodic` {{in the sense that}} their frequency response repeats itself at fixed intervals. They are thus well suited to a signal such as GPS L 1 which has a spectrum made up of lines separated by the code repetition frequency of 1 kHz. In this paper we examine how periodic filters {{can be used in a}} conventional GPS L 1 receiver. We find that <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> assist with acquisition of weak signals, and can improve code-tracking performance. © 2007 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Splitting {{of speech}} into two using {{time-varying}} <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> has helped {{in reducing the}} effect of increased temporal and spectral masking simultaneously. The time varying <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> contained pre-calculated sets of coefficients, which were selected in steps, such that a cyclic sweeping of magnitude responses occur. Presently investigation {{has been carried out}} to find the best sweep cycle. The two sets of coefficients selected at any instant of time formed a pair of complementary <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> with 18 auditory critical bands which provided spectral separation of components that are likely to get masked. Sweeping of bands provides temporal separation and reduces the effect of temporal masking. As the number of magnitude responses swept increases, the sweeping becomes smoother. The sweep cycle duration determines the time for which the sensory cells of the basilar membrane remain stimulated. Perception evaluation tests were conducted with slowly sweeping sine wave and running speech from a male and a female speaker for sweep cycles of 10, 20, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100 ins. Best results were obtained for a sweep cycle of 50 ins...|$|R

However their applications generally require more computation. In this paper we consider the simple method to design a multiplier-less narrowband FIR filter. The method is based on well known IFIR (Interpolated FIR) structure. The novelty of the proposed approach is the new structure, where the interpolation filter is the cascade of <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> and the wideband compensators. The <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> and compensators are multiplier-less filters. The model filter is rounded to the nearest integers, which can be implemented with the adders and shifts.

50|$|LaserDisc was a {{composite}} video format: the luminance (black and white) and chrominance (color) information were transmitted in one signal, separated by the receiver. While good <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> {{can do so}} adequately, these two signals cannot be completely separated. On DVDs, data is stored {{in the form of}} digital blocks which make up each independent frame. The signal produced is dependent on the equipment used to master the disc. Signals range from composite and split, to YUV and RGB. Depending upon which format is used, this can result in far higher fidelity, particularly at strong color borders or regions of high detail (especially if there is moderate movement in the picture) and low-contrast details like skin tones, where <b>comb</b> <b>filters</b> almost inevitably smudge some detail.|$|R
