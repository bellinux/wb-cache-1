The outcome of this thesis is classified information about factors affecting the amount and <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> produced goat milk; the factors are divided into three main categories - biological factors, nutritional factors and factors of technology and management.

Among the other significant factors which affect quality <b>of</b> goat <b>milk,</b> we can classify health, age, lactation phase, technology and hygiene <b>of</b> <b>milking,</b> housing and treatment and a climate.
