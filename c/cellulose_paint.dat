5000|$|During {{the filming}} of the Thunderbird 2 crash-landing on Tracy Island, the AP Films special effects crew {{attempted}} to prevent damage to the shooting model by covering various parts of it with foil lined with rubber gel; it was this, rather than the model itself, that was ignited. However, the model was severely burnt when one of its rockets caused the <b>cellulose</b> <b>paint</b> to catch fire, blackening a whole side. To allow the shooting to continue, effects artists Mike Trim and Roger Dicken made a hasty repair by applying green Plasticine to the damaged section, in the process substantially increasing the model's weight. Trim has since commented that this was unnecessary: [...] "On-screen, {{there was so much}} smoke, you couldn't really have told whether the far side was completely missing, let alone burnt." [...] Ultimately, the damage was judged to be so extensive that the model was scrapped and completely re-built.|$|E
50|$|For {{his first}} {{experimental}} site, Kettlewell chose Christopher Cadbury Bird Reserve, near Rubery, Birmingham, {{because it was}} heavily polluted, but still inhabited {{by a number of}} bird species. He caught all three types of peppered moth and marked them underneath their wings with <b>cellulose</b> <b>paint,</b> so that {{he would be able to}} identify them later from non-experimental individuals after recapture. He started capturing the moths on the night of 26 June 1953, and lasted till 5 July. Out of his total capture, he selected 630 (447 carbonaria, 137 typica, and 46 insularia) male moths and released them into the woods. Within two days, 149 moths were recaptured, out of which carbonaria was 27.5%, typica 13%, and insularia 17%. (The total capture after release was 770, but 621 of them were non-experimental moths, i.e. not bearing the paint marks.) Thus their survival values were 5.72%, 1.48%, and 4.32% respectively. This shows that black moths had the best survival advantage in a darkened and polluted environment.|$|E
5000|$|Colors and {{treatments}} {{applied to the}} panels from the factory should be considered. Although more original looking, period enamel or <b>cellulose</b> <b>paint</b> will be less capable of protecting the car bodywork than modern paints. A car's owner may wish to have a panel or portion of the car entirely painted when in fact it {{may have come from}} the factory with undercoating or other coating applied to one side, which may be less attractive than a smoothly finished and painted panel. In other cases, the owner might paint or plate a collection of small parts to look similar for a better appearance, when the factory might have installed these as many different colors, since the factory's prime concern was a balance between function and cost and not the appearance of unseen areas. Given the cost of restoration it makes sense to many owners to upgrade the corrosion protection of paints, underseals and anti-rust waxes to far above the original factory standard to protect the time and money invested in the restoration. Some owner's feel these improvements would make the car a [...] "Restomod", and not a restoration. The term [...] "Restomod" [...] is not used in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of an imported Borg-Warner DG (Detroit Gear) 12 automatic transmission, power steering and Dunlop's power disc brakes on all wheels made the Major in those respects a mechanically advanced car for its time. Its body, however, was originally {{designed for the}} Majestic by Daimler subsidiary, the old coachbuilding firm Carbodies and they provided the bodies in conjunction with Park Sheet Metal. They were finished in <b>cellulose</b> <b>paints</b> allowing a selection of colours not available in the new synthetic finishes used by Jaguar. They were built at Browns Lane on separate hand-moved lines.|$|R
50|$|Epichlorohydrin is a {{versatile}} precursor in {{the synthesis of}} many organic compounds. For example, it is converted to glycidyl nitrate, an energetic binder used in explosive and propellant compositions. The epichlorohydrin is reacted with an alkali nitrate, such as sodium nitrate, producing glycidyl nitrate and alkali chloride. It {{is used as a}} solvent for <b>cellulose,</b> resins, and <b>paints,</b> and it has found use as an insect fumigant.|$|R

5000|$|Teän was {{the site}} of ground {{breaking}} mark and re-capture population studies of the Common Blue (Polyommatus icarus) butterfly by entomologists E. B. Ford and Prof W. H. Dowdeswell who camped on the island from 26 August to 8 September 1938. They marked each insect with a dot of <b>cellulose</b> <b>paint</b> so {{that it was possible to}} tell the date of first capture and any subsequent recaptures. The Common Blue is not a migratory butterfly and no marked butterflies were captured on the west side of St Martin’s, so additions to the Teän population were likely to be mainly emergences and losses due to death. It was noted that the normal form of the butterfly was found on St Mary’s, Tresco and St Martin’s whilst on Teän there is a separate race, due to isolation. Ford described them as [...] "The females obtained in the summer (I have no knowledge of the spring form) have an extensive scattering of pale silvery-blue scales, so that they are most unlike those found elsewhere, which are neither blackish or else marked with a violet shade. Moreover, the form from Teän is associated with a characteristic variation on the under-side of the hind-wings, which affects both sexes; for in a large proportion of the specimens the two spots placed along the coastal margin are united, forming a short curved line, and other varieties in spotting are frequent. We seem to here a stage in the evolution of an independent sub-species". Recent visits have not found the Common Blue to be significantly different on Teän so Ford’s remarkable form no longer seems to exist; unusual female colour forms and aberrations may just occur more frequently on Scilly than elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho avaliou a eficiência de abrigos para bezerros, a partir de índices de conforto térmico (carga térmica radiante, índice de temperatura de globo e umidade e índice de globo negro), pela comparação entre abrigos cobertos por telha de cimento-amianto e telha de cimento- celulose. O experimento foi implantado num sistema de abrigos convencionais, tipo boxe, com cinco tratamentos: telhados de cimento-amianto, cimento-celulose, cimento-celulose pintado de branco e telhado duplo de cimento-celulose, todos expostos ao sol, e telhado de cimento-celulose em área sombreada. Foram {{realizadas}} cinco repetições (um bezerro por repetição), de setembro a novembro de 2002, em Pirassununga - SP. As variáveis fisiológicas registradas foram freqüência respiratória e temperatura retal. Os abrigos expostos ao sol e com telha de cimento-amianto apresentaram os índices menos satisfatórios quanto ao conforto térmico animal, em relação aos demais abrigos ao sol. Os abrigos com telhas de cimento-celulose e em área sombreada apresentaram os melhores índices de conforto térmico animal. Os resultados das variáveis fisiológicas foram melhores para o tratamento posicionado à sombra. Encontrou-se relação entre os resultados de conforto térmico e os fisiológicos, em especial para a freqüência respiratória. This {{work was}} focused in {{the efficiency of}} housing for calves, based on thermal comfort indexes (radiant thermal load, black globe humidity index and black globe index). It was compared animal housing covered with commercial corrugated sheets produced with asbestos cement and cellulose cement tiles. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a system of conventional housing, box type, with five treatments: roofs with asbestos cement tiles, cellulose cement tiles, <b>cellulose</b> cement <b>painted</b> tiles and double layer of cement cellulose tiles, all of them exposed to the sunlight and cement cellulose roof under shade. The experiment involved five replications (one calf per replication), during the spring time of 2002, in Pirassununga, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Physiological variables of thermoregulation (respiration rate and rectal temperature) were registered. The housing directly exposed to the sunlight and covered with asbestos cement sheets presented the less satisfactory results for the animal thermal comfort in comparison with the other treatments also exposed to the sun. The housing covered with cellulose cement tiles under shade showed the best results of thermal comfort. The results of the physiological variables were significantly better for the treatment positioned under shade. A satisfactory relation between the thermal comfort indexes and the physiological results (especially respiration rate) were found for the conditions of the present work...|$|R
