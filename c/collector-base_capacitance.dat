5000|$|Current mirrors are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} signal path of an integrated circuit, for example, for differential to single-ended signal conversion within an operational amplifier. At low bias currents, the impedances in the circuit are high enough {{that the effect of}} frequency may be dominated by device and parasitic capacitances shunting the input and output nodes to ground, lowering the input and output impedances. The <b>collector-base</b> <b>capacitance,</b> , of Q3 is one component of that capacitive load. The collector of Q3 is the output node of the mirror and its base is the input node. When any current flows in , that current becomes an input to the mirror and the current is doubled at the output. Effectively the contribution from Q3 to the total output capacitance is [...] If the output of the Wilson mirror is connected to a relatively high impedance node, the voltage gain of the mirror may be high. In that case the input impedance of the mirror may be affected by the Miller Effect because of , although the low input impedance of the mirror mitigates this effect.|$|E
40|$|Faceting at the {{periphery}} of the shallow trench isolation during SiGe epitaxial base growth and its influence on SiGe HBT <b>collector-base</b> <b>capacitance</b> are investigated utilizing Technology Computer Aided Design techniques. The simulations suggest peripheral diffusion of boron from the extrinsic base into the intrinsic device may be attributed to depletion of germanium and carbon on the faceted plane that drives the boron diffusion and contributes to the <b>collector-base</b> <b>capacitance,</b> Ccb. Increases in the angle of the facet relative to the { 110 } plane are shown to reduce Ccb. Moreover, a significant reduction in Ccb was observed with no faceting, suggesting that moving the facet away from the active silicon region was desirable for reducing this key parasitic capacitance. These results serve to highlight the role that faceting plays in extrinsic device parasitic capacitances and identifies a focus area for scaling the device capacitance...|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} process {{designs of}} horizontal current bipolar transistor (HCBT) technology suitable for future RF BiCMOS circuits are presented. The active transistor region is {{built in the}} defect-free sidewall of 900 -nm-wide n-hills on a (110) wafer. The collector n-hill region is partially etched at the extrinsic base-collector periphery, whereas the extrinsic base is self-protected, resulting in reduced <b>collector-base</b> <b>capacitance</b> (C-BC) and minimized volume of the extrinsic regions. The effect of doping levels at different regions on the transistor performance is examined in the two process designs. The fabricated HCBTs exhibit cutoff frequencies (f(T)) from 19. 2 to 25. 6 GHz, maximum frequencies of oscillations (f(max)) from 32. 2 to 39. 6 GHz, and collector-emitter breakdown voltages (BVCEO) between 4 and 5. 2 V, which are the highest fT and the highest fT center dot BVCEO product compared to existing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) lateral bipolar transistors (LBTs). The compact nature of the HCBT structure and low-cost technology make it suitable for integration with advanced pillar-like CMOS and SOI CMOS devices...|$|E
