40|$|Mirrors are {{the first}} link in the energy-conversion chain from Sun to electricity-delivery in the grid. Shape and solar {{reflectance}} are the key-parameters of mirrors, respectively affecting how solar radiation is concentrated around the focus, {{and how much of}} the impinging solar power is reflected. In SolarPACES Task III, an expert group is drafting the solar reflectance guidelines; in order to speed up the discussion the SRRR round robin was launched at the beginning of 2013. Identical kits, each one consisting of ten specimens collected from eight <b>cooperating</b> <b>producers,</b> were distributed and measured at six research institutes, acting as evaluators. The kit includes both traditional (glass based) and innovative (first-surface) solar mirrors. The paper only reports on the simplest task among those of SRRR: the solar hemispherical reflectance measurement. Near-specular solar reflectance was also measured and compared but the results are still under investigation and are not part of this paper. The measurements were accomplished according to the guidelines. The differences among the achieved results are within the typical accuracy of spectrophotometers, demonstrating the reliability of the reflectance guidelines. The statistic of the deviations from the true value is analysed separately for each evaluator, and allows us to infer information abut the gauging-status of the adopted reference mirror, as well as the measurement reproducibility...|$|E

Estonia's priorities for economic development include promotion of exports, small business and regional development. Small sawmills satisfy all three priorities but the industry's long run viability is in doubt. Current cost advantages depend on cheap raw material, labour and electricity, which are likely to disappear or be reduced with EU membership or further economic reform. Long run viability could emerge if <b>producers</b> <b>cooperate</b> in purchasing raw material, securing access to credit and marketing and adopt a niche market approach. Government can assist by providing export market support, credit access, a revised auction system for roundwood, retraining and extension programs and assistance in financing the set-up of joint-use production facilities. But such assistance, except for structural changes to promote competition and export marketing support, should all be temporary if the industry is ultimately to compete in the Western Europe market. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} a program for evaluation of seedstock populations in the swine industry. Differences among seedstock populations for economically important traits must be identified in order for pork producers to efficiently use available genetic resources. National genetic evaluation programs have the potential to identify the important differences among populations and to increase the rate of genetic improvement in a population. Program results provide performance benchmarks that stimulate testing and selection procedures by seedstock suppliers that further increase the rate of genetic improvement. A Terminal Sire Line Genetic Evaluation Program was designed and conducted in the United States by the National Pork Producers Council (Des Moines, IA) to compare seedstock populations for use in crossbreeding systems. High levels of statistical accuracy for program results were established; the ability to detect differences of 0. 25 SD per trait, a power of test of 75 %, and a 5 % significance level were selected. Pure breeds and breeding company sire lines were nominated for the program. Semen was collected from nominated boars and distributed to <b>cooperating</b> commercial <b>producers</b> during eight 1 -wk breeding periods. Pigs were produced in 136 commercial herds and transported to testing facilities at 8 to 23 d of age. Nine of the 11 sire lines originally entered in the program completed the sampling requirements for statistical analysis. High levels of statistical accuracy and a large, representative sample of boars with restrictions on genetic relationships ensured that the program results included unbiased, highly accurate sire line data for growth, carcass, meat quality, and eating quality traits of economic importance. This program has shown commercial producers that they have several choices of sire lines for changing their crossbreeding programs in desired trait areas. Commercial product evaluation must be an ongoing process, and this program serves as a model for future testing and evaluation of diverse genetic seedstock populations...|$|R

40|$|Access to {{the growing}} organic produce markets in the West is subject to strict rules of {{certification}}. In Europe, produce has to conform with various certification schemes, rooted in the rules established by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM). So {{if you want to}} start exporting organic produce, here are the steps to take. First call on a certification body which is recognised in the importing countries. You will need to enter into a contractual arrangement with them, under which you can get advice about the different stages of production, obtain the necessary licence and sometimes even become part of their marketing chain. There are several bodies which <b>cooperate</b> with <b>producers</b> in ACP countries, including AIAB in Italy, Bio-Gro in New Zealand, Instituto Biodinamico in Brazil, KRAV in Sweden, NASAA in Australia, Naturland-Verband in Germany, OCIA and FVO in the USA, the Soil Association in Great Britain (these are all accredited by IFOAM, who can provide addresses); other bodies include Ecocert International and Bioherb based in Germany, and Skal and Agro-Eco in the Netherlands. You will receive a visit from a technical expert who will inspect each step of production and processing to see if it is in accordance with the criteria in the sector. If the check is positive, you will be issued with an annual licence (for you) and a certificate (for the product). These checks are run at least once a year. The licence and organic label will be withdrawn if you do not continue to adhere to the certified procedures. There is a charge for the contract; you will need to pay the costs of the technical expert (travel, accommodation, daily consulting fees). It will be worthwhile trying to arrange an inspection visit in conjunction with other producers, in a cooperative or association. Although there are moves to establish more local certification offices in ACP countries, at present there are very few : OAASA in South Africa, ABLH in Kenya, Ecocert in Madagascar, Skal International in Suriname, INADES in Tanzania, WWOOF in Togo (If you know of others, write and let us know). Some development offices such as the Export Promotion of Organic Products from Africa, {{which is part of the}} Swedish development cooperation agency SIDA, can provide finance to meet the costs of certification.

40|$|AbstractIn verifying the {{tolerance}} specification and identifying {{the zone of}} conformity of a particular component an adequate determination of the task-related measurement uncertainty relevant to the utilized measurement method is required, in accordance with part one of the standard “Geometrical Product Specifications” {{as well as with}} the “Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement”. Although, measurement uncertainty is a central subject in the field of metrology and is certainly considered to be of significant importance, there is still a perceived lack of knowledge on the subject within employees in the field of quality management and industrial metrology. They are often neither familiar with procedures for the determination of measurement uncertainty nor with the interpretation and analysis of measurement results as well as economic consequences of decisions taken at the level of conformity. Furthermore, in times of increasing globalization relating to products, processes and development, in which ever more <b>producers</b> <b>cooperate</b> with institutes and companies from all over the world, there is a strong demand and need for a transnational vocational training on the topic of measurement uncertainty. For that reason, in the European project MUVoT (“Blended Learning course on measurement uncertainty for advanced vocational training” - Leonardo da Vinci – Transfer of Innovation 2011 - 1 -PL 1 -LEO 05 - 19870), a course for advanced vocational training on the topic of measurement uncertainty was established in cooperation with seven institutes from six European countries to provide an internationally harmonized education programme and thus guarantee a better quality of products through the training of metrologists. The training offer is based on a Blended Learning concept, combining self-dependent learning via a web-based eLearning platform and class teaching in face-to-face workshops. On the one hand, this allows the adaptation to individual knowledge and skills by self-controlled learning of abstract contents. On the other hand, the exercises enable the practical application of typical methods, which are generally considered as quite complex by many employees, and thus assure correct understanding. Furthermore, class teaching in manageable groups of participants offers the possibility of adaption to individual training needs. The integration of vocational training into a job-based application is facilitated, so that the idea of Lifelong Learning is promoted in new fields of application. Taking into consideration, that the target group of this training consists of participants with a very inhomogeneous qualification, including foremen, skilled workers, technicians and engineers, the course contents are provided in a modular structure with preparatory, basic and advanced chapters. By performing pilot courses at each project partner, the course content has been thoroughly tested and feedback has been sought and given allowing for a policy of continuous improvement. This article describes the results of these evaluations and the targeted improvements of the content and overall concept considering the identified competence requirements and needs of the participants...|$|R
40|$|Today {{we can see}} how {{companies}} are making significant investments in various methods and tools to access and utilize the users’ knowledge {{for the purpose of}} innovation efforts. What many highly innovative companies try to accomplish with these investments is to develop and establish sustained producer-user ecosystems. The aim of these ecosystems is often to encourage users to collaborate {{with each other and with}} the producer in order to generate innovations related to the offering of the producer. However, although these ecosystems are proven to create new innovation opportunities for companies, it has been shown that a close collaboration with many users brings about a number of challenges for companies. For example, it can be costly and time-consuming to establish and utilize large numbers of user relationships and it can be difficult to align the innovation interests of established producers with those of the users. Moreover, the fact that many innovating users have relationships to one another can contribute to conflicts of interests and established producers may have to balance stability and change within the ecosystem. Another challenge in the utilization of user relationships is that it is not only dependent on the direct interaction with users but also the internal dissemination and utilization of information related to the users’ needs. This dissemination can be problematic since it is costly and difficult to forward timely and reliable information about the users’ needs. Consequently, the aim of this thesis is to better understand how companies that are operating within sustained producer-user ecosystems can leverage user relationships for the purpose of innovation. The research forming the foundation for this thesis was carried out within two established medical technology companies that successfully had developed innovations within this type of ecosystems. Quantitative and qualitative data was collectedand a number of different analyses were conducted. The results reveal that these ecosystems can be understood as a system where direct and indirect user experiences are distributed among employees and users. This in turn implies that employees utilization of user relationships can be understood as a function of the extent to which employees knows and values the pertinence of their own as well as others direct and indirect user experiences as well as accessibility and cost of seeking user-information from other people. The results demonstrate that when companies experience high costs related to the acquisition of user experiences they may benefit from employing users to occupy boundary-spanning roles. However, the thesis reveals how the utilization of such boundary-spanning roles brings with it a number of organizational challenges. Moreover, an important aspect of success tends to be the utilization of relationships to so-called transformational users. These users experience problems with established producers' current products before the majority of users, they adopt new technologies earlier than their peers, and they <b>cooperate</b> with established <b>producers</b> for the purpose of transformation of a product field in order to obtain or maintain a central position within the ecosystem. Furthermore, the results reveal how established producers and users are jointly engaged in value creation through various collaborations. However, the results also indicate that the utilization of user relationships for innovation within these types of ecosystems is, to a large extent, a matter of managing tensions emerging within and around these collaborations. On a general level, this thesis points to the potential benefits of considering producer-user ecosystems as a comprehensive perspective, which may explain how companies gain and sustain a competitive edge, rather than one out of many approaches that companies can apply in order to leverage user relationships for innovation.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the collective action problem of nonpoint-source pollution control {{in a small}} agricultural watershed. At issue is the stability of cooperative behavior {{among a group of}} farmers, who have voluntarily agreed to discontinue their use of the herbicide atrazine due to high concentrations of the herbicide in a local water supply. Continued cooperation among the group is threatened by the unexpected cancellation of cyanazine, an inexpensive and widely used alternative to atrazine. With cyanazine no longer available, the farmers will face a significant increase in weed control costs if they continue to use products that do not contain atrazine. Is cooperation among the farmers still possible despite the increased cost of cooperating? This research explores the economic and behavioral factors that influence the collective outcome of this social dilemma. The collective action is modeled as a recurrent coordination problem. The producers (farmers) are engaged in a repeated assurance game with imperfect public information, where producers' choices are driven by the desire to coordinate their actions with the others in the group. A <b>producer's</b> decision to <b>cooperate</b> or defect is based on a threshold approach; if the number of others believed to be cooperating exceeds the level of cooperation required to make cooperation beneficial, then the producer will choose to <b>cooperate.</b> Otherwise, the <b>producer</b> will defect. Since producers are unable to directly observe the choices of the others in the group, each producer must rely on a subjective assessment of the group's behavior based on the realization of the public outcome, the concentration of atrazine in the lake. Producers use a naive Bayesian learning process to update their beliefs about the joint actions of the group. The formal learning process is modeled using a sequential quasi-Bayesian procedure that is consistent with the fictitious play model of learning. The interaction between the producers and the impact of their collective behavior on the levels of atrazine in the lake is formulated as a computational multi-agent system (MAS). The MAS is an artificial representation of the collective action problem that integrates the economic, behavioral and environmental factors that influence the decision-making process of producers. The MAS is used to simulate the evolution of collective behavior among the group and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} selected incentive mechanisms in preventing the collapse of joint cooperation. The results suggest that without additional incentives, farmers are likely to abandon their voluntary agreement and resume their use of atrazine within the watershed. It is then demonstrated how a combination of policy instruments can be used to alter the underlying game configuration of the collective action problem, resulting in cooperative outcomes. An ambient-based penalty, when used in conjunction with a subsidy payment, is shown to produce divergent incentive structures that shift the classification of the collective action away from a coordination problem with two equilibria to a mixed configuration containing several different game structures and many possible equilibria. This result has important consequences in terms of the evolution of producer behavior and the set of possible collective outcomes. The analysis concludes with an example, which demonstrates that when a mixture of game structures characterizes the collective action, joint cooperation is not a prerequisite to the realization of socially desirable outcomes. By carefully selecting the combination of subsidy payment and ambient penalty, a policy maker can manipulate the underlying structure of the collective action, whereby producers with the smallest impact on water quality choose to defect while all others cooperate.
