5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits {{to the size of}} a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the <b>cable</b> <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E

5000|$|WE/SS and Tyco/AMP 8P8C plugs have {{different}} spacing for the <b>cable</b> <b>strain</b> <b>relief.</b> [...] Thus, using a WE/SS 8P8C crimp die {{set on a}} Tyco/AMP 8P8C plug will crush {{the top of the}} connector and damage the crimp die set, and vice versa. While the WE/SS compatible plug is produced by a larger number of manufacturers than the Tyco/AMP plug, it is still important to know what style is being used to avoid damaging the plug or tool during crimping.|$|E
50|$|There are two sub-types of plug, {{that differ}} {{only in the}} type of {{contacts}} used. One contact is suitable for solid (single strand) copper conductors and the other is suitable for stranded or tinsel wire copper conductors. The crimper may also permanently deform part of the plastic plug body {{in such a way that}} it grips the outer sheath of the cable. This helps to keep the plug securely fastened to the end of the <b>cable,</b> by providing <b>strain</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|R
30|$|Since {{there was}} no {{allowance}} to either screw or weld any lugs to the pile, the mounting plate was bonded {{by means of a}} thick layer semi-structural adhesive as well (see Fig.  10, left). The upper part of the monopiles was coated by a corrosion protection which had to stay intact. Thus, no grinding was performed here but the coating was cleaned and the mounting plate as well as all <b>cables</b> and a <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> were bonded directly to the coating. As stated before, the data acquisition unit and the mounting plate had a weight of about 65  kg.|$|R
50|$|Quality {{differences}} exist in SCART cables. While a proper SCART cable uses miniature coaxial cables for the video signals, cheap SCART cables often use plain wires for all signals, {{resulting in a}} loss of image quality and greatly reducing the maximum cable length. A common problem on a cheap SCART cable is that a TV outputs a composite video signal from its internal tuner and this is induced or cross-talked onto an incoming video signal due to inadequate or non-existent screening; the result is ghostly images or shimmering superimposed on the incoming signal. To non-destructively verify if a SCART cable uses coaxial <b>cables,</b> unscrew the <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> at the SCART connector and fold open the plastic shell.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The implantable continuous-flow left {{ventricular}} assist devices (LVADs) HeartMate II (HM II) and HeartWare HVAD (HW) underwent design modifications. The {{impact of these}} changes on life-threatening pump malfunctions was evaluated. Methods: We retrospectively analysed pump malfunctions due to thrombosis or cable damage in patients supported with primarily implanted HM II (n = 191) and HW (n = 347), separated into patients supported with {{the old and new}} pump designs. In 2010, the <b>cable</b> <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> of the HM II device was improved (132 patients with old and 79 with new) and sealed grafts were introduced (68 patients with sealed inflow connector and outflow graft and 125 without). In 2011, titanium sintering of the inflow cannula of HW pumps was introduced (137 patients with a non-sintered and 210 with a sintered inflow cannula). Results: The median support time was 1. 12 (0 - 6. 1) years for all HM II and 0. 59 (0 - 4. 2) years for all HW patients. The cumulative rate of events per patient-year (EPPY) was 0. 11 in HM II patients, compared with 0. 09 EPPY in HW patients (P = 0. 32). After introduction of the new cable design, incidence of cable damage in HM II patients dropped from 0. 06 to 0 EPPY (P = 0. 03), whereas pump thrombosis increased from 0. 02 to 0. 14 EPPY (P < 0. 001) after the sealed graft was introduced. Pump thrombosis occurred in 4 % of patients supported with HW with a sintered inflow cannula vs 15 % with a non-sintered pump; the incidence changed from 0. 10 to 0. 07 EPPY in sintered pumps (P = 0. 45). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no differences over a period of 2. 5 years for events when the HM II cohort with sealed graft and new cable design (n = 68) was compared with the HW group with a sintered cannula (P = 0. 14) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Strain</b> <b>relief</b> in lattice {{mismatched}} heteroepitaxy {{is mediated}} by formation and/or propagation of dislocations. Due to their technological significance, {{the process of}} <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> in materials with face-centred cubic (fcc) lattices has been analyzed by several researchers 1, 2 following the work by Matthews and co-workers in the late 1960 s to early 1970 s 3 - 6. In the Matthews model, {{it is assumed that}} the strain relieved by any misfit dislocation is equal to the edge component of the dislocation burgers vector in the interface plane. This assumption has been used in all subsequent analyses of <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> in lattice mismatched heteroepitaxy [1, 2]. Based upon the known three-dimensional atomic structure of the dislocations in fcc lattices, we show that the assumption is not valid for the 60 degree dislocations that form/expand via the conservative glide process. For compressively (tensilely) strained films the assumption is valid only for the 90 degree dislocations that form/expand via aggregation of vacancies (interstitials).

40|$|The <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> of heteroepitaxial bcc-Fe(001) films, {{deposited}} at 520 - 570 K onto MgO(001), {{has been}} investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. In accordance with real-time stress measurements, the tensile misfit strain is relieved during coalescence of flat, mainly 2 - 3 monolayers (ML) high Fe islands at the high thickness of similar to 20 ML. To accommodate the misfit between merging strain-relaxed islands, a network of 1 / 2 [111] screw dislocations is formed.

Methods: The ONHs of 9 subjects with POAG (pre-TE IOP: 25. 3 +/- 13. 9 mmHg; post-TE IOP: 11. 8 +/- 8. 6 mmHg) were imaged (1 eye per subject) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Heidelberg Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) before (0. 05), suggesting biomechanical variability across subjects.
