50|$|The Canadian media {{industry}} is not governed exclusively by free-market economics but rather {{through a combination of}} public and private enterprise. Apart from a limited number of community broadcasters, media in Canada are primarily owned by a small number of companies: Bell, Corus, Rogers, Newcap, Quebecor and the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Each of these companies holds a diverse mix of television, <b>cable</b> television, radio, <b>newspaper,</b> magazine, and/or internet operations. A few smaller media companies exist within the Canadian media landscape as well. In 2007, CTVglobemedia, Astral Media, Quebecor, Canwest Global, and Rogers all expanded significantly, through the acquisitions of CHUM Limited, Standard Broadcasting, Osprey Media, Alliance Atlantis, and Citytv, respectively.

50|$|There {{may also}} be some {{large-scale}} owners {{in an industry that}} are not the causes of monopoly or oligopoly. Clear Channel Communications, especially since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, acquired many radio stations across the United States, and came to own more than 1,200 stations. However, the radio broadcasting industry in the United States and elsewhere can be regarded as oligopolistic regardless of the existence of such a player. Because radio stations are local in reach, each licensed a specific part of spectrum by the FCC in a specific local area, any local market is served by a limited number of stations. In most countries, this system of licensing makes many markets local oligopolies. The similar market structure exists for television broadcasting, <b>cable</b> systems and <b>newspaper</b> industries, all of which are characterized by the existence of large-scale owners. Concentration of ownership is often found in these industries.|$|R

50|$|English {{is used in}} {{official}} documents of business, government, the legal system, medicine, the sciences and as a medium of instruction. Filipinos prefer textbooks for subjects like calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, etc., written in English rather than Filipino. However, the topics are usually taught, even in colleges, in Tagalog or the local language. By way of contrast, native languages are often heard in colloquial and domestic settings, spoken mostly with family and friends. The use of English attempts to give an air of formality, given its use in school, government and various ceremonies. A percentage of the media such as <b>cable</b> television and <b>newspapers</b> are also in English; major television networks such as ABS-CBN and GMA and all AM radio stations broadcast primarily in Filipino.

40|$|The {{trend in}} media {{conglomeration}} has {{run at the}} speed of light over the past couple of decades, accelerated by the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In the midst of merger-mania the internet appeared to be a wide-open media terrain until America Online’s (AOL) acquisition of Time Warner. In light of this recent development between old and new media, this article will apply a critical political, economic, and theoretical framework to this emerging media environment by examining corporate ownership of Internet portal sites and search engines. As corporate presence on the Internet has increased, source diversity appears to decrease. Just after the 1996 Act became law, then Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Reed Hundt 1 had raised concern over fostering four different notions of diversity: outlet diversity, source diversity, voice diversity, and program diversity (Hundt 1996). Two of these concepts apply directly to the recent course of media conglomeration: outlet diversity, which refers to “the number of separately owned media outlets ” and source diversity, which concerns the number of “programming producers” or content producers (Hundt 1996). The term “source diversity ” will be used here to imply the number of separately owned media outlets, as well as the number of content producers. Corporate concentration subsists in practically all major media (broadcast television, <b>cable</b> television, radio, <b>newspapers,</b> magazines, book publishers, record distributors, etc.), whic...|$|R
40|$|Although {{scholars}} {{emphasize the}} transformative aspects of liberal and Civil Rights ideology as a remedy to past injustices, more consideration {{must be given}} to the history of identities that shape self-authorization for black women. This thesis is an intertexual analysis of the New York v. Brown, Dandridge, Hill, Johnson (N. Y. App. Div. 2007) criminal court case. <b>Newspapers,</b> <b>cable</b> news shows, and court transcripts illustrate how the focus concentrated on the women's performance of a supposed female masculinity, rather than the possibility of homophobic violence. This characterization of the women must be placed {{within the context of the}} racialization of gender and sexuality in the antebellum American south and moments that proceed. Injury to black women's bodies, in the form of rape, murder, forced removal, were not viewed as crimes because of their legal and moral standing as non -humans and property-plus. Reconstruction up to the early 1990 s conveniently used representations of the black community as scapegoats and distractions of U. S. economic failures. Interestingly, the representation of the women involved in New York v Brown vilified them in the media as inherently violent not only because of their blackness, but the performance of gender. Though there has been recent legislation on hate crimes to prevent violence and the realistic possibility on the institutionalization of gay/lesbian marriage, the continued violence against black queer youth remains unchallenged and invisible. While the prison and military industrial complexes have become containers for poor and racialized bodies, critiques against rights-based redress and the creation of spaces for alternative representations offer possibilitie...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} nature of Korean media giants among members of Asian media conglomerates {{in the era of}} media marketization. Since the 1980 s, each state in Asia has adopted neoliberal media laws and policies that have made its media systems more market-driven. This neoliberal media reform led to the restructuring of media systems from state-controlled systems to profit-oriented ones and facilitating the emergence of Asian media conglomerates. However, scholarship on {{the nature of}} Asian media giants has been sparse in critical media studies. Thus, I conduct a case study to explore the nature of Asian media giants with a focus on the interplay between media ownership and media markets {{in order to determine the}} major beneficiaries of Asian media marketization. I focus on the three Korean media conglomerates of Samsung, CJ and JoongAng Ilbo groups during the period from 1998 to 2012 when the Korean state applied the neoliberal media mode to the Korean media systems. Utilizing the theoretical approach of political economy of communication, I examine three points: (1) the relationship between the era of neoliberal media and the structures of four media markets (e. g., advertising, daily <b>newspaper,</b> <b>cable</b> television and film); (2) the interconnections among media expansions, media ownership and informal ties (e. g., blood and marriage ties); and (3) the relationship between the changed structures of those four media markets and corporate censorship of the three chaebol groups. To address these questions, I used both institutional and corporate profiling techniques and then analyzed both governmental and secondary documents, including those covering structures of media markets, media ownership, boards of directors, media expansions and emergent issues in the information and entertainment markets. Consequently, my analysis finds that neoliberal media laws and policies led to forming centralized market structures controlled by chaebol groups with connections to Western media conglomerates and/or foreign capital. Also, I find that the Lee family members used family connections to expand their media businesses and control multiple media operations, thereby becoming the media emperor in Korea. Finally, my analysis shows that a media-oriented ideology has rarely guaranteed free competition among market players but has instead led to increasing the market polarization between a few market controllers and many independent media companies. In other words, my study indicates that the neoliberal media mode allowed family capitalists in Korea with foreign capital to control the structures of media markets...|$|R
