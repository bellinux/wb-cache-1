30|$|In {{the first}} phase, as {{depicted}} in Figure 5 (b), PSTN will be bypassed by adding the I-CSCF function in BGCF. Although in this phase SIP devices cannot be supported, some services that are more easily implemented on SIP, such as voice calling and <b>click</b> <b>to</b> <b>dial,</b> may be implemented for the conventional Cable user endpoints. These are the services which can make differentiation for MSOs from telephony provider competitors. In {{the second phase of}} migrating toward IMS, MSOs may support SIP clients by adding the P-CSCF functions and developing SIP MTAs (see Figure 5 (c)). In addition, S-CSCF functions {{should be included in the}} CMS. Therefore, an IMS-like service control overlay will be set up with completion of this phase. Moreover, by expanding the customer space, MSOs are able to focus on their business goals and provide more advanced service features such as conference calling, call forwarding, and integrated voicemail and messaging.|$|E
40|$|AMC Technology {{wanted to}} add voice over IP (VoIP) {{functionality}} to Salesforce. com (Customer Relationship Management system). As it is currently, Salesforce. com does not have voice functionality, in that you cannot place or receive calls using Salesforce. Adding voice functionality to Salesforce is incredibly useful because it {{eliminates the need for}} hardware phones and allows for a more modern and efficient approach to calling for companies that have/rely upon call centers, such as customers of AMC Technology whose products connect CTIs (Computer Telephony Interface) and CRMs. We used a voice service called Twilio to provide functionality with Salesforce. AMC Technology {{wanted to add}} the ability to <b>click</b> <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> a client’s number associated with an account and have an outgoing call occur. Also, upon calling an agent using Salesforce, the caller’s account information should popup on the page. We were able to add these features by writing code using Twilio API libraries and nesting that code within AMC’s Contact Canvas Agent (CCA). This would allow for the CCA to pull the voice functionality from Twilio, make a connection with Salesforce and implement the voice functionality into Salesforce. We successfully added these features and will demo them at our station. The benefits of this project are that the need for hardware phones is nonexistent with the use of VoIP functionality and users will have an increase in ease of use along with more time saved on each call.

40|$|The optical {{band gap}} bowing of {{eighteen}} III–V compound alloys containing boron is calculated {{by means of}} a recent phenomenological model [M. Ferhat, Phys. Status Solidi b 241 (2004) R 38]. The optical band gap bowing is found to be strong for the all studied III–V boron alloys. In particular, we find that BNSb shows an important optical band gap bowing of 19. 78 eV. Parallel to this, we also introduce ab initio pseudopotential plane wave calculations with large relaxed supercells to check the validity of our phenomenological model for BNSb. This gives an optical bowing of 21. 19 eV, in fairly good agreement with the model used. Results suggest that the III–V boron alloys are characterized by a strong competition between the volume deformation <b>Click</b> <b>to</b> view the MathML source, charge transfer <b>Click</b> <b>to</b> view the MathML source, and structural relaxation <b>Click</b> <b>to</b> view the MathML source effects.
