6000|$|A {{few minutes}} more {{and they came}} on a [...] "pare" [...] of men (in other words, a band {{of two or more}} men working together) who were [...] "stopeing-in the back of the level," [...] as they termed the process of <b>cutting</b> <b>upwards</b> into the roof.|$|E
60|$|Then Gilmore, {{who never}} liked {{that there should}} be a laugh against himself, took his leave and walked home across the fields. Fenwick passed up through the garden, and, when he was near the terrace which ran along the garden front of the house, he thought that he heard a voice. He stood under the shade of a wall dark with ivy, and {{distinctly}} heard whispering on the other side of it. As far as he could tell there were the voices of more than two men. He wished now that he had kept Gilmore with him,--not that he was personally afraid of the trespassers, for his courage was of that steady settled kind which enables the possessor to remember that men who are doing deeds of darkness are ever afraid of those whom they are injuring; but had there been an ally with him his prospect of catching one or more of the ruffians would have been greatly increased. Standing where he was he would probably be able to interrupt them, should they attempt to enter the house; but in the mean time they might be stripping his fruit from the wall. They were certainly, at present, in the kitchen garden, and he was not minded to leave them there at such work as they might have in hand. Having paused to think of this, he crept along under the wall, close to the house, towards the passage by which he could reach them. But they had not heard him, nor had they waited among the fruit. When he was near the corner of the wall, one leading man came round within a foot or two of the spot on which he stood; and, before he could decide on what he would do, the second had appeared. He rushed forward with the loaded stick in his hand, but, knowing its weight, and remembering the possibility of the comparative innocence of the intruders, he hesitated to strike. A blow on the head would have brained a man, and a knock on the arm with such an instrument would break the bone. In a moment he found his left hand on the leading man's throat, and the man's foot behind his heel. He fell, but as he fell he did strike heavily, <b>cutting</b> <b>upwards</b> with his weapon, and bringing the heavy weight of lead at the end of it on to the man's shoulder. He stumbled rather than fell, but when he regained his footing, the man was gone. That man was gone, and two others were following him down towards the gate at the bottom of the orchard. Of these two, in a few strides, he was able to catch the hindermost, and then he found himself wrestling with Sam Brattle.|$|E
50|$|Underbucking {{is a type}} of log bucking <b>cutting</b> <b>upwards</b> {{from the}} bottom of a {{suspended}} log as opposed to overbucking which is cutting from the top down.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Corduroy: This modern diagram {{shows the}} warp (3) {{and the long}} (red-4) and short (green-5) weft threads; {{traditionally}} the knife (1) and the guide (2) are attached and the <b>cutting</b> motion is <b>upwards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1938, Citroën {{introduced}} the Citroën Traction Avant in a [...] "Commerciale" [...] version with a tailgate, initially with a two-piece tailgate, {{of which the}} upper piece hinged <b>upwards,</b> <b>cutting</b> well into the roof, and after World War 2 with a one-piece top-hinged hatchback.|$|R
5000|$|The {{badge of}} the 11th Gurkha Rifles was crossed kukris, points <b>upwards,</b> <b>cutting</b> edge inwards, with [...] "XI" [...] above the intersection. [...] The 11 Gorkha Rifles, {{formed by the}} Indian Army in 1948 after the Partition of India, uses the same badge. It does not claim any {{connection}} with the First World War regiment.|$|R
5000|$|Although RC {{drilling}} is air-powered, {{water is}} also used to reduce dust, keep the drill bit cool, and assist in pushing <b>cutting</b> back <b>upwards,</b> but also when [...] "collaring" [...] a new hole. A mud called [...] "Liqui-Pol" [...] is mixed with water and pumped into the rod string, down the hole. This helps to bring up the sample to the surface by making the sand stick together. Occasionally, [...] "Super-Foam" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "Quik-Foam") {{is also used}}, to bring all the very fine cuttings to the surface, and to clean the hole. When the drill reaches hard rock, a [...] "collar" [...] is put down the hole around the rods, which is normally PVC piping. Occasionally the collar may be made from metal casing. Collaring a hole is needed to stop the walls from caving in and bogging the rod string {{at the top of the}} hole. Collars may be up to 60 metres deep, depending on the ground, although if drilling through hard rock a collar may not be necessary.|$|R
50|$|In headhunting it was {{necessary}} to be able to draw the parang quickly. For this purpose, the mandau is fairly short, which also better serves the purpose of trailcutting in dense forest. It is holstered with the <b>cutting</b> edge facing <b>upwards</b> and at that side there is an upward protrusion on the handle, so it can be drawn very quickly with the side of the hand without having to reach over and grasp the handle first. The hand can then grasp the handle while it is being drawn. The combination of these three factors (short, cutting edge up and protrusion) makes for an extremely fast drawing-action.|$|R
5000|$|RAB {{drilling}} is {{used primarily}} for mineral exploration, water bore drilling and blast-hole drilling in mines, {{as well as}} for other applications such as engineering, etc. RAB produces lower quality samples because the cuttings are blown up the outside of the rods and can be contaminated from contact with other rocks.RAB drilling at extreme depth, if it encounters water, may rapidly clog the outside of the hole with debris, precluding removal of drill cuttings from the hole. This can be counteracted, however, with the use of [...] "stabilizers" [...] also known as [...] "reamers", which are large cylindrical pieces of steel attached to the drill string, and made to perfectly fit the size of the hole being drilled. These have sets of rollers on the side, usually with tungsten buttons, that constantly break down <b>cuttings</b> being pushed <b>upwards.</b>|$|R
