40|$|BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy with a {{possible}} polypectomy is an efficient and preferred screening method to {{reduce the incidence of}} colorectal cancer (CRC). However, critics argue that, to date, a reduction of incidence and mortality from CRC has not been demonstrated in a population-based setting. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of and mortality from CRC among individuals screened by colonoscopy and non-screened individuals. DESIGN: A <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> study. SETTING: Population-based setting in a precisely defined area with a low level of population migration. PATIENTS: This study involved 1912 screened and 20, 774 control participants. INTERVENTION: CRC cases in this <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> study were prospectively collected during the screening period of 1 year and the follow-up period of 6 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up data were corrected for negligible migration balance in the area. Tumor characteristics and risk or protective factors, age and sex, participation in general health screening examinations, history of CRC in a first-degree relative, smoking status, body mass index, frequency of sports activity, eating habits, and patients' professions were recorded. RESULTS: Overall cancer incidence was significantly lower in the screened group compared with the non-screened group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0. 31; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 16 - 0. 59; P <. 001). Colon cancer-associated mortality also was clearly lower (adjusted OR 0. 12; 95 % CI, 0. 01 - 0. 93; P =. 04). Risk factors such as lifestyle, smoking, and body mass index as well as family history were similar in both groups. Blue-collar workers had a higher incidence of CRC compared with professionals. The risk factors for CRC were a positive family history and smoking. LIMITATIONS: Number and ethnicity of the participants, non-randomized study. CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy with polypectomy significantly reduces CRC incidence and cancer-related mortality in the general population...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model describing how the uncertainty due to influential exogenous processes combines with stochasticity intrinsic to physiological aging processes and propagates through time to generate {{uncertainty about the}} future physiological state of the population.

In the study, which included {{the largest number of}} isolates to date, by analyzing pooled L 1, LCR, E 6, E 5 a, and E 5 b sequences (3217 bp) of an individual isolate, a total of 23 genomic variants were identified, of which three (5 isolates) and twenty (58 isolates) corresponded to prototypic and non-prototypic variant groups, respectively. Several novel, potentially important mutations are described. Full-length genome sequences of ten isolates revealed more than 99 % similarity to the HPV 11 prototype isolate.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate VL dynamics in a prospective cohort study of dogs in Juatuba, between 2010 and 2011, to confirm the incidence of Leishmania infantum, and to assess possible risk factors associated with infection. An observational and prospective <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> study was performed using serology testing in dogs, randomly selected from the whole municipality. All seronegative dogs, or dogs with inconclusive results were monitored using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) at 6 -month intervals. The dog's owners completed a semi-structured questionnaire to assess possible causal factors of seroconversion, and the responses were assessed using logistic regression. The canine incidence coefficient was 206 / 1, 000 dogs per year (CI: 178 - 238), and a cluster was identified in an area with a high concentration of seropositive dogs, but a low overall canine population. Large dogs were identified as a risk factor and the following variables were identified as protection factors: dogs aged over 4 years, daily peridomicile cleaning, and better socioeconomic conditions.

40|$|The {{sample size}} {{required}} for a cluster randomised trial is inflated compared with an individually randomised trial because outcomes of participants from the same cluster are correlated. Sample size calculations for longitudinal cluster randomised trials (including stepped wedge trials) need {{to take account of}} at least two levels of clustering: the clusters themselves and times within clusters. We derive formulae for sample size for repeated cross-section and <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> cluster randomised trials with normally distributed outcome measures, under a multilevel model allowing for variation between clusters and between times within clusters. Our formulae agree with those previously described for special cases such as crossover and analysis of covariance designs, although simulation suggests that the formulae could underestimate required sample size when the number of clusters is small. Whether using a formula or simulation, a sample size calculation requires estimates of nuisance parameters, which in our model include the intracluster correlation, cluster autocorrelation, and individual autocorrelation. A cluster autocorrelation less than 1 reflects a situation where individuals sampled from the same cluster at different times have less correlated outcomes than individuals sampled from the same cluster at the same time. Nuisance parameters could be estimated from time series obtained in similarly clustered settings with the same outcome measure, using analysis of variance to estimate variance components.

40|$|Abstract Background Disease {{incidence}} and prevalence are both core indicators of population health. Incidence {{is generally not}} as readily accessible as prevalence. Cohort studies and electronic health record systems are two major way to estimate disease incidence. The former is time-consuming and expensive; the latter is not available in most developing countries. Alternatively, mathematical models {{could be used to}} estimate disease incidence from prevalence. Methods We proposed and validated a method to estimate the age-standardized incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with prevalence data from successive surveys and mortality data from empirical studies. Hallett 2 ̆ 019 s method designed for estimating HIV infections in Africa was modified to estimate the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in the U. S. population and incidence of heart disease in the Canadian population. Results Model-derived estimates were in close agreement with observed incidence from cohort studies and population surveillance systems. This method correctly captured the trend in incidence given sufficient waves of cross-sectional surveys. The estimated MI declining rate in the U. S. population was in accordance with the literature. This method was superior to <b>closed</b> <b>cohort,</b> in terms of the estimating trend of population cardiovascular disease incidence. Conclusion It is possible to estimate CVD incidence accurately at the population level from cross-sectional prevalence data. This method {{has the potential to be}} used for age- and sex- specific incidence estimates, or to be expanded to other chronic conditions...|$|E
40|$|WHO {{guidelines}} {{call for}} universal antiretroviral treatment, and UNAIDS {{has set a}} global target to virally suppress most HIV-positive individuals. Accurate estimates of population-level coverage at {{each step of the}} HIV care cascade (testing, treatment, and viral suppression) are needed to assess the effectiveness of 2 ̆ 2 test and treat 2 ̆ 2 strategies implemented to achieve this goal. The data available to inform such estimates, however, are susceptible to informative missingness: the number of HIV-positive individuals in a population is unknown; individuals tested for HIV may not be representative of those whom a testing intervention fails to reach, and HIV-positive individuals with a viral load measured may not be representative of those for whom no viral load is obtained. We provide an in-depth description of the statistical methods (target parameters, assumptions, statistical estimands, and algorithms) used in an interim analysis of the intervention arm of the SEARCH Study (NCT 01864603) to analyze progress towards the UNAIDS 90 - 90 - 90 target at study baseline and after one and two years.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the total cancer incidence {{in relation to}} a 5 -year exposure to caesium- 137 ((137) Cs) from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. METHODS: A <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> was defined as all individuals living in the three most contaminated counties in mid-Sweden in 1986. Fallout of (137) Cs was retrieved as a digital map from the Geological Survey of Sweden, demographic data from Statistics Sweden, and cancer diagnosis from the National Board of Health and Welfare. Individuals were assigned an annual (137) Cs exposure based on their place of residence (1986 - 1990), from which 5 -year cumulative (137) Cs exposures were calculated, accounting for the physical decay of (137) Cs and changing residencies. HRs were adjusted for age, sex, rural/non-rural residence and pre-Chernobyl total cancer incidence. RESULTS: The 734   537 people identified were categorised by exposure: the first quartile was low exposure (0. 0 - 45. 4  kBq/m(2)), the second and third quartiles were intermediate exposure (45. 41 - 118. 8  kBq/m(2)), and the fourth quartile was the highest exposure (118. 81 - 564. 71  kBq/m(2)).

To investigate the potential effect of adverse selection in a term life insurance market, a discrete-time, discrete-state, Markov chain is used to track the evolution of twelve <b>closed</b> <b>cohorts</b> of women, differentiated by family history of breast and ovarian cancer and age at issue of a 20 -year annually renewable term life insurance policy.

Each year, the insurer calculates the expected premiums and expected future benefit payouts which determine the following year 2 ̆ 7 s premium schedule. At the end of each policy year, women can change their life insurance benefit, influenced by their testing status and premium changes.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the participation rate and participant characteristics in a <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> of subjects in a geographic region where arthritis SMPs have been offered multiple times and continuously for 2 decades. Methods. Data were from osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis subjects participating in the Arthritis, Rheuma-tism, and Aging Medical Information System (ARAMIS) who resided in the San Francisco (SF) Bay area who had responded to questions about ever participating in an SMP.

40|$|Abstract Objective. This study {{examined}} whether age, gender, and comorbidity were {{of importance for}} an individual's choice of listing with either a public or a private primary health care (PHC) practice. Design and setting. The study was a register-based <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> study in one private and one public PHC practice in Blekinge County in southern Sweden. Subjects. A cohort (12 696 individuals) was studied comprising all those listed with the public or private PHC practice on 1 October 2005 who were also listed with the public PHC practice on 1 October 2004. Main outcome measures. The listing/re-listing behaviour {{of the population in}} this cohort was studied at two points in time, 1 October 2005 and 1 October 2006, with respect to age, gender, and comorbidity level as measured by the ACG Case-Mix system. Results. Individuals listed with the public practice both on 1 October 2005 and one year later were significantly older, were more often females, and had a higher comorbidity level than individuals listed with the private practice. Individuals with a higher comorbidity level were more likely to re-list or to stay listed with the public practice. Conclusions. This study shows that the probability of choosing a public instead of private PHC provider increased with higher age and comorbidity level of the individuals. It is suggested that using a measure of comorbidity can help us understand more about the chronically ill individual's choice of health care provider. This would be of importance when health care policy-makers decide on reimbursement system or organization of PHC...|$|E
40|$|Background: Blacks {{are more}} likely to be {{diagnosed}} at a later stage of colorectal cancer (CRC), and have poorer survival than Whites. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is usually curable when diagnosed at an early stage. Objectives: We compare the use of CRC tests for screening between Whites and Blacks and compare the use of CRC tests for either screening or diagnosis and further check the test results for a diagnosis of CRC. Data: The data we use are from physician claims files provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (1996 – 2000) for a <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> of all Ten-nesseans eligible for Medicare in 1996, age $ 6. Results: Half as many Blacks as Whites were screened with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Significantly fewer Blacks had any colorectal procedures, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and/ or barium enema, for screening or diagnosis; however, the test results show that more Blacks were diagnosed with CRC than Whites. The use of CRC tests is low regardless of race. Only 24 % of beneficiaries used at least one of the four procedures during the five years. During the five years, FOBT and barium enema use decreased significantly for both Blacks and Whites, while colonoscopy use increased significantly. Sigmoidoscopy use was highest in 1998, which corresponds to the change of Medicare coverage policy in 1998. Conclusions: Removal of financial barriers to screening alone has failed to substantially improve the use of colorectal procedures. Lack of vigilance and lack of access to good quality of care contribute to the fact that Blacks {{are more likely}} to be diagnosed at a late stage o...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} student experience and {{formation of a}} professional identity on undergraduate and postgraduate occupational therapy and physiotherapy programmes at Hillside University. In my administrative role, I was aware that the student experience on these programmes did not reflect the typical “college experience” associated with transitions into student and campus life and then towards qualification. These health profession students make simultaneous transitions into higher education, and into a profession through practice placement settings where they learn skills and work alongside health professionals. Thus, they navigate between two worlds of very distinct modes of learning and socialisation, with the shared objective of a professional qualification and career. Using a phenomenological approach, the study explores those transitions through the subjective eyes of the participants. Data was gathered using semi-structured interviews with first and final year students on both UG and PG professional courses over one academic year, offering a longitudinal perspective and revealing students’ personal experiences {{of the formation of}} a professional identity through learning and socialisation. The study reveals how students engage less in traditional student activities due to anticipated periods on placements, and some non-standard start dates, and how students develop a strong focus on their learning and <b>close</b> <b>cohort</b> and peer groups bonds. The research found that as practice placements were experienced, students became more engaged with their future professions in the placement contexts, and also more distant with the university and its conceptualisation of a learner’s identity.

40|$|Objectives: Measles was endemic in England {{during the}} early 1800 s; however, it did not arrive in Australia until 1850 whereas other {{infectious}} diseases were known to have arrived much earlier—many with the First Fleet in 1788 —leading {{to the question of}} why there was a difference. Design: Ships surgeons’ logbooks from historical archives, 1829 – 1882, were retrospectively reviewed for measles outbreak data. Infectious disease modelling techniques were applied to determine whether ships would reach Australia with infectious measles cases. Setting: Historical ship surgeon logbooks of measles outbreaks occurring on journeys from Britain to Australia were examined to provide new insights into measles epidemiology. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Serial intervals and basic reproduction numbers (R 0), immunity, outbreak generations, age-distribution, within-family transmission and outbreak lengths for measles within these <b>closed</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Results: Five measles outbreaks were identified (163 cases). The mean serial interval (101 cases) was 12. 3  days (95 % CI 12. 1 to 12. 5). Measles R 0 (95 cases) ranged from 7. 7 – 10. 9. Immunity to measles was lowest among children ≤ 10  years old (range 37 – 42 %), whereas 94 – 97 % of adults appeared immune. Outbreaks ranged from 4 – 6 generations and, before 1850, were 41 and 38  days in duration. Two outbreaks after 1850 lasted longer than 70  days and one lasted 32  days. Conclusions: Measles syndrome reporting in a ship surgeon's logs provided remarkable detail on prevaccination measles epidemiology in the closed environment of ship voyages. This study found lower measles R 0 and a shorter mean clinical serial interval than is generally reported. Archival ship surgeon log books indicate it was unlikely that measles was introduced into Australia before 1850, owing to high levels of pre-existing immunity in ship passengers, low numbers of travelling children and the journey's length from England to Australia.

40|$|AIM: Recently, a {{polymorphism}} in the NOS 1 AP gene (rs 10494366), a regulator of neuronal {{nitric oxide}} synthase (nNOS), was associated with QTc prolongation. Both nNOS and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) regulate intracellular calcium levels and {{have an important role}} in cardiovascular homeostasis.

METHODS: The data from the Rotterdam study, a population-based <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> study of Caucasian individuals of ≥ 55 years of age, were used. We identified 1113 participants in the Rotterdam Study who were prescribed CCBs for the first time between 1991 and 2005. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality was assessed in participants who were prescribed CCBs with different NOS 1 AP rs 10494366 genotypes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: In participants starting on dihydropyridine CCBs (amlodipine, nifedipine and others) all-cause mortality (n = 79) risks were higher in participants with the TG [hazard ratio (HR) 2. 57, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 24, 5. 34] or the GG genotype (HR 3. 18, 95 % CI 1. 18, 8. 58) than in participants with the referent TT genotype. Cardiovascular mortality (n = 54) risks were 3. 51 (95 % CI 1. 41, 8. 78) for the TG genotype and 6. 00 (95 % CI 1. 80, 20. 0) for the GG genotype. No differences in all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality were seen in participants starting with the nondihydropyridine CCBs verapamil or diltiazem. CONCLUSION: The minor G allele of rs 10494366 in the NOS 1 AP gene is associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in Caucasian users of dihydropyridine CCBs. The mechanism underlying the observed association is unknown...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The World Health Organization has {{identified}} obesity {{as one of}} the most visible and neglected public health problems worldwide. Meta-analytic studies suggest that insufficient sleep increases the risk of developing obesity and related serious medical conditions. Unfortunately, the nationwide average sleep duration has steadily declined over the last two decades with 25 % of U. S. adults reporting insufficient sleep. Stress is also an important indirect factor in obesity, and chronic stress and laboratory-induced stress negatively impact sleep. Despite what we know from basic sciences about (a) stress and sleep and (b) sleep and obesity, we know very little about how these factors actually manifest in a natural environment. The Assessing Daily Activity Patterns Through Occupational Transitions (ADAPT) study tests whether sleep disruption plays a key role in the development of obesity for individuals exposed to involuntary job loss, a life event that is often stressful and disrupting to an individual’s daily routine. Methods This is an 18 -month <b>closed,</b> <b>cohort</b> research design examining social rhythms, sleep, dietary intake, energy expenditure, waist circumference, and weight gain over 18  months in individuals who have sustained involuntary job loss. Approximately 332 participants who lost their job within the last 3  months are recruited from flyers within the Arizona Department of Economic Security (AZDES) Unemployment Insurance Administration application packets and other related postings. Multivariate growth curve modeling will be used to investigate the temporal precedence of changes in social rhythms, sleep, and weight gain. Discussion It is hypothesized that: (1) unemployed individuals with less consistent social rhythms and worse sleep will have steeper weight gain trajectories over 18  months than unemployed individuals with stable social rhythms and better sleep; (2) disrupted sleep will mediate the relationship between social rhythm disruption and weight gain; and (3) reemployment will be associated with a reversal in the negative trajectories outlined above. Positive findings will provide support for the development of obesity prevention campaigns targeting sleep and social rhythms in an accessible subgroup of vulnerable individuals...|$|E

In this pilot study we used existing registries and whole-body measurements to develop algorithms to calculate lifetime effective doses and collective doses to some hunters in Sweden. Ten hunters and their family members were randomly selected from each of the three most contaminated counties in Sweden (Västernorrland, Uppsala, Gävleborg) using the register for hunting weapons from the Police Authority in 1985. Hence, this design can be regarded as a <b>closed</b> <b>cohort</b> only including hunters and their family members living in these three counties {{at the time of the}} accident. Statistics Sweden matched these individuals (n = 85) with their dwelling coordinates onto the digital map produced by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority after aerial measurements of 137 Cs (kBq m− 2). Internal effective doses were estimated using aggregated transfer factors from ground deposition to in-vivo body concentration for 134 Cs and 137 Cs in hunters (Bq kg− 1). External effective doses were also calculated on the dwelling coordinate for 134 Cs, 137 Cs and short-lived nuclides in these three counties. Annual effective doses for external and internal doses were then cumulated up to a life expectancy of 80 years for men and 84 years for women, respectively. The total lifetime effective doses to the members of the hunter families in this cohort were on average 8. 3 mSv in Västernorrland, 4. 7 mSv in Uppsala and 4. 1 mSv in Gävleborg. The effective dose to men were about 40 % higher than in women. In all counties the internal dose was about 75 % of the total lifetime effective dose. The collective dose for all hunters with family members, in total about 44, 000 individuals, in these three counties could be approximated at about 256 manSv. This study shows it is possible to use register data to develop algorithms for calculating lifetime effective dose commitments for hunters with relatively accuracy...|$|E

We explain these empirical results by showing that the logic of Gibrat 2 ̆ 019 s law applies not to total income, but to permanent income and to maginal utility.

5000|$|The goat {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{domestic}}ated creatures, yet readily goes feral and does quite well on its own. Sheep are <b>close</b> contemporaries and <b>cohorts</b> of goats in the history of domestication, but the domestic sheep is quite vulnerable to predation and injury, and thus rarely seen in a feral state. However, in places where there are few predators, they get on well, for example in the case of the Soay sheep. Both goats and sheep were sometimes intentionally released and allowed to go feral on island waypoints frequented by mariners, to serve as a ready food source.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{relation between}} inpatient {{length of stay}} after hip fracture and risk of death after hospital discharge. Setting Population >= 50 years old living in Sweden as of 31 December 2005 with a first hip fracture the years 2006 - 12. Participants 116 111 patients with an incident hip fracture from a <b>closed</b> nationwide <b>cohort.</b> Main outcome measure Death within 30 days of hospital discharge in relation to hospital length of stay after adjustment for multiple covariates. Results Mean inpatient length of stay after a hip fracture decreased from 14. 2 days in 2006 to 11. 6 days in 2012 (P= 11 days (n= 56 957), a 1 -day reduction in length of stay {{was not associated with}} an increased risk of death after discharge during any of the years of follow up. Limitations No accurate evaluation of the underlying cause of death could be performed. Conclusion Shorter length of stay in hospital after hip fracture is associated with increased risk of death after hospital discharge, but only among patients with length of stay of 10 days or less. This association remained robust over consecutive years...|$|R
