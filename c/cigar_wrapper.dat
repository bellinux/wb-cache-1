5000|$|By 1700, tobacco {{was being}} {{exported}} via the Connecticut River to European ports. The use of Connecticut Valley tobacco as a <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> leaf {{began in the}} 1820s. By the 1830s, tobacco farmers were experimenting with different seeds and processing techniques.Knowing {{that they were not}} the only players in the <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> economy, farmers began planting a new tobacco species in 1875, the Havana Seed. Area farmers grew tobacco for the two outside layers of cigars, the binder and the wrapper. A tobacco leaf type named Shoestring, then Broadleaf and Havana Seed were used.|$|E
5000|$|... 1900: Sumatran tobacco {{was planted}} under cloth {{canopies}} in Connecticut {{in an effort}} to simulate Sumatra’s tropical climate. The resulting shade grown tobacco was considered second to none for making <b>cigar</b> <b>wrappers</b> and consequently revolutionized the industry in the Connecticut Valley.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{three men}} - {{brothers}} Eli and Robert Rosenbaum and Walter Rosskam, a college classmate of Eli - had formed the R&R Chemical Company, which made <b>cigar</b> <b>wrappers</b> and <b>cigar</b> binding fluids. In 1920, they approached David Michael to purchase some guns for their cigar wrapping base.|$|R
50|$|Working {{conditions}} {{varied from}} backbreaking work for young local children, ages 13 and up, to backbreaking exploitation of migrants. Each tobacco plant yields only 18 leaves useful as <b>cigar</b> <b>wrappers,</b> and each leaf requires {{a great deal}} of individual manual attention during harvesting. Although the temperature in the curing sheds sometimes exceeds 38 C no work is done inside the sheds while the tobacco is being fired.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Jose Aray Marin, {{founder of}} the Don Cervantes factory, {{developed}} the world-famous Ecuadoran Sumatra breed in 1967. It is now considered the world’s premium <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> leaf and is in demand by cigar manufacturers worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Habano <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> is a leaf {{grown from}} a Cuban seed, hence the word “Habano” or “Havano,” {{referring}} to Cuba’s capital. Habano tobacco wrapper is darker in colour, has a much spicier flavor, a richer aroma, and has been grown in Nicaragua’s Jalapa Valley and Estelí since the 1990’ s.|$|E
50|$|Colonel Henry DuVal, {{president}} of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, shipped samples of Gadsden County tobacco to New York for leaf dealers and cigar manufacturers to inspect. Soon representatives of several companies came down from New York to purchase land for growing tobacco. There was such an influx of land purchases {{that a number of}} packing houses arose. This continued until 1970 when tobacco companies came under fire and demand diminished. Around 1970, growing tobacco declined substantially in Gadsden. The development of a homogenized <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper,</b> the ever-increasing cost of production, the subsidizing of the tobacco culture in Central America by the U.S. government, and the increasing, negative legal climate against the tobacco industry have added to the demise of Gadsden's future in tobacco. The last crop of shade-grown <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> tobacco was grown in 1977.|$|E
50|$|Previously {{referred}} to as the “Tobacco Substation,” the Valley Laboratory in Windsor, CT {{has a long history of}} improving the cultivation of tobacco leaves in Connecticut for use as fine <b>cigar</b> <b>wrappers.</b> The “Tobacco Laboratory,” (now simply the Valley Laboratory) building was completed in 1941. Today, research covers areas such as the production of biofuel crops, invasive plant management, developing integrated pest management (IPM) methods for Connecticut nurseries, and management of the exotic hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae).|$|R

50|$|In 1828, Governor William P. Duval {{introduced}} Cuban tobacco to {{the territory}} of Florida. As a result, the culture of shade-grown <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> tobacco was a dominant factor {{in the social and}} economic development of Gadsden County. Tobacco is a native plant of the western hemisphere. Early European explorers discovered Native Americans growing the plant when they set foot on their soil.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers {{grew more}} {{varieties}} of tobacco and developed more breeds {{to fulfill the}} demands of the American market, citing continuous improvement of the breeds as the driving force. In 1967, Jose Aray successfully crossbred Cubano and Sumatra varieties developing what now is the standard Ecuadoran Sumatra breed, sought after for <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> leaf worldwide. The operation is now owned by the Aray family and The Achievement Cigar Company. They continue to grow and develop the Sumatra breed and many other varieties, particularly the Connecticut, Habana 2000, and Criollo 98 breeds, especially for wrappers and fillers.|$|E

5000|$|Individually {{packaged}} blunt leaves {{have been}} available for many years. These are tobacco leaves that because of their nature and appearance are used to roll a cigar in one continuous sheet (thus the name blunt is used). The United States Tobacco Taxation Board has classified all individual <b>cigar</b> <b>wrappers</b> as [...] "blunts" [...] and taxes them as roll-your-own tobacco. Many US states classify blunt wraps as tobacco and a license is required to sell them and collect tax. Canada defines a blunt wrap as [...] "a sheet or tube made of tobacco used to roll cigarette tobacco in—similar to rolling paper". Use of these single continuous sheets {{is closer to the}} original blunts of the 19th century since it is not a spiral wrap.|$|R
50|$|This smooth, good-looking leaf {{yielded a}} higher percent of wrapper quality cigars. Just {{a few decades}} later, in the Late 1890s, the Sumatra leaf was adopted for growth in Connecticut. The demand for high quality <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> was never ending. This pushed Connecticut growers and {{scientists}} to develop a leaf so smooth and golden that it would dominate the market. This means that farmers and scientists worked together to develop a hybrid just to beat out competition in Cuba and Asia. Using over thirty samples from Cuba and Sumatra, Shade Tobacco was born in 1900, and the first shade-leaf tent was put up on River Street in Windsor. This new plant meant new labor.|$|E
50|$|Saturday, February 27, 1932, marked Crosby's last {{appearance}} as the Cremo Singer as the sponsor abruptly cancelled the show which puzzled CBS President Bill Paley {{for a couple}} of years until he received an explanation. It seems that the Cremo cigar was heavily advertised and sold as a machine-made cigar, which supposedly had a big advantage over the handmade variety because no worker's saliva would touch the <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> in making the cigar. However, sales of the cigar went so well that the production manager had to augment the machine-made cigars with some of the hand-made variety. He had not told his superiors about this and when the company president eventually found out, he cancelled the radio show because his advertising would have been shown to be untrue.|$|E
40|$|Prompt tillage after crop harvest was {{investigated}} {{as a cultural}} control for the tobacco cyst nematode, Globodera tabacum tabacum, on stalk-cut broadleaf <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> tobacco. Stalk stumps and roots remaining after harvest were destroyed by tilling immediately or from 2 to 6 wk after harvest in field experiments over 4 yr. Cyst nematode Pf/Pi ratios ranged from 0. 65 to 1. 62 when plants were tilled immediately after harvest and 1. 13 to 5. 88 when tillage was delayed. Nematode population development was monitored by inoculating plants in pots placed in fields with J 2 in eggs and sampling over time (8 to 18 wk). Three generations per year were observed, and G. t. tabacum generation time was as short as 6 wk for each generation. Destroying stalks and root systems remaining after harvesting stalk-cut broadleaf <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> tobacco removes the host to preclude development of nematodes {{at the end of}} the second and entire third generation. Early tillage resulted in consistently lower tobacco cyst nematode populations than allowing viable roots to remain in fields for an additional 8 to 18 wk. This management tactic reduces the need for nematicide application to slow nematode population increases over time and can reduce losses due to infection by G. t. tabacum...|$|E

40|$|Tobacco is {{a native}} to the Americas. Indigenous peoples smoked and {{otherwise}} used tobacco leaves for ceremonial and medicinal purposes for at least 25 centuries before dried tobacco leaves were handed to Christopher Columbus as a gift when he landed in the Caribbean. It has been grown commercially in the United States {{as far back as}} 1612 when the European colonist John Rolf, who later married Pocahontas, first planted seeds in Virginia for export to England (APVA, Breed). Overview The tobacco industry has gone through a considerable amount of change over the last decade. It has experienced a significant downturn in demand related to health concerns from smoking, a settlement on medical costs, and a notable change in marketing from auction markets to contracts. In addition, significant legislative changes in 2004 resulted in the elimination of price supports and a quota buyout, thus eliminating quota and associated acreage and geographic planting restrictions. There are six major classes of tobacco including flue-cured, air-cured, fire-cured, cigar filler, cigar binder, and <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> (ERS (A)). Flue-cured tobacco accounted for 6...|$|E
40|$|Field microplot {{experiments}} were conducted from 1995 to 1998 {{to determine the}} relationship between fresh shoot weight of stalk-cut broadleaf and shade-grown <b>cigar</b> <b>wrapper</b> tobacco types (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and initial density of Globodera tabacum tabacum second stage juveniles (J 2) per cm³ soil. Total shoot weight was negatively correlated with initial nematode densities of 12. 3 to 747. 3 J 2 /cm³ soil (r = - 0. 53 and - 0. 70 for broadleaf and shade-grown tobacco, respectively). Nonlinear damage functions were used to relate initial G. t. tabacum densities to shoot weight. The models described shoot weight losses of less than 14 % or 39 % for broadleaf and shade tobacco, respectively, at G. t. tabacum densities below 50 J 2 /cm³ soil. Total shoot weights were reduced by 40 % and 60 % of uninfested plots as preplant nematode densities approached maximum levels (> 600 J 2 /cm³ soil) for broadleaf and shade tobacco, respectively. Globodera t. tabacum population increase over a growing season was described by a linear relation on a log/log plot (R² = 0. 07 and 0. 61 for broadleaf and shade, respectively). These experiments demonstrate that G. t. tabacum can directly reduce shoot weight of stalk-cut broadleaf tobacco. Broadleaf is more tolerant to nematode infection than shade tobacco, as shade tobacco shoot weight reductions were greater at the same initial nematode densities in the same years...|$|E
50|$|Medan did {{not develop}} rapidly until the 1860s, when the Dutch {{authorities}} began to release new land for tobacco plantations. Jacob Nienhuys, Van der Falk, and Elliot, who were Dutch tobacco merchants, pioneered {{the opening of}} the tobacco plantation in Deli. Nienhuys' previous tobacco business in Java moved to Deli after an invitation by an Arab from Surabaya named Said Abdullah Bilsagih, brother in law of the Deli Sultan Mahmud Perkasa Alam. Initially Nienhuys cultivated tobacco on 4,000 hectares of land in Tanjong Spassi, near Labuhan, owned by the Sultan of Deli. On March 1864, Nienhuys sent samples of his crop of tobacco to Rotterdam, Netherlands to test its quality. Apparently, the tobacco leaves were considered high quality for cigar materials. Hence Deli's name rose as a producer of the best <b>cigar</b> <b>wrappers</b> for Europeans.|$|R
50|$|That {{would change}} {{in the first half}} of the century, in part due to Connecticut's own {{metropolitan}} centers swelling in size, as well as improved machinery that enabled farmers to plant and harvest more crops, including the Hawkes Plow manufactured in Hartford beginning in the 1830s.The tobacco industry also saw its first significant growth {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, as farmers in the Connecticut River valley and later the Housatonic River valley found success with their leaves as <b>cigar</b> <b>wrappers.</b> By 1810, <b>cigar</b> and plug factories were established in East Windsor and Suffield.Farmers also sought to introduce better stocks of cattle, including Devonshires beginning in 1819; Ayrshires in 1822; Guernseys in 1830; Shorthorns in 1835; Jerseys in 1846; and Holsteins some time after 1860. From 85,000 milk cows in the state as of 1850, the herd would increase to 128,000 by the end of the century.|$|R
5000|$|A cigar's {{outermost}} layer, or wrapper (Spanish: [...] ), is {{the most}} expensive component of a <b>cigar.</b> The <b>wrapper</b> determines much of the cigar's character and flavor, and as such its color is often used to describe the cigar as a whole. Wrappers are frequently grown underneath huge canopies made of gauze so as to diffuse direct sunlight and are fermented separately from other rougher cigar components, with a view to the production of a thinly-veined, smooth, supple leaf.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{brand and}} type of cigar tastes different. While the wrapper does not entirely {{determine}} {{the flavor of the}} <b>cigar,</b> darker <b>wrappers</b> tend to produce a sweetness, while lighter wrappers usually have a [...] "drier" [...] taste. Whether a cigar is mild, medium, or full bodied does not correlate with quality. Some words used to describe cigar flavor and texture include; spicy, peppery (red or black), sweet, harsh, burnt, green, earthy, woody, cocoa, chestnut, roasted, aged, nutty, creamy, cedar, oak, chewy, fruity, and leathery.|$|R
50|$|Another oddity of the Quai d'Orsay {{line are}} its Corona cigars.

50|$|Aristoff is a {{brand of}} <b>cigar.</b> The leaves (<b>wrapper,</b> binder, and filler) are {{exclusively}} grown and cured in Nicaragua. The cigars are all hand-rolled in Chinandega, Nicaragua and at the company's Honduras-based satellite factory. The corporate headquarters of this firm, however, lie in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with their principal market being the American Eastern Seaboard. A relatively new company, the brande was launched amid great fanfare in 2002. The company was marketed heavily {{on the internet and}} through a viral marketing scheme. The great expectations fell flat, however, when the first few series of cigars did not meet with popular approval. Sales of the product fell 78% after the first year. Due to this plunge in revenue, the IPO in the company was called off in April 2003.|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{fertilizers}} have {{a decisive}} {{influence on the}} yield and quality of tobacco. Yield, percentage of plant N, wrapper leaf quality, and nicotine content are all important quality characteristics in tobacco growing. This work {{is an attempt to}} provide a tool for optimizing mineral N nutrition for Cuban cigar tobacco, using a strategy that links N supply with leaf N concentration and wrapper yield. Similar approaches developed worldwide have mainly involved Virginia and Burley tobacco types but not Cuban cigar tobacco. The objective of the current work is to identify the effects of fertilizer N levels and timing of application on each of the mentioned quality factors for shade grown Cuban cigar tobacco. Another purpose is to explore the usefulness of a quick method of assessing the N status of plants based on measuring leaf transmission at two different wavelengths (650 and 940 nm). The experiments were done in the main tobacco growing area of Cuba (Vueltabajo). In each experiment, nine separate treatments were used covering different levels and times of fertilizer N application. The same experiment was carried out in three different years (2005 - 2006, 2006 - 2007, 2007 - 2008) but as the results were similar only one set of data is described (2006 - 2007). The patterns of response to N fertilizer of all four quality measurements, including yield and wrapper leaf quality, were similar in the different replications of the experiments. The optimal fertilizer level was 140 - 190 kg N/ha (40 % applied on days 8 - 10 after transplanting and 60 % on days 18 - 20 after transplanting). The optimal N concentration of leaves taken at the central foliar level of the middle stalk position was 4. 3 - 4. 7 % at harvest time. Leaf transmission measurements by means of the SPAD- 502 Chlorophyll Meter {{in the early stages of}} growth were correlated with leaf chlorophyll and N concentration and provide an excellent guide for predicting Cuban <b>cigar</b> tobacco <b>wrapper</b> leaf yield...|$|R
