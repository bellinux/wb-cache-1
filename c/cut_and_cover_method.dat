5|$|The {{station was}} opened on 30 May 1870 by the DR (now the District line) when the railway {{extended}} its line from Westminster to Blackfriars. The {{construction of the}} new section of the DR was planned {{in conjunction with the}} building of the Victoria Embankment and was achieved by the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>method</b> of roofing over a trench. Due to its proximity to the South Eastern Railway's Charing Cross station, the station was originally called Charing Cross.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} {{construction}} of the B-Tunnel for the Frankfurt U-Bahn facilities in 1971, a subterranean level was added in front of the main building, featuring the city's first public escalator and including a large shopping mall, one station each for the U-Bahn and S-Bahn trains, an air raid shelter and a public car park. The subterranean stations were opened in 1978 and were built in the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>method,</b> which involved the demolition of the second northern hall and rebuilding it after the stations were completed.|$|E
25|$|The boggy undersoil of Paris made it {{impossible}} for the engineers to follow their initial concept of deeply excavated, metal-lined tunnels: digging deeper to more stable ground would raise costs. The line was finally established immediately underneath the streets using the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>method</b> of the CMP's lines, then the standard in use on the Metropolitan system. As a consequence, the layout contains several difficult curves especially in the northern part where narrow streets have a winding route. The line had 23 stations, all with vaulted roof construction. An interchange with lines A and B was established at Saint-Lazare, but there was no connection with the CMP's lines.|$|E
50|$|Construction on {{the tunnel}} began in 2007. The {{southern}} {{section of the}} tunnel is a subsurface road built using <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>methods,</b> while the northern part was tunnelled using a shield method. The tunnel has two levels, with each level carrying three lanes of traffic in one direction. The tunnel was opened on 28 March 2010.|$|R

50|$|The line now curves to {{the west}} and crosses a major steel truss bridge over the Maribyrnong River, before {{entering}} the Bunbury Street Tunnel, built by <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>methods</b> under the roadway of the same name. The tunnel emerges into a deep cutting that runs under Footscray Station, reaching ground level by Middle Footscray station. Running north of the Sunbury suburban line the lines continue parallel to West Footscray station where the freight line slews around the station platform. Here the standard gauge continues north around Tottenham Yard before becoming the North East and Western standard gauge lines, while the broad gauge continues through the yard, before reaching the Newport-Sunshine line and Sunshine station.|$|R
500|$|From the beginning, Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, and it {{is still}} {{considered}} to be [...] "one of Brighton's best sea-facing squares". By the mid-20th century, most of the houses had become hotels, and in early 1969 a surface-level car park was planned for the Brighton Corporation owned central garden; this was changed to a 520-space underground car park which was created using the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>method</b> in which the garden was dug up, the car park with roof constructed, and the lawns and flowerbeds restored. [...] Richard Seifert's , Modernist 24-storey residential block, Sussex Heights, was built in 1968 on land immediately to the east of the square, and was criticised for affecting the character of the square because of its contrasting style and height. During the early 1970s the hotels sought permission from Brighton Corporation to erect neon signs advertising themselves; after negotiation with the Regency Society, a Brighton-wide conservation group formed in 1945, the Corporation made the square and the surrounding area into a conservation area in 1973. [...] Conservation area status gives the council firmer control over planning permission and changes to buildings or street furniture, especially in respect of their effect on [...] "the character and appearance of the area". The original conservation area has since been enlarged twice to its present size of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of an}} {{underground}} railway linking the City of London {{with some of the}} railway termini in its urban centre was proposed in the 1830s, and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854. To prepare construction, a short test tunnel was built in 1855 in Kibblesworth, a small town with geological properties similar to London. This test tunnel was used for two years {{in the development of the}} first underground train, and was later, in 1861, filled up. The world's first underground railway, it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for {{an underground}} [...] "inner circle" [...] connecting London's main-line termini. [...] The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884, built using the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>method.</b> Both railways expanded, the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing, Hounslow, Uxbridge, Richmond and Wimbledon and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as [...] in Buckinghamshire, more than [...] from Baker Street and the centre of London.|$|E

50|$|The {{opportunity}} {{to remedy the}} situation {{and to make the}} eastern end of the canal more accessible to the general public was provided by the Big Lottery Fund Living Landmarks programme. £140 million of funding was on offer, and in 2005 the Helix project was awarded one of the top four prizes, which kick-started the £43 million project. The plans included a new 950 yd section of canal, which would join the river below the four fixed bridges at a new sea lock. A new tunnel under the M9 motorway would be constructed by <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>methods,</b> <b>and</b> a lift bridge would be inserted into the A905 road. The plans also included the re-routing of two high-pressure oil pipelines which crossed the area to feed the refinery at Grangemouth.|$|R
50|$|The {{first line}} of the Seoul Subway network started {{construction}} in 1971 with economic and technical assistance from Japan. The first section of subway was built using the cheaper <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> construction <b>method.</b> Line 1 opened in 1974 with through services joining surrounding Korail suburban railway lines similar to the Tokyo subway. Today, many of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway's lines are operated by Korail, South Korea's national passenger and freight railway operator. This is similar to Europe and Japan, where the national railroad often operates local mainline urban railways, such as the S-Bahns in Germany, operated by subsidiaries of Deutsche Bahn, or JR East in Japan, which operates many other urban rail systems in Japanese cities.|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{enhancement}} in modeling techniques {{as well as}} site investigation methods, uncertainty exists seriously {{in the process of}} construction of underground structure in soft soils. These uncertainties arise from limited data of geological data, measurement errors, interpolation of spatially geological properties, and extrapolation of results of experiments and natural analogue studies over times and conditions relevant to the project. Robust and optimize design of tunnel support pattern consists many important parameters including advance rate and excavation method. However, quantitative definition of these parameters is difficult because of restricting in site investigation data and uncertainties related to them. Furthermore, erroneous evaluation in these parameters can affect in incorrect projection of tunnel stability or economic loss. The work reported in this paper specifically dealt with Amirkabir highway tunnel with approximately 1. 5 Km long in each tube (i. e.,north and south tubes). It is one of the important projects excavating below one of the highest traffic region of Tehran, including the difficulty of excavating through a heterogeneous sedimentary basin mainly composed of recent alluvial. Construction has been performed by different methods i. e., Underground excavation, <b>Cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cover</b> <b>and</b> Top/Down <b>methods</b> in different sections of the project. Deformations and settlements have been monitored during and after construction in order to avoid unpredictable deformations and as a result any possible failure. Similar to other part of the project, a probabilistic hypothetical elasticity modulus (PHEM) approach has been employed to evaluate the uncertainty in lining design of a horseshoe shape NATM(New Austrian Tunneling Method) tunnel in T 4 section of the project. The hybrid model, PHEM, consisting two essential parts is used to evaluate the performance of the system. A MATLAB interface program for generating the ABAQUS-based parametric model in one hand; and a Monte Carlo algorithm (Latin Hyper Cube Sampling method) to simulate the uncertainty existed in the system on the other hand are applied to produce the probabilistic density function of surface settlement of tunnel excavation and lining phases. In comparison with the monitoring data, the numerical results show that the PHEM approach introduced has had an appropriate prediction in surface settlements, improved the classical deterministic approaches...|$|R
