The paper analyzes the advantages of producers in the supply <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> agricultural products from three aspects including land resources, technology level of producers and input costs. The disadvantages of producers in the supply <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> agricultural products are analyzed from three aspects including scale level, mechanization and technology level and profit level. The opportunities of producers in the supply <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> agricultural products are analyzed from me aspects of laws, policies, Capitals and technologies.
