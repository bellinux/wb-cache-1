40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by a progressive loss of controlled cognitive processes (processes requiring mental effort and attentional resources), and functional neuroimaging at early stages of AD provides an opportunity to tease out the neural correlates of controlled processes. <b>Controlled</b> and automatic <b>memory</b> performance was assessed with the Process Dissociation Procedure in 50 patients diagnosed with questionable Alzheimer’s disease (QAD). The patients’ brain glucose metabolism was measured using FDG-PET. After a follow-up period of 36 months, 27 patients had converted to AD, while 23 remained stable. Both groups showed a similar decrease in <b>controlled</b> <b>memory</b> processes but preserved automatic processes at entry into the study, suggesting that impairment of <b>controlled</b> <b>memory</b> would not be specific for AD. Patients who subsequently converted to Alzheimer type dementia showed significantly decreased brain metabolism at baseline compared to stable QAD in associative cortices known to be involved in AD (the left precuneus, the right inferior parietal lobule and bilateral middle temporal cortex).

40|$|It is {{controversial}} whether monkeys, like human subjects, can recall, upon instruction, specific information about {{an event in}} memory. We therefore tested macaque monkeys on a task that was originally developed to study such active <b>controlled</b> <b>memory</b> retrieval in human subjects {{and we were able}} to demonstrate that monkeys, like human subjects, can retrieve, upon command, specific components of previously encoded events. Furthermore, following earlier functional neuroimaging work with human sub-jects showing the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to be involved in such active controlled retrieval, we recorded single-neuron activity within this region of the monkey brain while the monkeys performed the active retrieval task. Neuronal responses were related to the retrieval and the decision whether the retrieved information was the instructed one. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, an impressive capacity by macaque monkeys for <b>controlled</b> <b>memory</b> retrieval and, in addition, provide neurophysio-logical evidence about the role of the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in such controlled retrieval...|$|R

50|$|A {{need for}} {{cognitive}} closure may occur while engaged in goal-driven or goal-motivated cognitive functions (e.g., attention <b>control,</b> <b>memory</b> recall, information selection and processing, cognitive inhibition, etc.).

40|$|Age-related {{cognitive}} impairments often include difficulty retrieving memories, {{particularly those that}} rely on executive control. In this paper we discuss {{the influence of the}} prefrontal cortex on memory retrieval, and the specific memory processes associated with the prefrontal cortex that decline in late adulthood. We conclude that preretrieval processes associated with preparation to make a memory judgment are impaired, leading to greater reliance on postretrieval processes. This is consistent with the view that impairments in executive control significantly contribute to deficits in controlled retrieval. Finally, we discuss age-related changes in sleep as a potential mechanism that contributes to deficiencies in executive control that are important for efficient retrieval. The sleep literature points to the importance of slow-wave sleep in restoration of prefrontal cortex function. Given that slow-wave sleep significantly declines with age, we hypothesize that age-related changes in slow-wave sleep could mediate age-related decline in executive control, manifesting a robust deficit in <b>controlled</b> <b>memory</b> retrieval processes. Interventions, like physical activity, that improve sleep could be effective methods to enhance <b>controlled</b> <b>memory</b> processes in late life...|$|R
