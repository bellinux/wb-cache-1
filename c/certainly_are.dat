5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> but true as natural history they as <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> not... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.|$|E
5|$|Court-show viewers don't {{seem to want}} moral conundrums or {{technical}} wrinkles. They love Sheindlin's show because she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like the justice system to operate—swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> no lengthy appeals.|$|E
25|$|Schellenberg says he hasn't {{seen any}} serious {{objections}} to this premise by theistic philosophers, but there <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> other conceptions of God. Daniel Howard-Snyder {{writes about the}} possibility of believing in an unsurpassably great personal god that is nevertheless dispassionate towards its creatures. Drawing on the Stoic concept of Eudaimonia, he says one can think of a god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.|$|E

25|$|All these African {{cultures}} had musical traditions, which survive erratically to {{the present}} day, not always in detail, but in general style. The best preserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the instruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations are quite well preserved. In what other American countries are the religious ceremonies conducted in the old language(s) of Africa? They <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> in Lucumí ceremonies, though of course, back in Africa the language has moved on. What unifies all genuine forms of African music is the unity of polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call-and-response) and dance in well-defined social settings, {{and the absence of}} melodic instruments of an Arabic or European kind.|$|E
500|$|Mark Ruffalo {{began his}} role as Banner / Hulk in The Avengers, after Feige said {{he chose not to}} bring back Norton. In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be {{associated}} with only one character. In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers. In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] and [...] "World War Hulk" [...] storylines, stated, [...] "everything [...] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in Avengers? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> not even going to attempt that until Avengers 2. So there's a lot of time to think about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} woods in each cab were {{arranged}} in four basic patterns, all the elevator cabs used a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that [...] "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [...] <b>certainly</b> <b>are.</b> Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences {{on the design of}} the entire building." [...] The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also [...] customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans. Curcio writes that these elevators [...] "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and {{it is fair to say}} that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them". Curcio also compares the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry.|$|E

2500|$|However, as {{described}} in Plato's Theaetetus, Protagoras's views allow that some views may result from an ill body or mind. He stressed that although all views may appear equally true, and perhaps, should be equally respected, they <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> not of equal gravity. One view may be useful and advantageous {{to the person who}} has it, while the perception of another may prove harmful. Hence, Protagoras believed that the sophist was there to teach the student how to discriminate between them, i.e., to teach [...] "virtue".|$|E
