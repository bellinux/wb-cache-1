5|$|Cave 21 is {{approached}} {{through a}} small <b>crevice</b> from cave 20, {{in the absence of}} any direct approach. Its living space has a veranda of fairly large size. There is also an inner cell with a grooved door frame. Seating benches have been cut into shallow spaces both in the cell and in the veranda.|$|E
5|$|The female usually {{attaches}} the egg {{case to a}} substrate, inserts it into a suitably protective <b>crevice,</b> or {{carries it}} about until just before the eggs hatch. Some species, however, are ovoviviparous, keeping the eggs inside their body, with or without an egg case, until they hatch. At least one genus, Diploptera, is fully viviparous.|$|E
25|$|The short-toed nests in tree <b>crevices</b> {{or behind}} bark flakes. Old {{woodpecker}} nests, <b>crevices</b> in buildings or walls, and artificial nest boxes or flaps are also used.|$|R
50|$|C. gallinae is most {{prevalent}} in birds with nests in nest-holes and <b>crevices.</b> Infestations of nests in nest-holes and <b>crevices</b> {{are also more}} intense, meaning {{that there are more}} wintering C. gallinae in those nests.|$|R

5|$|The player {{continues}} to {{journey into the}} remains of a once sprawling city {{at the base of the}} mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the <b>crevice</b> still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear before the character and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into the <b>crevice</b> as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic scene. This scene shows a shooting star emanating from the <b>crevice</b> and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} from early to mid-April in Britain and Ireland, from mid-May in {{southern}} Scandinavia, and from June in the north. The nest is always {{close to the}} shore, in a cliff <b>crevice</b> or hole, or {{under the cover of}} vegetation. It is constructed by the female from seaweed and dead grass, and lined with finer fibres or hair.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, {{but they may}} join mixed feeding flocks at other times. Their habit of wedging a large food item in a <b>crevice</b> and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E
50|$|Granite night lizards {{are often}} found on rocky slopes with large exfoliating {{boulders}} and abundant <b>crevices,</b> but are occasionally found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral without boulders. They {{are active in}} <b>crevices</b> during the day, but move on the surface at night.|$|R

5|$|This bird has glossy black plumage, a long curved red bill, red legs, and a loud, ringing call. It has a buoyant {{acrobatic flight}} with widely spread primaries. The red-billed chough pairs {{for life and}} {{displays}} fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or <b>crevice</b> in a cliff face. It builds a wool-lined stick nest and lays three eggs. It feeds, often in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey.|$|E
5|$|About forty {{days after}} mating, the female giant Pacific octopus {{attaches}} strings of small fertilised eggs (10,000 to 70,000 in total) to rocks in a <b>crevice</b> or under an overhang. Here she guards and cares for them {{for about five}} months (160 days) until they hatch. In colder waters, such as those off of Alaska, it may take as much as 10 months for the eggs to completely develop. The female aerates the eggs and keeps them clean; if left untended, many eggs will not hatch. She does not feed during this time and dies soon afterwards. Males become senescent and die {{a few weeks after}} mating.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or <b>crevice</b> for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E

500|$|Drought escape {{by growing}} in small <b>crevices</b> or near {{persistent}} water supplies, or by staying dormant for about 95% of the year. Mosses and ferns {{in the area}} grow near constant water sources such as natural potholes and seeps from ice caves. Scabland penstemon, fernleaf fleabane, and gland cinquefoil grow in shallow <b>crevices.</b> Syringa, bush rockspirea, tansybush, and even limber pine grow in large <b>crevices.</b> While dwarf monkeyflowers (...) carry out their entire life cycle during the short wet {{part of the year}} and survive in seed form the rest of the time.|$|R
5|$|An ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no {{pleasant}} {{assemblage of}} shelves, and pools, and creeks, about which a child might {{play for a}} whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and alive in every <b>crevice</b> with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No other life was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself.|$|E
5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered <b>crevice.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 plaster ceiling supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster pieces in the ceiling. Contractors had to install scaffolding tall enough to reach the highest interior <b>crevice</b> in the ceiling eight stories up—the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of the repair work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E
5000|$|The {{range of}} the long-eared myotis {{includes}} several different environments. It {{has been known to}} occur in semiarid shrublands, shortgrass prairie, and subalpine forests, with habitats ranging from sea level to 2,830 meters. [...] They roost in a variety of places, including tree cavities, rock <b>crevices,</b> caves, and even abandoned buildings. They seem to prefer rock <b>crevices,</b> while individuals {{in the northern part of}} the range favor ponderosa and lodgepole pines. Reproducing females generally roost in small, 2-centimeter wide <b>crevices.</b> Most <b>crevices</b> used by the long-eared myotis are vertically oriented and contain an overhang over the opening. The bats occasionally switch roosts, an event that involves the colony as a whole. Roosting sites commonly contain a lot of rock cover, are far from bodies of water, and have little cover from trees and grass.|$|R
50|$|In Cañacao, Cavite and a {{few other}} places <b>crevices</b> were opened, and from them fine sand and dirty water were ejected. In one of these <b>crevices</b> that opened in Nueva Ecija, the crack was so wide and deep it was {{reported}} that an old man and a boy disappeared in it.|$|R

5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a <b>crevice,</b> burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} thrips create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} {{to the expansion}} of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most of these species occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species seems to have taken place on Acacia trees in Australia; some of these species cause galls in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available <b>crevice</b> in the bark. In Casuarina in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.|$|E
5|$|The pied butcherbird often perches on a fencepost, stump or branch while {{foraging}} for prey. It generally pounces on victims on {{the ground}} and eats them there. At times, it may hop or run along hunting ground-based food, and occasionally seize flying insects. It generally forages alone, or occasionally in pairs. The pied butcherbird has been observed hunting collaboratively with the Australian hobby, either picking off common starlings or rufous-throated honeyeaters disturbed by the larger hobby, or flushing out small birds from bushes, which the larger bird then hunts. The pied butcherbird sometimes stores food items by impaling them on a stick or on barbed wire, or shoving them in a nook or <b>crevice.</b>|$|E
50|$|It can {{be found}} in rock <b>crevices,</b> and under stones.|$|R
50|$|All the {{subspecies}} of Xenosaurus grandis live {{exclusively in}} rock <b>crevices,</b> which {{allows them to}} live in many habitats, including: xerophytic vegetation, tropical rainforests, cloud forests, oak forests, and tropical deciduous rainforests. The lizards have strong attachments to where they live, only living in 1-2 rock <b>crevices</b> for 95% of their entire lives.|$|R
50|$|A {{period in}} the annual cycle of Aneides aeneus called the pre-hibernation {{aggregation}} takes place in which A. aeneus will disperse from the breeding <b>crevices.</b> It is during this period, throughout the month of November, that most specimens of A. aeneus can be observed wandering over and between rock <b>crevices.</b> Following this dispersal, {{it is thought that}} A. aeneus ventures deep within the interconnected <b>crevices</b> of the cliffs and rock outcroppings to hibernate. Attempts were made to find A. aeneusunderground, beneath logs, within rotten logs, under rocks and under tree bark, but not a single specimen was produced.|$|R
5|$|This bird has glossy black plumage, {{a yellow}} beak, red legs, and {{distinctive}} calls. It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread flight feathers. The Alpine chough pairs {{for life and}} displays fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or <b>crevice</b> in a cliff face. It builds a lined stick nest and lays three to five brown-blotched whitish eggs. It feeds, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey in summer and fruit in winter; it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food.|$|E
5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a <b>crevice</b> or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock <b>crevice</b> where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.|$|E
