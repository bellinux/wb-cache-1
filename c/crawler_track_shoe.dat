Nagatani et al. developed Quince [1], which is equipped with four flipper arms and <b>crawler</b> <b>tracks</b> covering the body.

50|$|Track {{construction}} and assembly is {{dictated by the}} application. Military vehicles use a <b>track</b> <b>shoe</b> that is integral {{to the structure of}} the chain in order to reduce track weight. Reduced weight allows the vehicle to move faster and decreases overall vehicle weight to ease transportation. Since track weight is completely unsprung, reducing it improves suspension performance at speeds where the track's momentum is significant. In contrast, agricultural and construction vehicles opt for a <b>track</b> with <b>shoes</b> that attach to the chain with bolts and do not form part of the chain's structure. This allows <b>track</b> <b>shoes</b> to break without compromising the ability of the vehicle to move and decrease productivity but increases the overall weight of the track and vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The machine {{concept was}} a {{standard}} base to each model on which optional front-end equipment could be mounted with appropriate counterbalances, <b>crawler</b> <b>track</b> frames and minimal additional machinery. The most common variants included face shovel, dragline, lifting crane and grabbing crane. Less common variants included drag shovel, skimmer and pile driver. Some cranes were also lorry-mounted. All machines had 360 degree rotation on a conical section roller path.|$|R
40|$|Mobile robots having good terrain adaptability, {{sufficient}} payload capability, {{and high}} mobility are now urgently in de-mand. In this paper, {{design of a}} practical mobile robot is attempted, with an inspection task in a nuclear reactor as a concrete objective for development. The configuration of the mobile robot is first discussed. A wheel with <b>crawler</b> <b>track,</b> legs, and a snake-like articulated body are shown to be three fundamental configurations. A hybrid configuration consist-ing of an articulated body and a <b>crawler</b> <b>track</b> is most ade-quate for the nuclear reactor robot because of its excellent terrain adaptability, sufficient payload capability, and high mobility. Design of the joint structure of the articulated body is discussed. Basic control problems such as signal process-ing for tactile sensors and control of statically indeterminant forces are also investigated. A mechanical model KR I, a robot with six articulated body segments, 16 degrees of free-dom, length 1391 mm, and weight 27. 8 kg, is constructed and several experiments are done to demonstrate the basic mobility of the robot and to show the validity of introducing force control. 1...|$|R

50|$|A sulky is a {{lightweight}} cart having two wheels and a seat {{for the driver}} only but usually without a body, generally pulled by horses or dogs, and is used for harness races.

5000|$|Track spikes, or just spikes, are pointed {{protrusions}} {{usually made}} of metal, ceramic or plastic that are screwed {{into the bottom}} of most <b>track</b> and field <b>shoes</b> to increase traction and minimize the likelihood of slipping. The term [...] "spikes" [...] can also refer to <b>track</b> <b>shoes</b> featuring such protrusions. Spikes are similar to studs which are used for team sports, although generally smaller and with a sharp point.|$|R
50|$|Grousers are {{commonly}} used on construction vehicles such as bulldozers, loaders, and excavators. Grousers may be permanently attached to, or formed as a single piece with, the <b>track</b> <b>shoe,</b> {{or they may be}} bolted onto the <b>track</b> <b>shoe</b> for ease of replacement as they become worn. While grousers are usually straight, they may have more complex shapes, including spikes and involute curves, {{depending on the type of}} terrain and the performance requirements of the vehicle. Grousers are typically made of metal, such as forged steel, and are not designed for use on paved roads. Various devices, with names such as road bands, have been developed to temporarily cover grousers/cleats in order to allow a vehicle to drive on paved roads.|$|R

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{development}} and demonstration of a collision control technology for P&H-class mining shovels that minimizes the frequency and severity of dipper collisions between the bucket, <b>crawler</b> <b>tracks</b> and floor. The work was funded by ACARP as project C 15038. The collision control technology uses a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework whereby control actions for preventing collisions, are chosen based on the predicted future behaviour of the shovel. The system predicts future locations of the dipper over a receding time horizon using a set of mathematical models that are driven by the operator’s joystick commands. The prediction models incorporate the shovel’s electro-mechanical dynamics for hoist, crowd and swing motions. Predicted future bucket positions are tested for collisions using computational geometry algorithms on VRML models of the bucket, <b>crawler</b> <b>tracks</b> and floor. If a collision is predicted, the collision prevention algorithms calculate the minimum change to the operator’s command that will avoid the collision by a specified clearance distance. The altered joystick references are then passed to the P&H Centurion control system over the shovel’s PROFIBUS control bus. The technology has been successfully demonstrated on the CRCMining P&H 2100 BLE research shovel at Bracalba Quarry in Queensland and on a P&H 4100 A at Caballo Mine in Wyoming USA. The technology is currently being commercialized by P&H Mining Equipment...|$|R

5000|$|A {{conveyor}} bridge consists of girders resting on {{two or three}} supports mounted on rails, or sometimes on <b>crawler</b> <b>tracks.</b> The bridge is set across the pit and moves along the mining face at a few metres per minute. If it runs on rails, the tracks are shifted {{in accordance with the}} progress of the mining. The rock is moved from the excavator to the bridge by connecting conveyors. The dumping support of a {{conveyor bridge}} may rest on the soil of the seam or on a dumping mound specially poured and packed by the bridge itself, depending on the stability of the rock.|$|R
5000|$|Snow Tracs {{were also}} called Sand Tracs and saw {{use in the}} Sahara Desert as over-sand {{transport}} vehicles. The <b>crawler</b> <b>track</b> design was well suited for either sand or snow use but was not generally suitable for rocky all-terrain use. The track required loose ground to properly function so {{it was able to}} work equally well on gravel, sand, snow, or other loose material like tall grass. Because of their ability to be used in many conditions and climates, the Snow Trac was used world wide and still is in use today by emergency organizations and some commercial enterprises, although large utilities no longer use Snow Tracs.|$|R
50|$|Early graders {{were drawn}} by people and draft animals. The era of {{motorization}} by traction engines, steam tractors, motor trucks, and tractors saw such towed graders grow {{in size and}} productivity. The first self-propelled grader was made in 1920 by the Russell Grader Manufacturing Company, which called it the Russell Motor Hi-Way Patrol. These early graders were created by adding the grader blade as an attachment to a generalist tractor unit. After purchasing the company in 1928, Caterpillar went on to truly integrate the tractor and grader into one design—at the same time replacing <b>crawler</b> <b>tracks</b> with wheels to yield the first rubber-tire self-propelled grader, the Caterpillar Auto Patrol, released in 1931.|$|R
