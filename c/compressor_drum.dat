50|$|The Trent 900 {{family of}} engines {{had their first}} set of {{upgrades}} marketed as the Trent 900EP; these were available for delivery from 2012. This package delivered a 1% saving on fuel burn compared to non EP engines. While one source states that this package is not available as a retro fit to previously delivered engines, Rolls Royce told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the upgrades were intended in most cases for both new engines and as retrofits. This upgrade is based on advancements made during {{the development of the}} Trent XWB (for the Airbus A350 XWB) and matches improvements made for the Trent 700 called the Trent 700EP. Block 1 includes elliptical leading edges in the compressor, smaller low-pressure turbine tip clearances, and new coating for the high-pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>drum,</b> as well as an upgrade to the engine control (FADEC) software.|$|E
40|$|A hybrid large eddy {{simulation}} (LES) related {{technique is}} used to explore some key turbomachinery relevant flows. Near wall Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeling {{is used to}} cover over especially small scales, the LES resolution of which is generally intractable with current computational power. Away from walls, large eddy type simulation is used but with no LES model (numerical LES (NLES)). Linking of the two model zones through a Hamilton–Jacobi equation is explored. The hybrid strategy is used to predict turbine and compressor end wall flows, flow around a fan blade section, jet flows, and a cutback trailing edge. Also, application of NLES to the flow in an idealized high pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>drum</b> cavity is considered. Generally, encouraging results are found. However, challenges remain, especially for flows where transition modeling is important...|$|E

25|$|The Olympus 593 was a 2-shaft {{turbojet}} with reheat. The LP and HP compressors {{both had}} 7 stages and were each {{driven by a}} single-stage turbine. Due to the high inlet air temperatures at Mach 2 cruise - in excess of 120 degrees C - the <b>compressor</b> <b>drums</b> and blades were made from titanium except for the last 4 HP stages which were Nimonic 90 nickel alloy. Nickel alloys were normally only required in the hotter turbine areas but the high temperatures {{that occur in the}} last stages of the compressor at supersonic flight speeds dictated its use in the compressor also. Both the HP and LP turbine rotor blades were cooled.|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of <b>compressor</b> <b>drum</b> cavity heat transfer {{is an important}} factor in the overall design of an aero engine. The rotationally dominated flow field within the cavity governs the heat transfer conditions by suppressing the motion of the fluid. Without heating, the fluid in the outer region of the cavity can approach solid body rotation. The outer cavity fluid is disturbed by the bore flow at the inner radius. The resultant bore flow vortex has been shown to exhibit many different modes of behaviour, dependent on the Rossby number. At higher Rossby number the bore flow vortex has been shown to break down into a precessing radial arm. It has also been shown that the hot drive arm (shroud) between the compressor stages destabilises the flow field through natural convection. This paper presents data from the Sussex Multiple Cavity Rig, which matches the fluid dynamic conditions of a compressor bore in terms of axial throughflow, rotational Reynolds number and Grashof number. It features titanium alloy discs, which are instrumented with surface thermocouples. This paper presents data which helps to separate the effects of throughflow Reynolds number, rotational Reynolds number and Grashof number on the dimensionless disc temperature profiles. In order to illustrate the flow structures this paper presents a hybrid RANS/LES model for the two highest Reynolds number cases. For these cases, the numerical simulations show a change from stable to unstable stratification with an increase in the bore to shroud temperature ratio in good qualitative agreement with the measured data...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we have {{developed}} a Subtructured Finite Element / eXtended Finite Element (S-FE/XFE) method. The S-FE/XFE method consists in decomposing the geometry into safe FE-domains and cracked XFE-domains, and solving the interface problem with the Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting method (FETI). This method allows for handling complex crack configurations in 3 D structures with common commercial FE software that do not feature the XFEM. The method is also extended to a mixed dimensional formulation, where the FE-domain is discretised with shell elements while the XFE-domain is modelled with three-dimensional solid elements. This is the so-called S-FE Shell/XFE 3 D method. The mixed dimensional formulation is more convenient than a full XFE- 3 D formulation because it significantly reduces the computational cost and it is more accurate compared to a full shell model because it includes three-dimensional local features such as three-dimensional crack. The compatibility of the displacements through the interface is ensured using the Reissner-Mindlin equation. The method has been extensively validated towards both academic problems and semi-industrial benchmarks in order to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. Among them, the S-FE/XFE method is applied to a crack analysis in a section of a <b>compressor</b> <b>drum</b> of a turbofan engine. The results obtained with the S-FE/XFE method are compared with those obtained with a standard FE computation. Furthermore, two applications of the S-FE shell/XFE 3 D approach are proposed. First the load carrying capacity of a section of stiffened panel containing a through-the-thickness crack is investigated (this is the one-bay crack configuration). Second, {{the ability of the}} method for handling small surface cracks in large finite element models is addressed by looking at a generic 'large pressure panel' presenting realistic crack configurations.

40|$|The {{second stage}} <b>compressor</b> rotor <b>drum</b> in {{question}} has failed by fatigue. Fatigue cracks {{were found to}} have initiated at the rivet holes. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the fatigue crack initiation and fatigue appeared to be stress related. The most probable reason for fatigue crack initiation appears to be improper rivet contact with the rivet hole on the drum. This has resulted in excessive deformation in localized regions leading to stress concentrations and fatigue cracks initiation. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|R

40|$|A new {{open source}} Modelica library called “ThermoSysPro” has been {{developed}} {{within the framework of}} the ITEA 2 EUROSYSLIB project. This library has been mainly designed for the static and dynamic modeling of power plants, but can also be used for other energy systems such as industrial processes, buildings, etc. To that end, the library contains over 100 0 D/ 1 D model components such as heat exchangers, steam and gas turbines, <b>compressors,</b> pumps, <b>drums,</b> tanks, volumes, valves, pipes, furnaces, combustion chambers, etc. In particular, one and two-phase water/steam flow, as well as flue gases flow are handled. The library has been validated against several testcases belonging to all the main domains of power plant modeling, namely the nuclear, thermal, biomass and solar domains. The paper describes first the structure library. Then the test-case belonging to the thermal domain is presented. It is the dynamic model of a combined cycle power plant, whose objective is to study a step variation load from 100 % to 50 % and a full gas turbine trip.

40|$|AbstractSeveral dynamic {{models of}} {{concentrated}} solar power plants were developed. The component models used belong to the ThermoSysPro (Modelica-based) library developed by EDF and released under open source license. The main objective of ThermoSysPro {{is to provide a}} generic library for the modeling and simulation of power plants and other kinds of energy systems. The meaning of the word ‘generic’ is here to be understood as the possibility to use the same components to model different kinds of energy systems (thermal, nuclear, solar, etc.) for different types of studies (design, control system verification, etc.). To that end, the library contains over 200 0 D/ 1 D models of components such as heat exchangers, steam and gas turbines, <b>compressors,</b> pumps, <b>drums,</b> tanks, volumes, valves, pipes, furnaces, combustion chambers, linear parabolic trough solar collector, linear Fresnel reflector, solar field and heliostat, etc. In particular, one and two-phase water/steam flow, one phase oil flow, as well as flue gases flow are handled. The library has been validated against several test-cases belonging to all the main domains of power plant modeling, namely the nuclear, thermal, biomass and solar domains. The paper describes the structure of the library. Then the test-cases belonging to the solar domain (both solar and power cycle performance are modelled) are presented: a dynamic model of a Linear Parabolic Trough Solar power plant and a model of a Solar Hybrid Combined-Cycle Power Plant with a Linear Fresnel Field. Several transients are simulated, the objective being to reduce the uncertainty of the prediction on the yearly electricity production (simulation with yearly DNI) ...|$|R
40|$|When a {{gas turbine}} engine is shut down it will develop a {{circumferential}} thermal gradient vertically across the compressor due to hot air rising from the cooling metal components and pooling at the top. As the hot <b>compressor</b> rotor <b>drum</b> cools and contracts {{in the presence of}} this thermal gradient, it does so non-uniformly, and therefore will bend slightly, in a phenomenon known as rotor bow. Starting an engine under bowed conditions can result in damage, representing a risk to both airworthiness and operational capability. This research has developed a numerical approach involving 3 D unsteady conjugate heat transfer computational fluid dynamics one-way coupled to finite element analysis using simplified analogue models to conduct a parametric study into rotor thermal bow. The research has also developed a technique for studying rotor thermal bow experimentally, which also serves to partially validate the numerical approach. Through the conduct of a Plackett-Burman screening test, this research has found that of all the geometric, environmental, and operational parameters which define the simplified gas turbine models, diameter, length, and case wall thickness were the most influential, with diameter and length being significantly more influential than any other parameters. Further detailed analysis of these top three parameters was conducted using the same numerical technique applied to a quasi-random Sobol' sequence, allowing the design space to be interpolated using kriging. These detailed results confirmed that the rotor thermal bow phenomenon is largely dominated by bending member stiffness; however, the effect of diameter is non-linear, as increasing diameter will increase stiffness, but also increase the vertical temperature difference - two competing effects. This research has also investigated and discussed the operational impacts of rotor thermal bow, and outlined existing and possible mitigation strategies in addition to those fundamental design considerations which flow from the parametric study...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of a gas turbine engine it is {{important}} to have a good prediction ofthe temperature distribution for components ofthe engine. This research work looks at the method ofpredicting air and metal temperatures of the lIP <b>compressor</b> disc <b>drum.</b> It is a common practice to supply cooling air for the turbine disc and blades by passing the air axially between the bores of adjacent discs in the lIP compressor. Some ofthe central axial throughflow is known to enter the compressor interdisc cavities and a parasitic temperature rise occurs in the throughflow air as a result ofthe convective heat transfer. It is important that the heat transfer mechanism within a compressor interdisc cavity is understood, as the engine designer needs to know the temperature ofthe cooling air and the disc temperatures in order to predict the stress and the life of the compressor, and also to predict the seal and blade tip running clearances. In this thesis, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to study the flow and heat mechanism experienced by a gas turbine lIP compressor rotor. A review ofprevious research work and knowledge in the field of rotational buoyancy-driven flow has shown that the flow within the compressor inter-disc cavities is highly three-dimensional and time dependent in nature. Two approaches in the numerical modelling ofthe flow can be considered; one is to use CFD as a tool to model a single inter-disc cavity with axial throughflow in full three dimensions with unsteady flow. Using this approach requires a huge amount ofcomputational memory and time to run the CFD models. A second approach is to break down this complex flow process into separate physical mechanisms and introduce approximate but computationally efficient models for these processes. The second approach has been taken in this thesis, with the aim ofproducing a method that can be incorporated into current design practice. Two underlying flow mechanisms may be identified for this complex flow; the first associated with the flow within the inter-disc cavities and the second associated with the axial throughflow under the compressor disc bores.

40|$|The Tennessee Eastman (TE) Control Challenge {{proposed}} by Downs and Vogel [1] {{is a test}} bed problem for use in evaluating advanced process control methodologies from a plant-wide perspective. The dynamic model for the process (based on an actual industrial process) integrates the operation of five unit operations; viz. an exothermic, two-phase reactor, a partial condenser, a centrifugal <b>compressor,</b> a flash <b>drum</b> and a reboiled stripper. The process incorporates 41 process variables and 12 manipulated variables. Several researchers have considered various controller designs for the process, which include multi-loop SingleInput -Single-Output (SISO) control strategies, Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC) and linear/nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC). These approaches entail a significant degree of design effort in that {{the selection of the}} optimal (economic) set points and the selection of the optimal pairing of process and manipulated variables, are non-trivial tasks. Furthermore, linear controller designs may not be optimal in dealing with the non-linear behaviour inherent in the process dynamics. The success of biological organisms in controlling complex and uncertain environments may serve as significant motivation for a more biological (as opposed to algorithmic) approach to developing control strategies. Evolutionary reinforcement learning provides a framework for the development of control policies from direct cause-effect interactions with a simulated dynamic environment. In this paper the use of a novel evolutionary reinforcement learning algorithm, SANE (Symbiotic, Adaptive Neuro-Evolution), is demonstrated for the development of neural network controllers. The SANE algorithm performs the global search for an optimal plant-wide control strategy. The SANE algorithm [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of this field is to investigate various optimum field production strategies of the whole production system (from reservoir to separator) of Narsingdi Gas Field, Bangladesh using The Integrated Production Modeling, IPM suite (GAP, PROSPER, MBAL) software package by applying the trademarked methodology of Nodal Analysis. Recommending the best optimum production strategy on the context of recent gas crisis in the Bangladesh is {{the ultimate goal of}} this investigation. Individual modeling (Pressure and Temperature) of the wells in PROSPER by Nodal Analysis is a prime requirement of this work. Another important pre-requisites are to estimate the reserve of the field by Material Balance Method in MBAL, quality check with the recent volumetric reserve estimate, proper aquifer modeling and determine missing reservoir/aquifer parameters of the field. Based on this reserve estimation, various production forecasting and reservoir performance for existing and optimum conditions had been investigated after the whole production system of reservoir, wells, pipelines, chokes and separators in the GAP model. The reserve of the lower gas sand of this field is estimated to be 273. 838 BCF which fairly agrees with the recent volumetric estimate of 284 BCF. During the prediction run for various existing and optimum production strategies, it had been found that acceleration of production for existing conditions does not improve the gas recovery in a great deal, but when the wellhead backpressure is reduced by installing surface <b>compressors</b> and knockout <b>drum,</b> it definitely improves the gas recovery factor by 23 %. Finally, an optimum production strategy is recommended along with future installation of surface compressor and upgrading of gas processing capacity. </p...|$|R
