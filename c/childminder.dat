5|$|On 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié {{to a local}} GP surgery. The {{practice}} nurse {{there did}} not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems. By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered <b>childminder,</b> who Kouao met at {{her job at the}} hospital. There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao said that they were caused by razor blades that Climbié played with. Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted a scar on Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response to what she had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.|$|E

Minutes later, Fred entered the premises and asked Rose to accompany him on a date that evening; an offer she accepted. Shortly thereafter, Rose began a relationship with Fred, becoming a frequent visitor at the Lake House Caravan Park, and a willing <b>childminder</b> to Charmaine and Anna Marie, whom she noted were neglected and whom she initially treated with care and affection.

2500|$|Phil and Kathy {{sort out}} their {{differences}} {{and get married}} in secret in early 1995. Kathy keeps fainting and refuses to see Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton), she relents and is told she is pregnant. Phil is overjoyed about becoming a father, as is Phil's mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Kathy goes into labour with Pat helping her and Phil meets their son shortly after he is born. Kathy is opposed to Peggy's name suggestion of Eric and names him Ben. Kathy's niece, Sarah Hills (Daniela Denby-Ashe), and Sarah's boyfriend, Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney), look after Ben when he becomes ill and at hospital, he is diagnosed with meningitis. Phil's brother, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), reveals that Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), the husband of Ben's <b>childminder</b> Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson) and Kathy's nephew, has AIDS. Despite Kathy panicking that the AIDS caused the meningitis, she is reassured the conditions are not linked. Kathy and Phil are told that Ben has been left partially deaf in one ear. Kathy is devoted to Ben; feeling neglected, Phil turns to alcohol. By {{the end of the}} year his drinking has developed into alcoholism and he becomes violent toward Kathy. After he snatches Ben and leaves him near a fire while he passes out drunk, Kathy leaves him. Realising what he has lost, Phil tries to stop drinking and rebuild his marriage. Kathy takes him back but when Phil attends counselling, he begins an affair with a fellow alcoholic, Lorna Cartwright (Janet Dibley), who starts stalking him and makes herself known to Kathy. Phil takes Kathy to Paris, hoping that it will bring them closer. However, Phil confesses to his affair with Lorna and Kathy responds by throwing her wedding ring into the Seine, stating their marriage is [...] "the biggest mistake" [...] of her life. Phil begins sleeping rough and blames Kathy for his decline. Despite momentarily contemplating suicide, Kathy hardens herself towards her husband's abuse.|$|E

5000|$|In 1974, Sonia Jackson, Brian's wife, {{had been}} {{involved}} in the producation of the first Action Register on Childminding, part of the National Research Project on Childminding, commissioned by the Social Science Research Council and run by Brian. It showed that although registered <b>childminders</b> cared for more children than all local authority, private or factory day nurseries put together, and had more influence at this important stage of the child's growth than a working parent, only 1% of <b>childminders</b> were receiving any services or support at all. The survey also discovered large numbers of unregistered <b>childminders.</b> In 1974 responsibility for registering <b>childminders</b> was moved from health departments to the new Social Services departments. Based on findings from Brian's research - basically that <b>childminders</b> wanted the tools for the job, plus advice and support - regular groups were set up in the ground floor nursery at Longroyd Bridge. Transport for the women and children was provided by the NCC's minibus - it being rare for a woman to have her own car at that time, and public transport being difficult with more than one child. On offer were a toy and book library, loans of safety equipment, a bulk buying scheme, toy repair service and access to training. Local <b>childminders,</b> including Sheila Wenzel, who later became the chair of the Kirklees Childminders' Association, worked together with the NCC to improve services and conditions for <b>childminders.</b> Always aware of the power of television, Brian proposed to the BBC that [...] "a television series with appropriate back-up would be one way of improving the quality of care offered to the young children of working mothers.” (NCC Quinquennial Report 1980) Other People's Children a 19 part series, was screened three times a week, first shown in 1977 and repeated in 1978. 700 viewing groups were set up around the country, and not confined to <b>childminders</b> or pre-school workers. The BBC published a supporting handbook, which was subsidised by the Health Education Council and distributed free by Social Services Departments to all registered <b>childminders</b> throughout the country. The NCC was closely involved in production of both the series and the handbook.In the final programme, the idea that the viewing groups or local <b>childminders</b> might get together to form a National Childminding Association led to the inauguration of this association in Birmingham Town Hall, later in 1977.|$|R
40|$|In the {{changing}} political context of early learning and childcare in Scotland {{it is important}} to gather knowledge {{in order to understand the}} work of <b>childminders</b> and to make it more visible. The small scale scoping study presented here seeks to explore the role played, in Scotland, by <b>childminders</b> as they welcome and care for young children. In Scotland there are currently 6, 102 people registered as <b>childminders</b> to provide day care in their own homes: they provide for 34, 600 children (Care Inspectorate, 2015). Many of these <b>childminders</b> (about 80 %) are members of the Scottish Childminding Association (SCMA). Their work is equivalent to that of day-carers and home-based carers in other countries. Typically, the children who benefit from their services have working parents who often choose this form of home-based care as the next-best choice to having their children at home...|$|R
40|$|Childminding is an old-established yet under-researched form of {{childcare}} in England. Until the Nurseries and <b>Childminders</b> Regulation Act 1948 it {{was also}} largely unregulated. In the last decade <b>childminders</b> have experienced changes in legislation and policy which have aligned 7 them with those working {{in the rest of}} the childcare sector. As a consequence of these changes I believed that the role of the child minder has also changed. The aim of this study is to explore how <b>childminders</b> perceive their role. A survey methodology was chosen to elicit their views using questionnaires distributed to all 434 <b>childminders</b> working in one Local Authority in the North of England. In addition 2 <b>childminders</b> were interviewed, providing in-depth information to accompany the data from the 201 questionnaire returns. The study found the majority of <b>childminders</b> happy in their role, stating that the most satisfying aspect of their job was working with children and nurturing their development. In contrast, the most dissatisfying aspect of their job was reported to be the amount of paperwork they believed they had to complete. Nonetheless, contemporaneous with the increased amount of paperwork there was a perception of raised status amongst <b>childminders.</b> This may also be attributed to the recent move to professionalise the role of all childcare providers via the raising of formal qualification levels through funded training, and the formalising of professional standards and conditions. It is hoped that this study into a group of individuals, undertaking a common role, will reinforce the importance of continued training opportunities and influence the training strategy for the child minding workforce within my Local Authority. ...|$|R

50|$|In England, {{childcare}} is inspected {{and regulated}} by OFSTED (previously this was administered by Local Authority Social Services). Care {{for children under}} five is split into Childcare on Domestic Premises which is Childminding and Daycare. In the UK being a ‘Childminder’ is a protected title and can only be used by registered professionals. Registered <b>Childminders</b> are trained, insured and qualified in Pediatric First Aid. They comply/administer/work with The Early Years Foundation Stage EYFS and have the same responsibilities for education as nurseries and reception classes. They generally work from their own homes and are always self-employed setting their own terms and conditions. The basic numbers of children that <b>childminders</b> can care for is 6 children under 8 years of age; of these children, 3 may be under 5 and of these 1 may be under 1. These numbers include the <b>childminders</b> own children (although the <b>childminder’s</b> children will not {{be included in the}} childminding ‘Certificate’). Some <b>childminders</b> work with either childminding assistants or with co-childminders, which often increases the number of children that can be cared for and individual <b>childminders</b> can request a ‘variation’ which may increase the children that they care for particularly for ‘continuity of care’ or for twins. There is a professional body - the Professional Association for Childcare & Early Years (formerly the National Childminding Association), which “Promotes and supports quality child-minding expertise” and provides information for <b>Childminders</b> and parents. London has greater pressures on childcare provision than other English regions. A recent study by London’s Poverty Profile found the level of childcare provision in London is lower than the England average. In London, there are 4.4 children aged under 8 per childcare place, compared to the England average of 3.9.|$|R
