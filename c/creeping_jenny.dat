50|$|Lysimachia nummularia (syn. Lysimachia zawadzkii Wiesner) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Primulaceae. Its common names include <b>creeping</b> <b>jenny,</b> moneywort, herb twopence and twopenny thot.|$|E
50|$|The {{cultivar}} 'Aurea' (golden <b>creeping</b> <b>Jenny)</b> has yellow leaves, and {{is somewhat}} less aggressive than the species. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} three lakes in former gravel pits, {{and it also}} has areas of {{grassland}} and scrub. There are diverse bird species, and flora such as rageed-robin, brooklime, common spotted orchid and <b>creeping</b> <b>jenny.</b> Dragonflies include the brown hawker and black-tailed skimmer.|$|E
5000|$|Diphasiastrum complanatum, {{common names}} groundcedar, <b>creeping</b> <b>jenny,</b> or {{northern}} running-pine, is {{a species of}} clubmoss native to dry coniferous forests in colder northerly parts of the world. Under the original name Lycopodium complanatum, this was an inclusive superspecies that included {{a number of other}} species now known to be biologically separate.|$|E
5000|$|She {{spent much}} of {{the early part of the}} last century {{crossing}} Europe in <b>Creeping</b> <b>Jenny,</b> a caravan drawn by white oxen, and is credited with being the first person to install a bath in a mobile home. She is the subject of the second half of the book [...] "Happy Memories" [...] (Faith Press, 1960), by her sister, Constance Toulmin.|$|E
50|$|The Lily Glen or Kingen Cleugh Glen {{contains}} a small rivulet that runs {{down to the}} River Ayr. The lilies usually refer to daffodils in Scots, however lily {{can also be a}} general term for wild garlic or bluebells. The glen is rich in old woodland indicator plants such as woodruff, wood sorrel, bluebell, woodrush, cow wheat, enchanter's nightshade, <b>creeping</b> <b>jenny,</b> wood millet, dog's mercury, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{main feature}} of the marsh is club-rush which forms dense stands {{together}} with bulrush, great willowherb and common reed. The alder and birch wood on the drier areas has a good ground flora which is dominated by grasses, Remote-sedge and horsetails. The species reported include common spotted-orchid, marsh pennywort, common valerian, skullcap and <b>creeping</b> <b>jenny.</b> Wood horsetail is abundant in a damp area.|$|E
50|$|Glechoma hederacea (syn. Nepeta glechoma Benth., Nepeta hederacea (L.) Trevir.) is an aromatic, perennial, {{evergreen}} creeper of {{the mint}} family Lamiaceae. It is {{commonly known as}} ground-ivy, gill-over-the-ground, creeping charlie, alehoof, tunhoof, catsfoot, field balm, and run-away-robin. It is also sometimes known as <b>creeping</b> <b>jenny,</b> but that name more commonly refers to Lysimachia nummularia. It has numerous medicinal uses, and is used as a salad green in many countries. European settlers carried it around the world, and it has become a well-established introduced and naturalized plant {{in a wide variety of}} localities.|$|E
30|$|While fire {{experiments}} were sparse, management guidelines and fact sheets on invasive plants were plentiful. These typically lacked bibliographies or in-text citations or both, {{making it impossible}} for review authors to verify the information, determine its basis, or assess its scope of inference. In some cases, publications offered fire management recommendations for species for which we found no observation-based information on fire. For example, two sources noted that <b>creeping</b> <b>jenny</b> (Lysimachia nummularia) may be controlled by frequent prescribed fire (Kennay and Fell 1992, Czarapata 2005), yet no observation-based fire information was available for this species (Table 4). Managers could find this information more useful and apply it appropriately if the sources explained the basis for their recommendations, such as the plant communities observed and the fire frequencies used in treatment. In other cases, experience-based or unverifiable information was inconsistent with observation-based information. For example, information from management guides and fact sheets on leafy spurge suggests controlling this species with prescribed fire in conjunction with herbicide treatments (Lym and Zollinger 1995, Solecki 1997, Biesboer and Eckardt 2004). However, two studies with observation-based, quantitative information found that combining prescribed fire and herbicide treatments did not improve leafy spurge control compared to herbicide treatments alone (Wolters et al. 1994, Prosser et al. 1999).|$|E
