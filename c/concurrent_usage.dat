Any single radio interface that is dynamically switched to a wireless channel in different frequency bands to communicate with different nodes. This however incurs frequent channel switching overhead of the order of 100 s of microseconds which is comparable to packet transmission times. A more practical method for <b>concurrent</b> channel <b>usage</b> is to use multiple radio interfaces. A multi-channel wireless mesh network architecture (called Hyacinth) that equips each mesh network node with multiple 802. 11 NICs. We address the problem of interference aware routing in multi-radio infrastructure mesh networks where in each mesh node is equipped with multiple radio interfaces and a subset of nodes serve as Internet gateways. In proposed Virtual Refined Wi-Fi Additional interfaces can support parallelism in network flows, improve handoff times, and provide sideband communication with nearby peers. Completely, such benefits are outweighed by the added costs of an additional physical interface. Instead, virtual interfaces have been proposed as the solution, multiplexing a single physical interface across more than one communication endpoin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes an {{approach}} to performance analysis of a software architecture during <b>concurrent</b> <b>usage</b> scenarios and illustrates {{the use of the}} approach in practice with an industrial real-world case study. The approach combines three well-known concepts in the performance community, namely performance assessment of software architectures (PASA), layered queuing network (LQN), and rate monotonic analysis (RMA). PASA is an architecture analysis method that has evolved from software performance engineering (SPE). LQN is a performance modeling method and a notation that is an extension to queuing network modeling (QNM). Furthermore, RMA is a group of rules for analysis of the schedulability of a system. The goal is to provide software developers a systematic way in the early software system development phase to analyze the performance of <b>concurrent</b> <b>usage</b> scenarios. We have tried to approach the problem from the viewpoint of a developer that is not an expert in any particular performance modeling method so that the step to using more systematic methods would be as easy as possible...|$|E

This clinical trial was carried out to assess the safety and explore the potential efficacy of this approach in humans. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, dose‐escalation, phase I clinical trial of NP 2, a replication‐defective HSV‐based vector expressing human preproenkephalin (PENK) in subjects with intractable focal pain caused by cancer. NP 2 was injected intradermally into the dermatome(s) corresponding to the radicular distribution of pain. The primary outcome was safety. As secondary measures, efficacy of pain relief was assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS), the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF‐MPQ), and <b>concurrent</b> opiate <b>usage.</b> Results: Ten subjects with moderate to severe intractable pain despite treatment with > 200 mg/day of morphine (or equivalent) were enrolled into the study. Treatment was well tolerated with no study agent‐related serious adverse events observed {{at any point in}} the study. Subjects receiving the low dose of NP 2 reported no substantive change in pain. Subjects in the middle‐ and high‐dose cohorts reported pain relief as assessed by NRS and SF‐MPQ. Interpretation: Treatment of intractable pain with NP 2 was well tolerated. There were no placebo controls in this relatively small study, but the dose‐responsive analgesic effects suggest that NP 2 may be effective in reducing pain and warrants further clinical investigation.

The present {{study was conducted with}} an aim to assess the oral health status of individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older and to evaluate the effect of various antiasthma medications on oral health. Materials and Methods. Forty individuals with asthma (22 females and 18 males) between 12 and 66 years of age were included in the study after following extensive exclusion criteria. For all subjects a detailed case history was taken. A thorough oral examination was conducted to determine caries experience, periodontal status, and candidiasis. Furthermore, whole unstimulated saliva was collected for pH estimation and cytological smears obtained for the screening of candidiasis. Results. Of the 40 subjects examined, a history of xerostomia was found in 55 %, stomatopyrosis in 22 %, and halitosis in 5 %. The mean DMFT (decayed, missing, filled teeth) was 4. 97. Periodontal treatment need evaluation revealed the requirement for oral hygiene education and professional prophylaxis in most of the subjects. However, no significant correlation was found between use of antiasthma medications and periodontal needs. An acidic pH was found in 52. 5 % of the subjects and candidiasis was detected in 65 %. Conclusion. A high incidence of xerostomia, acidic pH, and candidiasis was found in those having asthma. Studies with a larger sample size may help confirm these findings.

40|$|Due to {{the interplay}} between {{increasing}} chip capacity and complex applications, System-on-Chip (SoC) development is confronted by severe challenges, such as managing deep submicron effects, scaling communication architectures and bridging the productivity gap. Network-on-Chip (NoC) has been a rapidly developed concept {{in recent years to}} tackle the crisis with focus on network-based communication. NoC problems spread in the whole SoC spectrum ranging from specification, design, implementation to validation, from design methodology to tool support. In the thesis, we formulate and address problems in three key NoC areas, namely, on-chip network architectures, NoC network performance analysis, and NoC communication refinement. Quality and cost are major constraints for micro-electronic products, particularly, in high-volume application domains. We have developed a number of techniques to facilitate the design of systems with low area, high and predictable performance. From flit admission and ejection perspective, we investigate the area optimization for a classical wormhole architecture. The proposals are simple but effective. Not only offering unicast services, on-chip networks should also provide effective support for multicast. We suggest a connection-oriented multicasting protocol which can dynamically establish multicast groups with quality-of-service awareness. Based on the concept of a logical network, we develop theorems to guide the construction of contention-free virtual circuits, and employ a back-tracking algorithm to systematically search for feasible solutions. Network performance analysis plays {{a central role in the}} design of NoC communication architectures. Within a layered NoC simulation framework, we develop and integrate traffic generation methods in order to simulate network performance and evaluate network architectures. Using these methods, traffic patterns may be adjusted with locality parameters and be configured per pair of tasks. We propose also an algorithm-based analysis method to estimate whether a wormhole-switched network can satisfy the timing constraints of real-time messages. This method is built on traffic assumptions and based on a contention tree model that captures direct and indirect network contentions and <b>concurrent</b> link <b>usage.</b> In addition to NoC platform design, application design targeting such a platform is an open issue. Following the trends in SoC design, we use an abstract and formal specification as a starting point in our design flow. Based on the synchronous model of computation, we propose a top-down communication refinement approach. This approach decouples the tight global synchronization into process local synchronization, and utilizes synchronizers to achieve process synchronization consistency during refinement. Meanwhile, protocol refinement can be incorporated to satisfy design constraints such as reliability and throughput. The thesis summarizes the major research results on the three topics.

40|$|Increased {{consumer}} demand for convenience and ready-to-eat (RTE) food, along with changes to consumer food purchase and storage practices {{have resulted in}} an increased reliance on refrigeration to maximize food safety. Previous research suggests that many domestic refrigerators operate at temperatures exceeding recommendations, however several studies are determined by means of one temperature data point, which, given temperature fluctuation, {{may not be a}} true indicator of actual continual operating temperature. Data detailing actual operating temperature and the impact of consumer practice on temperature are limited. This study has collated the time-temperature profiles of domestic refrigerators in consumer kitchens (n= 43) over 6. 5 days with <b>concurrent</b> self-report refrigerator <b>usage.</b> Overall, findings established a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between one-off temperature and mean operating temperature. No refrigerator operated at ≤ 5. 0 °C for the entire duration of the study. Mean temperatures exceeding 5. 0 °C were recorded in the majority (91 %) of refrigerators. No significant associations or differences were determined between temperature profiles and demographics including household size and refrigerator characteristics (age, type, loading and location). A positive correlation (p< 0. 05) between room temperature and refrigerator temperature was determined. Reported door opening frequency correlated with temperature fluctuation (p< 0. 05). Thermometer usage was determined to be infrequent. Cumulatively, research findings have established that the majority of domestic refrigerators in consumer homes operated at potentially unsafe temperatures influenced by consumer usage. Findings from this study may be utilized to inform the development of shelf-life testing based on realistic domestic storage conditions. Furthermore, data can inform development of future educational interventions to increase safe domestic refrigeration practices...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous driving of {{vehicles}} has been becoming a reality and radar is an indispensable feature of this transportation method. However, there will be interference issues due to the multiple signals transmitted from the radars on the adjacent driving vehicles operating {{in the same area}} at the same time. Consequently, radar interference mitigation techniques will be essential in such multi-vehicle environment. In order to accurately detect and localize adjacent vehicles, several radars must be carried on each vehicle. A low-cost and highly-integrated CMOS radar sensor could be the best candidate to fulfill this growing industrial need. Linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar with constant envelopewaveform is suitable for low-power/ low-cost CMOS implementation. However, the ghosttargets due to other radars and radio interference generate false alarms and lower the probability of detection. Some interference mitigation techniques allocating frequency sub-bands at different time for different users to avoid <b>concurrent</b> frequency band <b>usage</b> have been proposed in the past. However, the number of users must trade off with the available bandwidth so does the range resolution. This dissertation presents an interference-tolerant radar which can endure multiple signals transmitted from adjacent vehicles for autonomous driving applications. The interference immunity property has been realized by applying a specific code-division multiplexing method, involved with one-coincidence frequency hopping code, to the continuous-wave radar. A radar prototype has been implemented in 65 nm CMOS for operation at 24 GHz with 1 GHz bandwidth (equivalently with 15 cm range resolution). Measurements indicate that the prototype can support up to 22 adjacent vehicles simultaneously by using the optimized Hamming correlation property of the extended hyperbolic congruential code...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{a country}} {{dominated}} by western healthcare, interest in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is growing. The increasing popularity of TCM, occasionally used with conventional medicine, {{needs to be}} assessed, especially in a vulnerable paediatric population. This paper sought {{to evaluate the use}} of TCM in children, mainly to determine the common conditions they seek TCM, the pattern of acupuncture or herbal usage for various age groups, the extent of <b>concurrent</b> <b>usage</b> of TCM and conventional medicine, and the reasons for TCM use. Paediatricians' perceptions of TCM will allow us to gauge the acceptability of TCM by those who practise conventional medicine. These are assessed in another arm of this study, with a set of predictive characteristics for their personal TCM use, their perceptions of herb/acupuncture safety, and their own referral to TCM eventually determined. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was administered on 300 parents awaiting consultation at a large TCM clinic. Next, a separate qualitative questionnaire survey form was posted to 100 paediatricians. RESULTS: Herb usage in children is very common (84. 3 percent) and 80 percent of parents admitted <b>concurrent</b> <b>usage</b> of TCM and conventional medicine for their children. Drug-herb interactions was an issue of concern for paediatricians. Paediatricians with a higher level of self-reported TCM knowledge were more likely to refer for a cure. CONCLUSION: This was the first study to determine the characteristics of children attending a large TCM clinic in a country which is dominated by western healthcare. It also provided insight into the perceptions of TCM among paediatricians in Singapore.
