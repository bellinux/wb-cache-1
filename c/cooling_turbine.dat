40|$|Gas Turbines are {{designed}} to continuously and efficiently generate useful power from fuel energy and are developed into very reliable high performance engines. Nowadays gas turbines have been put to use in various fields like, power plants, marine industries {{as well as for}} industrial propulsion. For high thermal efficiency advanced gas turbines use high temperature at the entry of the turbine. Therefore, for the purpose of increasing thermal efficiency of the turbines, it is imperative to design effective cooling schemes. The current Turbine Inlet Temperature in advanced gas turbines is much higher than the melting point of the blade material. As a result a varied range of cooling techniques are used to cool the blade to maintain normal operation of the turbine. An attempt has been made to computationally analyse the effects of one type of cooling system, rib turbulated cooling, wherein the cooling effects of air flow through a ribbed turbine blade passage has been simulated using ANSYSFLUENT. The mass flow rates of air through the passage was varied to observe the variation of cooling effects with mass flow rate and results were compared. The temperature contours of the blade for different mass flow rates were observed. The trends of different parameters like heat transfer coefficient, Nusselt number, skin friction coefficient was also noted.

40|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>turbine</b> {{inlet air}} is a proven method of {{increasing}} turbine power output, especially during peak summer demand. It {{is estimated that}} turbine power output can increase {{by as much as}} 0. 7 % for every 1 °C drop in inlet air temperature. Two inlet air cooling systems are widely used: evaporative cooling systems and chiller systems. Evaporative cooling is economical and uncomplicated, but its efficiency can significantly drop if the relative humidity is high. There is also a potential for excessive wear of compressor blades if water droplets are carried into the compressor section. On the other hand, chiller systems have the advantage of being independent of humidity and do not have the potential to cause damage to compressor blades. However, chiller systems consume power and cause a larger pressure drop than evaporative coolers. In this work, the possibility of using an ejector refrigeration system to cool turbine inlet air is explored. These systems are low-maintenance, fluid-driven, heat-operated devices that can use part of the turbine exhaust flow as the heat source for running the cycle. These systems require only pump power to feed liquid refrigerant to the vapor generator, making the power consumption potentially lower than conventional chiller systems. Using thermodynamic analysis, this paper compares the performance of ejector refrigeration systems with that of chiller systems based primarily on their power consumption. Performance characteristics for the ejector system are obtained through a CFD model that uses a real-gas model for R- 134 a. Published data on the performance of a commercial gas turbine is also considered. The power consumption of ejector refrigeration systems is found to be significantly smaller than that of vapor compression systems, with savings ranging from 19 % to 80 %. Power consumption is also found to be small compared to the boost in turbine power that is obtained. The percentage of waste heat needed to operate the ejector refrigeration system is found to be generally less than 25 %. King Saud Universit...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{the wide}} {{applications}} of the disk flows problem in industrial and technological fields, such as rotating machinery, viscometry, spin coating, use of computer disks, and in various rotating machinery components, have attracted concentration of many researchers.

Amongst them, Hayat et al. (2001) studied the non-coaxial rotation of viscous fluid in the presence of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow. The rotating disk was considered porous. Both cases of suction and injection were studied using the Laplace transform method, where the exact solutions of the governing equations were obtained. In addition, the study of accelerated porous disks in non-coaxial rotation of MHD second grade has been investigated by Asghar et al. (2007). They also used a Laplace transform method for the solution of the governing problem. Guria et al. (2007) observed the effect of Hall current on non-coaxial rotation of a porous disk. After that, Guria et al. (2010) extended their problem by taking the porous disk with a slip condition. From the observation, {{it was found that the}} primary velocity increases while the secondary velocity decreases when increasing the slip parameter. Exact solutions to this problem were obtained by using the Laplace transform technique. Ahmad (2012) investigated a problem that was similar to that of Guria et al. (2010). However, they did not consider the effects of Hall current but they concentrated on the effect of porous medium in the fluid flow. Das et al. (2013) examined unsteady MHD flow of a viscous fluid between two parallel disks executing non-coaxial rotation. They obtained an analytical solution describing the flow for large and small times using the Laplace transform technique, and provided the physical interpretations for the emerging parameters using various plots. In subsequent investigations, Das et al. (2012) and Das and Jana (2014) used the same methodology and analyzed the effect of Hall current on MHD flow in a non-coaxial rotating frame. They found that both primary and secondary velocities were increasing when the value of the Hall parameter was increased. Lakshmi and Muthuselvi (2014) also used the Laplace transform technique and obtained the exact solutions to unsteady viscous flow induced by a sudden coincidence of the axes of a disk and the fluid at infinity rotating with the uniform angular velocity. Besides the above authors, Ersoy has reported excellent results for different fluid flows induced by eccentric-concentric rotation of a disk and the fluid at infinity for both Newtonian (Ersoy 2003) and non-Newtonian fluids, e.g. second-grade fluid and Maxwell fluid (Ersoy 2010, 2014). Similar to the previous authors, Ersoy (2003, 2010, 2014) have also investigated these problems using the Laplace transform technique.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{a study of the}} {{significance}} of lossmodels and their applications in simulation and optimisation ofaxial turbines. The design of a turbomachine system is a verycomplex engineering operation which can be looked upon as aniterative procedure made of various steps. Computational toolsfor simulating and optimising turbomachines are needed nowadaysin order to design turbines more effectively and efficiently. In order to use the tools to analyse elaborate thermodynamiccycles and optimise the cycles for different assignments,aerothermodynamic performances over each blade row in turbineshave to be predicted in a correct trend and reasonable accuratein a wide operating range. Because the flow in a turbine iscomplex and many mechanisms of the flow losses in turbine havenot be known well, loss models are needed, not only in thepreliminary process of mean line prediction but also in thefurther process of through flow calculation, in the simulationand optimisation of turbines. Most of the loss models areempirical while some of them are established with combinationof test data and analysis of physical origins of thelosses. The objectives of this thesis are to further understand anddevelop loss models and therefore to achieve useful guides forapplying the models properly in turbine aerothermodynamicsimulation and optimisation. In this thesis, concepts of the flow field, loss mechanismsand classification and definition of loss coefficient in axialturbines are introduced in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, some lossmodels published in the literature for axial turbines arereviewed and studied in detail. An effort is also made, in thischapter, to develop a simple method for approximatelypredictingoverall film cooling losses in a turbine blade rowbased on equation of mass, momentum and energy conservation inmixing flows. In Chapter 3, five axial turbine stages, whichhave been used for the study, are introduced. These turbinestages are with different geometrical parameters, with impulseand reaction and untwisted and free vortex blading, and work atdifferent flow conditions, in subsonic and supersonic flow andcooling and non-cooling conditions. In Chapter 4, mean lineperformances of these turbine stages were simulated withdifferent loss models which are the models byAinley/Mathieson/Dunham/Came (AMDC), Kacker/Okapuu, Craig/Coxand Moustaph/Kacker supplemented with the new developed coolingloss prediction method. The simulations were performed withinlarge operating ranges which cover design and off-designpoints. The predicted results from the mean line performancecalculation in the loss models were compared with theexperimental data. In Chapter 5, an analysis of the optimumpitch/chord ratio for both the stator and rotor in one of theseturbine stages was made through studying the total lossespredicted in the loss models. It was found that all these loss models give the same trendof overall performance compared with the trend of experimentalresults on the turbine stages. For the impulse turbine stages,it was showed that all these loss models seem to overestimatelosses in the whole operation range and the AMDC model is onewhich most overestimates the losses while the Craig/Cox modelgives the loss closest to the experimental results at and nearthe design point. When the aspect ratios in the impulse turbinestages increase about 25 %, the results showed that the modelsgive about 15 - 30 % lower total losses. For the free vortexblading turbine, {{it was found that the}} losses areunderpredicted in all the models, especially on the off-designoperation points, because the high losses at the hub wallcaused by the blading of free vortex are underestimated byusing the parameters at mean line. For the high pressure andtemperature cooled turbine stage, the predicted results showedthat all these models predict higher efficiencies than theexperiments because the lack of cooling loss calculation in themodels. The AMDC and Craig/Cox models seem to give closeresults to the experiments in this <b>cooling</b> <b>turbine</b> stagebecause of the fortuity of overestimated uncooled turbinelosses. After adding the cooling losses predicted with the newdeveloped method in the thesis, the trends of simulatedperformances in this turbine stage have better agreement withthe trend of experimental data. In the analysis of the optimumpitch/chord ratio, the results showed that the pitch/chordratio evaluated by total losses is not very critical and allthe models gave similar low loss regions of pitch/chord ratiosin which the total losses do not change significantly. Thisimplies there will be no significant difference between theseloss models if they are employed to obtain the optimumpitch/chord ratio in turbine optimisation process. NR 2014080...|$|E
