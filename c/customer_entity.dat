However, traditional methods of constructing a performance model are typically manual, time-consuming, intrusive and labourintensive. The limited amount and low quality of manually-collected data often lead to an inaccurate picture of customer flows and poor estimates of model parameters. Driven by advances in wireless sensor technologies, recent real-time location systems (RTLSs) enable the automatic, continuous and unintrusive collection of high-precision location tracking data, in both indoor and outdoor environment. This high-quality data provides an ideal basis {{for the construction of}} high-fidelity performance models. This thesis presents a four-stage data processing pipeline which takes as input high-precision location tracking data and automatically constructs a queueing network performance model approximating the underlying system. The first two stages transform raw location traces into high-level “event logs ” recording when and for how long a <b>customer</b> <b>entity</b> requests service from a server entity.

The third stage infers the customer flow structure and extracts samples of time delays involved in the system; including service time, customer interarrival time and customer travelling time. The fourth stage parameterises the service process and customer arrival process of the final output queueing network model. To collect large-enough location traces for the purpose of inference by conducting physical experiments is expensive, labour-intensive and time-consuming. We thus developed LocTrack- JINQS, an open-source simulation library for constructing simulations with location awareness and generating synthetic location tracking data. Finally we examine the effectiveness of the data processing pipeline through four case studies based on both synthetic and real location tracking data. The results show that the methodology performs with moderate success in inferring multi-class queueing networks composed of single-server queues with FIFO, LIFO and priority-based service disciplines; it is also capable of inferring different routing policies, including simple probabilistic routing, class-based routing and shortest-queue routing.

40|$|This thesis explores a {{combined}} application of Supply Chain Management theory for centralized and decentralized distribution systems and Customer Relationship Management techniques in data mining {{to solve the}} challenges of supply allocations to individual <b>customer</b> <b>entities</b> at Intel Corporation. The relatively long manufacturing lead time compared to order lead time restricts Intel's supply flexibility from responding to rapid order changes by each customer. As a result, the individual customer service level is sacrificed. Therefore, {{the objective of the}} research project is to improve customer service level by global optimization for all customers as opposed to the local optimization that each customer currently operates on. Over-ordering occurs in the local optimization system. The proposed solution is to use a scientific and systematic methodology of data mining to guide operational strategies that will provide incentives to encourage customers to order more accurately with Intel. Through this exercise, the supplies can be virtually centralized at Intel instead of being committed out to each customer in a decentralized fashion. The hypothesis is that the new system with more accurate ordering from customers will result in increased supply flexibility and higher effective service level. by Mindy H. Hsu. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|A {{long history}} of {{organizational}} {{research has shown that}} organizations are affected significantly by changes in technology. Scholars have given particular attention to the effects of so-called disruptive or discontinuous technological changes.

This dissertation, which examines the response of the American College of Radiology (ACR) to the emergence of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology (NMR), aims to contribute to this well-established research tradition in three distinct and important ways.

40|$|Purpose – The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse relationship quality in a business-to-business context. Given that the relationship between market orientation and customer-perceived service quality is well known in the area of higher education, this paper draws on its antecedents to examine relationship quality in cultural services. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 68 <b>customers</b> (cultural <b>entities)</b> was obtained from a postal survey (April 2010). Partial least squares (PLS) models were used to test the proposed hypotheses. This is a structural equation (SEM) technique based on variances that is suited to working with small and medium sized samples. Findings – The authors’ results show that satisfaction, trust and commitment are key components of relationship quality. While service quality is a determining factor of satisfaction, relationship quality can be improved by taking into account that customer-perceived market orientation acts as a precursor for service quality, satisfaction and commitment. Originality/value – This article attempts to expand upon the previous relationship quality literature on business-to-business relationships to: study behaviours conducive to lasting relationships between two different sectors (higher education and cultural industry); understand the antecedents of relationship quality; confirm relationship quality dimensions; and compare the hypothesized relationships from the customer's perspectiv...|$|R

40|$|Although {{supply chain}} (SC) has gained {{increasing}} attention {{in the last decade}} and numerous SC problems have been identified and solved, {{there is a lack of}} systematic approach to solve SC problems at a system level. SC can be viewed as a network of organisations including, but not restricted to, the suppliers (source of raw materials), manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and end <b>customers.</b> Each <b>entity</b> is able to process different tasks individually in order to satisfy the global goal of the network, which is usually the total cost or lead time of a set of products. If only inter-entity problems are solved, like inventory level, production planning, etc., the performance of the whole system is not guaranteed to be acceptable. The main objective of this paper is to review contemporary SC problems and the methodologies in solving them, and to suggest future research direction for solving supply chains problems. From the analysis of the review, it can be concluded that there is limited research to solve SC problems from a "system" point of view. In this connection, future direction in solving system-wide SC, and the potential difficulties, are discussed.
