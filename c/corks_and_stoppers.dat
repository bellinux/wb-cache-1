40|$|Nowadays the {{selection}} and {{the treatment of the}} glass waste is implemented in processing plants where, through sorting the foreign bodies and separation from Pb crystal, opaque bodies and the metals, a secondary raw material (SRM) - named cullet - is obtained, suitable for glass products and a glassy waste (glass waste 2) still not accepted by the glass factories. While the recovery of primary glass waste is already spread and technological known, the secondary glass waste (glass waste 2) is recovered by few companies in Italy from some years. Consequently the recovery of the waste of this secondary recovery process of glass waste is new (glass waste 3) and therefore to optimize, in order to reach an economic and sustainable industrial process solution. With the aim of optimizing the plant of SASIL already existing for the recovery of the "glass waste 3 ", innovative technologies have been studied and executed. The major difficulty is in the automatic separation of materials as plastic lightweight, synthetic <b>stoppers</b> <b>and</b> <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> that can nowadays find a market. In particular the solved problem is the separation for materials whose density is < 1, using non-impacting methods. The particle distribution and characterization of the waste in entrance in plant and the products obtained in different stage of treatment have been used to dimension the new plant and to suggest new kind of treatment. Among the innovative process suggested two density separation have been performed: - separation by means jig concentrators; - separation of new method of bath suction. In this research the jig concentrator, at difference of the previous research don't use floatation principle but only fluid motion (without chemical addition and collectors). The same is for the "bath suction apparatus" that it needs only of water to execute the separation. The separation of efficiencies are major than 80 % both for jig concentrators, for the separation of heavy plastic and glass from plastic lightweight <b>and</b> synthetic <b>stoppers</b> <b>and</b> <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers,</b> <b>and</b> for bath suction apparatus that led to separate plastic lightweight from synthetic <b>stoppers</b> <b>and</b> <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers.</b> On the base of laboratory results, a new treatment plant has been designed and economic evaluation have been made. The materials to be trade as secondary raw materials (SRM) are about 87. 5 % of the total feeding and they are glass, plastic lightweight, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, synthetic <b>stoppers</b> <b>and</b> <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers.</b> These percentage should be related to the high amount of this kind of waste to be valorized (glass waste 3), landfilled in the plant in Italy and ready to be recovered, after the implementation of the right industrial technology...|$|R

This study aims at comparing the effect of hydration (from 0 to 100 % relative humidity at 25 A degrees C) on the mechanical properties of four widely used types of stoppers: natural corks, agglomerated <b>corks,</b> technical <b>stoppers</b> <b>and</b> synthetic (co-extruded) <b>stoppers.</b> For both natural <b>and</b> agglomerated <b>corks,</b> the Young's modulus was significantly and similarly affected by hydration, with a constant plateau value up to 50 % relative humidity (RH) and a mean value around 22 and 14 MPa, respectively. For higher RH, the increase in water content leads to {{a decrease in the}} material rigidity (Young's modulus < 10 MPa), which is attributed to water clusters formation between polymer chains. Technical stoppers revealed a similar profile, but with a much smaller impact of the water content and with overall lower Young's moduli values, around 5 MPa, throughout the RH range. The stiffness of synthetic closures was not affected by hydration, in agreement with the hydrophobic behavior of polyethylene. Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis allowed us to identify a glass transition temperature (T (g)) in cork (around 0 A degrees C), and another one in agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>and</b> technical <b>stoppers</b> (close to - 45 A degrees C, corresponding to additives).

The study was carried out on <b>cork</b> planks <b>and</b> natural <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> from the most representative cork-producing areas in the world. Two training sets of international <b>and</b> national <b>cork</b> planks were studied. The first set comprised a total of 479 samples from Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, while the second set comprised a total of 179 samples from the Spanish regions of Andalusia, Catalonia, and Extremadura. A training set of 90 <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> from Andalusia <b>and</b> Catalonia was also studied. Original spectroscopic data were obtained for the transverse sections of the <b>cork</b> planks <b>and</b> for the body and top of the cork stoppers by means of a 6500 Foss-NIRSystems SY II spectrophotometer using a fiber optic probe. Remote reflectance was employed in the wavelength range of 400 to 2500 nm.

The {{target of the}} present investigation was to evaluate the ‘‘classification tree’’ {{as a tool to}} discover possible relationships between microsite characteristics <b>and</b> <b>cork</b> quality. Seven main cork oak (Quercus suber) producing areas have been identified in Sardinia, for a total of more than 122, 000 ha. Sixty-three sample trees, distributed among different geographical locations and microsite conditions, were selected. A soil profile near each sample tree was described, soil samples were collected and analysed. After debarking, cork quality of each sample tree was graded by an independent panel of experts. Microsites where trees had more than 50 % of the extracted cork graded in the best quality class, according to the official quality standard in Italy, were labelled as prime microsites, the others as nonprime microsites. Relationships between a binary dummy variable (0 for nonprime microsites, 1 for prime microsites) and site factors were investigated using classification tree analysis to select the relevant variables and to define the classification scheme. Prime quality microsites for cork production proved to be characterised by elevation, soil phosphorus content and sandiness. Results have been compared with those of the more conventional parametric approach by logistic regression. The work demonstrates the advantages of the classification tree method. The model may be appropriate for classifications at landscape and stand mapping levels, where it is possible to sample a number of microsites and to evaluate distributional characteristics of model output, while its precision is only indicative when estimating the prime quality of single microsites.

Moreover, musty-earthy samples of both types were shown to have a specific microbiota. The fungi Penicillium glabrum and Neurospora spp. were present in all samples and were assumed to make only a small contribution to off-odor development. In contrast, Penicillium islandicum and Penicillium variabile were found almost exclusively in 2, 4, 6 -trichloroanisole (TCA) tainted discs. Conversely, Rhodotorula minuta and Rhodotorula sloofiae were most common in cork stoppers, where only small amounts of TCA were detected.

Agglomerated cork stoppers, which were produced in Portugal, Spain, and Italy, used in wine bottles were examined.

The levels of mono- and dibutyltin compounds in corks {{were found in}} the range from < 0. 0024 to 3. 3 and from < 0. 0029 to 6. 7 mug of Sn/g, respectively. A low level of tributyltin contamination was also found in 2 of 31 tested samples. The presence of butyltin compounds in agglomerated cork stoppers was confirmed by GC-MS.

In turn from this treatment SASIL generates a 3 % of waste made of all the impurities usually present in a glass waste.
