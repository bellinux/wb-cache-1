50|$|The {{generation}} of {{vast quantities of}} waste rubber from car tires has sparked interest in finding uses for this discarded rubber. The rubber {{can be turned into}} a fine powder, which can then be used as a toughening agent for polystyrene. However, poor miscibility between the waste rubber and polystyrene will weaken the material. This problem requires the use of a <b>compatibilizer</b> (see compatibilization) in order to reduce interfacial tension and ultimately make rubber toughening of polystyrene effective. A polystyrene/styrene-butadiene copolymer acts to increase the adhesion between the dispersed and continuous phases.|$|E
40|$|The {{thermomechanical}} {{degradation of}} blends made from polypropylene and polystyrene, {{with or without}} <b>compatibilizer,</b> was studied using an internal mixer coupled to a torque rheometer. The blends processed without <b>compatibilizer</b> presented regular and expected results regarding torque reduction, with evidence of chain scission. The blends processed with the block copolymer of styrene and butadiene, SBS, as a <b>compatibilizer</b> presented unchanged or less reduced variation on torque values during processing. The extraction of stabilizers from the <b>compatibilizer</b> before processing {{did not affect the}} results. The <b>compatibilizer</b> concentration in the blends was varied, with its influence still being observed in concentrations as low as 0. 03 parts per hundred. Similar results were obtained in an experiment comparing the performance of a primary commercial anti-oxidant, Irganox 1076, and the <b>compatibilizer</b> SBS. Therefore, the <b>compatibilizer</b> can be considered as a processing aid agent with positive influence on avoiding thermomechanical degradation...|$|E

Effects of initial monomer and peroxide concentrations {{on the degree}} of grafting, on the amount of residual monomer, and on the side reactions were investigated. Reactive <b>compatibilizers</b> could be prepared with a suitable choice of processing conditions and initial concentrations. These oxazoline functionalized polyolefins and elastomers were found to act as effective <b>compatibilizers</b> in polymer blends. Blends of polyolefins and polyamide 6 were compatibilized with two novel types of compatibilizers: oxazoline functionalized polymers prepared by grafting and functionalized polyolefins prepared by copolymerization using metallocene catalysts. Comparison was made with commercial <b>compatibilizers.</b> Effects of the <b>compatibilizers</b> on blend morphology and thermal, tensile, and impact properties were studied. All of the functionalized polyolefins were effective <b>compatibilizers</b> in polyethylene/polyamide 6 blends. They were able to reduce the particle size and attach the particles more firmly to the matrix. The toughness was improved, though usually at the cost of stiffness. Only functionalized polyethylenes prepared with metallocene catalysts were able to improve the stiffness and strength along with toughness. In commercial polyolefin composites, fillers are usually coated with a fatty acid to make them organophilic. Replacement of fatty acid coatings with polymeric <b>compatibilizers</b> was studied in polyethylene/aluminum hydroxide (PE/ATH) and polyethylene/magnesium hydroxide (PE/MH) composites. The polymeric <b>compatibilizers</b> were oxazoline grafted polyethylene prepared by melt free radical grafting, hydroxyl and carboxylic acid functionalized polyethylenes prepared with metallocene catalysts, and commercial functionalized polyethylenes. Adhesion fracture changed to cohesion failure when the fatty acid coating was replaced through the addition of polymeric <b>compatibilizers.</b> Improvement in both stiffness and toughness was achieved, and improvements in flammability properties achieved with ATH or MH were preserved when polymeric <b>compatibilizers</b> were used as adhesion promoters. reviewe...|$|R

The DSC results for the blends of 50 / 50 and 30 / 70 compositions show two clear glass transition temperatures, indicating that the blends are two-phase systems. With the addition of <b>compatibilizer,</b> the separation between the two glass transitions decreased, suggesting an increased interaction between the blend components with <b>compatibilizer.</b> At 5 wt % of <b>compatibilizer,</b> the separation between the T(g) s reduced in both 50 / 50 and 30 / 70 blends. The positron results, for the blends without <b>compatibilizer</b> showed an increase in relative fractional free volume, as the EPDM content in the blend is increased. This suggests the coalescence of free volume of EPDM with the free volumes of PTT due to phase separation. However, the effect of <b>compatibilizer</b> in the blends was clearly seen with the observed minimum in free volume parameters at 5 % of the <b>compatibilizer,</b> further suggesting that this percent of <b>compatibilizer</b> seems to be the optimum value for these blends.

40|$|The compatibilization {{mechanism}} of some <b>compatibilizers</b> for blends of polyolefins with a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) was studied. Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were blended with a semirigid LCP (SBH) in a batch mixer, either {{with and without}} <b>compatibilizers.</b> The latter were two commercially available samples of functionalized polyolefins, that is, a PE-g-MA (HDM) and a PP-g-AA (Polybond 1001) copolymer and some purposely synthesized PE-g-LCP and PP-g-LCP copolymers. Microtomed films of the binary and the ternary blends were annealed at 240 degrees C on the hot stage of a polarizing microscope and the changes undergone by their morphology were recorded {{as a function of}} time. The results indicate that the <b>compatibilizers</b> lower the interfacial tension, thereby providing an improvement of the minor phase dispersion. In addition to this, the rate of the coalescence caused by the high-temperature treatment is appreciably reduced in the systems compatibilized with the PE-SBH and PP-SBH graft copolymers. Among the commercial <b>compatibilizers,</b> only Polybond 1001 displayed an effect comparable to that of the above copolymers.

Polycaprolactone (PCL) and starch {{can be used in}} the blend as such a substitute. Phase separation occurs when these two polymers are mixed, so a <b>compatibilizer</b> must be added. In this research this <b>compatibilizer</b> is made by functionalization of high molecular weight polycaprolactone in supercritical carbon dioxide. The goal of this research is to develop <b>compatibilizer</b> precursors using high molecular weight PCL and supercritical carbon dioxide. The functionalization degree of the <b>compatibilizer</b> precursors as function of the monomer and initiator intake is investigated and used in developing a mathematical model. The R 2 -value of our model is 0, 967; this implies that the model has a good fit with the experimental data. GPC analysis showed that no degradation/cross linking occurred during the reactions due to the use of supercritical carbon dioxide as the solvent in the reaction. The advantage of using supercritical carbon dioxide as an environmental benign solvent is that milder reaction conditions can be used. The <b>compatibilizer</b> precursors are tested for their performance in starch-PCL blends. These blends are made in the melt using a brabender. Different compatibilizers are used in different amounts to investigate changes in mechanical properties of the blends. In addition, the ratio of PCL and starch is changed. From the results can be concluded that the <b>compatibilizer</b> improves the mechanical properties. The amount and functionalization degree of the <b>compatibilizer</b> precursor have no influence on the mechanical properties. In addition, a <b>compatibilizer</b> made with normal melt processing is used in the blends to look to the difference with the compatibilizers made in supercritical carbon dioxide.

40|$|Abstract: By {{blending}} homemade <b>compatibilizer</b> with {{carboxylic acid}} functional groups into the basic materials of PPO and PA 66, through twin-screw extruder blending, the PPO/PA 66 alloy was prepared. The micromorphological and mechanical properties of PPO/PA 66 blends with different {{contents of the}} <b>compatibilizer</b> were studied by transmission electron microscope （TEM）, scanning electron microscope （SEM）, mechanical test and Molau test. The {{results showed that the}} homemade <b>compatibilizer</b> can improve the mechanical property. Besides showing good effect on the compatibility improvement for PPO/PA blends, it has an in-situ compatibilization for the PPO/PA 66 alloy. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of space charges in Polypropylene (PP) filled with synthetic and natural nanoclay after aging with - 25 kV/mm DC field under 50 0 C were investigated. Following certain periods of aging, the space charge {{was measured by}} the PEA technique. The PP materials, bases for the two types of Polymer nanocomposites, i. e. PP were loaded with synthetic and natural nanoclay. The unfilled PP contains grafted maleic anhydride as <b>compatibilizers.</b> It was observed that the percentage amount of <b>compatibilizers</b> affects the charge distribution in the PP materials. The results indicated that aging with 50 0 C temperature of the PNC with 2 and 4 -wt...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{concentrates}} {{on the effect of}} <b>compatibilizers</b> on the thermal, dynamic mechanical, crystalline and rheological properties of unmodified fluorinated and oxy-fluorinated short Kevlar fiber reinforced ethylene propylene copolymer (EP). The compati-bilizers used in this study are maleic anhydride grafted Polypropylene (MA-gPP). The composites were prepared in a brabender mixer and were molded in a compression molding. The compatibilized samples show improved thermal, dynamic mechanical crystalline as well as rheological properties as a result of better adhesion between the fiber and matrix at the interface. The compatibilizing effect is much more pronounced in the case of oxy-fluorinated Kevlar/EP composites in comparison with the untreated and fluorinated Kevlar/EP composites.
