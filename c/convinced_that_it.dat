5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley {{as a symbol of}} oppression, Czolgosz was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E
5|$|Father McCue (Arnie Walters) {{contacts}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and asks}} for her help in the case. Scully visits the Kernofs, and learns that Dara was adopted six years earlier. Due to her severe spinal deformities, there is no explanation as to how Dara {{walked out of the}} house. Lance is <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the Devil that stood over her in the street. Scully examines Dara's body with a pathologist Vicki Belon (Lorraine Landry), who notes her surgically removed extra fingers. Belon reluctantly proposes that the girl was struck down by God, as if she was a mistake.|$|E

5|$|Neither U-10 {{nor any of}} {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be impossible to}} take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E

As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million Kronen had been returned. Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.|$|E

But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow the carousel's installation on the fifth floor.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{originally}} considered reviving CBS's long-lost {{quiz show}} The $64,000 Question {{for a new}} era, with a new home on ABC. However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British Millionaire {{was about to make}} its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight FedEx packages from different family members, each containing a copy of Millionaires first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host Chris Tarrant's intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the $64,000 Question revival in favor of introducing Millionaire to American airwaves, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would become extraordinarily popular.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí was {{inspired}} above all by mediaeval Gothic art, {{but wanted to}} improve on its structural solutions. Neo-gothic {{was one of the}} most successful historicist styles at that time, above all as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc. Gaudí studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in León and Burgos, and became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of ruled surfaces, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.|$|E

5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{community}} of Narrowsburg, New York, several miles upstream, requested that Pennsylvania Department of Transportation replace the 102-year-old structure. It had already had its weight limits reduced. The same year, an engineering firm in Millburn, New Jersey reported replacing the bridge would cost about $6.16 million, while keeping it would cost even more and raise its life expectancy {{by no more than}} 15 years. The Upper Delaware Council said that the 8 ton (7.2 tonne) limit on the bridge was inadequate for service trucks and emergency vehicles. The Shohola Township supervisors support maintaining the existing bridge, but the Lumberland Town Board was not <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had {{a support}} network in Missouri, that {{provided}} them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than a means to an end at that point for Anderson: it became an end in itself.|$|E

As she walks back to her apartment, she notices Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) in her car reading a newspaper and searching for a place to stay. Mary Margaret offers Emma a spare room at her apartment. The following day, Mary Margaret notices Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) looking at the comatose John Doe (Dallas) while they are setting up decorations at the hospital. Henry believes that John Doe is Prince Charming and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Henry asks her to read to Charming from the storybook, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will wake him up. Emma persuades Mary Margaret to go along with Henry's wishes so that they can prove the stories aren't real. At the hospital, Mary Margaret reads the stories to the patient, until his hand grabs hers, shocking Mary Margaret. She tells Dr. Whale that Charming might be waking up, but the doctor does not believe her. After she leaves, Dr. Whale calls Regina (Parrilla), as he had been instructed to do should there be a change in John Doe's state, revealing that he had been lying to Mary Margaret.|$|E
5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and {{is placed in the}} Shotgun Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap similar to the one used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp would get him killed if he stayed with him. Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven Sing. It is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is Tapp's fault that her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will mangle her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did not call for backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that every one of the traps there could have been easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E
