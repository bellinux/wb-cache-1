40|$|Molecular typing of {{bacteria}} {{has been widely}} used in epidemiological studies but not as extensively for tracing the transmission of pathogenic bacteria in food plants. This {{study was conducted to}} examine the potential use of two molecular typing methods, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), to trace Listeria monocytogenes contamination in a shrimp processing plant. Ribotyping and phase typing were also performed on a select number of strains. One hundred fifteen strains of L. monocytogenes collected in different areas of a shrimp processing plant were first serotyped and then subtyped by molecular typing. RAPD and PFGE showed great promise for typing L. monocytogenes isolates since distinguishable and reproducible DNA polymorphisms were obtained. When the <b>composite</b> <b>profile</b> from both (RAPD and PFGE) methods was generated, there was an increase in the discriminatory power to discern differences between strains of L. monocytogenes. The results indicated that environmental strains all fell into <b>composite</b> <b>profile</b> groupings unique to the environment, while strains from both water and utensils shared another <b>composite</b> <b>profile</b> group.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the morphology and micro-morphology of Quaternary alluvial calcrete profiles from the Sorbas Basin shows that calcretes may be morphologically simple or complex. The 'simple' profiles reflect pedogenesis occurring after alluvial terrace formation and consist of a single pedogenic horizon near the land surface. The 'complex' profiles reflect the occurrence of multiple calcrete events during terrace sediment aggradation and further periods of pedogenesis after terrace formation. These 'complex' calcrete profiles are consequently described as <b>composite</b> <b>profiles.</b> The exact morphology of the <b>composite</b> <b>profiles</b> depends upon: (1) the number of calcrete-forming events occurring during terrace sediment aggradation; (2) the amount of sediment accretion that occurs between each period of calcrete formation; and (3) the degree of pedogenesis after terrace formation. Simple calcrete profiles are most useful in establishing landform chronologies because they represent a single phase of pedogenesis after terrace formation. <b>Composite</b> <b>profiles</b> are more problematic. Pedogenic calcretes that form within them may inherit carbonate from calcrete horizons occurring lower down in the terrace sediments. In addition erosion {{may lead to the}} exhumation of older calcretes within the terrace sediment. Calcrete 'inheritance' may make pedogenic horizons appear more mature than they actually are and produce horizons containing carbonate embracing a range of ages. Calcrete exhumation exposes calcrete horizons whose morphology and radiometric ages are wholly unrelated to terrace surface age. <b>Composite</b> <b>profiles</b> are, therefore, only suitable for chronological studies if the pedogenic horizon capping the terrace sequence can be clearly distinguished from earlier calcrete-forming events. Thus, a detailed morphological/micro-morphological study is required before any chronological study is undertaken. This {{is the only way to}} establish whether particular calcrete profiles are suitable for dating purposes. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{relevance}} of shear deformability, the practical use of <b>composite</b> <b>profiles</b> still conflicts with the serviceability requirements related to the stiffness demand for civil applications. Moreover, when dealing with shear deformable beams, it is also well recognized that displacement-based 1 -D models can lead to inaccurate stress predictions. Hence, a relatively simple beam model allowing to evaluate both strains and stresses accurately may represent a useful tool.

40|$|A palaeomagnetic study {{comprising}} the directional results from 289 individual lava flows, sampled along eight sections in the Palaeocene basalts of West Greenland, is reported. The eight individual sections are correlated using lithostratigraphical marker horizons {{to form a}} single <b>composite</b> <b>profile.</b> Generally, the lithological correlation is in good agreement with the record of geomagnetic secular variation. The total composite palaeomagnetic profile represents a stratigraphic thickness of 1. 6 km through the Vaigat Formation, which is the lowermost of the two volcanic formations formed during the main stage of plateau volcanism. Only two polarity zones {{are found in the}} <b>composite</b> <b>profile,</b> suggesting a very short duration for the West Greenland main plateau-building volcanism. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates support a high extrusion rate and also indicate that the lower normal polarity zone is Chron C 27 n and that the upper reverse polarity zone is Chron C 26 r.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Purpose of the Study The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the exposure and influence of recruitment techniques and influential sources and factors which influenced student selection of vocational-technical education. Procedures The data for this study were obtained through the use of a student questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 578 community college respondents within the urban, suburban and rural geographical areas in the State of Oregon. The Chi-square and t-Test statistics were used in statistically analyzing the data in reference to the classification of students [...] high school, transfer and out-of-school students within the urban, suburban and rural geographical areas. Conclusions From the results of this study, the following conclusions and implications can be drawn: 1. Career days, scheduling a conference with the community college guidance counselor and brochures, flyers, leaflets and booklets were ranked first, second and third respectively, in all geographical areas as the three most influential recruitment techniques. 2. The influence of other recruitment techniques were dependent upon the classification of students within each geographical area. A closer analysis of these recruitment techniques may assist college personnel in providing more effective recruitment programs. 3. It can be concluded that high school students had significantly greater overall contact and influence of recruitment techniques, and transfer and out-of-school students were significantly lower. 4. Parents, guardian or relatives and the community college guidance counselor were ranked first and second respectively by the classification of students in all geographical areas as being the most influential in offering personal advice. 5. In general, the transfer and out-of-school students ranked the employer, employment agency, welfare agency and rehabilitation agency as being higher among influential sources as compared to the total <b>composite</b> <b>profile.</b> 6. The parents, guardian or relatives were ranked first as an influential source, however ranked sixth in providing recruitment information to the respective classifications of students. It would be advantageous to provide more recruitment information to the parents, guardian or relatives, considering their influence with the respective classifications of students. 7. It can be concluded that there is a direct correlation between the quantity of recruitment information disseminated by influential sources and their relative influence upon the respective classifications of students. 8. The rural <b>composite</b> <b>profile</b> provided a larger quantity of recruitment information as compared to the total <b>composite</b> <b>profile.</b> 9. The influential sources which ranked first and second respectively by all geographical areas and classifications of students were recruitment information mailed by community college and recruitment information disseminated by the community college guidance counselor and faculty. Recommendations It is recommended that the findings of this study be utilized by community college personnel of vocational-technical education in planning and developing effective recruitment programs related to the different classifications of students. It is specifically recommended that community college personnel in vocational-technical education critically analyze the findings of this study in relationship to the recruitment techniques, recruitment informational dissemination sources and influential sources which were influential in recruiting, and adapt these influential factors to their present recruitment programs...|$|E

Fifteen species of fish were represented. Seventy-four samples {{out of a total}} of 320 were confirmed by PCR as yielding L. monocytogenes. From retail source A, a total of 171 samples yielded 59 (34. 5 %) that were positive for the presence of L. monocytogenes. In contrast, from retail source B, a total of 149 samples yielded 15 (10. 0 %) that were positive. Only six samples (3. 5 %) from retail source A had MPN counts of L. monocytogenes in the range of 100 to 1, 000 per 1, 000 g. Only two samples (1. 3 %) from retail source B had counts of L. monocytogenes from 100 to 1, 000 per 100 g. A total of 221 strains of L. monocytogenes were derived from the MPN cultures, 164 from retail source A, and 57 from retail source B. All 221 strains were subjected to RAPD analysis using three random primers. Primer LMPB 1 yielded 21 RAPD profiles, primer LMPB 4 yielded 19 profiles, and primer HLWL 74 yielded 26 profiles. A total of 55 <b>composite</b> <b>profiles</b> were identified by combining the profiles derived from the three primers.
