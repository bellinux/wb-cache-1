40|$|Protein enriched {{composite}} flours comprising {{rice flour}} and soybean and pea protein isolates were made. Experimental design resulted in composite protein enriched blends with different functional, rheological, mechanical and surface related textural properties. The enzyme transglutaminase (TG) was added for reinforcing the protein network. Protein isolates induced a significant (α< 0. 01) {{increase in the}} water absorption of the <b>composite</b> <b>blends,</b> having also a synergistic effect and a decrease of the storage (G′) and viscous (G′′) moduli. Protein isolates also modified the mechanical and surface related textural properties.

Crosslinking activity of the transglutaminase led to a significant decrease of the foaming activity and stability.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{captures the}} effect of {{structure}} and the applicability of compaction models using the cold compaction of a TiH 2 -SS 316 L composite powder prepared by high energy mechanical milling. The <b>composite</b> <b>blend</b> was cold pressed uniaxially to pressures of up to 1250 MPa. The compressibility of the <b>composite</b> <b>blend</b> was evaluated by fitting the experimental data to {{the most commonly used}} compaction models of Heckel, the Kawakita-Lüdde, the Cooper-Eaton, the Ge, and the Panelli-Filho compaction equations. Among the models, the Kawakita-Lüdde and Cooper-Eaton models fitted the experimental data very well with a good correlation (the correlation coefficient greater than 0. 99) throughout the entire pressure range under investigation. The nature and mechanisms responsible for the densification during cold compaction are discussed. The Heckel, Ge, Panelli-Filho, and Cooper-Eaton model analysis showed that the dominant compaction mechanisms for <b>composite</b> <b>blend</b> were rearrangement of particles followed by elastic and plastic deformation.
