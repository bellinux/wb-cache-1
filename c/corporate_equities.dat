40|$|The {{increase}} in international capital mobility {{over the past}} two decades has put pressure on the tax treatment of <b>corporate</b> <b>equity</b> income. <b>Corporate</b> level taxes distort investment flows across locations and create opportunities for tax avoidance by shifting income across jurisdictions. Outward flows of capital shift part of the burden of the corporate level tax on equity income from capital to labor, thereby making its incidence less progressive. Individual level taxes on <b>corporate</b> <b>equity</b> income lower the after-tax return to savings but have less distorting effects on investment location and are more likely to fall on owners of capital than workers. This logic suggests there may be both efficiency gains and increases in progressivity from shifting taxes on <b>corporate</b> <b>equity</b> income from the corporate to the shareholder level. We discuss these effects and estimate the distributional effects of raising shareholder-level taxes on <b>corporate</b> <b>equity</b> income and using the revenue to cut the corporate tax rate. We find that taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income (subject to a maximum 28 percent rate on long-term capital gains) would finance a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to about 26 percent, assuming no behavioral responses. While the distributional effect depends on what one assumes about the incidence of the corporate income tax, our results suggest that even if the corporate income tax is paid entirely by capital income, the reform would make the tax system more progressive...|$|R

Some stock market analysts have argued that the market is overvalued at this level. We use standard economic theory and find that the market is correctly valued. In theory, the market value of equity plus debt liabilities should equal the value of productive assets plus debt assets. Since the net value of debt is currently low, the market value of equity should be approximately equal to the market value of productive assets. We find that the market value of productive assets is roughly 1. 8 GNPs and is therefore in line with the market value of equity. ...|$|E

40|$|During the 1990 s {{the assets}} of {{corporate}} defined-benefit (DB) pension plans ballooned {{as a result of}} the booming stock market. Because of accounting rules for DB plans put in place in 1986, this robust growth provided a substantial, although stealthy, boost to the profits reported by sponsoring corporations. In particular, the extraordinary returns earned on pension assets flowed to the bottom line on corporate income statements through lower net pension cost accruals included in general corporate expenses. These developments may have misled many investors about the value of <b>corporate</b> <b>equities,</b> because pension cost accruals provide a fairly con-voluted signal of the underlying value of net pension assets, in two ways. First, the accounting rules allow firms to smooth the effect of volatility in asset returns in calculating net pension expense; this smoothing both hides the variation inherent in the realizations of risky returns and tends to make current accruals of pension cost a stale measure of a pensio...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{corporate}} taxation on firm behavior have been extensively {{discussed in the}} neoclassical model of firm behavior which abstracts from agency problems. As emphasized by the corporate governance literature, corporate investment behavior is however crucially influenced by diverging interests between shareholders and managers. We set up an agency model and analyze the crucial issue in corporate taxation of whether the normal return on investment should be exempted from taxation. The {{findings suggest that the}} divergence of interests may be intensified and welfare reduced if the corporate tax system exempts the normal return on investment from taxation. The optimal system may well use the full return on investment as a tax base. Hence, tax systems such as an Allowance for <b>Corporate</b> <b>Equity</b> (ACE) or a Cash-flow tax do not have the familiar efficiency-enhancing effects in the presence of corporate agency problems. corporate taxation, corporate governance, allowance for <b>corporate</b> <b>equity,</b> comprehensive business income tax, cash flow tax...|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} divided into four broad parts, {{beginning}} with an exploratory {{analysis of the data}} on expost returns on <b>corporate</b> <b>equities</b> and bonds for the 1926 - 80 period. In Part 2, we estimate the relationships between one-month expost returns on corporate bonds and equities andvariations in Treasury bill rates, economic activity, and other variables. The major other variable is unanticipated changes in new issue coupon rates on long-term Treasury bonds. Parts 3 and 4 contain econometric investigations of the determinants of one-month Treasury bill rates and unanticipated changes in long-term Treasury coupon rates, respectively. These parts extend the analysis of Part 2 by explaining variables that determine expost corporate bond and equity returns and provide evidence on the determination of new-issue yields on short- and long-term default-free debt. The last three parts ofthe study report econometric results based on data from the 1953 - 83 period. A number of important issues are addressed in the econometric parts of the paper. These include: the validity of the Modigliani-Cohn valuation-error hypothesis, the measurement of Merton's "excess return on the market", the relationship between real new-issue debt rates and real economic activity, and the usefulness of the Livingston survey data in explaining financial returns. ...|$|E
40|$|Proposals for {{mandatory}} private saving accounts {{differ in}} the degree of investment discretion that they provide to individual savers, and in their provisions for annuitization of accumulated assets. With respect to investment choices, some argue that individuals must be prevented from investing too conservatively, and earning low returns over their accumulation period, while others argue that individuals should be protected from recklessly investing their retirement assets. With respect to annuitization, there is concern that individuals might not choose annuities and would thereby expose themselves to a risk of outliving their assets in a privatized system. This paper draws on the existing experience with 401 (k) plans and other defined contribution pension plans to provide evidence on each of these issues. We find that the share of 401 (k) plan assets held in <b>corporate</b> <b>equities</b> has increased substantially in recent years. We are only able to provide limited evidence on participant asset management, since many 401 (k) plans have limited options in this regard. We do find, however, that a participant's education and income levels are related to asset allocation decisions, with less educated and lower income participants less inclined to invest in equity securities. We also analyze a unique data base on TIAA-CREF participants and find several attributes of annuitization behavior that seem inconsistent with standard behavior in the lifecycle model. ...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{a general}} {{business}} tax in an uncertain economy. Our tax system {{allows for a}} time-dependent tax rate and to this end we incorporate a generalized allowance for <b>corporate</b> <b>equity</b> (ACE). The generalized allowance is given by {{a fraction of the}} product of interest rate and book value of the project and this fraction can be time-dependent. We determine conditions under which taking this tax into account does not distort investment decisions, i. e. under which the tax system will be neutral. To allow for investors with arbitrary risk attitude we make use of the martingale approach. We show that the after-tax capital market is arbitrage-free and complete if it is arbitrage-free and complete in a world without taxation. We furthermore derive a valuation equation under taxes that we use to specify neutral tax systems. Our tax system generalizes two well-known neutral tax systems: the taxation of economic rent and the tax with allowance on <b>corporate</b> <b>equity</b> as introduced by Boadway/Bruce (1979) and Wenger (1983).
