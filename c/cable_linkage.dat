40|$|Many {{metazoan}} cells inhabit mechanically stressful environments and, consequently, their plasma membranes {{are frequently}} disrupted. Survival {{requires that the}} cell rapidly repair or reseal the disruption. Rapid resealing is an active and complex structural modification that employs endomembrane as its primary building block, and cytoskeletal and membrane fusion proteins as its catalysts. Endomembrane is delivered to the damaged plasma membrane through exocytosis, a ubiquitous Ca 2 +-triggered response to disruption. Tissue and cell level architecture prevent disruptions from occurring, either by shielding cells from damaging levels of force, or, when this is not possible, by promoting safe force transmission through the plasma membrane via protein-based <b>cables</b> and <b>linkages.</b> Prevention of disruption also can be a dynamic cell or tissue level adaptation triggered when a damaging level of mechanical stress is imposed.

5000|$|The F-16's {{maneuverability}} {{was further}} enhanced by its slight aerodynamic instability. This technique, called [...] "relaxed static stability" [...] (RSS), {{was made possible}} by introduction of the [...] "fly-by-wire" [...] (FBW) flight control system (FLCS), which in turn was enabled by advances in computers and system integration techniques. Analog avionics, required to enable FBW operations, became a fundamental requirement and began to be replaced by digital flight control systems {{in the latter half of}} the 1980s. Likewise, Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) to electronically manage powerplant performance was introduced with the Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan. The F-16's sole reliance on electronics and wires to relay flight commands, instead of the usual <b>cables</b> and mechanical <b>linkage</b> controls, earned it the sobriquet of [...] "the electric jet". Electronic FLCS and FADEC quickly became essential components of all subsequent fighter designs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{the current}} era of {{globalization}} every prosperous nation {{in this world}} wishes to develop a fast moving aircraft with a high lift coefficient and low drag coefficient, which helps them to enhance their military force and strengthens its civilization’s foundation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the viscous, incompressible and steady-state flow over the F- 16 aircraft using computer modelling techniques and to compare the modelled results with the experimental results done with the help of wind tunnel. This paper outlines the development of a computational model of the F- 16 model in modelling software and then the creation of a finite computational domain, segmentation of this domain into discrete intervals, application of the boundary condition such as Mach number or velocity and then obtaining the plots and results for coefficient of pressure, lift coefficient, drag coefficient, etc. The aircraft being a military aircraft travels at speed of Mach 2, which is around 1, 500 mph at an altitude of 50, 000 ft. This paper will give the future generation to think in a manner to develop the aerospace field and the CFD field too. The pilot has excellent flight control of the F- 16 through its "fly-by-wire " system. Electrical wires relay commands, replacing the usual <b>cables</b> and <b>linkage</b> controls. For easy and accurate control of the aircraft during high G-force combat manoeuvres, a side stick controller is used instead of the conventional centre-mounted stick. Hand pressure on the side stick controller sends electrical signals to actuators of flight control surfaces such as ailerons and rudder...|$|R
30|$|However, {{most of the}} {{research}} is conducted in a laboratory, and the issue is a loss of collaboration with the technology due to its multidisciplinary nature and the lack of adequate budget. There have been several samples of prosthetic hands, ranging from body-powered prosthesis to myoelectric hand, being manufactured and attempted in the commercial and for research. The choice of artificial hand is based on the necessity of the amputees. As usual, the prosthesis device actuator could be body-powered, pneumatic-powered, or electric-powered [2]. The body-powered artificial hand has the capability to actuate by muscles to direct the <b>cable</b> through a <b>linkage.</b> The benefits of body-powered prostheses are that they are cheaper and less expensive to fix. However, those prostheses are not cosmetically outward and are hard to operate with body power by some amputees. The electric-powered prosthetic hands that are battery-operated are utilized by the disabled due to their cosmetic appearance. However, these prostheses are costly. The disadvantage of battery-operated prostheses is extra weight and expense to maintenance. Although this happens a breakthrough in the operation of electric-powered prosthetic devices similarly, some disadvantages exist yet. These powered prosthetic hands must be operated by a pressure resistor, micro-switch, strain gauge, electromyogram signals (EMG), and electroencephalogram signals (EEG). There is a possibility of hybrid control method to improve the functionality of the devices.|$|R

5000|$|The early {{production}} R5 used a dashboard-mounted gearshift, {{linked by}} a rod which ran {{over the top}} of the engine to a single bend where the rod turned downwards and linked into the gearbox, which was positioned directly in front of the engine. A floor-mounted lever employing a <b>cable</b> <b>linkage</b> replaced this arrangement in 1973. An automatic version, with the larger 1,289 cc engine, was added in early 1978. At the time, the automatic usually represented just under five percent of overall Renault 5 production. Door handles were formed by a cut-out in the door panel and B-pillar. The R5 was one of the first cars produced with plastic (polyester and glass fibre) bumpers, which came from a specialist Renault factory at Dreux. These covered a larger area of potential contact than conventional car bumpers of the time and survived low speed parking shunts without permanently distorting. This helped the car gain a reputation as an [...] "outstanding city car", and bumpers of this type subsequently became an industry standard.|$|E

40|$|Ohio State and Stanford Universities are {{cooperating}} {{to better}} understand quadrupedal galloping through {{the design of a}} self-contained quadrupedal robot. The leg for this quadruped was first designed at Ohio State University (OSU). A second-generation leg is being tested at Stanford University. The Stanford leg incorporates important characteristics of a quadruped leg. These characteristics are grouped into three categories: biomimetic design, design for simulation and control, and design for experimentation. Important biomimetic design characteristics include minimal impact loss, elastic energy storage, and low inertia. Important characteristics for simulation and control include freedom from tether forces, high structural rigidity, and uncoupled actuation. To facilitate experimentation, the leg should resist the vibration of constant galloping, and be rapid to fabricate. The Stanford leg design is intended to improve on the OSU leg design with respect to these characteristics. Two improvements are most significant. The <b>cable</b> <b>linkage,</b> which works against a large spring to flex the knee, has been uncoupled from the front-to-back hip actuator. By using design and construction techniques common to the light aircraft industry, the stiffness of the leg structure has increased while the mass of the leg has remained constant. ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Mobility is something able-bodied people take for granted. Approximately 132, 500 people in the United Kingdom have disabilities which permanently confine them to a wheelchair; 40, 000 of these require a powered wheelchair. The opportunity to lead a normal life and be accepted as an equal by the able-bodied population is limited by their reduced mobility. As much freedom of movement as possible is therefore crucial for these people. Powered wheelchair users' mobility depends upon the manoeuvrability of the chair. For optimum manoeuvrability a chair must be capable of moving in any direction. Currently no omni-directional powered wheelchairs are commercially available. This thesis describes the design and deVelopment of a powered base unit for a wheelchair, controlled to instantaneously move in any direction. The novelty is principally represented by the innovative design and configuration of four omni-directional roller wheels* (LUMAN wheels) which, when individually controlled, produce the omni-directional movement of the base unit. Further novelty within the design {{is a set of}} bi-directional angled roller couplings that simultaneously disengage the wheels from the motors, via a <b>cable</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism, and simple control system. Mathematical data models illustrate the theoretical performance of the wheel configuration, and a prototype base unit is tested to prove these hypotheses...|$|E
