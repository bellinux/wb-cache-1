5000|$|Although the CCT can be {{calculated}} for any chromaticity coordinate, the result is meaningful only if the light sources are nearly white. The CIE recommends that [...] "The concept of correlated color temperature {{should not be used}} if the chromaticity of the test source differs more than [...] from the Planckian radiator."Beyond a certain value of , a <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> may be equidistant to two points on the locus, causing ambiguity in the CCT.|$|R
50|$|The {{readings}} {{by themselves}} are typically not as useful as their tristimulus values, {{which can be}} converted into <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> and manipulated through color space transformations. For this purpose, a spectrocolorimeter may be used. A spectrocolorimeter is simply a spectrophotometer that can estimate tristimulus values by numerical integration (of the color matching functions' inner product with the illuminant's spectral power distribution). One benefit of spectrocolorimeters over tristimulus colorimeters {{is that they do}} not have optical filters, which are subject to manufacturing variance, and have a fixed spectral transmittance curve—until they age. On the other hand, tristimulus colorimeters are purpose-built, cheaper, and easier to use.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{sensitivity}} of colorimetric technique in phytodiagnostics, with particular regard to color variations caused by water stress, and to verify the potential for use in irrigation timing of horticultural crops, water stress was induced on two-year-old, container-grown Citrus macrophylla and Citrus paradisi cv. Star Ruby plants {{in the third year}} after grafting. Measurements on plant leaves were preceded by a test of the colorimeter with the aim of evaluating the accuracy of the instruments and to point out possible drift effects due to prolonged use. The trend of colorimetric and xylematic pressure potential values over time were measured on leaf samples. Color of well-watered plant leaves showed very small variations while unwatered plant leaves presented a wide change in color. In addition water stress determined an increase in both the dominant wavelength and the saturation. The <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> y and z and the index (x+y) /z showed the best sensitivity in discriminating color variations. Moreover, clear correlations between xylematic pressure potential and <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> were found. Use of colorimetric technique may improve the possibilities for irrigation management, with particular regards to irrigation timing...|$|E

Progress towards achieving a high efficiency, long‐lived saturated blue PHOLED is discussed. First, a high efficiency (20 % EQE, 45 cd/A), light blue (0. 17, 0. 39) PHOLED is presented. Next, long‐lived blue PHOLEDs having <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co‐ordinates</b> (0. 17, 0. 38) and (0. 16, 0. 29) are estimated to degrade to half their initial luminance of 200 cd/m 2 after > 100, 000 hrs and 17, 500 hrs, respectively.

40|$|The {{spectral}} power {{distributions of}} the flames produced {{by a number of}} pyrotechnic compositions has been examined in the waveband 400 to 1000 nanometers. To do this a rapid scanning Perkin Elmer Model 108 monochromator was modified and operated as a spectroradiometer at 2 1 / 2 scans per second through the waveband. The spectral power distributions are presented in graphical form together with tabulations of their luminous intensities and <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> There is also a discussion on the probable assignments of line and band structure observed in the spectra to species present in the flame. At these scanning speeds, it was evident from the spectral power distributions that the power radiated by the flame varied in a periodic manner. An attempt has, therefore, been made to relate existing theories of stable and unstable combustion to the processes occurring in pyrotechnic flames...|$|E

Detailed optical spectroscopic {{studies of the}} glassy material were {{carried out in the}} UV–Vis-NIR spectral range. Using the optical absorption spectra Judd-Ofelt (JO) parameters are derived. The calculated values of the JO parameters are utilized in evaluating the various radiative parameters such as electric dipole line strengths (Sed), radiative transition probabilities (Arad), radiative lifetimes (τrad), fluorescence branching ratios (β) and the integrated absorption cross- sections (σa) for stimulated emission from various excited states of Sm 3  +‡ ion. The principal fluorescence transitions are identified by recording the fluorescence spectrum. Our analysis revealed that the novel glassy system has the optimum values for the key parameters viz. spectroscopic quality factor, optical gain, stimulated emission cross section and quantum efficiency, which are required for a high performance optical amplifier. Calculated <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> (0. 61, 0. 38) also confirm its application potential in display devices...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} scheelite-type Eu 3 +-activated CaMoO 4 {{phosphors}} were synthesized by the nitrate-citrate gel combustion method. All the compounds crystallized in the tetragonal structure with space group I 4 (1) /a (No. 88). FESEM results reveal the spherical-like morphology. The CaMoO 4 phosphor exhibited broad emission centered at 500 nm under the excitation of 298 nm wavelength, while Eu 3 +-activated CaMoO 4 shows an intense characteristic red emission peak at 615 nm at different excitation wavelengths, due to D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (2) transition of Eu 3 + ions. The intensities of transitions between different J levels {{depend on the}} symmetry of the local environment of Eu 3 + ions and were estimated using the Judd-Ofelt analysis. The high asymmetric ratio revealed that Eu 3 + occupies sites with a low symmetry and without an inversion center. The CIE <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> (x, y) were calculated from emission spectra, and the values were close to the NTSC standard. Therefore, the present phosphor is highly useful for LEDs applications...|$|E
40|$|Efficient ZnO:Eu 3 + (1 - 11 mol%) nanophosphors were {{prepared}} {{for the first time}} by green synthesis route using Euphorbia tirucalli plant latex. The final products were well characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), etc. The average particle size of ZnO:Eu 3 + (7 mol%) was found to be in the range 27 - 47 nm. With increase of plant latex, the particle size was reduced and porous structure was converted to spherical shaped particles. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicated that the peaks situated at similar to 590, 615, 648 and 702 nm were attributed to the D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (j(j= 1, 2, 3, 4)) transitions of Eu 3 + ions. The highest PL intensity was recorded for 7 mol% with Eu 3 + ions and 26 ml plant latex concentration. The PL intensity increases with increase of plant latex concentration up to 30 ml and there after it decreases. The phosphor prepared by this method show spherical shaped particles, excellent <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> in the white light region which was highly useful for WLED's. Further, present method was reliable, environmentally friendly and alternative to economical routes. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The effect of Fe 3 + ions on luminescence properties of MgO was studied and results were discussed in detail. The phosphors exhibit strong red emission upon 378  nm (6 A 1 (6 S)  →  4 E(4 G)) excitation. The characteristic photoluminescence (PL) peaks recorded at ∼ 513, 618 and 720  nm were attributed to transition of 4 E +  4 A 1 (4 G) → 6 A 1 (6 S), 4 T 2 (4 G) → 6 A 1 (6 S), 4 T 1 (4 G) → 6 A 1 (6 S) respectively.

The intensity of red emission was attributed to intrinsic defects, especially oxygen-vacancies, which could assist the energy transfer from the MgO host to the Fe 3 + ions.

40|$|Photoluminescence and {{photocatalytic}} {{properties of}} Eu-doped ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by facile phyto route. XPS results demonstrated {{the existence of}} Eu 3 + as dopant into ZnO. Morphologies of the NPs were mainly dependent on Eu 3 + and Aloe vera gel. Red shift of energy band gap {{was due to the}} creation of intermediate energy states of Eu 3 + and oxygen vacancies in the band gap. PL emission of ZnO:Eu 3 + (1 - 11 mol%, 8 ml and 7 mol%, 2 - 12 ml) exhibit characteristic peaks of D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (2) transitions. From the Judd-Ofelt analysis, intensities of transitions between different. ' levels dependent on the symmetry of the local environment of Eu 3 + ions. CIE <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> confirm reddish emission of the phosphor. Further, NPs exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B (94 %) under Sunlight was attributed to crystallite size, band gap, morphology and oxygen vacancies. In addition, photocatalyst reusability studies were conducted and found that Eu-doped catalyst could be reused several times with negligible decrease in catalytic activity. The present work directs new possibilities to provide some new insights into the design of new phyto synthesized nanophosphors for display devices, photocatalysts with high activity for environmental clean-up and solar energy conversion.

40|$|The {{investigation}} involves {{preparation and}} photoluminescence properties of CeO 2 :Eu 3 + (1 - 11 mol%) nano phosphors by eco-friendly green combustion route using Euphorbia tirucalli plant latex as fuel. The final product {{was characterized by}} powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Scanning electron microcopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The PXRD and SEM results reveals cubic fluorite phase with flaky structure. The crystallite size obtained from TEM {{was found to be}} similar to 20 - 25 nm, which was comparable to W-H plots and Scherrer's method. Photoluminescence (PL) emission of all the Eu 3 + doped samples shows characteristic bands arising from the transitions of D- 5 (0) -> F- 5 (J) (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) manifolds under excitation at 373 and 467 nm excitation. The D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (2) (613 nm) transition often dominate the emission spectra, indicating that the Eu 3 + cations occupy a site without inversion center. The highest PL intensity was recorded for 9 mol% Eu 3 + ions with 5 ml latex. PL quenching was observed upon further increase in Eu 3 + concentration. The international commission on illumination (CIE) <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> were calculated from emission spectra, the values (x, y) were very close to national television system committee (NTSC) standard values of pure red emission. The results demonstrate that the synthesized phosphor material could be very useful for display applications.

40|$|Lead {{tungsten}} tellurite (LTT) glasses doped with Pr 3 + (0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 mol%) ions {{were prepared}} by the conventional melt quenching technique. The glasses were characterized by X-ray diffraction, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra. The glassy nature of LTT host glass has been confirmed through XRD measurements. From the measured intensities of various absorption bands of these glasses, the three phenomenological Judd Ofelt (1 - 0) intensity parameters (Omega 2, Omega 4 and Omega 6) have been evaluated by using the standard as well as modified J-O theory. The J-O parameters measured from the modified J-O theory were used to characterize the absorption and luminescence spectra of these glasses. From this theory, various radiative properties like radiative transition probability (A(R)), total transition probability (A(T)), branching ratio (ss(R)) and radiative lifetime (tau(R)) have been evaluated for the fluorescent levels of Pr 3 + in these glasses. The emission spectra show five emission bands in visible region for which the effective band widths (Delta lambda(p)) and emission cross-sections (sigma(se)) have been evaluated. Among all the five emission transitions, a transition P- 3 (0) -> F- 3 (2) is more intense and falls in red region. The visible emission spectra, stimulated emission crosssections and branching ratios observed for all these glasses suggest the feasibility of using these glasses as lasers in red region. The CIE <b>chromaticity</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> were also evaluated from the emission spectra to understand the suitability of these materials for red emission.
