40|$|A {{research}} study {{was carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of different land uses on the water quality of Ruo River. Water sampling was done both in the upper and the middle sections of the river. The water samples were analysed for pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), sulphates, <b>chloride,</b> <b>bicarbonates,</b> nitrates, phosphates, fluoride, sodium, potassium, cadmium and Escherichia coli using standard methods. Land uses in the area significantly affected the concentration of EC, TDS, sulphates, potassium and sodium (p ≤ 0. 05) while pH, dissolved oxygen, <b>chloride,</b> <b>bicarbonates,</b> nitrates, phosphates and E-coli did not significantly fluctuate with land use changes in the area (p ≥ 0. 05). The effect of seasons was significant on pH, dissolved oxygen, phosphates, <b>chloride,</b> <b>bicarbonates</b> and sodium (p ≤ 0. 05) but not on electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, sulphates, nitrates, lead, potassium and e coli in Ruo River. The research recommends an integrated water resources management approach where all users and relevant stakeholders should take an active role in the conservation of Ruo River catchment in order to avoid further degradation of the catchment through different land uses...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{transport}} inhibitors on {{the movements of}} oxalate and chloride across the isolated short circuited rabbit colon were studied. Net oxalate absorption was shown in this species and was shown to be an energy dependent process as indicated by its sensitivity to 2 - 4 dinitrophenol (DNP) 10 (- 4) M. Mucosal addition of 4 -acetamido- 4 -isothiocyano- 2,-stilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid (SITS) 10 (- 4) M abolished the net flux of both oxalate and chloride. Acetazolamide (8 mM) in bicarbonate free buffer significantly reduced the mucosal to serosal flux of both anions. These results suggest that in rabbit colon, oxalate and chloride share a common transport pathway and implicate the <b>chloride</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> exchange system. This study also confirms that chloride absorption by the short circuited rabbit colon is an electrically silent process and presents evidence that suggests that chloride absorption is mediated by a <b>chloride</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> exchange system located in the apical membrane of absorbing colonic epithelial cells...|$|R

40|$|Strenuous {{exercise}} {{results in}} a marked blood acid-base disturbance which is accompanied by large increases in ventilation rate, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. : Recovery to normal resting values follows an,ex-ponential time course with a half-time of ~ 2 h for all parameters except Pa COi and ventilation rate. The latter return to normal by 30 min following the exercise period. Analysis reveals that there is initially a large discrepancy between the quantity of metabolic acids buffered in the blood and the blood lactate levels. The significance of this finding is discussed. Significant changes in the concentrations of <b>chloride,</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> and lactate, in both plasma and erythrocytes, accompany the blood acid-base disturbance. <b>Chloride</b> and <b>bicarbonate</b> appear to be passively distributed between the two com-partments according to a Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium whereas lactate only slowly permeates the erythrocyte...|$|R

50|$|Results {{published}} in the journal Science after the mission ended reported that <b>chloride,</b> <b>bicarbonate,</b> magnesium, sodium potassium, calcium, and possibly sulfate were detected in the samples. Perchlorate (ClO4), a strong oxidizer, was confirmed to be in the soil. The chemical when mixed with water can greatly lower freezing points, {{in a manner similar to}} how salt is applied to roads to melt ice. Perchlorate may be allowing small amounts of liquid water to form on Mars today. Gullies, which are common in certain areas of Mars, may have formed from perchlorate melting ice and causing water to erode soil on steep slopes.|$|R

The Effluent Water (EW) of Zob-Ahan (steel industrial complex), were seasonally collected, three times during 48 h period. The soils, well-water and vegetable plant samples were collected in land irrigated with EW and soil in adjacent virgin lands. The EW EC, TDS, BOD, COD, sulfate, <b>chloride,</b> <b>bicarbonate,</b> N-NO 3 and Cd, Co and Cr were above permissible limit, for wells water in the down side of evaporation ponds EC, TDS, N-NO 3, sulfate, <b>chloride,</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> and concentration of Cu, Co, Fe and Cr were above permissible limit and the soils treated with EW Zn, Mn and Cd concentration were in critical range. Soils irrigated with EW had higher OC content and available concentration of Cd, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn and Pb compared to control sample (adjacent virgin land). In vegetable plants, all measured heavy metals concentration (except Cu content in Taree Irani that was in critical rang) was in normal range. The heavy metals concentration in unwashed plant samples were higher than washed ones. The results showed that Zob-Ahan EW has limitation for application as irrigation water, discharge into surface and subsurface water. Therefore, the EW, should properly be treated before discharging into environment. The heavy metals in soil and well-water affected by EW and irrigated plants with EW should regularly and closely be monitored...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of ion and pH {{homeostasis}} {{is essential}} for normal neuronal function. The sodium-driven <b>chloride</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> exchanger NCBE (Slc 4 a 10), {{a member of the}} SLC 4 family of bicarbonate transporters, uses the transmembrane gradient of sodium to drive cellular net uptake of bicarbonate and to extrude chloride, thereby modulating both intracellular pH (pH(i)) and chloride concentration ([Cl(-) ](i)) in neurons. Here we show that NCBE is strongly expressed in the retina. As GABA(A) receptors conduct both <b>chloride</b> and <b>bicarbonate,</b> we hypothesized that NCBE may be relevant for GABAergic transmission in the retina. Importantly, we found a differential expression of NCBE in bipolar cells: whereas NCBE was expressed on ON and OFF bipolar cell axon terminals, it only localized to dendrites of OFF bipolar cells. On these compartments, NCBE colocalized with the main neuronal chloride extruder KCC 2, which renders GABA hyperpolarizing. NCBE was also expressed in starburst amacrine cells, but was absent from neurons known to depolarize in response to GABA, like horizontal cells. Mice lacking NCBE showed decreased visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in behavioral experiments and smaller b-wave amplitudes and longer latencies in electroretinograms. Ganglion cells from NCBE-deficient mice also showed altered temporal response properties. In summary, our data suggest that NCBE may serve to maintain intracellular <b>chloride</b> and <b>bicarbonate</b> concentration in retinal neurons. Consequently, lack of NCBE in the retina may result in changes in pH(i) regulation and chloride-dependent inhibition, leading to altered signal transmission and impaired visual function...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic prodiginine obatoclax shows {{promise as}} a {{potential}} anticancer drug. This compound promotes apoptosis of cancer cells, although the mechanism of action is unclear. To date, only the inhibition of BCL- 2 proteins has been proposed as a mechanism of action. To gain insight into other possible modes of action, we have studied the anion-binding properties of obatoclax and related analogues in solution, in the solid state, and by means of density functional theory calculations. These compounds are well suited to interact with anions such as <b>chloride</b> and <b>bicarbonate.</b> The anion-transport properties of the compounds synthesized were assayed in model phospholipid liposomes by using a chloride-selective-electrode technique and 13 C?NMR spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that these compounds are efficient anion exchangers that promote <b>chloride,</b> <b>bicarbonate,</b> and nitrate transport through lipid bilayers at very low concentrations.

40|$|The {{different}} {{mechanisms of}} acidosis buffering were investigated in 15 RDT patients dialyzed in cross-over with four depurative techniques: acetate dialysis (AD), bicarbonate dialysis (BD), lactate hemofiltration (LHF) and hemodiafiltration (HDF) with acetate bath and lactate reinfusion fluid. Blood pH, bicarbonate, blood gases, intraerythrocytic pH - on red cell h em olisates - an ion gap, L-lactate, pyruvate, adenosinmonophosphate (ADP) and 2 - 3 Diphosphoglycerate (2 - 3 DPG) levels were evaluated. During AD the intradialytic buffering is initially {{achieved by the}} CO 2 fall and later by the acetate metabolism and an important <b>bicarbonate</b> <b>shift</b> from the intra to the extracellular space. A physiological compensation is obtained during BD with bicarbonate administration and a mild ventilatory response to the pCO(2) increase. In LHF the massive lactate administration, with plasma levels of 7 mmol/l, strongly alters the Central Nervous System elettroneutrality inducing a hyperventilatory response with a purely pulmonary acidosis buffering. Furthermore the lactate/pyruvate ratio rose as high as 40 : 1 with ADP increase and cellular energy depletion. in HDF several different mechanisms are associated: the CO 2 fixation, the acetate muscular metabolism, the intra-extracellular <b>bicarbonate</b> <b>shift</b> with the pulmonary response driven by lactate Central Nervous System penetration...|$|R

40|$|Using a triple-lumen {{constant}} perfusion system, {{the following}} observations {{were made in}} normal subjects. First, <b>chloride,</b> <b>bicarbonate,</b> and sodium were found to exhibit net movement across ileal mucosa against electrochemical gradients. Second, during perfusion with a balanced electrolyte solution simulating plasma, the ileum generally absorbed, but sometimes secreted fluid. A reciprocal net movement of <b>chloride</b> and <b>bicarbonate</b> was noted when sodium movement was zero. Increasing rates of sodium absorption were associated with decreasing bicarbonate secretion rates and finally bicarbonate absorption. Even when bicarbonate was absorbed ileal contents were alkalinized (by contraction of luminal volume). Third, net chloride movement {{was found to be}} sensitive to bicarbonate concentration in ileal fluid. For instance, chloride was absorbed from solutions containing 14 or 44 mEq/liter of bicarbonate, but was secreted when ileal fluid contained 87 mEq/liter of bicarbonate. Fourth, when chloridefree (sulfate) solutions were infused, the ileum absorbed sodium bicarbonate and the ileal contents were acidified. Fifth, when plasma-like solutions were infused, the potential difference (PD) between skin and ileal lumen was near zero and did not change when chloride was replaced by sulfate in the perfusion solution...|$|R
