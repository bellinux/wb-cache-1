5|$|Very little {{improvisation}} {{took place}} during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> for the film. Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar {{near the end of the}} film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required stitches.|$|E
5|$|At the 1920 elections, {{domestic}} interests aligned {{against those}} of the BSAC, rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government. The run up to the 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious. For the Union were most of the leading citizens of Salisbury and Bulawayo, the British, South African and Rhodesian presses, the BSAC, and the British government. Against them was the Responsible Government Association, founded in 1917 by Ethel Tawse Jollie. Wallis, in his biography of Coghlan, One Man's Hand, gives him {{the credit for the}} victory of the responsible government lobby. Lewis Hastings, reviewing Wallis's book, recalls campaigning with Coghlan and says that he was the undisputed leader of the movement—highly competent, with a <b>clear</b> <b>vision,</b> principled and sincere. He attributes Coghlan's resolve to his years in Kimberley, where he experienced the autocratic rule of the De Beers mining company, owned by the BSAC.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn's {{hardware}} {{was new to}} the team, and it {{was their}} first attempt at creating an original environment. It was also Futatsugi's first year working as a full developer at Sega, so he was only able to do simple things while having a <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> of what he wanted, which helped him to keep the overall style pure, with stark and minimalist cutscenes. Similarly, Iwade kept the enemies easy to understand visually, with simple shapes, and this overall simple style ended up fitting well with the Saturn's hardware. Then, Team Andromeda set to work on elaborating an extensive back story, and Futatsugi, to be original and to avoid using Japanese or English, {{went so far as}} to create a new language for the game: a mix of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian. This was apparently inspired by the anime The Wings of Honneamise, of which team members were fans and which also features an invented language.|$|E

25|$|It {{is quite}} common for water to leak into the mask, which can be annoying, or {{interfere}} with <b>clear</b> <b>vision,</b> and the diver {{needs to be able}} to get rid of the water quickly and effectively. Reasons for the leakage include poor fit or fitting, leaking via head or facial hair, movement of the facial muscles causing temporary leaks, or impact of external objects against the mask, which may distort it temporarily, or move it so that it leaks, or in extreme cases dislodge it entirely from the diver's head.|$|E

25|$|Five {{crew members}} {{escaped from the}} cockpit through a 14-by-10-inch <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> panel, and two more through a gash in the {{fuselage}} in the crew compartment, the sole survivors of the accident. Holes were cut in the fuselage through which a stewardess and two passengers were removed, but the latter died before reaching a hospital, and the stewardess died later of her injuries. No {{attempt was made to}} use the emergency exits, and the main cabin door was jammed; at the inquiry a fire expert attached to the RAF stated that the door of the Constellation was the most difficult he had had to open in his 24-year firefighting career.|$|E

The game's creator, Ron Gilbert, departed from Lucas Arts after the second game. He stated on his blog that he had a <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> what the ending in the second game meant, how the story will develop from here, and that the story development Lucas Arts came up with in his absence was not close to his ideas.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Sharif {{announced}} that it would open unconditional talks with the Taliban, declaring them stakeholders rather than terrorists. The PML-N's conservative hardliners also chose to blame the US and NATO for causing terrorism in Pakistan. The peace effort was encountering problems before it had ever really begun. The Pakistani Taliban's Supreme Council released demands for a cease-fire, to also include the release of all its imprisoned militants and the withdrawal of the Pakistani military from all tribal regions. Former and current government officials criticised Sharif for not yet laying out a <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> of how the country should handle its more than 40 militant groups, many of them made up of violent Islamic extremists.|$|E

He is portrayed as a gentle spiritual man, far removed from the cold arrogance of Napoleon, but with a much <b>clearer</b> <b>vision</b> of the true nature of warfare.|$|R

50|$|Ready-made single-vision {{reading glasses}} go by many names, {{including}} over-the-counter glasses, ready readers, cheaters, magnifiers, non-prescription readers, or generic readers.

They are typically sold in retail locations such as pharmacies and grocery stores, but are also available in book stores and clothing retailers. They are available in common reading prescriptions in strengths ranging from +0.75 to +3.50 diopters.|$|R
25|$|Assuming that {{a problem}} exists, many have offered {{suggestions}} for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those suggestions are along three lines. The first is that the military must {{reach out to the}} civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military to find ways to talk to civilians, not the other way around. The second is that civilians must articulate a <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> of what they expect in terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|E
25|$|The PT-76 has {{a typical}} tank layout: the {{steering}} compartment at the front, the combat compartment {{in the center}} and the engine compartment at the back. The tank has a three-man crew, with the commander also acting as the radio operator and gunner. This reduces his effectiveness as an observer. The commander and loader stations are located inside the turret, the commander sits {{on the left side of}} the main gun and the loader sits on the right. They have a large oval shaped double hatch, which opens forwards on top of the turret. The driver sits in the center of the front of the hull and has a one piece hatch that opens to the right, with three vision blocks and periscopes located beneath the main gun at the top of the sloping glacis plate. Under the driver's seat, there is an emergency hatch that can be used by all crew members. At night, the center periscope is swapped for a TVN-2B night vision device which gives the driver <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> up to 60 meters.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of facial expressions and mouthing {{can be difficult}} to understand when an individual has a visual impairment. Such problems hinder the ability of people to understand stimuli and translate information pertaining to perception with their brain for analysis. Non-verbal communication is important in effective communication and elders with vision loss are more likely to misinterpret or read the other person's actions in a wrong way. Visual impairments also cause a loss in positive perceptions of the environment around them. This can lead to isolation and possible depression in elderly people. Macular degeneration is a common cause of vision loss in elderly people. It diminishes the macula of the eye, which is responsible for <b>clear</b> <b>vision.</b> It causes progressive loss of central vision and possible loss of colour vision. This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and growth of abnormal vessels around the retina causing the photoreceptors not to receive proper images. Though ageing almost always causes this, other possible effects and risk factors include smoking, obesity, family history and excessive sunlight exposure.|$|E
