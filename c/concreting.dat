5|$|By February {{the next}} year, {{construction}} had resumed. On 8 April 25men {{working on the}} bridge went on strike. This was of concern due to time dependent <b>concreting</b> being undertaken at that time. As the construction was considered unemployment relief, the constructing authority began to look for men who would do the work in their places. By 13 April, further details had emerged; {{the number of the}} men on strike was actually 32, and it had been caused by the alleged wrongful dismissal of three men who had left for their lunch break early. The strike continued until at least 21 April. Work had resumed by early May, and the bridge was reported as being a little over half completed at that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{redevelopment}} involved the demolition of the North Stand, the <b>concreting</b> of all terraces and the building a block of turnstiles around the upper section of the East Terrace. This work, begun in October 1981 and completed in 1986, reduced the capacity to 74,370 and cost £3 million. A second phase had been planned to begin in 1988, but the release of the Taylor Report caused the plans to be redrawn and the proposed costs escalated to £25 million. Scotland hosted the 1989 FIFA Under-16 World Cup, with the Scots contesting the final against Saudi Arabia at Hampden.|$|E
5|$|While {{state of}} the art materials-handling methods were used, in some {{instances}} labour-saving machinery worked beside operations intended to maximise the labour content. Sustenance workers were employed chiefly for on-site preparation, road construction, foundation excavation, clearing timber from the reservoir basin, and on some <b>concreting</b> operations. Skilled workers were required on the dam for fixing the formwork where the concrete was poured. These workers were probably employed at normal day labour rates, the main employment method used on the project. Bulk handling of cement was also used {{for the first time in}} Australia, this saw a significant saving as opposed to bagged cement which was the standard practice of the day.|$|E

5|$|Bootham Crescent was renovated {{over the}} summer of 1932; the Main and Popular Stands were built and {{terraces}} were banked up behind the goals. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, for York's 2–2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North. It was played before 8,106 supporters, and York's Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground. There were teething problems in Bootham Crescent's early years: attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons, and there were questions over {{the quality of the}} pitch. In March 1938 the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. The ground endured slight damage during the Second World War, when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End. Improvements were made shortly after the war ended, including the <b>concreting</b> of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End being completed.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} at the shareholders' annual meeting in September 1948 that York had purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075, with the club's finances in a strong position at the time. Bigger crowds were recorded {{around the country in}} the post-war period, and York achieved five-figure average attendances in 1948–49 and 1955–56. Over the late 1940s and early 1950s, <b>concreting</b> was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand, due to the efforts of the supporters' club, and the Shipton Street End. York reached the semi-final of the 1954–55 FA Cup, and two matches from this run were played at Bootham Crescent: the first-round match against Scarborough, which York won 3–2, and the fifth-round match against Tottenham Hotspur, which was won 3–1 before a crowd of 21,000. During the summer of 1955, the Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street, funded by profits gained from the FA Cup run and a stand extension fund.|$|E
5|$|The ground first {{hosted a}} match against First Division {{opposition}} on 12 January 1935 when York played Derby County in an FA Cup third-round match, which {{set a new}} club record attendance of 13,612. Attendance records were set at four successive stages of the 1937–38 FA Cup, culminating in the 28,123 attendance for the sixth-round match against Huddersfield Town on 5 March 1938. By now the ground's capacity was around 23,000, and seats were placed around the pitch to accommodate more fans. During the Second World War, the tunnel {{at the back of}} the Popular Stand was used as an air-raid shelter for pupils and staff of Shipton Street School. The ground was slightly damaged after the air-raid on York in April 1942, when houses along the Shipton Street End were bombed. Considerable improvements were made in the immediate post-war period. Deeper drainage and the <b>concreting</b> of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End were completed, and loudspeaking equipment was installed.|$|E

5|$|Local {{historian}} Yves le Maner {{was charged}} {{with the task of}} developing the project while a feasibility study was conducted into the possibility of completing some of the original excavation work to make the site safe for public access. The plans were approved in 1993 and the site was purchased by the Commune de Helfaut. The following year, the Conseil Général du Pas-de-Calais acquired the site. The 69-million-franc project (£7.5 million at 1997 prices) was largely underwritten by the Conseil Général, which provided 35 million francs, with another 17 million coming from the regional council. The European Union provided a further 12 million, the French State provided 3 million and the Saint-Omer municipal administration funded the remaining 1 million francs; a number of private shareholders were also involved. The Societé d'Equipement du Pas-de-Calais was contracted to carry out the development work, which involved excavating a further two metres (six feet) beneath the dome, clearing out and completing the unfinished <b>concreting</b> of some of the tunnels, building an exhibition centre and car park in the quarry floor and installing a lift to carry visitors up from the octagon to the dome.|$|E

25|$|On 11 June, it was {{discovered}} that the water level in the spent fuel pool was only one third of normal, and only part of the fuel rods were covered with water. This was probably the cause of the high radiation levels measured. This pool has also been used to dump equipment. On Sunday 19 June, the pool was refilled, to minimize the radiation and making it possible to work again at this place. On 21 June, the first stage of strengthening at the second floor in the building under the pool was finished: 32 steel columns 8 meters long with a weight of 40 tons each were placed at the second floor.

When opened in 1901, it had the third largest arch in Europe at that time. The bridge is built to the Melan System invented by Josef Melan, which gained popularity particularly in the United States and Germany because the bridges could be built without a supporting stage. Rigid truss arches made of iron are set into the reinforced concrete bridge. The load-bearing core of the bridge was the truss iron framework during construction.

40|$|Abstract — The use {{of super}} {{absorbent}} polymer (SAP) in <b>concrete</b> {{is proven to}} have many positive effects on the properties of <b>concrete</b> in its both stages; fresh <b>concrete</b> and hardened <b>concrete.</b> This study focuses {{on the use of}} an optimum amount of Sodium Polyacrylate as a super absorbent polymer in ordinary plain <b>concrete.</b> One of the major improvements that the SAP can contribute to the <b>concrete</b> is by providing internal water source. This internal water source acts as internal curing agent after the final setting of <b>concrete.</b> At the same time the SAP releases water at relatively slower rate at the fresh <b>concrete</b> stage. The SAP also provides additional voids in the <b>concrete</b> mass.
