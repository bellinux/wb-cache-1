60|$|It {{is hardly}} {{necessary}} again to repeat that, as {{in every other}} deductive science, verification a posteriori must proceed pari passu with deduction a priori. The inference given by theory as {{to the type of}} character which would be formed by any given circumstances must be tested by specific experience of those circumstances whenever obtainable; and the conclusions of the science as a whole must undergo a perpetual verification and correction from the general remarks afforded by common experience respecting human nature in our own age, and by history respecting times gone by. The conclusions of theory <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted,</b> unless confirmed by observation; nor those of observation, unless they can be affiliated to theory, by deducing them from the laws of human nature, and from a close analysis of the circumstances of the particular situation. It is the accordance of these two kinds of evidence separately taken—the consilience of a priori reasoning and specific experience—which forms the only sufficient ground for the principles of any science so “immersed in matter,” dealing with such complex and concrete phenomena, as Ethology.|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{and data}} analysts are {{sometimes}} {{faced with the}} problem of very small samples, where the number of variables approaches or exceeds the overall sample size; i. e. high dimensional data.

Looking specifically at the case of Wikipedia, and at how it is employed in scholarly research, this study contributes new knowledge about the potential role of user-generated information in science and innovation. This is done using a dataset collected from the Scopus research database, which is processed {{with a combination of}} bibliometric techniques and qualitative analysis. Results show {{that there has been a}} significant increase in the use of Wikipedia as a reference within all areas of science and scholarship. Wikipedia is used to a larger extent within areas like Computer Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities, than in Natural Sciences, Medicine and Psychology. Wikipedia is used as a source for a variety of knowledge and information as a replacement for traditional reference works. A thematic qualitative analysis showed that Wikipedia knowledge is recontextualised in different ways when it is incorporated into scholarly discourse. In general, one can identify two forms of framing where one is unmodalised, and the other is modalised. The unmodalised uses include referring to Wikipedia as a complement or example, as a repository, and as an unproblematic source of information. The modalised use is characterised by the invocation of various markers that emphasise - in different ways - that Wikipedia <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> automatically <b>trusted.</b> It has not yet achieved full legitimacy as a source...|$|R
5000|$|The sole survivor, {{associated}} with Warwick Castle, was made around 1290-1300. It is now {{preserved in the}} British Museum's collection. At some point, probably in the sixteenth century, it was converted into a violin-type instrument with a tall bridge, 'f'-holes and angled fingerboard; thus, the instrument's top <b>is</b> <b>not</b> representative of its original appearance. That instrument contributed to {{a great deal of}} confusion. It was labeled a violin in the 18th century, a gittern in the early 20th century and finally a citole, beginning after 1977. That confusion is itself illustrative of the confusion about the nature of citoles and gitterns; once the instruments and their traditions were gone, scholars in later centuries didn't know which images and sculpture went with which names from poetry and other literature. Additionally, scholars have translated passages {{in such a way that}} literature itself <b>can</b> <b>not</b> always <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b> One example cited by the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: a specific reference to the citole may be found in Wycliffe's Bible (1360) in 2 Samuel vi. 5: [...] "Harpis and sitols and tympane". However, the Authorized Version has psaltiries, and the Vulgate lyrae. The Britannica also supposed that the citole has been supposed to be another name for the psaltery, a box-shaped instrument often seen in the illuminated missals of the Middle Ages, also liable to confusion with the gittern. Whether the terms overlapped in medieval usage has been the subject of modern controversy. The controversy of citole versus gittern was largely resolved in a 1977 article by Lawrence Wright, called The Medieval Gittern and Citole: A Case of Mistaken Identity.|$|R

Cloak was possessed by Dormammu {{as part of a}} plot to capture Doctor Strange, Iron Fist, and White Tiger in a plot to power the Siege Perilous and invade Earth. With help from Dagger, Spider-Man was able to free Cloak from Dormammu's possession. Cloak and Dagger then help Spider-Man free Doctor Strange, Iron Fist, and White Tiger and defeat Dormammu.

40|$|Abstract—Access card {{authentication}} {{is critical}} and essential for many modern access control systems, {{which have been}} widely deployed in various government, commercial and residential environments. However, due to the static identification information exchange among the access cards and access control clients, it is very challenging to fight against access control system breaches due to reasons such as loss, stolen or unauthorized duplications of the access cards. Although advanced biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint and iris identification can further identify the user who is requesting authorization, they incur high system costs and access privileges <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> transferred among <b>trusted</b> users. In this work, we introduce a sensory-dataenhanced authentication for access control systems. By combining sensory-data obtained from onboard sensors on the access cards {{as well as the}} original encoded identification information, we are able to effectively tackle the problems such as access card loss and stolen. Our solution is backward-compatible with existing access control systems and significantly increases the key spaces for authentication. We theoretically demonstrate the potential key space increases with simple sensor data and empirically demonstrate simple rotations can increase key space by more than 30, 000 times with an authentication accuracy of 95 %. We performed extensive simulations under various environment settings and implemented our design on WISP to experimentally verify the system performance. I...|$|R
40|$|Mortality case {{registration}} {{is one of}} the oldest statistical data keeping, more for the legal reasons. Mortality statistical data are used for demographic and health purposes, if they classified and adjusted for factors such as age, gender, etc. Deficiencies in mortality registration are absence of descriptive factors, absence of some case reports, inaccuracy in reported cases, and changes of description of the cause of disease in time. Specificities of mortality are: age, gender, and disease. Of the age related one, three categories are the most important, children under the age of one, 1 - 4 years group, and relative death rate, that is, percentage of death related to the group of over 50 years. In present time, the mortality specific data are based on reports on the Ministry of Health which is obtained from the reports of the cemeteries in Tehran and several large cities. According to these reports, children mortality in the large cities is 29 to 145 in 1000. Independent studies in the rural areas showed this rate to be 112. 8 to 217 in 1000. Reported figures for the mortality rate of 1 - 4 years old age group in the large cities vary from 281 to 2206 per 1000. The reason for this difference is considered to be the deficiencies in the methods of reports of the regions. In all reported figures, the sex related group showed higher mortality rate in men, but due to deficiencies of the system of registration, this difference <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> considered real. The more important causes of death in Iran are related to malnutrition and infections. Sources of data for determination of morbidity rates are consistent reports of the contagious diseases, registration of all cases of chronic and non contagious diseases, and collection of data from the people as morbidity survey. In Iran, most of the cases <b>are</b> <b>not</b> reported; also, diagnoses are mostly on the bases of suspicions and guesses. For these reasons, the published statistical data and their variations <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> scientifically <b>trusted.</b> In the registration of a disease, only the important case of cancer registration in the north of Iran has been continued for some years as a research project, with successful results. Of the morbidity surveys, the health and diseases investigation project in Roudsar, the Bilharziosis studies in Khuzestan, national Malaria studies, and dermal Leishmaniasis, trachoma and dermal fungal diseases can be mentioned. These studies have produced relatively reliable data on the prevalence and appearance of the diseases, helping the control programs of these diseases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{the real}} world, {{cryptographic}} computations are often performed {{on a relatively}} insecure device which <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> to maintain secrecy of the secret key. Exposure of secret keys {{is perhaps the most}} debilitating attack on a cryptosystem since it implies that all security guarantees are lost. The notion of forward security guarantees that the compromise of current secret keys does not compromise past secret keys and past communications. Therefore, it can minimize the resulting damage caused by the exposure of secret keys, and provides a promising approach to deal with the secret key exposure. In this paper, we present an efficient forward-secure public-key encryption scheme and prove it to be secure in the standard model. Most of the performance parameters of our proposed scheme are independent on the total number of time periods. When compared with the previous scheme, our scheme is much more efficient.
