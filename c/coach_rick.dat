5|$|Edler {{plays in}} the style of an {{offensive}} defenseman. One of his strongest offensive assets is his slapshot. At the Canucks' 2008 SuperSkills event, he beat the team's reigning hardest shooter, Sami Salo, with a 99.3 mile-per-hour shot and has gone on to win the competition in 2009 and 2010, as well. He is also known for his poise and confidence with the puck, allowing him to make strong first passes out of the defensive zone to forwards. Many within the Canucks organization, such as Assistant <b>Coach</b> <b>Rick</b> Bowness, have asserted this as a reflection of his calm off-ice demeanor.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Academy won {{the contest}} 8-0, {{which made it}} the Academy's first ever {{football}} victory, {{and was the first}} match in which they recorded points. It would remain the school's only victory until the 1884 season, and would remain as the last shutout for the school until 1886, when a squad defeated Johns Hopkins 6-0. Carter's single win gives him the second fewest in Navy football history, behind interim <b>coach</b> <b>Rick</b> Lantz. However, his undefeated record and perfect win percentage remain the highest ever for the academy.|$|E

Cunningham used the exposure and fundraising opportunities to build two apartment-style residence halls on campus, Davis and Bedford Halls, providing an alternative to dormitory and off-campus housing for upperclassmen.|$|E
5|$|One {{month before}} the Senators were to open the new Palladium, after three-straight last place finishes, and poor {{attendance}} at the Civic Centre, the Senators organization was in turmoil. Star player Alexei Yashin, angered that management favoured Daigle over him despite posting higher numbers, was a contract hold-out. First-round draft choice Bryan Berard, who had left the Senators training camp unsigned to a contract, had publicly stated {{that he would never}} report to the Senators.
