40|$|Purpose: The author {{compared}} monosyllabic Mandarin lexical tones {{produced by}} 3 -year-old Mandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in Taiwan {{and in the}} United States. Method: Following the procedures in Wong, Schwartz, and Jenkins (2005), the author collected monosyllabic tone productions from 3 -year-old Mandarin-speaking children in Taiwan and low-pass filtered them to eliminate lexical information but retain tone information. Five Mandarin-speaking adults residing in Taiwan categorized these filtered tones and those produced by the Mandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the United States, the latter of which was reported in Wong et al. (2005). Agreements on tone categorization by judges residing in Taiwan and in the United States were evaluated. Tone accuracy of <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in Taiwan and the United States were examined and compared. Results: The Mandarin-speaking judges residing in the United States and in Taiwan showed high agreements on tone categorization. None of the 4 tones produced by the Mandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the United States and in Taiwan was adultlike. Children in Taiwan made more errors in Tone 2 and Tone 4 than didMandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the United States. Accuracy rates of Tone 1 and Tone 3 were comparable in the 2 groups of children. Conclusion: Mandarin tone acquisition is a protracted process. Three-year-old Mandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in Taiwan and the United States show similar developmental patterns and have not yet produced monosyllabic tones with adultlike accuracy. postprin...|$|R

On the day of the NFL Draft, Jones wore a T-shirt that featured his grandmother's picture.|$|E

500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care {{to be far more}} important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to [...] "show love and affection" [...] to kids. [...] "Safety and protection" [...] came next, followed by [...] "moral guidance," [...] "taking time to play," [...] and [...] "teaching and encouraging." [...] "Financial care" [...] finished last. [...] Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, and because of that many men now {{have a better understanding of}} what life is like for their <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in modern society. [...] Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically [...] "manly" [...] attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.|$|E
500|$|As an only <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in what were, {{in all but}} name, palaces, her {{childhood}} {{appears to have been}} quite lonely. She was a companion to her hypochondriac mother and, in later life, a hostess with her father during her mother's long periods of indisposition. She was indulged by both parents and her formal education was neglected in favour of music and singing lessons, subjects in which she was accomplished. Her parents were very protective of her, attempting to ensure that she was never exposed to the risk of sickness or even the sight of poverty. As a result, she was never allowed to enter the cottages on the Rothschilds' estates. A cousin, who seems to have disliked her, claims that Hannah was so sheltered that the phrase [...] "the poor" [...] was just a meaningless euphemism to her. This is likely to be an exaggeration, as from her teens onwards she used much of her fortune to improve the lot of the poor, in housing and education. Whatever the faults of her education, she possessed great confidence, impressing her Rothschild relations, who noted her poise and competence when she hosted a large house party at Mentmore for the Prince of Wales while only 17 years of age.|$|E

500|$|Since the 1980s, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Wills played or observed an Aboriginal football game, Marngrook, as a <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the Grampians among the Djab wurrung, and incorporated some of its features into early Australian football. The theory has provoked intense debate, amounting to a controversy dubbed [...] "football's history wars". In her essay [...] "A Seductive Myth", published in the AFL's The Australian Game of Football Since 1858 (2008), Hibbins calls the proposed link an [...] "emotional belief" [...] lacking [...] "any intellectual credibility". She points out that neither Wills nor any of his fellow football founders mention Aboriginal games in existing documents, and states that there is no evidence of Marngrook being played in the vicinity where Wills grew up. Since then, among the personal papers of ethnographer Alfred William Howitt, an interview has been found with a Mukjarrawaint man who recalls playing Marngrook in the Grampians. Also, in his first-hand account of Aboriginal games, James Dawson, an Aboriginal rights activist, records the Djab wurrung word for football as [...] "Min'gorm". De Moore therefore argues that Marngrook was likely played around where Wills lived as a boy, [...] "or, at the very least, that the local Aboriginal people knew of such a game". That Wills knew of Marngrook, he adds, is speculative at best.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E
