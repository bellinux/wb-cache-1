One study indicated the conversion of p115 into p105 is activated by cell detachment through cytoskeletal regulation of phosphatase PP2A, although other work has found conflicting results.|$|E
5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the <b>centrosome</b> is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E

40|$|<b>Centrosomes</b> are {{the main}} microtubule-organizing centers in animal cells. During meiosis and mitosis, two <b>centrosomes</b> form the poles that direct the {{assembly}} of a bipolar spindle, thus ensuring the accurate segregation of chromosomes. Cells cannot tolerate the presence {{of more than two}} active <b>centrosomes</b> during meiosis or mitosis because doing so results in the formation of multipolar spindles, infidelity in chromosome segregation, and aneuploidy. Here, we show that fertilization of Spisula solidissima oocytes results in cells that contain three active <b>centrosomes,</b> two maternal and one paternal. During meiosis I, the paternal <b>centrosome’s</b> ability to nucleate microtubules is selectively shut off while maternal <b>centrosomes</b> remain competent to nucleate microtubules and assemble asters in the same cytoplasm. We propose that embryos can identify paternal vs. maternal <b>centrosomes</b> and can control them differentially...|$|R
40|$|Isolated <b>centrosomes</b> {{nucleate}} microtubules when incubated in pure tubulin solutions {{well below}} the critical concentration for spontaneous polymer assembly (approximately 15 microM instead of 60 microM). Treatment with urea (2 - 3 M) does not severely damage the centriole cylinders but inactivates their ability to nucleate microtubules even at high tubulin concentrations. Here we show that <b>centrosomes</b> inactivated by urea are functionally complemented in frog egg extracts. <b>Centrosomes</b> can then be reisolated on sucrose gradients and assayed in different concentrations of pure tubulin to quantify their nucleating activity. We show that the material that complements <b>centrosomes</b> is stored in a soluble form in the egg. Each frog egg contains enough material to complement greater than 6, 000 urea-inactivated <b>centrosomes.</b> The material is heat inactivated above 56 degrees C. One can use this in vitro system to study how the microtubule nucleating activity of <b>centrosomes</b> is regulated. Native <b>centrosomes</b> require approximately 15 microM tubulin to begin nucleating microtubules, whereas <b>centrosomes</b> complemented in interphase extracts begin nucleating microtubules around 7 - 8 microM tubulin. Therefore, the critical tubulin concentrations for polymer assembly off native <b>centrosomes</b> is higher than that observed for the <b>centrosomes</b> first denatured and then complemented in egg extracts. In vivo, the microtubule nucleating activity of <b>centrosomes</b> seems to be regulated by phosphorylation {{at the onset of}} mitosis (Centonze, V. E., and G. G. Borisy. 1990. J. Cell Sci. 95 : 405 - 411). Since cyclins are major regulators of mitosis, we tested the effect of adding bacterially produced cyclins to interphase egg extracts. Both cyclin A and B activate an H 1 kinase in the extracts. Cyclin A-associated kinase causes an increase in the microtubule nucleating activity of <b>centrosomes</b> complemented in the extract but cyclin B does not. The critical tubulin concentration for polymer assembly off <b>centrosomes</b> complemented in cyclin A-treated extracts is similar to that observed for <b>centrosomes</b> complemented in interphase extracts. However, <b>centrosomes</b> complemented in cyclin A treated extracts nucleate much more microtubules at high tubulin concentration. We define this as the "capacity" of <b>centrosomes</b> to nucleate microtubules. It seems that the microtubule nucleating activity of <b>centrosomes</b> can be defined by two distinct parameters: (a) the critical tubulin concentration at which they begin to nucleate microtubules and (b) their capacity to nucleate microtubules at high tubulin concentrations, the latter being modulated by phosphorylation...|$|R

Results supported the hypothesis of Mazia (1984), who proposed that <b>centrosomes</b> are 'flexible bodies'.

25|$|The {{number of}} MTs {{attached}} to one kinetochore is variable: in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one MT binds each kinetochore, whereas in mammals {{there can be}} among 15-35 MTs bound to each kinetochore. However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one kinetochore. There are MTs that extend from one <b>centrosome</b> to the other (and {{they are responsible for}} spindle length) and some shorter ones are interdigitated between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that kinetochore attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other <b>centrosome</b> will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one chromatid will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the kinetochore is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of error detection and correction (as the spindle assembly checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores.The movement of one chromatid towards the <b>centrosome</b> is produced primarily by MT depolymerization in the binding site with the kinetochore. These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} heat shock on <b>centrosomes</b> has been mainly studied in {{interphase}} cells. <b>Centrosomes</b> {{play a key}} role in proper segregation of DNA during mitosis. However, the direct effect and consequences of heat shock on mitotic cells and a possible cellular defense system against proteotoxic stress during mitosis have not been described in detail. Here, we show that mild heat shock, applied during mitosis, causes loss of dynamitin/p 5 O antibody staining from <b>centrosomes</b> and kinetochores. In addition, it induces division errors in most cells and in the remaining cells progression through mitosis is delayed. Expression of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 protects against most heat-induced division abnormalities. On heat shock, Hsp 70 is rapidly recruited to mitotic <b>centrosomes</b> and normal progression through mitosis is observed immediately after release of Hsp 70 from <b>centrosomes.</b> In addition, Hsp 70 expression coincides with restoration of dynamitin/p 50 antibody staining at <b>centrosomes</b> but not at kinetochores. Our data show that during mitosis, <b>centrosomes</b> are particularly affected resulting in abnormal mitosis. Hsp 70 is sufficient to protect against most division abnormalities, demonstrating the involvement of Hsp 70 in a repair mechanism of heat-damaged mitotic <b>centrosomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{forms and}} {{locations}} of <b>centrosomes</b> in mouse oocytes and in sea urchin eggs were followed {{through the whole}} course of fertilization and first cleavage by immunofluorescence microscopy. <b>Centrosomes</b> were identified with an autoimmune antiserum to centrosomal material. Staining of the same preparations with tubulin antibody and with the DNA dye Hoechst 33258 allowed the correlation of the forms of the <b>centrosomes</b> with the microtubule structures that they generate and with the stages of meiosis, syngamy, and mitosis. The results with sea urchin eggs conform to Boveri's view on the paternal origin of the functional <b>centrosomes.</b> <b>Centrosomes</b> are seen in spermatozoa and enter the egg at fertilization. Initially, the <b>centrosomes</b> are compact, but as the eggs enter the mitotic cycle the forms of the <b>centrosomes</b> go through a cycle in which they spread during interphase, apparently divide, and condense into two compact poles by metaphase. In anaphase, they spread to form flat poles. In telophase and during reconstitution of the daughter nuclei, the centrosomal material is disposed as hemispherical caps around the poleward surfaces of the nuclei. Mouse sperm lack centrosomal antigen. In the unfertilized mouse oocyte, the meiotic spindle poles are displayed as broad-beaded <b>centrosomes.</b> In addition, centrosomal material is detected in the cytoplasm as particles, about 16 in number, which are foci of small aster-like arrays of microtubules. The length and number of astral microtubules correlate {{with the size of}} the centrosomal foci. After sperm incorporation, as the pronuclei develop and more cytoplasmic microtubules assemble, a few of the foci associate with the peripheries of the nuclei. The number of foci multiplies during the first cell cycle. At the end of interphase, all of the centrosomal foci have concentrated on the nuclear peripheries and the cytoplasmic microtubules have disappeared. At prophase, the <b>centrosomes</b> are seen as two irregular clusters, marking the poles which, at metaphase and anaphase, appear as rough bands with foci, and the spindle is typically barrel-shaped. At telophase, the <b>centrosomes</b> are seen as arcs that lie on the nuclear peripheries after cleavage. The ordering of microtubules in all the stages reflects the shapes of the <b>centrosomes.</b> The findings on the sea urchin confirm the classical theory of the paternal origin of <b>centrosomes</b> and contrast with observations tracing the mitotic poles of the mouse egg to maternal centrosomal material. This evidence strengthens the conclusion that mouse <b>centrosomes</b> derive from the oocyte...|$|R
50|$|In early mitosis, several motor {{proteins}} {{drive the}} separation of <b>centrosomes.</b> With the onset of prophase, the motor protein, dynein, provides {{the majority of the}} force required to pull the two <b>centrosomes</b> apart.

Second, the <b>centrosomes</b> are separated via microtubules motor proteins.|$|R
25|$|During spermiogenesis, the {{spermatids}} {{begin to}} form a tail by growing microtubules {{on one of the}} centrioles, which turns into basal body. These microtubules form an axoneme. Later the centriole is modified in the process of <b>centrosome</b> reduction. The anterior part of the tail (called midpiece) thickens because mitochondria are arranged around the axoneme to ensure energy supply. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive. The Golgi apparatus surrounds the now condensed nucleus, becoming the acrosome.|$|E
25|$|The {{subcellular}} localization of the Golgi apparatus varies among eukaryotes. In mammals, {{a single}} Golgi apparatus is usually {{located near the}} cell nucleus, close to the <b>centrosome.</b> Tubular connections are responsible for linking the stacks together. Localization and tubular connections of the Golgi apparatus are dependent on microtubules. If microtubules are experimentally depolymerized, then the Golgi apparatus loses connections and becomes individual stacks throughout the cytoplasm. In yeast, multiple Golgi apparatuses are scattered throughout the cytoplasm (as observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In plants, Golgi stacks are not concentrated at the centrosomal region and do not form Golgi ribbons. Organization of the plant Golgi depends on actin cables and not microtubules. The common feature among Golgi {{is that they are}} adjacent to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.|$|E

SUMOylation of target proteins has been shown to cause a number of different outcomes including altered localization and binding partners. The SUMO-1 {{modification of}} RanGAP1 (the first identified SUMO substrate) leads to its trafficking from cytosol to nuclear pore complex. The SUMO modification of hNinein leads to its movement from the <b>centrosome</b> to the nucleus. In many cases, SUMO modification of transcriptional regulators correlates with inhibition of transcription. One can refer to the GeneRIFs of the SUMO proteins, e.g. human SUMO-1, to find out more.|$|E

500|$|NEDD9 binds {{directly}} to the Aurora-A mitotic kinase at the <b>centrosome,</b> and promotes its activity, allowing cells to enter mitosis. [...] Degradation of NEDD9 {{at the end of}} mitosis contributes to timely Aurora-A degradation. [...] Cell overexpressing NEDD9 exhibit deficient cytokinesis resulting in accumulation of multipolar mitotic spindles and abnormal numbers of centrosomes. On the other hand, cells with depleted NEDD9 have prematurely separated centrosomes and are deficient in microtubule organizing activity at mitosis leading to abundance of monopolar or asymmetric spindles, preventing cells from entering mitosis. NEDD9 also regulates Aurora-A activation at the basal body of cilia as cells resorb cilia during early G1. [...] Cilia are small organelles that protrude from the surface of adherent cells that are the obligate site of action for proteins such as Hedgehog, and the polycystins: by influencing ciliary stability, NEDD9 is positioned to affect these signaling systems. Interaction of NEDD9 with Aurora A kinase may also play a role in tumor invasion. NEDD9 binds to and regulates acetylation of cortactin (CTTN) in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6–dependent manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to F-actin. Overexpression of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells.

We recently showed that mitochondrial outer membrane porin VDAC 3 localizes to <b>centrosomes</b> where it negatively regulates ciliogenesis. We show here that the other two family members, VDAC 1 and VDAC 2, best known for their function in mitochondrial bioenergetics, are also found at <b>centrosomes.</b> Like VDAC 3, centrosomal VDAC 1 is predominantly localized to the mother centriole, while VDAC 2 localizes to centriolar satellites in a microtubule-dependent manner. Down-regulation of VDAC 1 leads to inappropriate ciliogenesis, while its overexpression suppresses cilia formation, suggesting that VDAC 1 and VDAC 3 both negatively regulate ciliogenesis. However, this negative effect on ciliogenesis is not shared by VDAC 2, which instead appears to promote maturation of primary cilia. Moreover, because overexpression of VDAC 3 cannot compensate for depletion of VDAC 1, our data suggest that while the entire VDAC family localizes to <b>centrosomes,</b> they have non-redundant functions in cilogenesis...|$|R

2500|$|During the {{synthesis}} phase (S phase) {{in the cell}} cycle, the <b>centrosome</b> starts to duplicate. Just {{at the beginning of}} mitosis, both centrioles in each <b>centrosome</b> reach their maximal length, centrosomes recruit additional material and their nucleation capacity for microtubules increases. As mitosis progresses, both centrosomes separate to establish the mitotic spindle. In this way, the spindle in a mitotic cell has two poles emanating microtubules. Microtubules are long proteic filaments with asymmetric extremes, a [...] "minus"(-) end [...] relatively stable next to the <b>centrosome,</b> and a [...] "plus"(+) end [...] enduring alternate phases of growing-shrinking, exploring the center of the cell. During this searching process, a microtubule may encounter and capture a chromosome through the kinetochore. Microtubules that find and attach a kinetochore become stabilized, whereas those microtubules remaining free are rapidly depolymerized. As chromosomes have two kinetochores associated back-to-back (one on each sister chromatid), when one of them becomes attached to the microtubules generated by one of the cellular poles, the kinetochore on the sister chromatid becomes exposed to the opposed pole; for this reason, most of the times the second kinetochore becomes attached to the microtubules emanating from the opposing pole, {{in such a way that}} chromosomes are now bi-oriented, one fundamental configuration (also termed amphitelic) to ensure the correct segregation of both chromatids when the cell will divide.|$|E

Pretreatment of the lysed cell preparations with control antibody or buffer without antibody had no effect on the ability of <b>centrosomes</b> and kinetochores to initiate microtubule assembly.

40|$|<b>Centrosomes</b> are the {{dominant}} sites of microtubule (MT) assembly during mitosis in animal cells, {{but it is}} unclear how this is achieved. Transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC) proteins stabilize MTs during mitosis by recruiting Minispindles (Msps) /XMAP 215 proteins to <b>centrosomes.</b> TACC proteins can be phosphorylated in vitro by Aurora A kinases, but the significance of this remains unclear. We show that Drosophila melanogaster TACC (D-TACC) is phosphorylated on Ser 863 exclusively at <b>centrosomes</b> during mitosis in an Aurora A-dependent manner. In embryos expressing only a mutant form of D-TACC that cannot be phosphorylated on Ser 863 (GFP-S 863 L), spindle MTs are partially destabilized, whereas astral MTs are dramatically destabilized. GFP-S 863 L is concentrated at <b>centrosomes</b> and recruits Msps there but cannot associate with the minus ends of MTs.

All 197 genes also produced RNAi phenotypes when <b>centrosomes</b> were present, indicating that none were entirely selective for the acentrosomal pathway. However, a subset of genes produced a selective defect in pole focusing when <b>centrosomes</b> were absent, suggesting that <b>centrosomes</b> compensate for this shape defect.
