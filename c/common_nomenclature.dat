500|$|According to Raymond L. Williams, it was {{not until}} the 1970s, when enough Latin American writers had {{published}} novels dealing with military regimes, that [...] "dictator novel" [...] became <b>common</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> The most celebrated novels of this era were Alejo Carpentier's Reasons of State (1974), Augusto Roa Bastos's I, the Supreme (1974), and Gabriel García Marquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975). He defines the dictator novel as a novel which draws upon the historical record to create fictionalized versions of dictators. In this way, the author is able to use the specific to explain the general, as many dictator novels are centred around the rule of a one particular dictator. Within this group he includes those novelists who took to task authoritarian figures such as Vargas Llosa's Conversation in the Cathedral (1969) and Denzil Romero's La tragedia del Generalísimo (1984). He even includes Sergio Ramírez's ¿Te dio miedo la sangre? (1977), a novel about Nicaraguan society under the Somoza dictatorship, which has been described as a [...] "dictator novel without the dictator".|$|E

40|$|Despite their {{importance}} in anatomy, physiology, pathology and surgery, the fasciae and the fascial spaces have been poorly described in classic textbooks. This little attention {{depends on the}} fact that these fasciae vary in thickness and composition, especially at the cervical level. Indeed, in the main literature they have been described in different forms. Furthermore, the definition itself of the fascia is not consistent in a variety of authors. As a consequence, different criteria have been used to define and classify the fascial systems. In this paper, a brief terminological history and the most <b>common</b> <b>nomenclatures</b> and classifications of the fascia have been summarized...|$|R

This study examines the consolidated financial statements of the top 170 listed companies in three major EU stock exchanges (UK, France and Germany) and uncovered a disparity in the use of <b>common</b> <b>nomenclatures.</b> The findings reveal that the inconsistencies in the application of terminologies such as statement of financial position instead of balance sheet and sequence of arrangement of assets in order of liquidity constitute the main differences for entities operating in the three countries.

This article makes several contributions by providing <b>common</b> <b>nomenclatures</b> and theoretical perspectives that are essential to promoting scientific progress in this area. It focuses mainly on empirical collaborative software studies in which culture is a key conceptual construct.

The Gene Ontology (GO) {{is now considered}} to be a great success in biology, a field that has already developed several extensive ontologies. Similar advantages could accrue to the simulation and modeling community. Ontologies provide a way to establish common vocabularies and capture domain knowledge for organizing the domain with a community wide agreement or with the context of agreement between leading domain experts. They can the be used to provide significantly improved (semantic) search and browsing, integration of heterogeneous information sources, and improved analytics and knowledge discovery capabilities. Such knowledge can be used to establish <b>common</b> vocabularies, <b>nomenclatures</b> and taxonomies with links to detailed information sources. In this paper, the design and development of a draft ontology for modeling and simulation called the Discreteevent Modeling Ontology (DeMO) are discussed, which can form a basis for achieving a broader community agreement and adoption. ...|$|R
