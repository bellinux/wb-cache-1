40|$|When {{goods are}} {{produced}} according to customers ’ specifications, the product complexity can vary at two levels. Specifically, customized products may have unique configurations, unique components, or both. The dimensions {{do not necessarily}} correlate with one another, which gives rise to different gestalts of complexity. In this paper, they are labeled as mass production, custo-mized production, and mass customization. The gestalts are used to analyze order management practices in 163 machinery manufacturing cases. The results show that available-to-promise veri-fications are essential in mass production, whereas project management is crucial in customized production. In mass customization, both practices are necessary. That finding challenges some of the conventional wisdoms about mass customization: as far as order management is concerned, mass customization (e. g., product modularization and component standardization) does not elim-inate the inherent complexity of producing according to unique specifications. Therefore, basic project management methods are important in all forms of <b>customized</b> <b>manufacturing...</b>|$|E

Some of the important planning problems that need realistic modelling and quicker solution especially in automated manufacturing systems have assumed greater significance in the recent past.
