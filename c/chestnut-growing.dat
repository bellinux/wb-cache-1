50|$|Candied {{chestnuts}} {{appeared in}} <b>chestnut-growing</b> areas in northern Italy and southern France {{shortly after the}} crusaders returned to Europe with sugar. Cooking with sugar allowed creation of new confectioneries. A candied chestnut confection was probably served around {{the beginning of the}} 15th century in Piedmont, among other places. But marrons glacés as such (with the last touch of 'glazing'), may have been created only in the 16th century. Lyon and Cuneo dispute the title for the addition of the glazing, or icing, that makes the real marron glacé.|$|E
5000|$|Phytophthora {{disease is}} the longest-known {{chestnut}} tree disease leading to tree death. Of {{the two main}} pathogens for this disease, the one in European chestnuts is known since 1971 to be Phytophthora cambivora. Phytophthora cinnamoni was discovered in chestnut trees in the United States in 1932. Both trigger similar symptoms. Since then, {{it has also been}} shown to occur in most European <b>chestnut-growing</b> countries. It is difficult to differentiate between the two pathogens. Chemicals seem of little effectiveness. Many countries impose strict prophylactic rules {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease.|$|E
5000|$|Huanggang has {{a diversified}} economy, ranging from bio- and herbal {{medicine}} to manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism. Since ancient times, Huanggang has been renowned for local specialties {{such as the}} [...] "Qichun Four Treasures" [...] (snake, turtle, bamboo, and moxa), Huangmei [...] "tiaohua" [...] embroidery, and Wuxue [...] "zhangshuiqian" [...] bamboo products. Today, Huanggang at large is recognized for organic vegetables. With its [...] "Guihuaxiang" [...] brand of chestnuts, Luotian is the leading <b>chestnut-growing</b> county in all of China. Yingshan {{is famous for its}} [...] "cloud mist" [...] green tea. Qichun, of course, is famous for herbal medicine. Macheng is a national model county for cattle breeding. Huangmei is a major center of freshwater shrimp and fragrant jade rice production. And Hongan peanut production ranks the first in Hubei Province.|$|E
40|$|The {{arrival and}} spread of {{chestnut}} blight, {{caused by the}} fungus Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr, in Caucasian Azerbaijan has compromised the livelihoods of chestnut farmers and is causing rapid genetic erosion {{in the center of}} diversity for the European chestnut, Castanea sativa Mill. In Azerbaijan, blight was first reported in 2008 and is currently present in all <b>chestnut-growing</b> regions. Fortunately, there is a demonstrated biological control technique which may be applied in the context of Europe and Eurasia. This presents an opportunity to simultaneously achieve environmental and genetic resource conservation goals while reinforcing the livelihoods and maintenance of diversity of the nation’s chestnut growers. However, national institutions primarily recognize the economic and genetic importance of certain elite crops, particularly those which were prominent production goods during the Soviet period. The present work was undertaken to characterize the socio-economic role of chestnut production and use in the communities where this crop is grown and sold. We investigate the monetary role of chestnut sales in the livelihoods of growers and collectors. It is hypothesized that while continuing to be a minor production good nationally, chestnut sales in a newly entrepreneurial agricultural sector have taken on tremendous livelihood importance to specific communities. The socio-economic importance of chestnut-based income to Azerbaijan’s <b>chestnut-growing</b> communities is illustrated by the results of in-depth household budget interviews from 22 <b>chestnut-growing</b> households in two villages...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and diversity}} of vegetative compatibility (vc) types in populations of Cryphonectria parasitica, the causal agent of chestnut blight, were examined throughout five <b>chestnut-growing</b> areas in central Sardinia (Italy). The hypovirulent strains of the pathogen were more frequently isolated with respect to virulent ones. Four vc types were identified among the 131 isolates, obtained from 150 randomly selected cankers (30 for each area) by means of European tester isolates (EU). EU- 12 and EU- 2 groups were the dominant vc types, reaching a percentage of 48, 9...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany {{different}} {{viruses that}} reduce virulence and alter the phenotype to varying extents {{have been identified}} in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica. Most viruses identified in this fungus fall within the Hypoviridae family of positive-sense RNA viruses, which contains one genus and four species. Different species predominate in different geographic locations in <b>chestnut-growing</b> areas around the world. In this paper, we describe the genome organization and some variants of Cryphonectria hypovirus 4 (CHV- 4), the species most commonly found in eastern North America. CHV- 4 is distinguished from other hypoviruses by having little effect on fungal virulence and colony morphology. The 9. 1 -kb genome of strain CHV- 4 /SR 2 is the smallest of any member of the family characterized to date. Like the recently characterized species CHV- 3, a single ORF was predicted from deduced translations of CHV- 4 /SR 2. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a putative glucosyltransferase domain in both CHV- 4 and in CHV- 3, but no such homolog was detected in the more thoroughly examined CHV- 1 or in CHV- 2. Alignments with 8 other CHV- 4 isolates from different regions of eastern North America revealed sequence diversity within the species and the likelihood that RNA recombination has led to this diversity...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{economic}} interest in the cultivation of chestnuts for both timber and nut production has resurfaced in the Mediterranean area. However, chestnut cultivation has suffered in recent years from the spread of exotic pests, such as the gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus, and from the resurgence of previously present diseases, most likely due to anomalous climate dynamics. This {{is the case with}} chestnut ink disease, caused by the soilborne pathogens Phytophthora cinnamomi and P. cambivora. Scientific and technical support in monitoring and management, that utilizes new forecasting approaches incorporating related environmental variables, is therefore essential. The main aim {{of this study was to}} develop a mathematical model assessing the potential for the establishment of chestnut ink disease at a large scale. Towards this goal, fuzzy rule-based theory was applied to the environmental variables associated with host presence, pathogens' ecological niches and ink disease symptoms expression. The effectiveness of the rule-based modelling outcomes, provided with uncertainty maps to facilitate their correct interpretation, was confirmed by detailed field data collected from a large <b>chestnut-growing</b> area where ink disease has been increasing in recent years. The final model gave consistent predictions for disease presence. For this reason, it represents a flexible and valuable decision-support tool to forecast which sites are at risk from CID. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH...|$|E
