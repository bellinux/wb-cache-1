40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{relation}} of social support to health outcomes. Support networks were found to be predictive of health status. Not so clear was the manner in which social support helped the individual to avoid health complications. Whereas some aspects of the support network were protective, others were burdensome. Duties to one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>network</b> could serve as a stressor and duties outside one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>network</b> might stress the support system itself. Exposure to one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>network</b> was associated with certain health risks while disruption in one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> social support <b>network</b> was associated with other health risks. ^ Many factors contributed to the impact of a social support network upon the individual member: the characteristics of the individual, the individual 2 ̆ 7 s role or position within the network, qualities of the network and duties or indebtedness of the individual to the network. This investigation considered the possibility that performance could serve as a stressor in a fashion similar to an exposure to a health hazard. ^ Because the literature includes many examples of studies in which the subjects were college students, academic progress is a performance common to most subjects. A profile of the support networks of successful students was contrasted with those of less successful students in this correlational study. ^ What was uncovered in this investigation was a very complex web of interrelated constructs. Most aspects of the social support network did not significantly predict academic performance. Only a limited number of characteristics were associated with academic success: the frequency of support, student age, the existence of a 2 ̆ 7 mentor 2 ̆ 7 within one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>network,</b> and the extent to which one received a predominant source of support. Other factors had a tendency to be negatively correlated with midterm grade, suggesting those factors may impede academic performance. ^ Medical status did not predict grades, but was correlated with many aspects of the network. Disruptions in particular parts of one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>network</b> were correlated with particular health categories. In fact, disruption in social support was more predictive of academic outcomes than medical complications. Whereas the individual 2 ̆ 7 s values were related to the contributing factors, only the individual 2 ̆ 7 s satisfaction with certain aspects of the support network were predictive of higher midterm grades in a psychology class. Dissatisfaction was associated with lower grades, suggesting a disruptive effect within the network. Associations among the features of support networks which predicted academic progress were considered. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{earliest}} days of broadcast television in the 1950 <b>s,</b> <b>network</b> television has maintained a keen fascination with Asian/American women, who implicitly helped secure the boundaries of white women’s “empire of the home. ” This dissertation inquires into when and how Asian/American women have been represented on U. <b>S.</b> <b>network</b> television. Bringing together questions and analyses of beauty, race, and gender to better understand how Asian/American femininity has been negotiated within the conventions of network television, I argue that the figure I call the Asian/American femme—suspended between feminine subject and feminized object—appeared on network television to mediate and obscure moments of U. S. national and imperial crisis. In addition to analyses of specific programs and network television texts, this dissertation examines the racialized and gendered mistreatment that Asian/American performers have experienced working within the television industry. By combining textual analysis with analysis of industrial practices and performers’ star-texts, I work to understand how network television has imagined Asian/American women’s gender and sexual debts to the nation, as well as how key Asian/American performers, through their own feminine labor, enact the “resolution” of Asian/American women’s tenuous status in the nation. Far from advancing in a linear progression from stereotypical to more sensitive and complex representations, the Asian/American femme on U. <b>S.</b> <b>network</b> television, I argue, instead demonstrates how television, as a social and racial technology, accommodates shifting racial, gender, and sexual discourses in U. S. dominant culture. 10000 - 01 - 0...|$|R
