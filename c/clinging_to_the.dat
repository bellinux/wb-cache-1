5|$|The adult Iago sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of grass and grain (the main cereal crop grown in Cape Verde is maize), but also on insects and plant shoots. They can do damage to crops by eating young leaves, and like house sparrows will eat the food scraps {{available}} near houses. Nestlings, by contrast to adults, are fed almost exclusively on insects, especially caterpillars, flies, and orthopterans. The Iago sparrow forages mostly on the ground, moving restlessly whilst <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground like a mouse.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, the {{schooner}} Lioness discovered {{one of the}} cutters, {{and after}} saving the occupants of the second boat {{made her way to}} the scene of the disaster. Arriving in the afternoon, she found 40 people still <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rigging. It was reported that of the approximately 643people aboard, only 193 were saved. Captain Edward WC Wright of the 91st Argyllshire Regiment was the most senior army officer to survive; he was awarded a brevet majority for his actions during the ordeal, dated 26 February 1852.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Octopussy return {{separately}} to India. Bond {{arrives at}} Khan's palace just as Octopussy and her troops have launched {{an assault on}} the grounds. Octopussy attempts to kill Khan, but is captured by Gobinda. While Octopussy's team, led by Magda, overpower Khan's guards, Khan and Gobinda abandon the palace, taking Octopussy as a hostage. Bond pursues them as they attempt to escape in their plane, <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fuselage and disabling the tailplanes. In a struggle with Bond, Gobinda takes a deadly plummet off the roof of the plane and Bond rescues Octopussy from Khan, the pair jumping onto a nearby cliff only seconds before the plane crashes into a mountain, killing Khan. While M and General Gogol discuss the transport of the jewelery, Bond recuperates with Octopussy aboard her private boat in India.|$|E

5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{theories}} proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease {{that resulted in the}} failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots. The proboscis of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a feeding tube through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find Phylloxera <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roots of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Lindemann {{may have}} left his combat {{position}} when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and {{prior to the}} lethal hit on the command position, {{in order to give}} the command to abandon the ship. The surviving Matrose Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that he had seen a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving Maschinengefreiter—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near Bismarcks forward 38cm turret, Anton. He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flagmast, going under with the ship.|$|E

5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. Examinations {{of their}} stomach contents reveal a highly varied diet that {{depended on the}} particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are <b>clinging</b> <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including fish feed and decaying organic matter. C.mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E
