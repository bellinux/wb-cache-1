50|$|Under Directive 1999/74/EC, {{furnished}} cages {{must provide}} {{at least the}} following: 750 cm2 per hen, of which 600 cm2 is 45 cm high, a nest, a littered area for scratching and pecking, 15 cm of perch and 12 cm of food trough per hen and a <b>claw</b> <b>shortening</b> device.|$|E
50|$|As {{alternatives}} to battery cages, Directive 1999/74/EC allows non-cage systems and furnished cages. Furnished cages therefore represent a feasible alternative to battery cages in the EU after 2012. Under the directive, furnished cages must provide {{at least the}} following: 750 cm2 per hen, of which 600 cm2 is 45 cm high, a nest, a littered area for scratching and pecking, 15 cm of perch and 12 cm of food trough per hen and a <b>claw</b> <b>shortening</b> device. Austria banned battery cages in 2009 and is set to ban furnished cages by 2020. Belgium has also banned the battery cage - and proposes to ban furnished cages by 2024. Germany has introduced a ‘family cage’, which has more space than the furnished cages used in other countries, however, consumers in Germany have been rejecting these eggs. Outside the EU, Switzerland has already banned both the battery and furnished cage systems.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out {{throughout}} a laying period to compare the behaviour and performance of two groups of commercial layers, 180 ISA Brown and 120 Hy line W 98, housed at 17 weeks of age in furnished cages with a nest box, perches, dust-bath, and <b>claw</b> <b>shortening</b> device. Based on productive parameters, the model of furnished cages studied is suitable for both, Isa Brown and Hy line hens. The study suggested that strain has {{a significant effect on}} feather condition and on some behavioural displays, particularly those related to the use of a dust-bath...|$|E
50|$|The feet of Pedopenna resembled {{those of}} the related troodontids and dromaeosaurids (which {{together}} form the group Deinonychosauria), though were overall more primitive. In particular, the second toe of Pedopenna was not as specialized as in deinonychosaurs. While Pedopenna did have an enlarged <b>claw</b> and slightly <b>shortened</b> second toe, {{it was not as}} highly developed as the strongly curved, sickle-like claws of its relatives.|$|R

Durante um ciclo completo de postura foram avaliados o comportamento e o desempenho de duas linhagens de poedeiras comerciais, 180 ISA Brown e 120 Hy line W 98, alojadas com 17 semanas de idade em gaiolas enriquecidas com ninho, poleiros, banho de areia e dispositivos de desgaste de unhas. Em ambas as linhagens, Isa Brown e Hy line W 98, o modelo de gaiola estudado foi apropriado em termos de desempenho produtivo. O estudo sugeriu que a linhagem teve efeito significativo sobre a condição da plumagem e sobre alguns aspectos comportamentais, particularmente, aqueles relacionados ao uso do banho de areia...|$|E
40|$|A {{review was}} {{undertaken}} {{to obtain information}} on the range of claw abrasives {{which could be used}} in layer cages to keep claws of hens blunt. In Europe a council directive has been issued which requires that all layer cages be fitted with suitable <b>claw</b> <b>shortening</b> devices. Research in Europe on claw abrasives suggest that abrasives reduce claw length of hens, improves feather cover, lowers mortality and reduces the incidence of scratches and entrapment injuries. More recent trials in Australia showed that claw abrasives could result in mortality in hens from prolapse and cannibalism. A low-cost, non-invasive method by which the claws of caged layers can be kept short and blunt can be achieved by fitting 8 mm strips of abrasive tape on the egg guard. Bird`s claws scrape against this tape while they are feeding. In Australia studies have shown that abrasive paint was more effective and more durable as a claw shortener than abrasive strips. The birds using the abrasive paint had the shortest claw length and lowest claw sharpness. Other work in Europe has shown that strips of sand fixed on the egg baffle with resin had a significant abrasive effect on the nails {{but by the end of}} the laying period large parts of the strip had been worn down. Claw shorteners have also been produced during cage manufacture by pressing a tread to make a perforated baffle. One of the most durable claw abrasives is a metal plate with abrasive iron filings. Other durable abrasives such as stone are also being tested for suitability as a claw abrasive...|$|E
