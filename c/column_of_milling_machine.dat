40|$|Building {{structures}} {{the most}} rigid as possible {{is a common}} practice in order to guarantee extremely precise tool spindle positioning. However, very rigid structures are usually very lightly damped and this could lead to some dynamic problems in case of resonance conditions. In the case <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines,</b> due to the variety <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> programs and <b>of</b> cutting tool types, the machine tool is often forced by broad frequency spectrum excitation, quite impossible to be predicted at a design stage. Thus a near-resonance working condition could easily appear. In recent years, to increase damping whilst maintaining very rigid structures, metal foam sandwiches have been used. However, it is quite rare to find comprehensive experimental studies demonstrating {{the effectiveness of this}} solution on a complete structure, such as a <b>column</b> <b>of</b> a <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> In this paper, two <b>columns</b> <b>of</b> a <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> built using different technologies, i. e. classic metalworking and metal foam sandwiches, are compared.
