5000|$|The {{connection}} of Apraca kings with Yagu-raja Kharaosta has raised <b>chronological</b> <b>questions</b> which call into doubt previously established norms {{about him and}} also seem to require a considerably earlier date for the Mathura Lion Capital Inscriptions (in which he is twice mentioned as Yuvaraja Kharaosta), than is usually attributed to him. Kharaosta {{is believed to have}} been the ruler of Cukhsa—a territory comprising districts of Peshawar, Hazara, Attock and Mianwal in northern Pakistan. The Apraca kings of Bajaur are believed to have been an important allies of Kharaosta in helping to protect his borders from ever-present threat of invasion from the west. It does not, therefore, seem unlikely that Arta (Mahakshatrapa), Kharaosta Kamuio (Yuvaraja), Aiyasia Kamuia (Agramahisi—the chief queen of Rajuvula), Maues or Moga (Gandhara king) as well as the rulers of Apraca dynasty of Bajaur were probably all related and were connected by some sort of familial connections. The fact that Kharaosta and his daughter Aiyasi have both been referred to as Kamuias in the Mathura Lion Capital inscriptions [...] may also hold a clue that the Apraca dynasty was also probably a Kamuia (Kamboja) dynasty. The surname Kamuia is a Kharoshthised/Prakritised form of Pali Kambojika or Sanskrit Kamboja. See main article: Kamuia ...|$|E

60|$|The {{work of art}} was dug up {{from under}} the firm concreted floor of a cave in the Dordogne. That cave was once {{inhabited}} by the nameless artist himself, his wife, and family. It had been previously tenanted by various other early families, {{as well as by}} bears, who seem to have lived there in the intervals between the different human occupiers. Probably the bears ejected the men, and the men in turn ejected the bears, by the summary process of eating one another up. In any case the freehold of the cave was at last settled upon our early French artist. But the date of his occupancy is by no means recent; for since he lived there the long cold spell known as the Great Ice Age, or Glacial Epoch, has swept over the whole of Northern Europe, and swept before it the shivering descendants of my poor prehistoric old master. Now, how long ago was the Great Ice Age? As a rule, if you ask a geologist for a definite date, you will find him very chary of giving you a distinct answer. He knows that the chalk is older than the London clay, and the oolite than the chalk, and the red marl than the oolite; and he knows also that each of them took a very long time indeed to lay down, but exactly how long he has no notion. If you say to him, 'Is it a million years since the chalk was deposited?' he will answer, like the old lady of Prague, whose ideas were excessively vague, 'Perhaps.' If you suggest five millions, he will answer oracularly once more, 'Perhaps'; and if you go on to twenty millions, 'Perhaps,' with a broad smile, is still the only confession of faith that torture will wring out of him. But in the matter of the Glacial Epoch, a comparatively late and almost historical event, geologists have broken through their usual reserve on this <b>chronological</b> <b>question</b> and condescended to give us a numerical determination. And here is how Dr. Croll gets at it.|$|R

40|$|The Great Salt Lake is {{a modern}} hypersaline lake, in which an {{extended}} modern and ancient microbial sedimentary system has developed. Detailed mapping based on aerial images and field observations {{can be used to}} identify non-random distribution patterns of microbial deposits, such as paleoshorelines associated with extensive polygons or fault-parallel alignments. Although it has been inferred that climatic changes controlling the lake level fluctuations explain the distribution of paleoshorelines and polygons, straight microbial deposit alignments may underline a normal fault system parallel to the Wasatch Front. This study is based on observations over a decimetre to kilometre spatial range, resulting in an integrated conceptual model for the controls on the distribution of the microbial deposits. The morphology, size and distribution of these deposits result mainly from environmental changes (i. e. seasonal to long-term water level fluctuations, particular geomorphological heritage, fault-induced processes, groundwater seepage) and have the potential to bring further insights into the reconstruction of paleoenvironments and paleoclimatic changes through time.

40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years {{radiocarbon}} dating has been widely used in archaeology and related fields to address a wide-range of <b>chronological</b> <b>questions.</b> Because of some inherent stochastic factors of a complex nature, radiocarbon dating presents a rich source of challenging statistical problems. The <b>chronological</b> <b>questions</b> posed commonly involve the interpretation of groups of radiocarbon determinations and often substantial amounts of a priori information are available. The statistical techniques used up to very recently could only deal with the analysis of one determination at a time, and no prior information could be included in the analysis. However, {{over the last few years}} some problems have been successfully tackled using the Bayesian paradigm. In this thesis we expand that work and develop a general statistical framework for the Bayesian interpretation of radiocarbon determinations. Firstly we consider the problem of radiocarbon calibration and develop a novel approach. Secondly we develop a statistical framework which permits the inclusion of prior archaeological knowledge and illustrate its use with a wide range of examples. We discuss various generic problems some of which are, replications, summarisation, floating chronologies and archaeological phase structures. The techniques used to obtain the posterior distributions of interest are numerical and, in most of the cases, we have used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We also discuss the sampling routines needed for the implementation of the MCNIC methods used in our examples. Thirdly we address the very important problem of outliers in radiocarbon dating and develop an original methodology for the identification of outliers in sets of radiocarbon determinations. We show how our framework can be extended to permit the identification of outliers. Finally we apply this extended framework to the analysis of a substantial archaeological dating problem...|$|E

Artificial periods (“künstliche Perioden”) and the phases of cemetery usage (“Belegungsphasen”) were identified both in the particular cemeteries and in the five analyzed regions. As a result of the analyses, we may identify three phases of development of the Polgár complex cemeteries (Formenkreis 1 =Tiszapolgár, Formenkreis 2 =Tiszapolgár- Bodrogkeresztúr, Formenkreis 3 =Bodrogkeresztúr, with the features of the ceramics from Hunyadihalom).

40|$|Abstract For many of archaeology’s rarest {{and most}} enigmatic bone {{artifacts}} (e. g. human remains, bone ornaments, worked bone), {{the destruction of}} the 500 mg material necessary for direct accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating on graphite targets would cause irreparable damage; therefore many have not been directly dated. The recently improved gas ion source of the MICADAS (MIni CArbon DAting System) offers a solution to this problem by measuring gaseous samples of 5 – 100 µg carbon at a level of precision not previously achieved with an AMS gas ion source. We present the results of the first comparison between “routine” graphite dates of ca. 1000 µg C (2 – 3 mg bone collagen) and dates from aliquots of gaseous samples of < 100 µg C (< 0. 2 mg bone collagen), undertaken with the highest possible precision in mind. The experiment demonstrates the performance of the AixMICADAS in achieving reliable radiocarbon measurements from < 0. 2 mg collagen samples back to 40, 000 14 C BP.

40|$|Deer {{are very}} {{abundant}} in the European Pleistocene and their marked species turnover and high rate of evolutionary change make them useful biochronological indicators and {{a good example of}} adaptive radiation. However, a clear understanding of their evolution is biased by their confused taxonomy, and the number of identified remains is reduced by the fact that their systematics is mainly based on antler and cranial morphology, not taking teeth and limb bone morphology into account. Thus, the project's aim was firstly to review the confused taxonomy of the Pleistocene deer, with special regard to the Megacerini (giant deer) and to the Dama-like deer (fallow deer) also assessing relationships with other taxa, by re-examining the original descriptions and re-studying key specimens from Britain and the continent. Then, to determine metric and non-metric morphological variation in the dental and postcranial remains using articulated skeletons from key sites in Western Europe as a guide. A cladistic analysis based on all available non-metric characters will provide a systematic framework for the exploration of palaeobiological <b>questions.</b> <b>Chronological</b> calibration will allow assessment of speciation rates in relation to environmental change. Geographical and chronological variation in size and adaptive form will be interpreted in relation to climate, habitat and guild diversity, testing ideas on the correlates of body size, antler complexity, and feeding and locomotor adaptation...|$|R
40|$|In {{approaching}} {{the scientific literature}} on the UNESCO world heritage site of Palmyra for the first time, any scholar would be immediately struck {{by the number of}} studies devoted to the Roman phase of the settlement – roughly 1 st-third quarter of the 3 rd century. By contrast, contributions on late antique and early Islamic Palmyra have never been numerous, reflecting both the preference granted by current scholarship to the study of Roman remains and the paucity of archaeological and written evidence at our disposal to cast light on this period. Admittedly, works on post- 273 Palmyra have grown significantly in number {{in the last couple of}} decades. Yet, almost the totality of them has often been confined to the examination of items of circumstantial evidence. We still lack an organic publication that attempts a systematic overview of these works and tries to contextualise the history of the city in a broader geographic and <b>chronological</b> framework.

This dissertation presents an examination of those evidence that are useful to better understand the historical development of the settlement from the fall of Zenobia and the second Palmyrene revolt (272 - 273) to the collapse of the Umayyad caliphate (750). The civilian and military character of the city is investigated through the analysis of specific themes for which enough evidence is available to work with. Besides written sources and published archaeological evidence, archival material is used to cast more light on a selected number of specific items of evidence. The final output of this study is to present a comprehensive history of the post-Roman settlement to be taken as a starting point for future discussion on the topic...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{and explains}} {{the development of}} the KEF between its formation in 1970 and 2003. Using a historical and case study approach, the thesis analyses the strategic behaviours of the KEF. The guiding questions shaping this thesis are drawn from the intersection of resource dependence theory and the literature on employer associations. In response to these <b>questions,</b> <b>chronological</b> narrative explains the development of Korea's political economy and industrial relations between 1970 and 2003 as it affected the KEF. It pays particular attention to the growth of the chaebols [...] family-owned and controlled business conglomerates [...] as political as well as economic forces, their changing relations with government and their labour management strategies. This thesis argues that when Korea's chaebol owners formed their association, the KEF, they did so in the absence of immediate clear or concrete challenges to their business interests. Instead, they evaluated the likelihood of some future external challenges and chose to act on these perceptions. In particular, they strategically chose to prepare for the possible re-emergence of an independent labour movement many years into the future rather than trust forever in governments? repressive systems of labour control. Resource dependence theory proved useful for examining the KEF's internal dynamics. The KEF and its chaebol members were linked through asymmetric inter-dependence. The chaebols dominated KEF membership, took financial responsibility for KEF operations and formally ruled through its governance structure. The KEF's high dependence on the chaebols inhibited any shift away from its chaebol-dominated profile. This also meant that the KEF leadership found it extremely difficult to exert control over member firms' behaviour. However, as the relationship between the chaebols and their external environment changed, internal power resources (industrial relations expertise) and external ones (a militant union movement, tripartite arrangements) helped the KEF Secretariat increase its authority. This allowed it to achieve greater discretionary power in its internal and external domains...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Bayesian {{analysis}} is now routinely {{applied for the}} construction of site-specific stratigraphic chronological models. Other approaches have analyzed the chronology of phases of archaeological activity across regions. The available radiocarbon results—the nature of the samples and their associations—provide the basis for what <b>chronological</b> <b>questions</b> it is possible to address for any site or region. In dealing with regional analyses, due consideration must be made of data selec-tion. While data selection might be a relatively self-evident consideration in the analysis of a site chronology, working with data from a larger region poses a number of specific data selection issues. Robust association between dated samples and a particular type of diagnostic material culture or site may provide one means of producing regional chronologies. However, if the activity under investigation includes a number of different cultural traits, which are related but with each having a slightly different chronological currency, defining the temporal end of data selection becomes more problematic. This article presents one approach, using a case study from the British Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, with 880 simulation OxCal models used to investigate the effect of variously defining the end of a regional archaeological phase. The results emphasize that for a regional case study, sensitivity analysis may provide a useful tool to ensure representative models; the study also highlights the importance of comparing multiple model posteriors...|$|E

This study was designed to qualitatively describe and interpret the Navy officer training, work experience and lifestyle of women commissioned into the Navy during the 1970 's and 1980 's. Using a case study method, twelve women officers with at least four years experience participated in extensive face-to-face interviews. General, <b>chronological</b> <b>questions</b> were developed to guide the participants through an oral history of their experiences starting from the time they decided to join the Navy, through each training activity and work assignment, separation or expected separation from active duty and their expectations for the future.

Military training and experience influenced: the women's decisions to remain in the Navy, depending on their perception of the Navy as an organization of personal and professional opportunity; their choices of technical specialties within the Navy; occupational and career choices after the Navy; choices of learning activities; choice of lifelong friends, colleagues and spouses or significant others; their evolving self-image. Women officers are a non-traditional group that is still marginalized by the unacceptance of women into the military subculture; full equality cannot be realized until combat exclusion laws are eliminated.

40|$|The glass finds {{from two}} Bronze Age {{settlements}} located in Veneto (Northen Italy) have been investigated: Fondo Paviani (Verona) and Montebello Vicentino (Vicenza). The present study aims to chemical and physical characterisations of the archaeological finds and, primarily, {{to answer to}} <b>chronological</b> <b>questions.</b> The main questions are: 1) may the compositional change from HMG to LMHK glasses date back before FBA stricto sensu? 2) are glasses from the surface layers of Fondo Paviani related {{to the age of}} the settlement: late MBA 3 /RBA- early FBA? If this is true, to wich phase may they be referred? Finally 3) are the scraps found at Fondo Paviani during the archaeological survey related to local production? The glass samples have been characterized by SEM-EDS, EPMA and computerized 2 D-image analyses. The results may be summarized in three main points: 1) the bead from the excavation of Montebello Vicentino, belonging to the transition between RBA and FBA, is a HMG glass. This confirms that LMHK glass did not exist before the FBA strictu sensu; 2) measured texture and the LMHK-type glass composition of a bead from surface layer of Fondo Paviani allow us to unambiguously date the bead to FBA period; 3) based on their composition, the glass scraps from the same archaeological survey cannot be dated to the Bronze Age. The glass scraps therefore are not related to local production. Actually one is a colourless glass with LMG composition, and the others are early- 20 th century blast furnace slags produced in the FE smelting process. It is argued that the presence of a well-detailed age-composition relationship, archaeometric analyses may greatly aid the archaeological interpretation of puzzling finds...|$|E
40|$|The Mercian {{supremacy}} has {{a relatively}} fixed {{place in the}} thought of contemporary Anglo- Saxon historians, who have focused primarily on documentary evidence for the rivalry of Mercian kings and Kentish archbishops. Less attention {{has been devoted to}} the shape of the Mercian realm; a kingdom with a midland focus extending its reach permanently over neighbouring kingdoms from the late seventh century onwards. Regional communities absorbed within the new Mercian sphere played an active role in its construction, influencing both Mercian development and their own futures, whilst the succession of each new king offered opportunities for renegotiation of the terms of hegemony. Using an interdisciplinary approach, this thesis uses an essentially <b>chronological</b> structure to <b>question</b> varied political aims and pressures, defensive needs, and cultural, economic and religious interests across the midland kingdoms, then to assess these as motivating factors in the relationships of resistance and accommodation which formed the Mercian hegemony. In chapter one it considers the diverse backgrounds of the independent midland kingdoms during early Mercian expansion. In chapter two the specific case study of the takeover of London is tackled, with its consequences for the East Saxons. The absorption of local rights and delegation of Mercian influence and protection under Aethelbald is analysed in chapter three as a key factor in regional power-relations amongst the Lindisse, Maagonsaete and Hwicce. As Mercian hegemony expanded under Aethelbald and Offa, chapter four considers strategies of accommodation and resistance within the kingdom of East Anglia. In chapters five and six, the formation of a supra-regional Mercian community under Offa and Coenwulf is considered, with the internal impact of key Mercian developments, such as common defensive burdens and economic currency, the establishment and dissolution of the Lichfield archbishopric, conquest and rebellion in East Anglia and Kent and external relations with the Welsh, West Saxons and Franks. Local attempts made to stabilise and augment the authority of their own lineages are discussed and how regional lineages responded to the loss of royal power explored. The final chapter asks if forces of Mercian regional interest and dynastic politics elicited multiple crises in the 820 s, causing the Mercian disintegration and allowing West Saxon invasion in 829 and the re-emergence of disparate destinies for the midland kingdoms. This thesis argues that choices at a regional level for unity or independence conditioned not only Mercian hegemony, but also responses in each region to subsequent West Saxon and Scandinavian overlordship...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncertainties}} regarding future {{climate change}} have put considerable notice to the climate variability following the Late Glacial-Holocene transition (ca. 13 - 9 ka BP) in the North Atlantic region {{as well as}} the forcing mechanisms behind climate changes. Much attention has focused on short climate events {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms that drove these changes but also to identify the leads and lags in the climate system. Chronological uncertainties for these events remain but an accurate chronological framework for the North Atlantic region would enhance possibilities to solve some of the <b>chronological</b> <b>questions.</b> Tephrochronology uses volcanic ash from a volcanic eruption which creates a marker horizon in marine and lake sediments, peat bogs and glacier ice as the ash is spread over large areas. These time-parallel markers allow precise correlations between archives. The purpose of this thesis is to improve and refine the Early Holocene tephrochronological framework with focus on dating and identification of new and previously known tephra horizons on the Faroe Islands, especially around the climatic events of the Preboreal Oscillation (11, 300 - 11, 100 cal. yr BP), the Erdalen events (10, 100 - 10, 050 and 10, 000 - 9800 cal. yr BP) and the 9. 3 ka BP event. A second goal is to develop the methodology of tephrochronology for finding cryptotephra (not visible by the eye) horizons in lacustrine sediments. The findings of eight tephra horizons spanning ca. 11, 350 to 9700 cal yr BP where three are known from other locations in Europe show the potential of tephrochronology for linking records across the North Atlantic region. Refined ages for the Askja-S and Hässeldalen tephra were obtained from an age model built on eight AMS radiocarbon ages with the Saksunarvatn ash as a constrained age. The results from using XRF ITRAX core scanner to locate tephra in lacustrine sediments illustrate that high concentrations of basaltic tephra could be captured but not lower concentrations of rhyolitic shards. ...|$|E
40|$|The wide {{availability}} of precise radiocarbon dates has allowed researchers {{in a number}} of disciplines to address <b>chronological</b> <b>questions</b> at a resolution which was not possible 10 or 20 years ago. The use of Bayesian statistics for the analysis of groups of dates is becoming a common way to integrate all of the radiocarbon evidence together. However, the models most often used make a number of assumptions which may not always be appropriate. In particular, there is an assumption that all of the radiocarbon measurements are correct in their context and that the original radiocarbon concentration of the sample is properly represented by the calibration curve. In practice in any analysis of dates some are usually rejected as obvious outliers. However there are Bayesian statistical methods which can be used to perform this rejection in a more objective way (Christen, 1994 b) but these are not often used. This paper discusses the underlying statistics and application of these methods, and extensions of them, as they are implemented in OxCal v 4. 1. New methods are presented for the treatment of outliers, where the problems lie principally with the context rather than the radiocarbon measurement. There is also a full treatment of outlier analysis for samples which are all of the same age which takes account of the uncertainty in the calibration curve. All of these Bayesian approaches can be used either for outlier detection and rejection or in a model averaging approach where dates most likely to be outliers are downweighted. Another important subject is the consistent treatment of correlated uncertainties between a set of measurements and the calibration curve. This has already been discussed by Jones and Nicholls (2001) in the case of marine reservoir offsets. In this paper the use of a similar approach for other kinds of correlated offset (such as overall measurement bias or regional offsets in the calibration curve) is discussed and the implementation of these methods in OxCal v 4. 0 is presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|Archaeologists put {{a premium}} on {{pressing}} “legacy data” into service, given the notoriously selective and destructive nature of their practices of data capture. Legacy data consist of material and records that been assembled over decades, sometimes centuries, often by means and for purposes long since discredited or superseded. The primary strategies by which archaeologists put the data to work for new purposes are, I argue, secondary retrieval, recontextualization, and experimental modelling. I focus here on a particularly telling and complex example of secondary retrieval: the extraction of new data from old by means of radiocarbon dating. This {{is by no means}} a straightforward process of retrieving physical samples from legacy data to which 14 C techniques can be applied that can, on their own, decisively settle <b>chronological</b> <b>questions.</b> When Libby’s post-war radiocarbon revolution got under way, it was expected to establish an absolute chronology that would render obsolete the local and relative chronologies on which archaeologists had long relied. Transformative though it has been, bringing these tools of physical dating to bear on archaeological problems has been a long, tortuous process, now described as proceeding through two subsequent radiocarbon revolutions. The second was an extended (and on-going) process of calibration by which 14 C chronologies were corrected and refined, often against the very lines of evidence they were meant to displace. The most recent, a “pragmatic Bayesian” approach to archaeological dating, is motivated by concern that, no matter how much it is refined, radiocarbon dating cannot on its own resolve the chronological problems that archaeologists address; the challenge, its advocates argue, is to ‘fully integrate archaeological information with 14 C dating in order to address archaeologically relevant (and therefore socially relevant) timescales and episodes’ (Manning 2015 : 151). This is a genre of “robustness” reasoning that illustrates its epistemic risks as well as its appeal. As recent philosophical debate makes clear (Soler et al. 2012, Soler 2014), it depends on appeals to the convergence of independent lines of evidence that may have more rhetorical than epistemic force and that may be spurious. Drawing on this philosophical literature I identify a set of conditions that must be met if these risks are to be avoided, all of which are an explicit focus of debate in cases of contestation about and reconciliation of chronologies based on legacy data.

40|$|The thesis {{poses the}} {{question}} in which ways traditional book-historical research can be supported by digitisation and computational analysis. Not merely possibilities of support are explored. The crucial matter is whether completely new methods of re-search are evolving due to new potentials. How can modern methods of electronic storage, digital reproduction and computational analysis be employed for the investi-gation of medieval manuscripts or early printed material? The theoretical part focuses on one specific method of book-historical research – analytical bibliography. This method is discussed in detail: It is shown how it origi-nated in the descriptive bibliography of incunabula {{on the one hand}} and in the phi-lological study of literary texts of the Elizabethan era on the other hand. The main principle of analytical bibliography is, that printed material supplies the body of pri-mary evidence when trying to gather information about the production circum-stances and process. By evaluating the printed pages carefully, by taking into account every– intended and accidental – trace the printing press left, details can be inferred, that are not revealed by any secondary documents. Studying this evidence can help solve technical and <b>chronological</b> <b>questions</b> about the printing process and can also further textual studies. For this latter use the term “textual bibliography” has been established, while pure “analytical bibliography” is not concerned with textual prob-lems. After laying out more clearly the distinction between textual and analytical bibliog-raphy, the thesis explains several specific terms: edition, impression, issue, state, can-cellans, cancellandum, technique, procedure, practice, incidence – relying primarily on definitions by Lotte Hellinga and Martin Boghardt. The theoretical part concludes with an extensive discussion of procedures (based on the work of Martin Boghardt and Chrisoph Reske) of analytical bibliography. Examples, taken mainly from the study of Gutenberg-prints, illustrate this part. Finally, technical aids for this historical research method are presented. The Hinman Collator and its successors, as well as two different versions of composite imaging, one of them already making use of digi-tal photography and computational manipulation, are described, focusing on their key advantages and disadvantages. The second part of the thesis initially deals with different digitisation technologies, concentrating on aspects which are of importance specifically for medieval manu-scripts and early prints, the central problem being how to enable perfect representa-tion of details and - at the same time – guarantee the preservation of the material. Based on technical facts and on the experience of digitisation projects, criteria is de-veloped for choosing the modes of scanning and processing and benchmarking rules are established. Following these preliminary technical considerations, three important research projects using digitisation in different ways are presented and evaluated. The first, CEEC (Codices Electronici Ecclesia Coloniensis) is not concerned with analytical bibliography, but with the documentation of and research on one large manuscript collection. A system of digital cataloguing is presented, offering the pos-sibility for researchers from all over the world not only to use the supplied informa-tion, but also to contribute their own results. Digital representations of – so far – 65. 000 pages of manuscripts of the Cologne collections are exhibited in different resolutions, up to 4. 491 x 3. 480 pixel. Furthermore, paleographical tools were devel-oped, translating traditional methods of analysing manuscript hands into digital methods. The second project, which is discussed, is the Japanese initaive HUMI (Humani-ties Media Interface), whose broad aim it is to build up a digital research environ-ment. One of the ambitions of HUMI is to digitise all remaining Gutenberg-Bibles (B 42) and to find out more about the typecase and other production circumstances with the help of computational analyses. So far, six copies of the B 42 have been digitized and partially made available via internet. Research has been done using methods of static and dynamic superimposition and line-by-line comparison, broadly speaking digital versions of collating machines. The remaining project is that of Paul Needham and Blaise Agüera y Arcas, two Princeton researchers whose work is based on the digitisation and computational analysis of several prints, one of them the Calixtus Bulla. Their research is probably the most sophisticated in terms of digitisation and computer-supported, mathemati-cal examination. Using their results, the two researchers have raised questions about some basic assumptions of the Gutenberg historiography and thereby caused a tre-mendous stir in the research community. So far no extensive publication has been brought forth by Needham and Arcas, making room for scepticism and criticism. The evaluation offered in the thesis is based on an unpublished article by one of the researchers and partially explains their method, but centers on showing perspectives and problems their – possibly groundbreaking – research poses. The summary compares these three projects, differentiating between several dig-itisation aims: to make material widely available, to offer new grounds for interna-tional discussion, to transfer traditional modes of research to the new medium or to offer completely new methods, unthinkable by traditional means. It is demonstrated that there is a wide range of possibilities of using digitisiation and/or computational analysis to – at the least – stimulate and facilitate research on historical t manuscripts and prints, but that one must wait for further advances to judge, whether a wholly new form of research, which makes digital technology compatible with the study of historical material without decontextualizing it, will be developed...|$|E
