5|$|The race {{itself was}} much like its Greek counterpart, {{although}} there were usually 24 races every day that, during the fourth century, took place on 66 days each year. However, a race consisted of only 7 laps (and later 5 laps, so that there <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> more races per day), instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race. The Roman style was also more money-oriented; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators. There were four-horse chariots (quadrigae) and two-horse chariots (bigae), but the four-horse races were more important. In rare cases, if a driver wanted {{to show off his}} skill, he could use up to 10 horses, although this was extremely impractical.|$|E

25|$|Over time, Blaichman's unit {{increased}} in size. They {{were joined by}} refugees from Markuszow and expanded to sixty fighters. In the spring of 1943, Blaichman encountered Samuel Gruber. Gruber's group consisted of men who had fought in the Polish Army and {{knew how to use}} explosives and mines. The two groups joined together and became a more effective fighting force. By September 1943, the Polish People's Army realized that the Blaichman and Gruber groups could be a dependable ally in the fight against the Germans and provided them with supplies that had been parachuted in by the Soviet air force. Now equipped with hand grenades, explosives, land mines, machine guns, and ammunition, the group <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> more successful in fighting the Germans.|$|E

500|$|Accounts {{at the end}} of the 20th century {{focused on}} the effects of Smart's confinement. Clement Hawes, {{following}} Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an animality' of madness", believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the [...] "medical stigmatization" [...] he felt at the hands of his fellow man. Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was [...] "a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as quietly as possible." [...] Contrary to the bestialisation, Allan Ingram argued that Jubilate Agno was [...] "a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable.

While it was recognised that individual radiologists would not all necessarily report equal numbers of studies (because of different subspecialty interests, varying non-service commitments, differing modality commitments, etc.), it was felt that across radiology departments, workload <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>evened</b> out reasonably in this way.|$|R
