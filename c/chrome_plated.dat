25|$|This {{is one of}} {{the reasons}} that scuba {{regulators}} are generally constructed from brass, and <b>chrome</b> <b>plated</b> (for protection).

25|$|High-end, <b>chrome</b> <b>plated</b> steel dildos {{are also}} popular in the BDSM scene. Some users prefer them because of their hardness, firmness, durability, {{electrical}} conductance (see erotic electrostimulation), and low friction, especially when {{used in conjunction with}} lubricant.

25|$|Materials : Early {{windlasses}} were individually hand forged from {{a single}} piece of wrought iron by a blacksmith. More modern techniques include casting of iron or bronze, drop forging and (the most common technique) welding. Some boatmen had their windlasses 'silvered' (or <b>chrome</b> <b>plated)</b> for increased comfort and to prevent rusting. Windlasses are now only rarely plated, but a popular modern choice of metal is aluminium, whose smooth and rustproof surface has the same advantages of longevity and blister-reduction, and is also very light. One type of these, the Dunton Double, has only a single eye, but by clever tapering it will operate either size of spindle.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, a Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) {{was issued}} banning several toxic {{substances}} {{for use in}} the automotive industry in Europe, including hexavalent chromium, which is used in <b>chrome</b> <b>plating.</b> However, <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> is metal and contains no hexavalent chromium after it is rinsed, so <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> is not banned.|$|R

40|$|Functional hard <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> is a {{technique}} {{that has been in}} commercial production for over 50 years and which is a critical process associated with manufacturing and maintenance operations on aircraft, vehicles, and ships. However, current and anticipated environmental regulations, together with concerns related to performance, are leading to the qualification of other types of coatings as replacements for chrome. Within the Department of Defense (DoD), hard <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> is widely used, with the total value of plating operations exceeding $ 100 million annually. In functional hard <b>chrome</b> <b>plating,</b> chromium deposits with thicknesses ranging from 2. 5 to 500 µm (0. 1 to 20 mils) are obtained from passing an electric current through a solution of chromic acid and a catalyst. It is used to provide resistance to wear, abrasion, heat and corrosion as well as to provide low friction, and to restore dimensions on worn, undersized, or ground parts, where the chrome is over-deposited and machined back to the correct dimension. Vickers hardness values (300 g load) for <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> are generally in the range of 8. 5 to 10. 5 GPa. Hardness starts to decrease above 220 ˚C; consequently, <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> should not be used for wear resistance in applications where the service temperature exceeds 400 ˚C. Hard <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> utilizes chromium in the hexavalent state (hex-Cr), which is a known carcinogen...|$|R
25|$|The Proton Prevé Sapphire Concept {{was also}} {{exhibited}} at the launch ceremony. It was developed by Proton Design {{in an effort to}} demonstrate the Prevé's market and technical potential.

30|$|The LPDC {{machine unit}} {{employed}} {{here is a}} vertical cold chamber die casting unit. The wheel casting {{coming out of the}} LPDC unit is quenched in water and is sent for checking internal casting defects in the non-destructive x-ray checking machine. After non-destructive x-ray check, the alloy wheel casting then follows the gate-cutting process, heat treatment, shot-blasting, CNC machining and air-leak testing. After air-leak test depending on the product requirement the alloy wheel is either sent to the paint line or sent to the <b>Chrome</b> <b>Plating</b> Plant. The paint line mainly consists of degreasing the machined alloy wheel, deoxidizing, conversion coating, pre-heating in dry-off oven, color coating and packing and dispatch.

2500|$|Concurrent {{with the}} release of these large models, Gabilondo {{replaced}} the Danton with the Llama I and Llama II. The Llama I was manufactured from 1933 to 1954 and resembled a miniature copy of Colt 1911 in 7.65mm/.32 ACP. As a locked breach was unnecessary for a pistol in this calibre, it was eliminated, as was the grip safety. Similar to previous Gabilondo models it had a nine-round magazine. The Llama II was manufactured from 1933 to 1954, The Llama II was chambered in 9mm corto/.380ACP with an eight-round magazine and without grip safety. The Llama III was introduced with a grip safety, locked breech and continued to be made until 1954. It was made in the same calibre and magazine capacity.

50|$|<b>Chrome</b> <b>plating</b> {{can be done}} by two {{different}} methods, where the source of the deposited metal is either in the form of hexavalent chromium or trivalent chromium. Hexavalent <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> baths have a long history for producing heavy, corrosion resistant and mechanically hard coatings. However, the process is slow, varies in thickness according to the shape of the object, and produces extremely toxic waste. Plating from trivalent baths is commonly used for thinner, decorative finishes. It can be faster, more uniform, and with lower disposal costs but requires more careful controls during the process.|$|R

40|$|Background: Biomonitoring {{provides}} a useful tool to estimate the genetic risk from exposure to genotoxic agents. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the potential cytogenetic damage associated with occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium by using micronuclei (MN) as a biomarker. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study and all participants were males. Both the exposed and control individuals were selected from Coimbatore, Southern India. Exfoliated buccal cells from 44 <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> workers and 40 age and sex matched control subjects were examined for MN frequency and nuclear abnormalities (NA) other than micronuclei, such as binucleates, broken eggs, karyorrhexis, karyolysis and pyknosis. Results: Results showed statistically significant difference between <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> workers and control groups. MN and NA frequencies in <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> workers were significantly higher than those in control groups (p < 0. 05) and also significantly related to smoking habit (P < 0. 05). A significant difference in NA was observed in workers exposed to chromium for longer duration. In addition to this, a higher degree of NA was observed among smokers. Conclusion: MN and other NA reflect genetic changes, events associated with carcinogenesis. Therefore the results of this study indicate that <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> workers are under risk of significant cytogenetic damage. Therefore, there is a need to educate those who work with heavy metals about the potential hazard of occupational exposure and the importance of using protective measures...|$|R
