5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, <b>cupric</b> <b>chloride,</b> and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E

40|$|In view of {{the known}} effect of zinc on the {{crystalline}} nature of insulin, we have investigated whether zinc alters the biologic potency of this hormone. Using the rate of lipogenesis by rat epididymal adipocytes as an index of the biologic potency of insulin, we have shown that zinc exerts a potent stimulatory effect upon lipogenesis in vitro similar to, but quite indepen-dently of, insulin {{and that it has}} an additive effect with that of insulin when both are incubated together. This effect of zinc on adipocytes and the biologic potency of insulin, hitherto unreported, is of significance at the biologic, pharmacologic, and clinical level. DIABETES 29 : 665 - 667, August 1980. It is well known that the addition of zinc promotes the for-mation of hexamers from insulin monomers. 1 It is possi-ble that such an alteration in the crystalline form of insu-lin may result in some change in its biologic potency. The addition of zinc is already known to alter the configura-tion of proteins and to alter their biologic activity; for exam-ple, the addition of zinc to denatured alcohol dehydrogen-ase leads to a reconstitution of the dimeric form from its monomers and to the restoration of its activity which would otherwise not occur. 2 We have therefore investigated the possibility that zinc may modify the biologic activity/potency of insulin in vitro. We have used the rate of lipogenesis by adipocytes from the rat epididymal fat pad as an index of the biologic potency of insulin.

40|$|One of the {{characteristic}} reactions of α-polycarbonyl compounds is {{their tendency to}} undergo “decarbonylation” {{with the formation of}} a compound with one less carbon atom and carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. An important synthetic example of this type of reaction is the thermal decomposition of oxalylacetic esters which yield the corresponding malonic esters and carbon monoxide. The related thermal decarbonylation of ethyl pyruvate has been studied by Calvin and Lemmon. These workers found that ethyl pyruvate- 2 -C^(14) gave only non-radioactive carbon monoxide which result indicates that the ester carbonyl group is lost exclusively. The decarbonylation reactions of diphenyl triketone (diphenylpropane- 1, 2, 3 -trione, I) are particularly interesting since they have been reported to be brought about by a wide variety of agents such as bases, acids, <b>cupric</b> acetate, aluminum <b>chlorides</b> and sunlight.
