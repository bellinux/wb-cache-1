500|$|The {{concentration}} of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most commercial ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) {{and to a}} lesser extent chalcocite (Cu2S). These minerals are concentrated from crushed ores to the level of 10–15% copper by froth flotation or bioleaching. Heating this material with silica in flash smelting removes much of the iron as slag. The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag that floats on top of the heated mass.

50|$|By May 1905 {{the company}} had 400 tons of matte ready for export. At that time they {{believed}} there were 62,360 tons of ore in sight valued at £1,060,000. In June 1905 they declared a dividend of five shillings per share, the first copper mining company in North Queensland to do so. During 1905, the company produced £61,248 worth of copper. They paid £25,308 in dividends, and expenses were £16,192 on the <b>copper</b> <b>matte,</b> £12,189 on smelting, £6,149 on ore raising, £2,922 on management expenses, £781 on general expenses and £632 on the smelting plant.|$|E
50|$|The {{isolation}} of the mine again made the operation marginal. All supplies had to come either 462 km overland from Townsville or via Cairns for 192 km along the Chillagoe line to Almaden, and then carted by bullock team another 190 km to the mine. Coke, which was vital for smelting cost from 12 to 14 pounds to land at the mine and limestone had to be carted for over 48 km. After treating 860 tons of ore, smelting was abandoned even though 191 tons of <b>copper</b> <b>matte</b> had been produced.|$|E
50|$|The initial melting of the {{material}} to be smelted is usually {{referred to as the}} smelting or matte smelting stage. It can be undertaken in a variety of furnaces, including the largely obsolete blast furnaces and reverberatory furnaces, as well as flash furnaces, Isasmelt furnaces, etc. The product of this smelting stage is a mixture of copper, iron and sulfur that is enriched in copper, and which is called matte or <b>copper</b> <b>matte.</b> The term matte grade is normally used to refer to the copper content of the matte.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{reverberatory furnace}} bath is quiescent, very little {{oxidation}} of the feed occurs (and thus very little sulfur is {{eliminated from the}} concentrate). It is essentially a melting process. Consequently, wet-charged reverberatory furnaces have less <b>copper</b> in their <b>matte</b> product than calcine-charged furnaces, and they also have lower copper losses to slag. Gill quotes a copper in slag value of 0.23% for a wet-charged reverberatory furnace vs 0.37% for a calcine-charged furnace.|$|R
50|$|The next licence issued was for an {{electrowinning}} application at the Broken Hill Associated Smelters (“BHAS”) {{lead smelter}} at Port Pirie, in South Australia. BHAS commissioned in 1985 a solvent extraction and electrowinning (“SX-EW”) to recover <b>copper</b> from copper-lead <b>matte</b> produced as {{a by-product of}} the lead smelting operations. The process used involves leaching the copper from the material using an acidic chloride-sulfate solution, followed by solvent extraction to concentrate the leached copper and electrowinning.|$|R
50|$|The {{replacement}} of the hearth roasters with the fluid-bed roaster meant {{that the amount of}} sulfur eliminated from the concentrate during the roasting process increased, raising the copper content ("matte grade") of the reverberatory furnace <b>matte</b> from 33-35% <b>copper</b> to 40-42% <b>copper.</b> This higher <b>matte</b> grade meant that less sulfur per tonne of concentrate treated in the smelter had to be eliminated in the converters, thus raising their effective capacity and allowing higher copper production from the smelter without adding additional converters.|$|R

However, {{the expense of}} this railway, combined with a slump in copper prices in late 1907, meant {{that by the time}} the railway opened on 7 August 1908 the company was already in financial trouble. The smelter had suspended operations while waiting for the railway to be completed, and a short smelting campaign was conducted in late 1908.|$|E

Additionally, the company developed and installed a special burner at the plant to produce sulfuric acid from pyrites, a cheaper raw material with a stable price.

40|$|Cyprus was {{undoubtedly}} the main area of {{production of the}} copper oxhide ingots found in different Mediterranean countries. Recent research at Politiko Phorades and Maroni shows that the casting of the oxhide ingots required a complex process which involved both inland mining and coastal sites. Egyptian and Near Eastern written sources suggest that not only oxhide ingots but possibly other raw <b>copper</b> (ore, <b>matte</b> or other semi-processed material) were exported from Alashiya/Cyprus. However, lead isotope analysis of some ingots from Late Minoan I contexts and archaeological evidence from Ras Ibn Hani, in the Ugaritic kingdom, and Timna, in the political domain of Egypt, show that the oxhide ingots were not cast only in Cyprus, from at least {{the beginning of the}} Late Bronze Age to the last centuries of the second millennium BC. Leaving aside the copper oxhide ingots depicted in the well-known scenes of tribute of the Theban tombs, special attention is here paid to Egyptian foundry scenes, especially that depicted in Hepu tomb. A group of oxhide ingots is here displayed above the craftsmen who are represented in act of fanning a fire. A review of Egyptian scenes of various workshops shows that from the Old Kingdom the products of the working activities are generally displayed {{in the same way as}} in the Hepu tomb. It is therefore very likely that the aim of this scene is to epitomize the casting of the copper oxhide ingots displayed above. If this interpretation is right, the production of copper oxhide ingots should be admitted also in Egypt during the 15 th- 14 th centuries BC, although on a far smaller scale than in Cyprus.
