As a result, our buying power decreases almost monthly, making living on a fixed income an even greater challenge. For some, it {{can mean the difference}} between buying groceries and buying medication. Setting guidelines and being smart about your buying habits can give you more <b>control</b> over <b>your</b> money and help to control the impact of inflation. Tightening Your Belt In order to <b>control</b> <b>your</b> spending and make <b>your</b> <b>budget</b> work for you, consider writing down what your true necessities are, what items or services you can do without, and a method to help you save for what you need and/or desire. Compulsive spending is a serious problem for those on a fixed income. Some ways you can make your dollars stretch farther, or at least cover your necessities, include: making your home more energy-efficient; conserving energy; buying gasoline when the price is lower (usually early in the week); clipping coupons; cutting back on donations; spending less on Christmas and birthday gifts; watching for “good ” sales at the grocery or retail stores; and meal planning.
