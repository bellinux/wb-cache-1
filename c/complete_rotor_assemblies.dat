40|$|A set of test {{correlated}} mathematical {{models of}} the SSME High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump (HPOTP) housing and <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> was produced. New analysis methods within the EISI/EAL and SPAR systems were investigated and runstreams for future use were developed. The LOX pump models have undergone extensive modification since {{the first phase of}} this effort was <b>completed.</b> The <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> from the original model was abandoned and a new, more detailed model constructed. A description of the new rotor math model is presented. Also, the pump housing model was continually modified as additional test data have become available. This model is documented along with measured test results. Many of the more advanced features of the EAL/SPAR finite element analysis system were exercised. These included the cyclic symmetry option, the macro-element procedures, and the fluid analysis capability. In addition, a new tool was developed that allows an automated analysis of a disjoint structure in terms of its component modes. A complete description of the implementation of the Craig-Bampton method is given along with two worked examples...|$|R
50|$|Two-phase {{electrical}} power {{was an early}} 20th-century polyphase alternating current electric power distribution system. Two circuits were used, with voltage phases differing by one-quarter of a cycle, 90°. Usually circuits used four wires, two for each phase. Less frequently, three wires were used, with a common wire with a larger-diameter conductor. Some early two-phase generators had two <b>complete</b> <b>rotor</b> and field <b>assemblies,</b> with windings physically offset to provide two-phase power. The generators at Niagara Falls installed in 1895 were the largest generators {{in the world at}} that time and were two-phase machines. Three-phase systems eventually displaced two-phase power systems for power transmission and utilization. There remain few two-phase distribution systems, with examples in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; many buildings in Center City are permanently wired for two-phase and Hartford, Connecticut.|$|R

The method is based on combining the two magnetic field principles of induction and torque. The apparatus includes a <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> having a pair of inductive magnetic field pickup coils which are concentrically mounted, orthogonally oriented in the r and z directions, and coupled to remotely located electronics which include electronic integrators for determining magnetic field changes. The <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> includes an axle oriented in the toroidal direction, with the axle mounted on pivot support brackets which in turn are mounted on a baseplate. First and second springs are located between the baseplate and the <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> restricting rotation of the <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> about its axle, the second spring providing a constant tensile preload in the first spring. A strain gauge is mounted on the first spring, and electronic means to continually monitor strain gauge resistance variations is provided. Electronic means for providing a known current pulse waveform to be periodically injected into each coil to create a time-varying torque on the <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> in the toroidal direction causes mechanical strain variations proportional to the torque in the mounting means and springs so that strain gauge measurement of the variation provides periodic magnetic field measurements independent of the magnetic field measured by the electronic integrators...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{computational}} modelling of static and dynamic analyses of journal bearings, with analyses of stability of oil-film motion and analyses of {{response of the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies.</b> At our workplace a new theoretical approach to the modelling of the static and dynamic behaviour of the rigid rotating body in liquid is used. The approach {{is based on the}} application of the Navier-Stokes motion eq., equation of continuity and boundary conditions eqs. It is possible to separate the motion of the rigid body and liquid from each other using suitable transformation relations and then it is also possible to separate the stationary and nonstationary motions from each other. A method of control volumes is used for these analyses. The real Bézier body is used for the description of the geometrical configuration and also for the approximation of velocity and pressure functions. Combined the ALE (Arbitrary Lagrange-Euler) method is used, because it´s necessary to generate a new net (to perform new meshing) for a change of the shaft position. The additional effects of the liquid (additional mass, stiffness and damping), which we solved in dynamic analysis, are the function of the single parameter only – the shaft-centre position. There is a large advantage in comparison with the standard approach, which is based on application of the Reynolds liquid eq.

40|$|Virtually all {{previous}} research on the squeeze-film damping of <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies</b> has considered the use of only one damper. However, many aero-engine <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{have at least two}} dampers and the interplay between them {{is an important factor in}} the overall vibration performance of the rotor. The purpose of this paper is to report results on a test facility which simulates the rotor of an aero-engine of the size used to power an executive jet. It draws general conclusions on the application of two squeeze-film dampers (SFDs) to such a rotor, while in the process qualitatively validating a suggested theoretical model of the SFD. The test facility is a three bearing rigid <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> incorporating two sprung bearing supports, each in series with a weakly sealed squeeze-film damper. A range of practical configurations with different SFD static misalignments is studied. Non-linear jump phenomena and subharmonic resonances are demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically for a range of rotor unbalance. The paper is concerned with predicting and measuring rotor-centre responses and vibration orbits and drawing conclusions that are relevant to the designer. It forms a complement to a previous paper (1) in which spectrum analyses of vibration signatures were made...|$|R
40|$|The renewed {{interest}} in advancing nuclear energy has spawned the research of advanced technologies for recycling nuclear fuel. A {{significant portion of the}} advanced fuel cycle includes the recovery of selected actinides by solvent extraction methods utilizing centrifugal contactors. Although the use of centrifugal contactors for solvent extraction is widely known, their operation is not without challenges. Solutions generated from spent fuel dissolution contain unknown quantities of undissolved solids. A majority of these solids will be removed via various methods of filtration. However, smaller particles are expected to carry through to downstream solvent extraction processes and equipment. In addition, solids/precipitates brought about by mechanical or chemical upsets are another potential area of concern. During processing, particulate captured in the <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> by high centrifugal forces eventually forms a cake-like structure on the inner wall introducing balance problems and negatively affecting phase separations.

The data indicated very tight binding between the c(11) ring and the gammaepsilon complex, with an apparent K(d) value of approximately 7. 4 nm. The <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> was primarily dependent on the interaction of the cring with the gammasubunit, and binding of the cring to the free epsilon subunit was not observed. Mutagenesis of selected conserved amino acid residues of all three rotor components (cR 45, cQ 46, gammaE 204, gammaF 203 and epsilonH 38) severely affected <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly.</b> The interaction kinetics between the gammaepsilon complex and c(11) ring mutants suggested that the assembly of the c(11) gammaepsiloncomplex was governed by interactions of low and high affinity.
