40|$|The {{requirements}} {{that must be}} met in order that stationary numerical corona models can be scaled from one star to another are discussed. A <b>corona</b> <b>model</b> is a solution of the conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy, subject to appropriate boundary conditions, and of the equation of state. In general, the mass M and radius R of the star enter these equations and boundary conditions as free parameters. A given solution can be scaled to other stars only if all equations can be rewritten in such a form that M and R do no longer appear explicitly as free parameters, but only implicitly as scaling factors of the variables. An adequate means to find these scaling factors is a homologous transformation: one multiplies all variables and parameters by separate constants (i. e., scaling factors) and requires that the equations and boundary conditions remain valid. This leads {{to a set of}} nonlinear relations between the transformation constants.

40|$|We {{present an}} updated global {{model of the}} solar corona, {{including}} the transition region. We simulate the realistic tree-dimensional (3 D) magnetic field using {{the data from the}} photospheric magnetic field measurements and assume the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Alfvén wave turbulence and its non-linear dissipation to be the only source for heating the coronal plasma and driving the solar wind. In closed field regions the dissipation efficiency in a balanced turbulence is enhanced. In the coronal holes we account for a reflection of the outward propagating waves, which is accompanied by generation of weaker counter-propagating waves. The non-linear cascade rate degrades in strongly imbalanced turbulence, thus resulting in colder coronal holes. The distinctive feature of the presented model is the description of the low corona as almost-steady-state low-beta plasma motion and heat flux transfer along the magnetic field lines. We trace the magnetic field lines through each grid point of the lower boundary of the global <b>corona</b> <b>model,</b> chosen at some heliocentric distance, R=R_b∼ 1. 1 R_ well above the transition region. One can readily solve the plasma parameters along the magnetic field line from 1 D equations for the plasma motion and heat transport together with the Alfvén wave propagation, which adequately describe physics within the heliocentric distances range, R_<R<R_b, in the low solar corona. By interfacing this threaded-field-lines model with the full MHD global <b>corona</b> <b>model</b> at r=R_b, we find the global solution and achieve a faster-than-real-time performance of the model on ∼ 200 cores.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{extended}} <b>corona</b> <b>model</b> based on ray-tracing simulations to investigate X-ray time lags in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This model {{consists of two}} axial point sources illuminating an accretion disc that produce the reverberation lags. These lags are due to the time delays between the directly observed and reflection photons and {{are associated with the}} light-travel time between the source and the disc, so they allow us to probe the disc-corona geometry. We assume the variations of two X-ray sources are triggered by the same primary variations, but allow the two sources to respond in different ways (i. e. having different source responses). The variations of each source induce a delayed accretion disc response and the total lags consist of a combination of both source and disc responses. We show that the extended <b>corona</b> <b>model</b> can reproduce both the low-frequency hard and high-frequency soft (reverberation) lags. Fitting the model to the timing data of PG 1244 + 026 reveals the hard and soft X-ray sources at ∼ 6 r_g and ∼ 11 r_g, respectively. The upper source produces small amounts of reflection and can be interpreted as a relativistic jet, or outflowing blob, whose emission is beamed away from the disc. This explains the observed lag-energy {{in which there is no}} soft lag at energies < 1 keV as they are diluted by the soft continuum of the upper source. Finally, our models suggest that the fluctuations propagating between the two sources of PG 1244 + 026 are possible but only at near the speed of light.

40|$|The hard {{state of}} X-ray {{binaries}} (XRBs) {{is characterized by}} a power law spectrum in the X-ray band, and a flat/inverted radio/IR spectrum associated with occasionally imaged compact jets. It has generally been thought that the hard X-rays result from Compton upscattering of thermal accretion disk photons by a hot, coronal plasma whose properties are inferred via spectral fitting. Interestingly, these properties-especially those from certain magnetized corona models-are very similar to the derived plasma conditions at the jet footpoints. Here we explore {{the question of whether the}} `corona' and `jet base' are in fact related, starting by testing the strongest premise that they are synonymous. In such models, the radio through the soft X-rays are dominated by synchrotron emission, while the hard X-rays are dominated by inverse Compton at the jet base - with both disk and synchrotron photons acting as seed photons. The conditions at the jet base fix the conditions along the rest of the jet, thus creating a direct link between the X-ray and radio emission. We also add to this model a simple iron line and convolve the spectrum with neutral reflection. After forward-folding the predicted spectra through the detector response functions, we compare the results to simultaneous radio/X-ray data obtained from the hard states of the Galactic XRBs GX 339 - 4 and Cygnus X- 1. Results from simple Compton <b>corona</b> <b>model</b> fits are also presented for comparison. We demonstrate that the jet model fits are statistically as good as the single-component <b>corona</b> <b>model</b> X-ray fits, yet are also able to address the simultaneous radio data.
