40|$|The creep {{and wear}} {{behaviour}} of highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> and standard polyethylene liners {{were examined in}} a prospective, double-blind randomised, controlled trial using radiostereometric analysis. We randomised 54 patients to receive hip replacements with either highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> or standard liners and determined the three-dimensional penetration of the liners over three years. After three years the mean total penetration was 0. 35 mm (SD 0. 14) for the highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> group and 0. 45 mm (SD 0. 19) for the standard group. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0. 0184). From the pattern of penetration {{it was possible to}} discriminate creep from wear. Most (95 %) of the creep occurred within six months of implantation and nearly all within the first year. There was no difference in the mean degree of creep between the two types of <b>polyethylene</b> (highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> 0. 26 mm, SD 0. 17; standard 0. 27 mm, SD 0. 2; p = 0. 83). There was, however, a significant difference (p = 0. 012) in the mean wear rate (highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> 0. 03 mm/yr, SD 0. 06; standard 0. 07 mm/yr, SD 0. 05). Creep and wear occurred in significantly different directions (p = 0. 01); creep was predominantly proximal whereas wear was anterior, proximal and medial. We conclude that penetration {{in the first six months}} is creep-dominated, but after one year virtually all penetration is due to wear.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use {{of highly}} <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> is now commonplace in total hip arthroplasty. Hip {{simulator}} studies and short-term in vivo measurements {{have suggested that}} the wear rate of highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> is significantly less than that of conventional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. However, long-term data to support its use are limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the intermediate-term steady-state wear of highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> compared with that of conventional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene acetabular liners in a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with use of radiostereometric analysis. METHODS: Fifty-four patients were randomized to receive hip replacements with either conventional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene acetabular liners (Zimmer) or highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> liners (Longevity; Zimmer). All patients received a cemented, collarless, polished, tapered femoral component (CPT; Zimmer) and an uncemented acetabular component (Trilogy; Zimmer). Clinical outcomes were assessed and the three-dimensional penetration of the head into the socket was determined for a minimum of seven years. Linear regression was used to calculate the steady-state wear rate following the creep-dominated penetration seen during the first year. RESULTS: At a minimum of seven years postoperatively, the mean total femoral head penetration was significantly lower in the highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> group (0. 33 mm; 95 % confidence interval [CI], +/- 0. 10 mm) than it was in the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene group (0. 55 mm; 95 % CI, +/- 0. 10 mm) (p = 0. 005). The mean steady-state wear rate of highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> was 0. 005 mm/yr (95 % CI, +/- 0. 015 mm/yr), compared with 0. 037 mm/yr (95 % CI, +/- 0. 019 mm/yr) for conventional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (p = 0. 007). No patient in the highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> group had a wear rate above the osteolysis threshold of 0. 1 mm/yr, compared with 9 % of patients in the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> has a significantly lower steady-state wear rate compared with that of conventional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.

40|$|Wear particle-induced osteolysis is a {{major cause}} of aseptic {{loosening}} in THA. Increasing wear resistance of polyethylene (PE) occurs by increasing the cross-link density and early reports document low wear rates with such implants.

The insert material was the only variable. The Harris hip score, radiographic signs of osteolysis, and polyethylene wear were recorded annually. Twenty-three historical and 17 moderately <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> inserts were analyzed (five patients died, three were lost to followup). At 8  years, the wear rate was lower for <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (0. 088  ±  0. 03  mm/year) than for the historical polyethylene (0. 142  ±  0. 07  mm/year). This reduction (38 %) did not diminish with time (33 % at 5  years). Acetabular cyst formation was less frequent (39 % versus 12 %), affected fewer DeLee and Charnley zones (17 % versus 4 %), and was less severe for the <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene.</b> The only revision was for an aseptically loose cup in the historical <b>polyethylene</b> group.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> is {{resistant}} to wear {{in comparison to}} conventional polyethylene, it remains unknown whether it can decrease the wear-related revision rate of total hip arthroplasty. ObjectivesTo determine whether <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> decreases the wear-related revision rate of total hip arthroplasty compared with conventional polyethylene. Data sourcesElectronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were queried from inception to July 6, 2013. Study selectionRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> with conventional polyethylene were included. In addition, the standard 28 -mm femoral head was used, and follow-up was performed {{for a minimum of}} 5 years. The primary outcome assessed was wear-related revision. The secondary outcome measures evaluated were the incidence of osteolysis, the linear wear rate, and the linear head penetration. Data synthesisThe Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias was used for quality assessment. Data from eligible studies were pooled using a random effects model. ResultsEight studies involving 735 patients were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed {{there was no significant difference}} between <b>cross-linked</b> and conventional <b>polyethylene</b> group in terms of osteolysis or wear-related revision. The pooled mean differences were significantly less for the linear wear rate and linear head penetration for <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> than for conventional polyethylene. LimitationsThe studies differed with respect to the cross-linked liner brands, manufacturing processes, and radiological evaluation methods. Moreover, the follow-up periods of the RCTs were not long enough. ConclusionsThe current limited evidence suggests that <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> significantly reduced the radiological wear compared with conventional polyethylene at midterm follow-up periods. However, there is no evidence that <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> had an advantage over conventional polyethylene in terms of reducing osteolysis or wear-related revision.

40|$|Background: Aseptic {{loosening}} {{of total}} hip arthroplasties is generally caused by periprosthetic bone resorption due to tissue reactions on polyethylene wear particles. In vitro testing of polyethylene cups incorporated with vitamin E shows increased wear resistance. The {{objective of this}} study is to compare vitamin E-stabilized highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> with conventional <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> in "reversed hybrid" total hip arthroplasties (cemented all-polyethylene cups combined with uncemented femoral stems). We hypothesize that the adjunction of vitamin E leads to a decrease in polyethylene wear in the long-term. We also expect changes in bone mineral density, less osteolysis, equal functional scores and increased implant survival in polyethylene cemented cups incorporated with vitamin E in the long-term. Design: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Patients to be included are aged under 70, suffer from non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease of the hip and are scheduled for a primary total hip arthroplasty.

Radiological follow-up will be assessed at 6 weeks and at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years postoperatively, to determine polyethylene wear and osteolysis.

40|$|Background: <b>Cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> was {{developed}} to reduce volumetric wear in prosthetic joints. Hip simulator studies have shown promising results with regard to wear reduction. This study evaluated the short-term in vivo wear of a moderately <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene.</b> Methods: Linear head penetration, as an assessment of in vivo polyethylene wear, was measured in two groups of pa-tients after total hip replacement. Twenty-four hips received a conventional polyethylene insert and thirty-four, a <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> liner; both inserts were manufactured by the same company. Linear and volumetric wear rates were measured on radiographs with use of a validated computer-assisted technique and were adjusted for patient-related fac-tors. Patient activity was assessed by a computerized two-dimensional accelerometer worn on the ankle. Results: Patients with a conventional polyethylene insert showed a mean linear wear rate of 0. 13 mm per year and a mean volumetric wear rate of 87. 6 mm 3 per year. The group with a <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> liner showed a mean lin-ear wear rate of 0. 02 mm per year and a mean volumetric wear rate of 17. 0 mm 3 per year.

40|$|The {{articulation}} {{performance of}} silicon nitride against conventional and highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene,</b> {{as well as}} for self-mated silicon nitride bearings, was examined in a series of standard hip simulation studies. Wear rates for polyethylene liners against silicon nitride femoral heads were consistent with reported literature, although higher than cobalt chromium controls. Excessive protein precipitation was a confounding factor in interpretation of the wear data. Post wear-test Raman spectroscopy of the <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> liners showed no oxidative degradation. Wear of self-mated silicon nitride was found to be essentially zero and indistinguishable from alumina controls using continuously orbital hip simulation for up to three million cycles. However, introduction of an alternative loading profile from three to five million cycles, including a stop-dwell-start sequence, significantly increased wear for two of six silicon nitride couples. This behavior is associated with formation and disruption of a gelatinous silicic acid tribochemical film, and is consistent with a recurrent transition from fluid-film to boundary lubrication.

40|$|Background: First-generation highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> liners {{have reduced}} the {{incidence}} of wear particle-induced osteolysis. However, failed acetabular liners have shown evidence of surface cracking, mechanical failure, and oxidative damage. This {{has led to the}} development of second-generation highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene,</b> which has improved wear and mechanical properties and resistance to oxidation in vitro. Owing to its recent introduction, there are no publications describing its clinical performance. Questions/purposes: We assessed early clinical wear of a second-generation highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> liner and compared its clinical performance with the published results of hip simulator tests and with first-generation highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> annealed liners. Patients and Methods: Twenty-one patients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Clinical outcome and femoral head penetration were measured for 19 patients at 6 months and 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Results: The median proximal head penetration was 0. 009 mm and 0. 024 mm at 1 and 2 years, respectively. The median two-dimensional (2 -D) head penetration was 0. 083 mm and 0. 060 mm at 1 and 2 years, respectively. The median proximal wear rate between 1 and 2 years was 0. 015 mm/year.
