40|$|<b>Co-housing</b> is {{the overall}} term {{for groups of}} {{households}} creating and managing their own living environment. From recent research on <b>co-housing</b> in EU member states {{it becomes clear that}} cohousing initiatives consider themselves as pioneers for energy-transition. Nevertheless, the value and contribution of <b>co-housing</b> initiatives to housing provision and sustainable urban development, both quantitative and qualitatively, have hardly been assessed. Fitting the design features of cohousing buildings into energy performance calculation models already poses some problems. In addition, everyday practices such as sharing domestic services make energy-demand in <b>co-housing</b> (potentially) different from single-household residence. This paper first presents an inventory of keyelements illustrated by Dutch <b>co-housing</b> projects. On this basis it proposes a model for energy performance assessment that goes beyond the building-related normatised EP-models. Spatial Planning and Strateg...|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis studies {{experiences}} with <b>co-housing</b> {{in relation to}} the Danish social housing sector and planning in general. The focal point of the examination is the lived experiences of <b>co-housing</b> residents. I have collected these experiences through qualitative interviews, inspired by phenomenological theory, with the aim of extracting meaning from subjective life-world narratives. Furthermore a point of departure of the thesis has been a critical view, with roots in critical geography, on ideals of housing, family life and the discourses of planning in relation to this. Overall the interviewed residents express positive {{experiences with}} living in <b>co-housing.</b> One central conclusion is that <b>co-housing</b> offers, for the interviewees, an alternative way of practising their everyday life, as the everyday life in the examined <b>co-housing</b> is structured around practising everyday routines jointly. The most central one of these joint everyday routines is the common meal, which can be said to form a meeting point in the everyday life. The social life of the communities {{is said to be the}} most important thing and the main reason for living in <b>co-housing.</b> Another central conclusion is that <b>co-housing</b> constitutes a practical as well as social community and that the practical everyday routines and social life in the communities are very much related and as such produced in a dialectical way. A central perspective on the <b>co-housing</b> communities is that they balance on a fine line between privacy and community in the spatiality of the everyday. <b>Co-housing</b> offers, for the residents, a duality in everyday life, which contains privacy as well as community. This understanding of <b>co-housing</b> as ‘produced communities’ is related to Lefebvres spatial concept of the ‘production of space’ and Doreen Masseys notion of ‘sense of place’. Theoretical perspectives on community, home and place are furthermore used to grasp a deeper understanding of the empirical narratives. The narratives on everyday life in <b>co-housing</b> are argued to be of relevance for planning of housing within the Danish social housing sector. With Leonie Sandercock’s perspective on planning it is argued that individual narratives contain a meaning and value that can qualify planning practice. The social housing sector has an aim of providing housing to a broad spectre of residents. The <b>co-housing</b> experiences of the interviewees are positive, and alternative, everyday experiences that can inspire planning of housing to be more diverse – in the light of a dominating ideal of housing being single-family housing – and as such it is argued that these kind of experiences can qualify a planning for difference...|$|R

40|$|Following the UN world summits on Climate Change (Paris 2015) and Habitat (Quito 2016), most European cities assume {{an active}} role to {{implement}} internationally agreed goals related to climate change, translated in the so-called New Urban Agenda. At the same time, the urban housing market is increasingly inaccessible for low- and middle-income households. To overcome problems such as failing housing supply and high energy-bills, groups of residents take initiatives to create and manage housing projects collectively; these initiatives are further indicated as ‘co-housing’.   The {{aim of this study}} is to create deeper understanding of the current rise of <b>co-housing</b> in Europe, and what it could mean in urban policies addressing energy transition and climate change. There are two domains where <b>co-housing</b> can become an important asset for urban development: design and maintenance of (semi-) public space for climate change mitigation, and the transition to a circular metabolism in housing. Based on empirical data, this thesis concludes that <b>co-housing</b> projects present relevant models and approaches for reducing the energy consumption and for integrating renewable energies in the general housing stock. Engineers can learn from <b>co-housing</b> pioneers to advance the targets for energy-transition and further develop sustainable cities. The thesis contributes to the emerging body of knowledge with a new understanding of <b>co-housing,</b> analysing its ‘key-features’ with an interdisciplinary framework, in a European context. It adds a new perspective to existing <b>co-housing</b> research, which is dominated by social sciences, by drawing attention to the physical characteristics of <b>co-housing,</b> produced in architectural, planning and engineering processes (the technosphere). The choices made during design and building are not only shaped by the residents’ aims and perception of sustainability, but also influenced by technosphere-related institutions, such as the building-components industry, energy or waste networks and providers, and planning regulations. The professional partners for the projects, such as housing associations and engineers, are equally affected by the institutional context, but their position is different from that of residents. They may for example be more anchored in governmental or professional regulations. To structure this dynamic, the research distinguishes three interrelated aspects: • ACTORS / involved in the (realisation of) projects: social practices of residents and their professional partners in co-creation. • CONTEXT / the structural forces surrounding the projects, specifically the macroinstitutional regimes. This also includes culturally determined interpretations of sustainability, technology, participation, societal roles, sharing, and so on. • TECHNOSPHERE / specifically building technology and utilities, focussing on energyrelated design and engineering of the <b>co-housing</b> projects. The thesis is primarily based on qualitative methods, as it found that reliable quantitative data are as yet unavailable. Looking for effective low-impact energysolution in <b>co-housing,</b> quantitative data remain however necessary and this thesis elaborates on pitfalls and possibilities for their accumulation. Empirical material from Dutch case-studies form the core of the research. Examples were also taken from countries where the re-emergence of <b>co-housing</b> is most visible and articulate: Belgium, France, Germany, the UK and Switzerland. <b>Co-housing</b> continues to develop and gain experiences with competences, such as communication skills and the ability to work cross-disciplinarily. The building industry and engineering professions increasingly call for such capabilities, but resident-led urban development have not yet entered the urbanism and engineering curricula. Therefore, opportunities should be provided for future professionals not only to acquire such capabilities but also to address fundamental questions related to residentinvolvement and democracy. This will enable future professionals to create a balance between ‘bottom-up’ articulated needs on the quality of living environments with large-scale investments in new urban energy, mobility and mutual care networks...|$|R

50|$|In 1945, the California {{legislature}} created Institutes of Industrial Relations (IIR) at the Los Angeles and Berkeley campuses. Clark Kerr and Paul A. Dodd {{were appointed}} {{as the first}} directors of UC Berkeley and UCLA division respectively. Kerr later reminisced, “We came in as the very first effort of this big university {{to make contact with}} the trade unions. It was Earl Warren’s way of saying that the unions were recognized as an important part of California society.” Unlike the University Extension program, the IIR was intended to be under the control of university faculty. In 1964, the University created the Centers for Labor Research and Education (or Labor Centers) at UCLA and UC Berkeley to more directly serve organized labor. However, interest and support for labor studies began to decline during the 1980s with the decline of trade union influence. Budget cuts in the early 1990s eliminated over 50% of the IIR's funding, {{and by the end of}} the decade, UCLA IIR's budget was only half of Berkeley's.

40|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is a mental disorder developed from experience of or {{exposure to a}} traumatic event. In a rodent model of this disorder, we test whether social support, through co-housing, {{may be able to}} alleviate the long term anxiety normally displayed by animals after trauma. There were four groups: a single housed rat (shock or sham), a <b>co-housed</b> group with one shock and two sham rats (e. g. family support) and another <b>co-housed</b> group with three shock rats (e. g. group therapy). The results from a series of anxiety tests showed that the <b>co-housed</b> single shock group displayed decreased anxiety in the open field test, while the <b>co-housed</b> group shock rats showed decreased anxiety in the elevated plus maze test. The single housed shock group showed increased avoidance to the shock side of the shock box by the third exposure to it when compared to the <b>co-housed</b> single shock group. Translated to humans, this suggests that family support and group therapy support may have differential effects that may be beneficial in certain environments. These results also indicate that having social support is generally more effective in reducing anxiety than lack of support...|$|E

Results indicated that an infected chicken failed to initiate viral shedding of H 7 N 9 to naIve <b>co-housed</b> chickens. The infected chicken did, however, successfully transmit the virus to quail (Cotumix sp.) located directly below the infected chicken cage. Oral shedding by indirectly infected quail was, on average, greater than ten-fold that of directly inoculated chickens.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Heifers can calve {{down with}} {{intramammary}} infections (IMI) and udder damage. This {{will have a}} negative impact on their longevity, future milk yield and financial return. <b>Co-housed</b> pre-weaned calves that are fed fresh milk have the opportunity to suckle each other's teats and may infect udders of fellow heifer calves with pathogens present in milk. The prevalence of IMI in pregnant heifers in South Africa (SA) which were <b>co-housed</b> and reared on fresh milk as calves, is not known. Quarter secretion samples from both pregnant heifers (n= 2065) and dry cows (n= 5365) were collected for microbiological analysis from eight SA dairy herds. All heifers tested in this study were <b>co-housed</b> pre-weaning and were fed fresh milk as calves. RESULTS: The prevalence of coagulase negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, environmental streptococci, coliforms and samples with no bacterial growth in heifers was 26 %, 0. 9 %, 0. 08 %, 1. 4 %, 0. 4 % and 66 %, respectively. The overall prevalence ratio between heifers and cows for Staphylococcus aureus IMI was 0. 76 (95 % CI: 0. 59, 0. 98). Four of the individual herds had prevalence ratios of less than one (p< 0. 05), one herd had a prevalence ratio of 3. 15 (95 % CI: 1. 52, 6. 32), and the remaining 3 herds had a prevalence ratio not significantly different from 1. 0. Marginally significant differences were found between Staphylococcus aureus IMI in pregnant heifers compared to cows in their second and later lactations (p= 0. 06, p= 0. 05, respectively) but no significant differences between heifers and cows in their first lactation. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Streptococcus agalactiae IMI in heifers came as a surprise, especially as herd infection rates were low. The high prevalence ratio of Staphylococcus aureus between heifers and cows in one herd warrants further investigation due to the potential danger of udder damage in a young cow at the start of her productive life. The IMI in heifers with host adapted pathogens can also act as a source of new IMI for lactating dairy cows...|$|E

The results and analysis are presented at different case study levels, with the discussion and conclusions following this. Findings – The findings show that the physical environment and common areas have an important role to activate residents. When well-designed common areas exist, a higher level of engagement can be achieved by getting residents involved in the planning and running of activities. Research limitations/implications – This paper discusses residents’ experiences in two Finnish housing settings and it focuses on the housing market in Finland.

40|$|The {{association}} between intestinal diseases, mood disorders and cognitive deficits is increasingly recognized. Previous studies from our lab suggest that chronic intestinal diseases, such as infection with an enteric pathogen, {{in combination with}} an acute psychological stressor (water avoidance stress [WAS]), can induce anxiety-like behavior and memory defects in mice. In our current study, we hypothesized that nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod) receptors, as important modulators of homeostasis between the host immune system and the gut microbiota, are integral regulators of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Using Nod 1 /Nod 2 double knockout (NodDKO) mice, we performed behavioral testing, qPCR analysis of stool bacterial DNA, and serum corticosterone analysis. Compared to wild type (WT) controls (C 57 BL/ 6), NodDKO mice displayed anxiety- like behaviors (light/dark box test, p< 0. 001) and deficits in recognition memory (novel object recognition [NOR] test, p< 0. 001) following exposure to a single session of WAS. WT and NodDKO mice differed {{in the composition of}} their microbiota in 4 of 7 bacterial groups studied by qPCR, indicating the presence of intestinal dysbiosis in NodDKO mice. Baseline elevated levels of serum corticosterone were also observed in NodDKO mice. To evaluate a potential role for the microbiota in mediating these effects given the presence of dysbiosis in NodDKO mice, WT and NodDKO mice were <b>co-housed</b> at weaning and behavior assessed in adulthood. Co-housing indicated that Nod 1 /Nod 2 receptors are important for recognition memory and anxiety-like behavior, with defects remaining despite partial microbiota normalization. Interestingly, co-housing also ameliorated the WAS-induced spike in corticosterone levels in <b>co-housed</b> WT and NodDKO mice. Therefore, our study indicates that Nod receptors serve as key signaling molecules, potentially acting via the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, to modulate the MGB axis in mic...|$|E
