Formulation was prepared by ionotropic external gelation technique using Ca+ 2 and Al+ 3 ions. The prepared beads were characterized for Entrapment efficiency, Scanning electron microscopy, Swelling kinetics, Release behavior of beads by Kinetics modeling. Ca+ 2 <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> beads showed sustained release of drug for about 8 hr while Al+ 3 <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> beads shown sustained release of drug about 10 hrs. The entrapment efficiency was also lesser in case of Ca+ 2 <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> beads. The alginate beads swelled and eventually disintegrated in phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8).

40|$|Ion {{irradiation}} {{has been}} investigated as a route for the preparation of mechanically stable and highly durable <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> sulphonated PEEK for fuel cell application. The formation of <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> was confirmed by solvent extraction using the well known Charlsby–Pinner equation. The DSC {{results indicated that the}} <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> retard the crystallization, but no changes were observed in the mechanism of crystallization. The thermal kinetic data for irradiated PEEK quantitatively suggest that these films still have sufficient thermal stability for long term applications as fuel cell membranes. Analysis of the dielectric response by Cole-Cole, Havrilak and Negami and Williams and Watts equations indicated that the dipole relaxation was broadened and becoming more asymmetric with <b>cross</b> <b>link</b> density. The sulphonation of the <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> PEEK in concentrated sulphuric acid indicated that the rate of reaction decreased with <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> density and was consistent with diffusion control kinetics. Increasing <b>cross</b> <b>link</b> density resulted in more bound water in the equilibrated membranes and the nano-structure present was comparable to that of Nafion. <b>Cross</b> <b>linking</b> improved the chemical stability of PEMs in particular in methanol solution. The measurement of power output and energy efficiency suggested that the <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> PEMs produced are promising candidates to replace Nafion membranes but more information are required, in particular on their long term stability under fuel cell operating conditions.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were carried out to study the changes in the characteristics of hydrogels. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) was performed to study microstructure of hydrogels. The result showed that all formulated hydrogels had excellent floating behavior.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to prepare, characterize and to evaluate a new modified starch namely <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea for its application in the formulation of sustained release floating tablets as rate controlling polymer. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea was prepared and characterized by various physical properties and IR spectra. Sustained release floating tablets of three anti-hypertensive drugs namely Captopril, Losartan and Valsartan were formulated employing <b>cross</b> <b>Linked</b> starch Urea as rate controlling polymer and were evaluated. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea prepared by gelatinizing potato starch in the presence of urea and calcium chloride was insoluble in water and aqueous fluids of acidic and alkaline pHs. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea exhibited good swelling in water. The swelling index was 630. 2 %. As crosslinked starch urea is insoluble and has good swelling in water, it is considered suitable as release retarding and rate controlling matrix polymer for sustained release floating tablets. stained release tablets of (i) captopril, (ii) losartan and (iii) valsartan prepared using <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea as matrix polymer were non disintegrating in water, acidic (pH 1. 2) and alkaline (pH 7. 4) fluids and gave slow and controlled release over longer periods of time. In each case the release rate depended on the strength or concentration of <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea polymer in the tablets. A good linear relationship was observed between percent polymer in the matrix tablets and release rate (K 0) with all the three drugs indicating that the <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea polymer is an efficient rate controlling polymer suitable for design of sustained release tablets. Drug release from these SR tablets was by diffusion mechanism, fickian diffusion in the case of tablets containing low percent of polymer and non fickian (anamalous) diffusion in the case of tablets containing high percent of polymer. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea alone and in combination with sodium bicarbonate (gas generating agent) was found not suitable for formulation of floating tablets though it has good rate controlling effect for formulation of sustained release tablets. When <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea was used along with bees wax (lipohilic polymer) and starch acetate (good film forming polymer) it was found suitable for formulation of floating tablets. Floating tablets formulated with <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea (50 %) as matrix polymer, Bees wax (5 %) and starch acetate (5 %) as floating enhancers and sodium bicarbonate as gas generating agent exhibited good floating over 13 – 14 hrs with a floating lag time of 45 – 60 seconds. Drug release from these floating tablets was spread over 12 hrs with all the three drugs studied. The drug release from these tablets was by non fickian (anomalous) diffusion. Thus <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea was found to be a good rate controlling polymer for sustained release tablets and along with bees wax and starch acetate it was also a good matrix polymer for floating tablets.

40|$|Fibrinogen degradation, fibrin polymerisation, and the {{insertion}} of <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> into fibrin by fibrin stabilising factor lead to the appearance of new antigenic determinants. Antibodies against these antigenic sites may react specifically with the derivatives {{but not with the}} parent molecules. We have utilised a monoclonal antibody, which interacts with the <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> fragment D dimer and related high molecular weight fibrin derivatives, to develop an enzyme immunoassay which measures <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> fibrin derivatives in plasma and serum using D dimer as standard. Mean concentration in plasma from normal subjects was 75 ng/ml with an upper limit of about 144 ng/ml. Concentrations in patients with pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were raised in all cases. Confirmation of the specific increase of <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> fibrin derivatives in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation was obtained by parallel monitoring of their fibrin degradation products in serum using affinity chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

50|$|Andersen, in 1996, {{discovered}} that the tyrosine residues are involved in chemically covalent cross-links in many forms such as dityrosine, trityrosine, and tetratyrosine. Primarily, in resilin, tyrosine and dityrosine served as the chemical cross-links, in which R groups of Tyrosine and Dityrosine add to {{the backbone of the}} growing peptide chain. Andersen came to this conclusion based on a study involving these two compounds in which he was able to rule out other forms of <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> such as disulfide bridges, ester groups, and amide bonds. Though the mechanism of cross-linking of Tyrosine is understood that occurs through radical initiation, the <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> of resilin still remains a mystery. <b>Cross</b> <b>linking</b> of resilin occurs very quickly and this is possibly a result of temperature. At increasing temperature, the rate of <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> of the residues increases and leads to a highly cross-linked resilin network.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{multi-step}} biosynthesis of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme {{involves a}} variety of accessory proteins. To further understand this process, a Strep-tag II variant of the large subunit of Escherichia coli hydrogenase 3, HycE, was constructed to enable isolation of protein complexes. A complex with SlyD, a chaperone protein implicated in hydrogenase production through association with the nickel-binding accessory protein HypB, was observed. A SlyD–HycE interaction preceding both iron and nickel insertion to the enzyme was detected, mediated by the chaperone domain of SlyD, and independent of HypB. These results support a model of several roles for SlyD during hydrogenase maturation.

40|$|Cisplatin is an {{extremely}} effective chemotherapeutic agent used {{for the treatment of}} testicular and other solid tumours. It induces a variety of structural modifications in DNA, the most abundant being the GpG- and ApG- 1, 2 -intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> formed between adjacent purine bases. These <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> account for approximately 90 % of cisplatin-induced DNA damage and are thought to be responsible for the cytotoxic activity of the drug. In human cells, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) process removes the intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> from the genome, the efficiency of which is likely to be an important determinant of cisplatin cytotoxicity. We have investigated whether the p 53 tumour suppressor status affects global NER of cisplatin-induced intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> in human cells. We have used a (32) P-postlabelling method to monitor the removal of GpG- and ApG-intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> from two human cell models (the 041 TR system, in which p 53 is regulated by a tetracycline-inducible promoter, together with WI 38 fibroblasts and the SV 40 -transformed derivative VA 13) that each differ in p 53 status. We demonstrate that the absence of functional p 53 leads to persistence of both cisplatin-induced intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> in the genome, suggesting that p 53 regulates NER of these DNA lesions. This observation extends the role of p 53 in NER beyond enhancing the removal of environmentally induced DNA lesions to include those of clinical origin. Given the frequency of p 53 mutations in human tumours, these results may have implications for the use of cisplatin in cancer chemotherapy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{neutrophil}} Fc receptor (Fc gamma R) and CD 59 signalling {{responses in}} normal healthy subjects and patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Intracellular free calcium concentrations were measured in neutrophils loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura- 2, using a spectrofluorimeter. RESULTS: Basal intracellular calcium ion concentrations {{were similar in}} both groups when no primary antibody, CD 59, or CD 32 (Fc gamma RIII) antibody was added. When CD 16 (Fc gamma RIII) antibody was added, there was a significantly greater basal calcium concentration in the patient group compared with the control group. Transient cytosolic calcium ion fluxes were observed after binding Fc gamma RII, Fc gamma RIII, or CD 59 with specific monoclonal antibodies and <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> with the F(ab) 2 fragment of sheep antimouse IgG. Peak concentrations of intracellular free calcium, [Ca 2 +]i, after <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> {{each of the three}} receptors, were comparable between normal healthy donors and patients with RA.
