25|$|Assembly {{language}} {{is useful in}} reverse engineering. Many programs are distributed only in machine <b>code</b> <b>form</b> which is straightforward to translate into assembly language, but more difficult to translate into a higher-level language. Tools such as the Interactive Disassembler make extensive use of disassembly for such a purpose. This technique is used by hackers to crack commercial software, and competitors to produce software with similar results from competing companies.|$|E

The traditional <b>code</b> <b>forms,</b> such as SYNOP, CLIMAT and TEMP, are character-based and their coding is position-based. Newer WMO <b>code</b> <b>forms</b> are designed for portability, extensibility and universality. These are BUFR, CREX, and, for gridded geo-positioned data, GRIB.|$|R

25|$|Adventure International {{was founded}} by Scott Adams (not to be {{confused}} with the creator of Dilbert). In 1978, Adams wrote Adventureland, which was loosely patterned after (the original) Colossal Cave Adventure. He took out a small ad in a computer magazine in order to promote and sell Adventureland, thus creating the first commercial adventure game. In 1979 he founded Adventure International, the first commercial publisher of interactive fiction. That same year, Dog Star Adventure was published in source <b>code</b> <b>form</b> in SoftSide, spawning legions of similar games in BASIC.|$|E
25|$|Experience in India gave Stephen {{opportunity}} {{for his next}} activity. The government of India had been driven by {{the conditions of the}} Indian judicial system to recast a considerable part of the English law which had been informally imported. Criminal law procedure, and a good deal of commercial law, had been or were being put into easily understood language, intelligible to civilian magistrates. The rational substance of the law was preserved, while disorder and excessive technicalities were removed. Using Jeremy Bentham's ideal of codification, he attempted to get the same principles put into practice in the United Kingdom. In spite of six years of effort on this task, Stephen was largely unsuccessful in making any reforms. Stephen also privately published digests in <b>code</b> <b>form</b> of the law of evidence and criminal law.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the OLPC {{project was}} heavily criticised over Red Hat's {{non-disclosure}} agreement (NDA) with Marvell concerning the wireless device in OLPC, {{especially in light}} of the OLPC project being positioned as an open-source friendly initiative. An open letter for documentation was inked by Theo de Raadt (a recipient of the 2004 Award for the Advancement of Free Software), and the initiative for open documentation has been supported by Richard Stallman, the President of the Free Software Foundation. De Raadt later clarified that he finds an issue with OLPC having proprietary firmware files that are not allowed to be independently re-distributed (even in the binary form) by third-party operating systems like OpenBSD, as well as receiving no documentation to write the necessary drivers for the operating system. De Raadt has pointed out that the OpenBSD project requires no firmware source code, and no low-level documentation to work on firmware, only requiring the binary distribution rights and documentation to interface with the said binary firmware that runs outside of the main CPU, a quite simple request that is generally honoured by many other wireless device vendors like Ralink. Stallman fully agreed with de Raadt's request to open up the documentation, since Stallman is known to hold an even stronger and more idealistic position in regards to the proprietary components, and requires that even the firmware that runs outside of the main CPU must be provided in its source <b>code</b> <b>form,</b> something de Raadt does not require. De Raadt later has had to point out that such more idealistic and less realistic position has instead been misattributed to OpenBSD's more practical approach to make it look unreasonable, and stood on record that OpenBSD's position is much easier to satisfy, yet it nonetheless remained unresolved.|$|E

2500|$|While BMC's most {{significant}} asset {{is perhaps a}} workforce of skilled software engineers, the firm owns considerable intellectual property {{in the form of}} software code. It elaborated how it protects this property in an SEC filing (2002): [...] "We distribute our products in object <b>code</b> <b>form</b> and rely upon contract, trade secret, copyright and patent laws to protect our intellectual property. The license agreements under which customers use our products restrict the customer's use to its own operations and prohibit disclosure to third persons. We now distribute certain of our products on a shrink-wrap basis, and the enforceability of such restrictions in a shrink-wrap license is unproven in certain jurisdictions. Also, notwithstanding those restrictions, it is possible for other persons to obtain copies of our products in object <b>code</b> <b>form.</b> We believe that obtaining such copies would have limited value without access to the product's source code, which we keep highly confidential. In addition, we employ protective measures such as CPU dependent passwords, expiring passwords and time-based trials." ...|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{six hundred}} Linux {{distributions}} exist, with close to five hundred {{out of those}} in active development. [...] Because of the huge availability of software, distributions have taken {{a wide variety of}} forms, including those suitable for use on desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones and tablets, as well as minimal environments typically for use in embedded systems. [...] There are commercially backed distributions, such as Fedora (Red Hat), openSUSE (SUSE) and Ubuntu (Canonical Ltd.), and entirely community-driven distributions, such as Debian, Slackware, Gentoo and Arch Linux. Most distributions come ready to use and pre-compiled for a specific instruction set, while some distributions (such as Gentoo) are distributed mostly in source <b>code</b> <b>form</b> and compiled locally during installation.|$|E
