60|$|At {{last the}} sun once more {{broke through the}} clouds and the journey of the {{tourists}} was resumed. Close to the city the roads were in fairly good condition, but farther out they soon found evidences of the tremendous downpour of the days before. Deep gullies had been <b>cut</b> <b>here</b> and there, and occasionally they came across washed-out trees and brushwood.|$|E

[...] "In the garden at Fernex is a long berceau walk, closely arched over with clipped horn-beam--a verdant cloister, with gaps <b>cut</b> <b>here</b> and there, admitting {{a glimpse of the}} prospect. Here Voltaire used to walk up and down, and dictate to his secretary."--Handbook for Switzerland, p. 174.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars, stating: [...] "All eight <b>cuts</b> <b>here</b> move with similar {{fluidity}} {{and offer a}} very gritty and realist approach {{to the roots of}} hard bop. Highly recommended." ...|$|R

5000|$|In the July 21, 1993, {{issue of}} St. Petersburg Times, {{a review of}} the album spoke of the song, stating [...] "Sure, there are a few radio-ready <b>cuts</b> <b>here</b> ("Show Me Heaven" [...] and [...] "I've Always Got You"), but overall the album is fairly bland guitar-and-synthesizer formula." ...|$|R
60|$|On they came, {{until they}} reached the edge of the <b>cut.</b> <b>Here</b> some plunged in, others were pushed in by the {{pressure}} from behind. Those who could swim were pulled down by their struggling comrades. Some got across and tried to climb the slippery side of the dike, but fell back and were seized by the Aztecs; whose canoes now dashed up, and added to the confusion by hurling a storm of missiles into the crowd.|$|E
60|$|The melting ice {{had formed}} a pool {{in the bottom of}} the gorge. Frona {{stretched}} out full length, and dipped her hot mouth in its coolness. And lying as she did, the soles of her dilapidated moccasins, or rather the soles of her feet (for moccasins and stockings had gone in shreds), were turned upward. They were very white, and from contact with the ice were bruised and <b>cut.</b> <b>Here</b> and there the blood oozed out, and from one of the toes it streamed steadily.|$|E

Oh, I've known more than one Eastern girl to go home without ever {{learning}} what we really are <b>cut</b> <b>here.</b> Miss Hammond, Gene Stewart is a fiend when he's drunk. All the same I know, whatever he did, he meant no shame to you. Come now, don't think about it again to-night." [...] She took up the lamp and led Madeline into a little room.

6000|$|But {{there are}} much simpler methods {{by which the}} vagaries of light may be made amusing, and among {{the best of these}} are what are called [...] "Chinese shadows." [...] These require a little ingenuity, but they are {{certainly}} simple enough. They consist of nothing but a card or paper, upon which the lights of the picture intended to be represented are cut out. When this is held between a candle and a wall, a startling shadow-image may be produced, which one would not imagine to have any connection with the card, unless he had studied the manner in which said card was <b>cut.</b> <b>Here</b> is a picture of a company amusing themselves with these cards. No one would suppose that the card which the young man is holding in his hand bore the least resemblance to a lion's head, but there is no mistaking the shadow on the wall.|$|E
60|$|We camped on {{a saddle}} {{near the village}} of Sunnook, at 4000 feet above the sea; and {{on the last day of}} the year we visited this most {{interesting}} monastic establishment: ascending from our camp along the ridge by a narrow path, <b>cut</b> <b>here</b> and there into steps, and passing many rocks covered with inscriptions, broken walls of mendongs, and other remains of the via sacra between the village and temple. At one spot we found a fissure emitting hot vapour of the temperature of 65.5 degrees, that of the air being about 50 degrees. It was simply a hole amongst the rocks; and near the Rungeet a similar one is said to occur, whose temperature fluctuates considerably with the season. It is very remarkable that such an isolated spring should exist on the top of a sharp ridge, 2,800 feet above the bottom of this deep valley.|$|E
60|$|The {{scene was}} weird enough without Wiles's eye {{to add to}} its wild picturesqueness. The {{mountain}} towered above,--a heavy Rembrandtish mass of black shadow,--sharply <b>cut</b> <b>here</b> and there against a sky so inconceivably remote that the world-sick soul must have despaired of ever reaching so far, or of climbing its steel-blue walls. The stars were large, keen, and brilliant, but cold and steadfast. They did not dance nor twinkle in their adamantine setting. The furnace fire painted {{the faces of the}} men an Indian red, glanced on brightly colored blanket and serape, but was eventually caught and absorbed in the waiting shadows of the black mountain, scarcely twenty feet from the furnace door. The low, half-sung, half-whispered foreign speech of the group, the roaring of the furnace, and the quick, sharp yelp of a coyote on the plain below were the only sounds that broke the awful silence of the hills.|$|E
40|$|Glover and Sherali (2003) {{introduced}} a wide class of Foundation-Penalty (FP) cuts for GUB and ordinary mixed-integer programs. The FP cuts {{are easy to}} generate by exploiting routine branch-and-bound penalty calculations, and encompass other classical cuts such as disjunctive cuts, lift-and-project cuts, convexity cuts, Gomory cuts, and mixed-integer rounding <b>cuts.</b> <b>Here</b> we focus on two special classes of FP cuts, called balanced FP cuts and multi-level balanced FP cuts, and exhibit their relationship to special forms of disjunctive cuts. A numerical example illustrates the rich variety of cuts that can be generated...|$|R

Several <b>cuts</b> <b>here,</b> including the closing Medley and My Baby (My Baby, My Own) were originally intended for the abandoned To the Baby album Diana also worked on in this period. The production was clean and uncluttered, if slightly, unadventurous and straight forward. Diana would also begin working with her brother/songwriter, Arthur [...] "T-Boy" [...] Ross during these sessions as he co-wrote songs she would eventually record and release.|$|R

60|$|Cheyenne County was an {{enormous}} expanse of hilly plain, if the two words may be used together. Low heights of sharp ascent, pyramid-shaped buttes, and wide benches (<b>cut</b> <b>here</b> and there by small creek valleys) made up its surface, which, broadly considered, was only the vast, treeless, slowly-rising eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. At long distances, on the flat, sandy river, groups of squat and squalid ranch buildings huddled as if to escape the wind. For years {{it has been a}} superb range for cattle, and up till the coming of the first settlements on the Cannon Ball, it had been parceled out among a few big firms, who cut Government timber, dug Government stone, and pastured on Government grass. When the wolves took a few ponies, the ranchers seized the opportunity to make furious outcry and bring in the Government troops to keep the Indians in awe, and so possessed the land in serenity. Nothing could be more perfect, more commodious.|$|E
6000|$|And now {{she came}} on for her second dance, {{assisted}} this time only {{by her own}} image reflected in a little weedy pool about {{the middle of the}} stage. From the programme Fiorsen read, [...] "Ophelia's last dance," [...] and again he grinned. In a clinging sea-green gown, <b>cut</b> <b>here</b> and there to show her inevitable legs, with marguerites and corn-flowers in her unbound hair, she circled her own reflection, languid, pale, desolate; then slowly gaining the abandon needful to a full display, danced with frenzy till, in a gleam of limelight, she sank into the apparent water and floated among paper water-lilies on her back. Lovely she looked there, with her eyes still open, her lips parted, her hair trailing behind. And again Fiorsen raised his hands high to clap, and again called out: 'Brava!' But the curtain fell, and Ophelia did not reappear. Was it the sight of him, or was she preserving the illusion that she was drowned? That [...] "arty" [...] touch would be just like her.|$|E
60|$|The {{meeting of}} the adherents was {{appointed}} for the next afternoon. We decided to have it on the Queen's Stair-way, which is a long flight of steps, cut in the solid limestone, and leading up out of a deep and shadowy ravine, where {{the people of the}} town many years ago cut out the calcareous material for their houses. There has been no stone <b>cut</b> <b>here</b> for a long time, and the walls of the ravine, which stand up as straight as the wall of a house, are darkened by age and a good deal covered up by vines. At the bottom, {{on each side of the}} pathway which runs through the ravine to the town, bushes and plants of various semi-tropical kinds grow thick and close. At the top of the flight of stairs are open fields and an old fort. Altogether, this was considered a quiet and suitable place for a meeting of a band of revolutionists. We could not have met in the silk-cotton tree, for we should have attracted too much attention, and, besides, the hotel-clerk would have routed us out.|$|E
5000|$|Billboard {{magazine}} in 1982 gave a positive albeit {{brief review of}} the album, saying [...] "Richard has made {{some of the best}} pop singles of recent years, and several <b>cuts</b> <b>here</b> are worthy to join that list." [...] The album was described as [...] "Richard's latest continues the pattern of his recent LPs, concentrating on sleek, buoyant pop tracks that bristle with excitement. There are also a few ballads for balance, including two traditional pieces - 'The Water is Wide' and 'Little Town,' where a new melody was put to the Christmas favourite 'Oh Little Town of Bethlehem'." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{first week}} or two went on happily enough in getting our little new pet of a house into trimness and good order; for {{as it had been}} long for sale, of course there was any amount of little repairs that had been left to amuse the leisure hours of the purchaser. Here a {{doorstep}} had given way, and needed replacing; there a shutter hung loose, and wanted a hinge; abundance of glass needed setting; and as to painting and papering, there was no end to that. Then my wife wanted a door <b>cut</b> <b>here,</b> to make our bedroom more convenient, and a china closet knocked up there, where no china closet before had been. We even ventured on throwing out a bay-window from our sitting-room, because we had luckily lighted on a workman who was so cheap that it was an actual saving of money to employ him. And to be sure our darling little cottage did lift up its head wonderfully for all this garnishing and furbishing. I got up early every morning, and nailed up the rosebushes, and my wife got up and watered geraniums, and both flattered ourselves and each other on our early hours and thrifty habits. But soon, like Adam and Eve in Paradise, we found our little domain to ask more hands than ours to get it into shape. So says I to my wife, [...] "I will bring out a gardener when I come next time, and he shall lay the garden out, and get it into order; and after that I can easily keep it by the work of my leisure hours." ...|$|E
60|$|When he had gone, Augustus freed {{both hands}} from the manacles and unfastened his feet. He then {{turned down the}} head of the {{mattress}} on which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks, as closely as possible {{to the floor of the}} berth. He chose to <b>cut</b> <b>here,</b> because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to conceal what had been done by letting {{the head of the}} mattress fall into its proper position. For the remainder of the day, however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided the plank. It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the sea-stores of Captain Barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig. These circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and Augustus; for, had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to reach me. As it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design. It was near daybreak, however, before he completed the second division of the board (which was about a foot above the first cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage through with facility to the main orlop deck. Having got here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being barely room enough left for his body. Upon reaching the hatch he found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing between two rows of the casks. It was now too late, however, to attempt getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the lower hold. He therefore resolved to return, and wait till the next night. With this design, he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little detention as possible when he should come again. No sooner had he loosened it than Tiger sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the covering with his paws. There could be no doubt, from his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and Augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him down. He now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was especially desirable that I should make no attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended. After-events proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did; for, had it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we discuss how to {{maximize}} the double-parton scattering (DPS) contribution in four-jet production by selecting kinematical <b>cuts.</b> <b>Here</b> both single-parton and double-parton scattering effects are calculated in the k_T-factorization approach, following our recent developments of relevant methods and tools. Several differential distributions are shown and discussed {{in the context of}} future searches for DPS effects, such as rapidity of jets, rapidity distance, and azimuthal correlations between jets. The dependences of the relative DPS amount is studied as function of those observables. The regions with an enhanced DPS contribution are identified. Future experimental explorations could extract more precise values of σ_eff and its potential dependence on kinematical variables. Comment: 17 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
