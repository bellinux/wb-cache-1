5|$|The {{engineering}} and prototyping for Asteroid {{was done by}} Alcorn. The game is encoded entirely in discrete electronic components, like Atari's earlier games, and unlike later computer-based arcade games; the graphics are all simple line elements {{with the exception of}} the spacecraft, which are generated based on diodes on the circuit board arranged in the shape of half of a ship to represent the shape they <b>create.</b> <b>That</b> half ship is mirrored on the screen, similar to the diode array in Computer Space, which generated eight directions of a rotating ship with a mirrored four images. The game was completed quickly, and Alcorn soon moved on to Atari's third game, Gotcha. When the game was complete, the design was given to Midway to sell under that name, only for Atari to produce a nearly identical version itself titled Space Race, which was released on July 16, 1973.|$|E
25|$|Waddell {{spent the}} early 1960s in Mexico, {{continuing}} {{to create new}} works and studying the casting process. In September 1963 a bomb exploded in a church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four young girls. This prompted Waddell to <b>create</b> <b>That</b> Which Might Have Been: Birmingham 1963, a work that was set up at the First Unitarian Universalist Church in Phoenix in 1969. A second casting was later installed at the Carver Museum and Cultural Center in Phoenix.|$|E

25|$|Since it {{presumed that}} Congress's {{failure to act}} in the years since Federal Baseball Club was an {{implicit}} expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read as having done more to <b>create</b> <b>that</b> exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned per curiam majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice (William O. Douglas) would express his regret at having joined the majority when Toolson was again upheld in the similar Flood v. Kuhn.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} is: for {{the seven}} million people who watched it, did it feel authentic, did it {{create a sense of}} period? ...We were creating a realistic world within a worldâ€“ a world of damsels and heroes and a huge amount of excitement. That, for me, is the priority. Did it <b>create</b> <b>that</b> world? It absolutely did. That's not to say that we don't work increasingly hard to get everything right. But it's hard to get all the details right when it's a 21st century drama, never mind anything earlier.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Kashyap {{directed}} That Day After Everyday, a 20-minute short-film {{that was}} released on YouTube; starring Radhika Apte, Geetanjali Thapa and Sandhya Mridul. It showed the story of three working women facing troubles everyday, {{both inside and outside}} their houses and how they overcome them. Dealing with issues like eve teasing and public molestation, the video got four lakh hits in two days. Speaking about the purpose of the project, Kashyap showed his intention to make people feel angry: [...] "..the idea was not to offer a solution, just show something to <b>create</b> <b>that</b> feeling".|$|E

500|$|Filming took {{around six}} weeks, {{relatively}} short for a thriller; Weisz said most take {{about three months}} to complete. Producers used hand-held cameras and had a lower budget than usual for the genre. Kondracki said filming in Eastern Europe was crucial, [...] "In a story such as this, it's more about what you don't see, {{so you need to}} <b>create</b> <b>that</b> world." [...] The Carpathian Mountains in Romania served as the backdrop for the war-ravaged Sarajevo of the late 1990s. Scenes set in UN buildings were filmed in Toronto. Most outdoor scenes are set at night; daytime shots often appear bleak, gray and overcast. This, coupled with a grainy texture, helped create a documentary feel.|$|E
500|$|For {{the closing}} reveal {{involving}} Melisandre, {{the director of}} the episode stated that a similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was used, with Carice van Houten wearing prosthetic makeup for the face that was then transposed onto the real body of an old woman. Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So if you try to <b>create</b> <b>that,</b> then you're creating something that looks beyond our known reality. Here you feel like she's very old without putting a number on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Lasseter's {{intention}} with {{a sequel}} was {{to respect the}} original film and <b>create</b> <b>that</b> world again. The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting, how a toy would feel {{if it were not}} played with by a child or, worse, a child growing out of a toy. Brannon suggested the idea of a yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact. The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of A Tin Toy Christmas, an original half-hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990. [...] The obsessive toy collector named Al McWhiggin, who had appeared in a draft of Toy Story but was later expunged, was inserted into the film. Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself.|$|E

500|$|The {{story of}} Adam causing Ashley's {{miscarriage}} was named [...] "editor's choice" [...] by the magazine. Engen {{was nominated for}} a SoapCentral Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2009. Some fans were upset that Adam and Rafe's [...] "sex scene" [...] was implied rather than shown onscreen; Branco spoke out about the issue, saying, [...] "ilming a sex scene between a straight and gay man could come off as offensive. Firstly, Adam would have to appear uncomfortable in the situation which could anger gay right groups, etc." [...] Muhney also approved of the decision not to show the sex scene, saying, [...] "or me, the way it was done was tasteful and it almost makes the audience wonder what exactly happened. You can <b>create</b> <b>that</b> in your head and try to interpret it by how the characters reacted afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Jacksonville" [...] premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. James Poniewozik of Time Magazine {{called it}} [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "well-acted", especially liking John Noble's performance. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining [...] "I liked 'Jacksonville' {{for the way}} it plunged directly {{into the heart of}} the show's mythology for the first time in a while, and even if it didn't tell us much we didn't already know, having the story become more personal for our heroes served to <b>create</b> <b>that</b> unsettled feeling at which Fringe excels". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly loved [...] "Jacksonville", believing it to be a [...] "tremendously moving, startling episode" [...] and [...] "one of [...] finest hours". AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw particularly praised the scene of Olivia trying to comfort her younger self, and then confronting Walter over it. She also felt Olivia's loss of memory to be [...] "interesting," [...] and became [...] "practically gleeful" [...] at her and Peter's near kiss.|$|E
500|$|The Avalanches have {{described}} the album as a [...] "road trip" [...] in a [...] "big, wide, expansive country like Australia." [...] For inspiration, the group looked back on their teenage years of driving {{around the country and}} suburbia listening to music. The record is supposed to [...] "capture that feeling of growing up...jumping in the car and hitting the road with a six-pack and heading out to the bush." [...] The album attempts to capture the [...] "halfway between happy and sad" [...] feeling similar to old Beach Boys records which are a constant inspiration for the group. Chater felt that this feeling is what made Since I Left You a success, and they have continuously strived to <b>create</b> <b>that</b> feeling. Di Blasi thinks of Wildflower as a free-spirited person who does what they wish regardless of conventionality. The album features many samples from 1960s psychedelic music and relates to the era through counterculture and anti-establishment themes.|$|E

500|$|The final scene, {{featuring}} Burt's face superimposed {{onto the}} cityscape, {{was created by}} special effects supervisor Mat Beck. The only actual footage in the scene is a pull-back shot of the carnival that was filmed 110 {{feet in the air}} via crane. A CGI cityscape was then created that resembled Burt Reynolds' head. The two shots were sewn together, and a blur effect was added to [...] " [...] it sell". An alternate version of the scene was created that featured Chris Carter's head instead of Reynolds'. This version was included as a bonus feature on the season nine DVD set. The score for the episode, {{like the rest of the}} series, was composed by Mark Snow. Snow based much of the music in the episode on records made by Karl ZÃ©ro, on the request of Carter. Carter later noted that [...] "I had heard his music and it was so far out and it fit with exactly what I wanted to do because I wanted to recreate [...] Little Italy. [...] I wanted to <b>create</b> <b>that</b> festival." ...|$|E
500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to <b>create</b> <b>that</b> space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward who does it all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, [...] "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Loyalty to Loyaltys title {{comes from}} a paper {{of the same name}} by American philosopher Josiah Royce, in which he {{challenged}} Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas about [...] "will to power" [...] and the Ã¼bermensch, [...] "saying that the ultimate pursuit of mankind should be to live in community and embrace each other, not to try to trample each other and rise to the top." [...] Maust said that he could relate to that phrase with the band saying that it's [...] "very similar to how [...] conduct ourselves, the way that [...] write songs and the way that [...] view each other in the band. No one person is writing for the other person, but we are loyal to each other. We're loyal to loyalty." [...] For the recording process, Maust explained that they took four months to experiment with deeper and grittier sounds they were comfortable with, compared to the first record that took eight days to <b>create</b> <b>that</b> carried [...] "a much more polished, for-radio sound." [...] He also commented that the overall dark tone throughout the album was the cause of constant touring across Europe, but said that it did more good than harm for the band because it led to them crafting songs that weren't written from the perspective of being on the road.|$|E

500|$|While {{the first}} five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, {{production}} of the show's sixth season was based in Los Angeles, California. The scenes {{taking place in the}} hangar were filmed at the Marine Corps Air Station Tustin in Tustin, California. The hangar, constructed in 1942 as an airship base, {{is one of the largest}} all-wooden hangars in the United States. Bill Roe, director of photography, and Rob Bowman were tasked with lighting the entire structure for the episode's teaser and climax, a job that Spotnitz later called [...] "amazing". He noted that, after the series' move to Los Angeles, production costs had risen, forcing the show to cut down on its [...] "astonishing production values". However, he applauded the use of the hangar, noting that it [...] "was a way to try and <b>create</b> <b>that</b> cinematic scale and still keep [...] affordable". The episode also revisits trains as a setting, something that had previously been done in the third season episodes [...] "731" [...] and [...] "Nisei". However, for budgetary reasons, the scenes taking place on the trains did not take up much screen time. To give the effect that the train carrying Cassandra Spender is moving at a high speed, Manners utilized [...] "sound effects, music, clever camera angles and quick cutting". In reality, the train was never moving faster than eight miles an hour.|$|E
