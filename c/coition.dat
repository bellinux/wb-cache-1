40|$|Dubowitz et al. {{have offered}} a scoring system for {{estimating}} the gestational age of newborn babies. If {{the system is}} applied to twin pairs, the heavier twin is generally estimated {{to have a greater}} gestational age than the lighter one. Previously this has been interpreted as a flaw in the scoring system. However, {{it may well be that}} in some twin pairs the gestational ages are slightly different and that therefore, the heavier twin would be expected to have a greater gestational age. Such cases would arise through superfecundation (the formation of two zygotes from different <b>coitions).</b> Superfecundation can be proved only in rare case (those with two fathers). It can be argued that the rarity of such cases is accounted for by the rarity with which women expose themselves to the risk of bearing such twins (and by the improbability of detection), rather than by the rarity of superfecundation. It is inferred that superfecundation by the same man is relatively common and that therefore dizygotic twins quite often have different gestational ages. The scoring system of Dubowitz can be tested for bias by submitting monozygotic pairs to it: the association between weight and estimated gestational age should be absent in such pairs. If the system proves free of such bias, then a finding first reported here will assume some interest: it is that in opposite-sexed twin pairs, the male is significantly more often assessed as having the greater gestational age. It is suggested that this finding should be provisionally accepted as evidence for the hyopthesis that male zygotes are formed earlier than females...|$|R
60|$|Now {{does all}} life {{work up to}} the one consummating act of <b>coition?</b> In one direction, it does, {{and it would be}} better if {{psychoanalysis}} plainly said so. In one direction, all life works up to the one supreme moment of <b>coition.</b> Let us all admit it, sincerely.|$|E
60|$|Sex surely has a {{specific}} meaning. Sex means the being divided into male and female; and the magnetic desire or impulse which puts male apart from female, {{in a negative}} or sundering magnetism, but which also draws male and female together in a long and infinitely varied approach towards the critical act of <b>coition.</b> Sex without the consummating act of <b>coition</b> is never quite sex, in human relationships: just as a eunuch is never quite a man. That is to say, the act of <b>coition</b> is the essential clue to sex.|$|E
60|$|This is the moot {{point for}} psychoanalysis. But {{let us look}} at sex, in its obvious manifestation. The sexual {{relation}} between man and woman consummates in the act of <b>coition.</b> Now what is the act of <b>coition?</b> We know its functional purpose of procreation. But, after all our experience and all our poetry and novels we know that the procreative purpose of sex is, to the individual man and woman, just a side-show. To the individual, the act of <b>coition</b> is a great psychic experience, a vital experience of tremendous importance. On this vital individual experience the life and very being of the individual largely depends.|$|E
60|$|The two {{individuals}} are separate again. But are they {{as they were}} before? Is the air the same after a thunder-storm as before? No. The air is as it were new, fresh, tingling with newness. So is the blood of man and woman after successful <b>coition.</b> After a false <b>coition,</b> like prostitution, there is not newness but a certain disintegration.|$|E
60|$|But after <b>coition,</b> {{the actual}} {{chemical}} {{constitution of the}} blood is so changed, that usually sleep intervenes, to allow the time for chemical, biological readjustment through the whole system.|$|E
6000|$|And {{more than}} all these, [...] And less than all these, [...] This last, [...] Strange, faint <b>coition</b> yell [...] Of the male {{tortoise}} at extremity, [...] Tiny from under {{the very edge of}} the farthest [...] far-off horizon of life.|$|E
6000|$|After <b>coition,</b> we say {{the blood}} is renewed. We say that from the new, finely {{sparkling}} blood new thrills pass into the great affective centers of the lower body, new thrills of feeling, of impulse, of energy.--And what about these new thrills? ...|$|E

60|$|Perhaps, then, we {{will allow}} {{ourselves}} to say what, in psychic individual reality, is {{the act of}} <b>coition.</b> It is the bringing together of the surcharged electric blood of the male with the polarized electric blood of the female, with {{the result of a}} tremendous flashing interchange, which alters the constitution of the blood, and the very quality of being, in both.|$|E
6000|$|But {{what is the}} experience? Untellable. Only, we know something. We {{know that}} in the act of <b>coition</b> the blood of the {{individual}} man, acutely surcharged with intense vital electricity--we know no word, so say [...] "electricity," [...] by analogy--rises to a culmination, in a tremendous magnetic urge towards the magnetic blood of the female. The whole of the living blood in the two individuals forms a field of intense, polarized magnetic attraction. So, the two poles must be brought into contact. In the act of <b>coition,</b> the two seas of blood in the two individuals, rocking and surging towards contact, as near as possible, clash into a oneness. A great flash of interchange occurs, like an electric spark when two currents meet or like lightning out of the densely surcharged clouds. There is a lightning flash which passes through the blood of both individuals, there is a thunder of sensation which rolls in diminishing crashes down the nerves of each--and then the tension passes.|$|E
60|$|But {{we are not}} {{confined}} to one direction only, or to one exclusive consummation. Was {{the building of the}} cathedrals a working up towards the act of <b>coition?</b> Was the dynamic impulse sexual? No. The sexual element was present, and important. But not predominant. The same in the building of the Panama Canal. The sexual impulse, in its widest form, was a very great impulse towards the building of the Panama Canal. But there was something else, of even higher importance, and greater dynamic power.|$|E
60|$|If {{this is true}} for men, it is {{much more}} true for women. Teach a woman to act from an idea, and you destroy her womanhood for ever. Make a woman self-conscious, and her soul is barren as a sandbag. Why were we driven out of Paradise? Why did we fall into this gnawing disease of unappeasable dissatisfaction? Not because we sinned. Ah, no. All the animals in Paradise enjoyed the sensual passion of <b>coition.</b> Not because we sinned. But because we got our sex into our head.|$|E
60|$|Woman can {{polarize}} her consciousness upwards. She {{can obtain}} a hand even over her sex receptivity. She can divert even the electric spasm of <b>coition</b> into her upper consciousness: {{it was the}} trick which the snake and the apple between them taught her. The snake, whose consciousness is only dynamic, and non-cerebral. The snake, who has no mental life, but only an intensely vivid dynamic mind, he envied the human race its mental consciousness. And he knew, this intensely wise snake, that the one way to make humanity pay more than the price of mental consciousness was to pervert woman into mentality: to stimulate her into the upper flow of consciousness.|$|E
60|$|Is {{this new}} craving for {{polarized}} communion with others, this craving {{for a new}} unison, is it sexual, like the original craving for the woman? Not at all. The whole polarity is different. Now, the positive poles are the poles of the breast and shoulders and throat, the poles of activity and full consciousness. Men, being themselves made new after the act of <b>coition,</b> wish {{to make the world}} new. A new, passionate polarity springs up between men who are bent on the same activity, the polarity between man and woman sinks to passivity. It is now daytime, and time to forget sex, time to be busy making a new world.|$|E

60|$|And to-day {{what have}} we but this? Almost inevitably we find in a child now an intense, precocious, secret sexual preoccupation.

A child and its own roused, inflamed sex, its own shame and masturbation, its own cruel, secret sexual excitement and sex curiosity, {{this is the greatest}} tragedy of our day. The child does not so much want to act as to know. The thought of actual sex connection is usually repulsive. There is an aversion from the normal <b>coition</b> act. But the craving to feel, to see, to taste, to know, mentally in the head, this is insatiable. Anything, so that the sensation and experience shall come through the upper channels. This is the secret of our introversion and our perversion to-day. Anything rather than spontaneous direct action from the sensual self. Anything rather than the merely normal passion. Introduce any trick, any idea, any mental element you can into sex, but make it an affair of the upper consciousness, the mind and eyes and mouth and fingers.

5000|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} may {{be defined}} by different words, including coitus, copulation, <b>coition,</b> or intercourse (which is typically shorthand for sexual intercourse).

The term vaginal sex, and less often vaginal intercourse, may also refer to any vaginal sexual activity, particularly if penetrative, including sexual activity between lesbian couples. Copulation, by contrast, more often refers to the mating process, especially for non-human animals; it can denote any sexual activity between opposite-sex or same-sex pairings, but is generally defined as the sexually reproductive act of transferring sperm from a male to a female or sexual procreation {{between a man and a}} woman.|$|E

A cart horse pulling a heavy load collapsed. Herbert became fearful of going out into the street, with his fear focused on horses and heavily loaded vehicles, which he was afraid would fall over.

Hans' father initially attributes the neurosis to [...] "sexual over-excitement caused by his mother's caresses" [...] and fear caused by the large penises of horses. While not rejecting these explanations, Freud gradually encourages the father also to understand Hans' disorder in terms of the anxiety caused by the arrival of his younger sister and an inadequately satisfied curiosity as to the origin of babies. Although a number of sexual and excretal fantasies and anxieties (such as Oedipal wishes and castration anxiety) are explored during the case history, Freud does not ultimately explain the case in terms of these factors, and on occasion reproaches Hans' father for sticking too dogmatically to a rigidly Oedipal understanding of his son's anxiety.
