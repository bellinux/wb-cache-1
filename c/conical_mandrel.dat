40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{expansion}} ratio on the corrosion rate of the expanded tubes exposed to sea water {{as well as the}} microstructure changes caused by the expansion of Cr-Mo steel tubes to large permanent deformations. 2. 25 Cr- 1. 0 Mo steel (schedule 40 and schedule 80) tubes were subjected to various expansion ratios of 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % by pushing <b>conical</b> <b>mandrels</b> through them using a piston. The microstructure was also studied to determine {{the effect of}} the expansion on the grain structure of the material. Microscopic examination of the expanded tubes revealed that grains elongate along the direction of the hoop stress and this elongation increases with an increase of expansion ratio. Moreover, it was found that corrosion rate and hardness increase with an increase in expansion ratio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCold {{tube drawing}} is a metal forming process which enables to produce tubes with high {{dimensional}} precision. It consists in reducing tube dimensions by pulling {{it through a}} die. Tube outer diameter is calibrated by a die and the tube inner diameter and thickness are calibrated by a mandrel. One of the major concern of metal forming industry is the constant improvement of productivity and product quality. In the aim of pushing the process to the limit {{the question is how}} far the material can be processed without occurrence of failure. In the present study, a long <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> with a small cone angle was designed in order to carry out drawing tests up to fracture with experimental conditions very close to the industrial process. The FEM of the process was built in order to access the local stress and strain data. A specific emphasis was put on the friction characterisation. For that purpose force measurement during the <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> experiments enabled to characterise a pressure dependent friction coefficient constitutive law by means of an inverse analysis. Finally, eleven failure criteria were selected to study the drawability of cobalt-chromium alloy tubes. The assessment of failure criteria based on damage variables or damage accumulation variables involved their calibration on uniaxial tensile tests. The experimental studies were completed by SEM fractography which enabled to understand the fracture locus and the propagation direction of the fracture...|$|E
40|$|Native semi-lunar {{heart valves}} are {{composed}} of a dense fibrous network that generally follows a curvilinear path along {{the width of the}} leaflet. Recent models of engineered valve leaflets have predicted that such curvilinear fiber orientations would homogenize the strain field and reduce stress concentrations at the commissure. In the present work, a method was developed to reproduce this curvilinear fiber alignment in electrospun scaffolds by varying the geometry of the collecting mandrel. Elastomeric poly(ester urethane) urea was electrospun onto rotating conical mandrels of varying angles to produce fibrous scaffolds where the angle of fiber alignment varied linearly over scaffold length. By matching the radius of the <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> to the radius of curvature for the native pulmonary valve, the electrospun constructs exhibited a curvilinear fiber structure similar to the native leaflet. Moreover, the constructs had local mechanical properties comparable to conventional scaffolds and native heart valves. In agreement with prior modeling results, it was found under quasi-static loading that curvilinear fiber microstructures reduced strain concentrations compared to scaffolds generated on a conventional cylindrical mandrels. Thus, this simple technique offers an attractive means for fabricating scaffolds where key microstructural features of the native leaflet are imitated for heart valve tissue engineering...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{aluminium}} tubes {{have very}} important industrial applications, particularly in automobile industry. Tube drawing process {{is widely used}} to reduce the outer and inner diameters of tubes. An important issue in the tube drawing process to obtain variable wall thickness is how to determinate and predict its formability limits. Previously published works generally deal with the formability limit of conventional tube drawing based on experimental analysis, analytical method and finite element method. However, {{in the case of}} variable wall thickness tubes, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge and data in order to predict their limit of formability. In the present study, both theoretical and experimental methods are proposed for estimating the formability limit of the variable wall thickness aluminium tubes used for the transportation purposes. A modification of a <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> was proposed and a special control system for mandrel displacement during the process was used to carry out the drawing tests. During the drawing process, the tube pulling axis was controlled at constant speed while the mandrel was moved to achieve the continuously variable wall thickness. The formability limit in term of minimum wall thickness and maximum area reduction was obtained before tube rupture. These values are useful data for the determination of the extent of deformation during a drawing process that a material can experience without failure. The maximum drawing stress ratio was also determined experimentally. Further, an extension of an upper bound solution developed in previous publications is proposed to predict the drawing stress field. The maximum drawing stress ratio was used as a criterion for fracture analysis. It was shown that the analytical model with its new extension combined to the fracture criterion predicts quite well the thickness and area reduction limit. The experimental studies were completed by examining the microstructure and strain field at the limit state...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{prospective}} applications of wrought AM 30 magnesium alloy {{is in the}} form of hollow circular extrusions. They can either be fabricated by employing a conventional <b>conical</b> die and <b>mandrel</b> that produce seamless extrudates, or by using a porthole die employing a welding chamber technique. The latter has become popular due to several advantages and has been adopted commercially for aluminium and magnesium alloy extrusions. In the present investigation, cast billets of AM 30 magnesium alloy were extruded under similar conditions, using two different dies, i. e., a conventional conical die and a commercially used porthole die. The extruded circular tubes produced by the two methods were characterized for their microstructure as well as physical and mechanical properties. The tubes fabricated using porthole die showed significant refinement in microstructure with improved mechanical properties, outside the seam-joint portion, compared to the tubes fabricated using conical die. The extrusion loads using porthole die, were, however, higher compared to the conventional method. Processing issues, structure and properties of magnesium extrusions, produced by the two methods, are discussed in details in this paper...|$|R
40|$|EP 991136 A UPAB: 20000508 NOVELTY - A heater for {{plastics}} comprises {{a microwave}} generator, a waveguide and screened antenna, {{and has a}} safe and coaxial wave trap which is completely open for insertion of e. g. a plastic tube end, for concentrated, controlled, efficient local heating. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the method of heating components made of microwave-absorbing plastic. Preferred features: The screen projection beyond the antenna tip, is a quarter wavelength or more. The zone between the antenna tip and the screen is dimensioned {{in accordance with the}} size of the component to be heated. In one region it is especially narrow, to concentrate heating locally. The component inserted in the narrow region is heated there, in accordance with specific requirements. Between the antenna and screen, dielectric is included. The antenna tip is e. g. <b>conical,</b> a <b>mandrel,</b> a rod or a hook. Antenna tip and screen are coaxial. In the method, components are heated, to weld them together. A double version of the heater (illustrated in the disclosure) may be constructed to heat e. g. two tube ends simultaneously, to weld them together. Heating may precede permanent deformation. A conically-tipped antenna may be used for tube end flaring. Heating may induce crosslinking. USE - To heat plastic components, especially tube ends, using microwaves. ADVANTAGE - Despite being very compact for the duty, the head heats particularly uniformly. It is very simple to use. A striking feature is the containment of microwave radiation, a consequence of selecting dimensions in relation to the wavelength. Usefully, the screen is wide open at the end, yet blocks microwave release. The limited heating region ensures efficient use of energy; the microwave field may be concentrated for more intense local heating. Heating and deformation of pipe ends, suggests application as a pipeline joint welding machine...|$|R
2500|$|Bassoon reeds, made of Arundo donax cane, {{are often}} {{made by the}} players themselves, {{although}} beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and gouged to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or profiled, by removing material from the bark side. This {{can be done by}} hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a <b>conical</b> steel <b>mandrel</b> (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the [...] "throat," [...] and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study of}} the {{resistance}} of different organic coatings containing volatile corrosion inhibitors environmentally friendly and their anti corrosive performance when applied to steel surfaces in sea environment. In the context of this paper, studied 7 coatings systems of 2 categories: a.) organic solvent (SB) and especially 4 coating systems (SB 1,SB 2,SB 3,SB 4) with different density in anticorrosion pigment and 1 system of organic coating with volatile corrosion inhibitor (VCI) and b.) water soluble (WB) especially 2 systems of organic coatings (WB 1,WB 2) containing resin with anticorrosive properties. Coatings in the first category contained two types of anti-corrosive pigments, oxyaminophosphate salt of magnesium and zinc phosphate pigment. As well as these systems contain volatile corrosion inhibitors. Zinc phosphate (Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 * 2 - 4 H 2 O) was the first and most important alternative "green" phosphate pigment was used in place of chromate pigments. Magnesium pigments are ecological anticorrosive pigments as they do not contain any evidence to be responsible for toxicity. Even though these pigments are manufactured at high temperatures they show high thermal stability. The anticorrosive coatings contain corrosion inhibitors in ionic form under the name of "volatile inhibitors", creating a protective layer of ions at the steel surface that stops the electrolytic action between anode and cathode regions. The volatile corrosion inhibitors are defined as compounds or mixtures of compounds (usually organic amine base-soluble in water) with high vapor pressure (107 - 10 - 2 mmHg) that can prevent general corrosion of metallic materials. In the field of organic coatings the use of corrosion inhibitors makes it possible to prepare organic coatings friendlier to the environment with the possibility of better corrosion protection and the ability to heal itself. The requirement {{for the protection of the}} environment impose on paint industries, to produce paints with lower content in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Thus one way to reduce these, is the steady reduction in the use of organic solvents and the creation of new coatings in which we use water as solvent which as a dispersion medium allows to avoid pollution problems by solvent evaporation. The second category of waterborne coatings,which are studied, contains acrylic resin with anticorrosive properties. The anticorrosive properties of these products are based on the fact that almost no water or vapor will migrate through the polymer membrane, since no water or oxygen can penetrate into the metal substrate, so therefore there is no corrosion. Because of this unique feature, the aqueous dispersion requires no filling or anticorrosive pigment for optimum performance. This means that it is possible to deliver very high gloss in pigmented coatings with superior anticorrosive properties. The degree of corrosion protection of the coatings was estimated by determining the density of the corrosion current icorr, linear polarization resistance Rp and the corrosion rate CR as a function of exposure time of the coated specimens in a sea enironment NaCl 3, 5 % w/w. In addition to this we examine the change in the corrosion potential of the coated samples according to the exposure time in the corrosive environment. The durability of organic coatings was studied by assessing their physicochemical properties. For this study used the following methods:  Estimation of coating system adhesion by the cross cut test  Estimation of coating system adhesion by the pull-off test  Estimation of coating system flexibility by the <b>Conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> bending test Summarizing the main outcomes from this thesis it is concluded that: The coatings contain volatile inhibitors (VpCI) have very good anti-corrosion properties in the coating but lose their mechanical properties and adhesion. Moreover both anticorrosive,adhesion and mechanical properties are very good in organic coatings (SB). On the contrary,huge disadvantage is the environmental pollution due to the organic solvent. In the end,in coatings with water-soluble resins (WB) we observe changes in the anticorrosive properties by changing the composition of the coating. Generally, WB coatings do not exhibit good electrochemical properties. Adhesion is increased when the emulsion of the resin increases. The mechanical properties vary and can be placed between the mechanical properties of the two previous categories of organic coatings. ΚΥΡΙΑΚΟΣ ΣΟΛΟΜΩΝΙΔΗΣ 172 σ.
