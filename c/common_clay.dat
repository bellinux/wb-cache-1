25|$|In the 18th century, Johann Heinrich Pott (1692–1777) and Andreas Sigismund Marggraf {{demonstrated}} that alumina was a constituent. Pott in his Lithogeognosia {{showed that the}} precipitate obtained when an alkali is poured into a solution of alum {{is quite different from}} lime and chalk, with which it had been confounded by G.E. Stahl. Marggraf showed that alumina is one of the constituents of alum, but that this earth possesses peculiar properties, {{and is one of the}} ingredients in <b>common</b> <b>clay.</b> He also showed that crystals of alum can be obtained by dissolving alumina in sulfuric acid and evaporating the solutions, and when a solution of potash or ammonia is dropped into this liquid, it immediately deposits perfect crystals of alum.|$|E
25|$|The exact findspots of many objects {{retrieved}} {{during the}} 1920s excavations {{could no longer}} be reconstructed due to the poor publication standards, so that many can only be dated by comparing them with what has been found at other sites that do have a good stratigraphy and chronological control. Many of the objects found during the 1920s could be dated from the Uruk period to the Early Dynastic I period. Very few copper objects were found in Jemdet Nasr. These included an adze, a fish-hook and a small pendant {{in the shape of a}} goose. A particular type of stone vessel with ledge handles and a rim decorated by incised rectangles has so far not been found at any other site. The function of a number of flat polished stones incised with lines forming a cross is uncertain, but it has been suggested that they were used as bolas. They are common in Uruk period sites. Because clay as a raw material is widely available around Jemdet Nasr, clay objects are very <b>common.</b> <b>Clay</b> objects included baked clay bricks, clay sickels, fragments of drain pipes, spatulas, spindle whorls and miniature wagon wheels. Beads, small pendants and figurines were made of bone, shell, stone, clay and frit.|$|E
25|$|The <b>common</b> <b>clay</b> {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they}} have a relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{thin-film}} {{energy dispersive}} spectroscopic (EDS) analyses of clays with low-atomic-number (low Z) elements (e. g. Na, Al, Si), presents {{a challenge to}} the microscopist {{not only because of the}} spatial resolution required, but also because of their susceptibility to electron beam-induced radiation damange and very low X-ray count rates. Most <b>common</b> <b>clays,</b> such as kaolinite, smectite and illite occur as submicrometer crystallites with varying degrees of structural disorder in at least two directions and may have dimensions as small as one or two unit cells along the basal direction. Thus, even clays with relatively large a-b dimenstions (e. g., 100 x 100 nm) may be 300 s) in order to obtain satisfactory statistical precision. Unfortunately, beam damage rates for the <b>common</b> <b>clays</b> are very rapid (< 10 s in imaging mode) between 100 kV and 200 kV. With a focussed probe for elemental analyses, the damage rate is exacerbated by a high current density and may result in loss of low-Z elements during data collection and consequent loss of analytical accuracy...|$|R

2500|$|Magatama {{became very}} common in the Kofun period, ca. CE 250 to CE 538, {{and by the end}} of the period almost all kofun tumuli {{contained}} magatama. In the early Kofun period magatama were made from jadeite as in earlier periods, but by the middle of the period were made from jasper, {{and by the end of}} the period, almost exclusively of agate and jade. Magatama capped by silver or gold also appear towards the end of the period. Large magatama made of talc, imitations of smaller ones made of more precious materials, were used as grave goods. Magatama are found in kofun tumuli across Japan from the period. Their use went from merely decorative to sacred and ceremonial grave goods. [...] are magatama with inscriptions that look like flowers of the clove tree and have a hole suitable to attach to a string. These first appear in the Kofun period. In the Kofun period magatama appear on necklaces, with several magatama set between bored cylinders.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Syntheses of ferric smectites were {{performed}} at low temperature (75 ~ by aging coprecipitated gels of silica and Fe 2 +-sulphate under initially reducing then oxidizing conditions.

Crystallogenesis of the ferric smectite was studied by XRD, IR, DTA, M 6 ssbauer and EPR spectroscopies. The end-synthesis mectite contained only Fe 3 + ions, all located in the octahedral sheet. This clay was mixed with a cryptocrystalline iron oxide phase containing one-third of the iron atoms and undetectable y XRD.
