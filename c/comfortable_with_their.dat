25|$|Some generic {{drugs are}} viewed with {{suspicion}} by doctors. For example, warfarin (Coumadin) has a narrow therapeutic window and requires frequent blood tests {{to make sure}} patients {{do not have a}} subtherapeutic or a toxic level. A study performed in Ontario showed that replacing Coumadin with generic warfarin was safe, but many physicians are not <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> patients taking branded generic equivalents. In some countries (for example, Australia) where a drug is prescribed under more than one brand name, doctors may choose not to allow pharmacists to substitute a brand different from the one prescribed unless the consumer requests it.|$|E
25|$|Non-university {{intermediate}} {{professionals and}} skilled workers for the industry, agriculture, commerce {{and other services}} where needed. As more new public university institutions were founded or expanded, polytechnics didn't feel <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> subaltern status in the Portuguese higher education system {{and a desire to}} be upgraded into university-like institutions grew among the polytechnic institutions' administrations. This desire of emancipation and evolution from polytechnic status to university status, was not followed by better qualified teaching staff, better facilities for teaching or researching, or by a stronger curricula with a more selective admission criteria, comparable with those enforced by almost all public university institutions. Criteria ambiguity and the general lower standards in polytechnic higher education and admission, were fiercely criticised by education personalities like university rectors, regarding issues like the lack of admission exams in mathematics for polytechnic engineering applicants, and the proliferation of administration and management courses everywhere, many without a proper curriculum in mathematics, statistics and economics-related disciplines.|$|E
25|$|Donald McAdams {{wrote that}} in the 1990s, within trustee District 5 there were schools that were about 50% White that usually had ample parent support and {{stronger}} test scores while there were schools about 90% or higher minorities that had low test scores and little to no parent support. He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had minority children {{as long as the}} minority children tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them. Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> presence. He added that very poor black children tended to go to their neighborhood schools outside of District 5. McAdams also stated that White middle class parents did not consider Asians and Asian Americans to be minorities who could make a school less attractive to them. In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, non-English speaking Central American students at some HISD neighborhood schools made them unattractive to White parents.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{transsexual}} people {{undergo a}} physical transition. Some find reasons not to; for example, {{the expense of}} surgery, the risk of medical complications, or medical conditions which make the use of hormones or surgery dangerous. Some may not identify strongly with another binary gender role. Others may find balance at a mid-point during the process, {{regardless of whether or}} not they are binary-identified. Many transsexual people, including binary-identified transsexual people, do not undergo genital surgery, because they are <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> own genitals, or because they are concerned about nerve damage and the potential loss of sexual pleasure, including orgasm. This is especially so in the case of trans men, many of whom are dissatisfied with the current state of phalloplasty, which is typically very expensive, not covered by health insurance, and commonly does not achieve desired results. For example, not only does phalloplasty not result in a completely natural erection, it may not allow for an erection at all, and its results commonly lack penile sexual sensitivity; in other cases, however, phalloplasty results are satisfying for trans men. By contrast, metoidioplasty, which is more popular, is significantly less expensive and has far better sexual results.|$|E
25|$|In series two (2013) Caroline is {{surprised}} to learn that Gillian has slept with John, whom she {{is in the process of}} divorcing. When Alan and Celia quietly marry in private, Caroline is pleased for them, though Gillian feels slighted. Wishing to buy John out of their shared house, she asks both Celia and Kate for financial assistance and invites Kate to move in with her. Kate, nearing her 42nd birthday, confides in Caroline that she would like a baby before she gets too old. Caroline takes Kate away for her birthday, though angers her by booking two single rooms. She feels excluded when Kate reminisces with an old university friend, Greg (Marcus Garvey) whom she is using as a sperm donor. The following day, Kate informs Caroline that their relationship is over, as Caroline is too old to change her ways and be <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> relationship. Three months later, Caroline is dejected when William leaves for university and Lawrence declares that he wants to live with his father. She is overcome with emotion after learning that Kate is twelve weeks pregnant. She distracts herself by planning a wedding party for Alan and Celia with Gillian. Caroline becomes the first person to learn that Gillian murdered her ex-husband; she promises to keep this secret. In the series two finale Caroline tells Kate she has learnt from her mistakes, and implores her to give her a second chance. At Alan and Celia's wedding dance on Christmas Eve, Kate surprises Caroline by asking her to dance; the pair promise to commit to each other before kissing passionately.|$|E
500|$|In 1878, Leno and {{his family}} moved to Manchester. There, he met Lydia Reynolds, who, in 1883, joined the Leno family theatre company, which already {{consisted}} of his parents, Danvers and Leno. [...] The following year, Leno and Reynolds married; around this time, he adopted the stage name [...] "Dan Leno". On 10 March 1884, the Leno family took over the running of the Grand Varieties Theatre in Sheffield. The Lenos felt <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> working class Sheffield audiences. On their opening night, over 4,000 patrons entered the theatre, paying sixpence to see Dan Leno star in Doctor Cut 'Em Up. In October 1884, facing tough competition, the Lenos gave up the lease on the theatre.|$|E

50|$|School {{and country}} {{contexts}} highly influence students’ initial abilities to form deep questions. In the developing world, many teachers lack adequate teacher training. Their training is often limited to content, rather than pedagogical practices. In some cases, when {{teachers were asked}} to use new technology before they were <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> it, <b>their</b> discomfort led them to stifle students’ questions. Cultural norms governing relations between adults and students, and socialization into situational authority roles, may also inhibit student questioning.|$|R
500|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} {{violence}} and the abuse of power, {{as well as of}} coming of age. The protagonists have a recurring struggle to make choices they are <b>comfortable</b> <b>with.</b> <b>Their</b> moral development takes place within the harshness of the Upland culture, contrasted with examples of kindness and altruism. It has been described as sharing themes of dreamworlds and choices with a number of other works by Le Guin, such as the Earthsea cycle, The Beginning Place, and [...] "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas". It also shares similarities with Maurice Sendak's book Where the Wild Things Are, while Orrec's transformation in the novel has been compared to the biblical story of Jonah.|$|E

While Idolator Robbie Daw found the ladies <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> own sexuality in the clip and said [...] "What girl in the mid-'90s did not want to emulate that?," [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Vibe claimed that the visuals for [...] "Creep" [...] and [...] "Red Light Special" [...] set the standard for video eroticism at the time.|$|E
500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, we may be pretty sure he has something to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles.

2500|$|At a {{time when}} sexism and {{homophobia}} were common, and when the African-American bourgeoisie sought to distance itself from the slavery {{of the past and}} seek social equality and racial integration, the Niggerati themselves appeared to be relatively <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> diversity of gender, skin colour, and background. [...] After producing FIRE!!, which failed {{because of a lack of}} funding, Thurman persuaded the Niggerati to produce another magazine, Harlem. [...] This, too, lasted only a single issue.|$|E
2500|$|Therapeutic {{approaches}} for GIDC {{differ from those}} used on adults and have included behavior therapy, psychodynamic therapy, group therapy, and parent counseling. Proponents of this intervention seek to reduce gender dysphoria, make children more <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> bodies, lessen ostracism, and reduce the child's psychiatric comorbidity. The majority of therapists currently employ these techniques. [...] "Two short term goals have been discussed in the literature: the reduction or elimination of social ostracism and conflict, and the alleviation of underlying or associated psychopathology. Longer term goals {{have focused on the}} prevention of transsexualism and/or homosexuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{documentary}} The Butch Factor, gay men (one of them transgender) {{were asked about}} their views of masculinity. Masculine traits were generally seen as an advantage {{in and out of}} the closet, allowing [...] "butch" [...] gay men to conceal their sexual orientation longer while engaged in masculine activities such as sports. Effeminacy is inaccurately associated with homosexuality, and some gay men doubted their sexual orientation; they did not see themselves as effeminate, and felt little connection to gay culture. Some effeminate gay men in The Butch Factor felt uncomfortable about their femininity (despite being <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> sexuality), and feminine gay men may be derided by stereotypically-masculine gays.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} that people preferring to use the right hand prefer to use the left leg, e.g. when using a shovel, kicking a ball, or operating control pedals. In many cases, this may be because they are disposed for left-handedness but have been trained for right-handedness. In the sport of cricket, some players may find that they are more <b>comfortable</b> bowling <b>with</b> <b>their</b> left or right hand, but batting with the other hand.|$|R

Or, the player can skip the trainers and go straight to figuring out a song from the Music Library.

2500|$|There {{is limited}} {{research}} on the consequences of adoption for the original parents, and the findings have been mixed. One study {{found that those who}} released their babies for adoption were less <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> decision than those who kept their babies. However, levels of comfort over both groups were high, and those who released their child were similar to those who kept their child in ratings of life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and positive future outlook for schooling, employment, finances, and marriage. [...] Subsequent research found that adolescent mothers who chose to release their babies for adoption were more likely to experience feelings of sorrow and regret over their decision than those who kept their babies. However, these feelings decreased significantly from one year after birth {{to the end of the}} second year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music on}} Brighter than a Thousand Suns (1986), was mostly similar in sound and mood to [...] "Love like Blood". Following {{the success of}} Night Time, the band had decided to recruit Kimsey again to handle production. While no less {{aggressive}} and heavy than their older work, Brighter than a Thousand Suns diverged musically in ways that led to controversy among listeners. In this case, disagreements between fans and critics alike included opinions on whether the band was conforming with pressure from EG to develop a more commercial sound, to whether the songs were relevant for those listeners more <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> proto post-punk beginnings. The record was a commercial failure compared to the previous effort, failing {{to reach the top}} 50 in the UK charts. However, two singles were released from the album - [...] "Adorations" [...] (which fractionally missed the UK Top 40) and [...] "Sanity" [...] - and the band continued touring successfully {{until the end of the}} year.|$|E
