50|$|On a map, the <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> {{latitude}} {{may or may}} not be parallel, {{and their}} spacing may vary, depending on which projection is used to map the surface of the Earth onto a plane. On an equirectangular projection, centered on the equator, the <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> latitude are horizontal, parallel, and equally spaced. On other cylindrical and pseudocylindrical projections, the <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> latitude are horizontal and parallel, but may be spaced unevenly to give the map useful characteristics. For instance, on a Mercator projection the <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> latitude are more widely spaced near the poles to preserve local scales and shapes, while on a Gall-Peters projection the <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> latitude are spaced more closely near the poles so that comparisons of area will be accurate. On most non-cylindrical and non-pseudocylindrical projections, the <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> latitude are neither straight nor parallel.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{knowledge}} sharing and maturation in new product development (NPD). We show how knowledge items mature {{as they are}} shared in expanding <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> trust until the items are exhausted and transformed to new knowledge items to serve new activities. Our conceptual framework integrates knowledge sharing, <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> trust and knowledge maturation. We explore knowledge maturation patterns through six in-depth case studies of NPD projects using Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) technology. Our results show that knowledge maturation patterns are contextual and complex. Knowledge is shared in <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> trust, where one circle feeds into another during the maturation process. Psychological safety {{plays a role in}} the choice <b>of</b> <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> trust for knowledge maturation. These results suggest that formal NPD process and progress across <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> trust interact and reinforce knowledge transformation. These results have implications for articulating the IT architecture for NPD...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Bounded Apollonian circle {{packings}} (ACP’s) {{are constructed}} by repeatedly inscribing circles into the tri-angular interstices of a configuration of four mutually tangent <b>circles,</b> one <b>of</b> which is internally tangent {{to the other}} three. If the original four circles have integer curvature, all <b>of</b> the <b>circles</b> in the packing will have integer curvature as well. In [S 1], Sarnak proves that there are infinitely many <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> prime curvature and infinitely many pairs <b>of</b> tangent <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> prime curvature in a primitive 1 integral ACP. In this paper, we give a heuristic backed up by numerical data for the number <b>of</b> <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> prime curvature less than x, {{and the number of}} “kissing primes, ” or pairs <b>of</b> <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> prime cur-vature less than x in a primitive integral ACP. We also provide experimental evidence towards a local to global principle for the curvatures in a primitive integral ACPs. 1...|$|R
