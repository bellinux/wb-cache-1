In September 2012, Artur Mas, then Catalonia's president, requested from the central government a new [...] "fiscal agreement", with the possibility of giving his <b>community</b> <b>powers</b> equal to those of the communities of chartered regime, but prime minister Mariano Rajoy refused.

40|$|The piece studies how the German federal {{reform of}} 2006 seeks to respondto {{the demands of}} the system of powers in the European Union. The increasein <b>community</b> <b>powers</b> has had a {{particular}} impact on the system of powersof the Länder, whose role in EU institutions and bodies has proved to be insufficient. For this reason the federal reform took the community processinto account in setting up an efficient multi-level system of powers.

40|$|This article draws a {{comparison}} between the different provisions that dealwith the allocation of powers system definition of the amended statutes ofAutonomy. From {{the analysis of the}} different regulations we appreciate thatthe statutes of Catalonia, Andalusia and Aragon contain norms regardingthe functional definition of competences. Nevertheless, in the case of theCatalan Statute, this provisions defining the allocation of powers system mustbe modulated according to the restricted adjudication of the decision 31 / 2010,ruled by the Constitutional Court, from June 28 th. This decision would eventuallyhave an impact on the adjudication of the statutes of Autonomy’sprovisions of Andalusia and Aragon. Other amended statutes (such as thepassed in Valencia, Balearic Islands, Castilia-Leon, Extremadura and Navarra) do not change the previous competence framework through a general definition,be it because of the logic of the previous system was kept or, ashappened in the case of Navarra, because the statute’s rules were not amendedin this point. The study also analyzes a specific field in the powers allocatedbetween the State and the Autonomous Community (such as the regulationson professional associations). This allows to conclude that the moreambitious amendment of the statutes of Autonomy concerning the principlesof the competences framework do not have almost any remarkable effectin the state’s legislative powers and the scope of decisions adopted by theAutonomous <b>Community</b> <b>powers...</b>|$|E
