25|$|A {{decoupling}} capacitor is a capacitor {{used to protect}} {{one part of a}} circuit from the effect of another, for instance to suppress noise or transients. Noise caused by other <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> is shunted through the capacitor, reducing the effect they have {{on the rest of the}} circuit. It is most commonly used between the power supply and ground.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} {{resistor}} {{is exactly the}} same in the time domain and the -domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the <b>circuit</b> <b>elements.</b> For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the -domain account for that.|$|E

40|$|Chua {{proposed}} an Elementary <b>Circuit</b> <b>Element</b> Quadrangle including the three classic elements (resistor, inductor, and capacitor) and his formulated, named memristor as the fourth element. Based on an observation that this quadrangle {{may not be}} symmetric, I {{proposed an}} Elementary <b>Circuit</b> <b>Element</b> Triangle, in which memristor as well as mem-capacitor and mem-inductor lead three basic element classes, respectively. An intrinsic mathematical relationship is found to support this new classification. It is believed that this triangle is concise, mathematically sound and aesthetically beautiful, compared with Chua’s quadrangle. The importance of finding a correct <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> table {{is similar to that}} of Mendeleev’s periodic table of chemical elements in chemistry and the table of 61 elementary particles in physics, in terms of categorizing the existing elements and predicting new <b>elements.</b> A correct <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> table would also request to rewrite the 20 th century textbooks...|$|R

25|$|The use of op-amps as circuit blocks is {{much easier}} and clearer than specifying all their {{individual}} <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> (transistors, resistors, etc.), whether the amplifiers used are integrated or discrete circuits.

25|$|Purely {{electronic}} <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> soon replaced their {{mechanical and}} electromechanical equivalents, {{at the same}} time that digital calculation replaced analog. Machines such as the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Colossus computers, and the ENIAC were built by hand, using circuits containing relays or valves (vacuum tubes), and often used punched cards or punched paper tape for input and as the main (non-volatile) storage medium.|$|E
25|$|This {{design is}} simple, {{but a good}} basis for a {{practical}} design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> would probably {{be found in a}} real design that would roll-off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.|$|E

25|$|Conventionally, {{capacitors}} {{are treated}} as if they generate reactive power and inductors as if they consume it. If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add. This is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power 'consumed' by the load. Purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by 90degrees, while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by 90degrees. The result {{of this is that}} capacitive and inductive <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> tend to cancel each other out.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, works on {{thyristor}} circuits were carried at Bell Labs, IBM and RCA. Ian Munro Ross and David D'Azaro (Bell Labs) experimented with thyristor-based memory cells. Joe Logue and Rick Dill (IBM) were building counters using monojunction transistors. Torkel Wallmark and Harwick Johnson (RCA) used both the thyristors and field-effect transistors. The works of 1955–1958 that used germanium thyristors were fruitless. Only {{in the summer}} of 1959, after the inventions of Kilby, Lehovec and Hoerni became publicly known, D'Azaro reported an operational shift register based on silicon thyristors. In this register, one crystal containing four thyristors replaced eight transistors, 26 diodes and 27 resistors. The area of each thyristor ranged from 0.2 to 0.4mm2, with a thickness of about 0.1mm. The <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> were isolated by etching deep grooves.|$|E
25|$|Each trace {{consists}} of a flat, narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching. Its resistance, determined by its width, thickness, and length, must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. Power and ground traces {{may need to be}} wider than signal traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a ground plane for shielding and power return. For microwave circuits, transmission lines can be laid out in a planar form such as stripline or microstrip with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent impedance. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the inductance and capacitance of the printed circuit board conductors become significant <b>circuit</b> <b>elements,</b> usually undesired; but they {{can be used as a}} deliberate part of the circuit design, obviating the need for additional discrete components.|$|E

25|$|A {{flash drive}} {{consists}} of a small printed circuit board carrying the <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> and a USB connector, insulated electrically and protected inside a plastic, metal, or rubberised case, which can be carried in a pocket or on a key chain, for example. The USB connector may be protected by a removable cap or by retracting {{into the body of}} the drive, although it {{is not likely to be}} damaged if unprotected. Most flash drives use a standard type-A USB connection allowing connection with a port on a personal computer, but drives for other interfaces also exist. USB flash drives draw power from the computer via the USB connection. Some devices combine the functionality of a portable media player with USB flash storage; they require a battery only when used to play music on the go.|$|E
500|$|Directional {{couplers}} {{are most}} frequently constructed from two coupled transmission lines set close enough together such that energy passing through one is coupled to the other. [...] This technique is favoured at the microwave frequencies where transmission line designs are commonly used to implement many <b>circuit</b> <b>elements.</b> [...] However, lumped component devices are also possible at lower frequencies, such as the audio frequencies encountered in telephony. [...] Also at microwave frequencies, particularly the higher bands, waveguide designs can be used. [...] Many of these waveguide couplers correspond {{to one of the}} conducting transmission line designs, but there are also types that are unique to waveguide.|$|E
500|$|Filter {{performance}} parameters, such as stopband {{rejection and}} rate of transition between passband and stopband, are improved by adding more components and thus increasing {{the length of the}} filter. [...] Where the components are repeated identically, the filter is an image parameter filter design, and performance is enhanced simply by adding more identical elements. [...] This approach is typically used in filter designs which use a large number of closely spaced elements such as the waffle-iron filter. [...] For designs where the elements are more widely spaced, better results can be obtained using a network synthesis filter design, such as the common Chebyshev filter and Butterworth filters. [...] In this approach the <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> do not all have the same value, and consequently the components are not all the same dimensions. [...] Furthermore, if the design is enhanced by adding more components then all the element values must be calculated again from scratch. [...] In general, there will be no common values between the two instances of the design. [...] Chebyshev waveguide filters are used where the filtering requirements are rigorous, such as satellite applications.|$|E

The invented method achieves extremely accurate and selective electrochemical deposition with a tiny amount of electrolytic solution, compared to conventional submersive and/or immersive methods, and eliminates the need for masking or etching, reducing the costs of manufacture and amount of waste electrolytic solution produced...|$|R
50|$|When {{analyzing}} electrical circuits, {{the actual}} {{direction of current}} through a specific <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> is usually unknown. Consequently, the reference directions of currents are often assigned arbitrarily. When the circuit is solved, a negative value for the variable means that the actual direction of current through that <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> is opposite that of the chosen reference direction.In electronic circuits, the reference current directions are often chosen so that all currents are toward ground. This often corresponds to the actual current direction, because in many circuits the power supply voltage is positive with respect to ground.|$|R
