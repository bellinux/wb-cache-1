5|$|Lactarius deterrimus is an edible mushroom, but is {{much less}} {{appreciated}} than the similar L.deliciosus. The first tastes slightly bitter and is often infested by maggots. Like L.deliciosus, this fungus is mainly stir-fried in butter or oil; if it is <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> the flesh becomes very soft. Young fruit bodies can be also pickled, or dried for later use. As the fungus is often heavily infested by maggots, skilled mushroom pickers prefer young fruit bodies. The urine discolours to red if {{a large amount of}} milk caps are eaten, but this is entirely harmless and is not evidence for an impairment to health. The red-coloured azulene compounds, ingested with the mushroom food, are more or less excreted with the urine.|$|E
25|$|In Cha chaan teng, {{macaroni}} is <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> {{and served}} in broth with ham or frankfurter sausages, peas, black mushrooms, and optionally eggs, reminiscent of noodle soup dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare. These affordable dining shops evolved from American food rations after World War II {{due to lack of}} supplies, and they continue to be popular for people with modest means.|$|E
25|$|Microscopy of beer residue {{points to}} a {{different}} method of brewing where bread was not used as an ingredient. One batch of grain was sprouted, which produced enzymes. The next batch was <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> dispersing the starch and then the two batches were mixed. The enzymes began to consume the starch to produce sugar. The resulting mixture was then sieved to remove chaff, and yeast (and probably lactic acid) was then added to begin a fermentation process that produced alcohol. This method of brewing is still used in parts of non-industrialized Africa. Most beers were made of barley {{and only a few}} of emmer wheat, but so far no evidence of flavoring has been found.|$|E
50|$|The old way {{of making}} bazeen is to form the dough into palm-size cakes and <b>cook</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> a special copper pot called a qidir. The barley cakes, having become solid, are then broken up in the pot with a large, flat, wooden ladle and mixed to form one large piece. Nowadays, a blender is often used, or the dough is <b>cooked</b> {{immediately}} <b>in</b> <b>water</b> like a pudding.|$|R

25|$|While {{there are}} close to 4,000 {{varieties}} of potato, it has been bred into many standard or well-known varieties, {{each of which has}} particular agricultural or culinary attributes. In general, varieties are categorized into a few main groups, such as russets, reds, whites, yellows (also called Yukons) and purples—based on common characteristics. Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. For culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness. Floury, or mealy (baking) potatoes have more starch (20–22%) than waxy (boiling) potatoes (16–18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two potato starch compounds: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape when boiled.|$|E
2500|$|Meat has {{usually been}} <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> {{which is just}} simmering, such as in stewing; higher {{temperatures}} make meat tougher by causing the proteins to contract. Since thermostatic temperature control became available, cooking at temperatures well below boiling, [...] (sous-vide) to [...] (slow cooking), for prolonged periods has become possible; this is just hot enough to convert the tough collagen in connective tissue into gelatin through hydrolysis, with minimal toughening.|$|E
6000|$|A vulgar mind, {{in reply}} to these remarks {{regarding}} the gastronomic ignorance of Snorter and Pogson, might say, [...] "True, these gentlemen {{know nothing of}} household economy, being occupied with other more important business elsewhere. But what are their wives about? Lady Pogson in Harley Street has nothing earthly to do but to mind her poodle, and her mantua-maker's and housekeeper's bills. Mrs. Snorter in Belford Place, when she has taken her drive in the Park with the young ladies, may surely have time to attend to her husband's guests and preside over the preparations of his kitchen, as she does worthily at his hospitable mahogany." [...] To this I answer, {{that a man who}} expects a woman to understand the philosophy of dinner-giving, shows the strongest evidence of a low mind. He is unjust towards that lovely and delicate creature, woman, to suppose that she heartily understands and cares for what she eats and drinks. No: taken as a rule, women have no real appetites. They are children in the gormandizing way; loving sugar, sops, tarts, trifles, apricot-creams, and such gewgaws. They would take a sip of Malmsey, and would drink currant-wine just as happily, if that accursed liquor were presented to them by the butler. Did you ever know a woman who could lay her fair hand upon her gentle heart and say on her conscience that she preferred dry sillery to sparkling champagne? Such a phenomenon does not exist. They are not made for eating and drinking; or, if they make a pretence to it, become downright odious. Nor can they, I am sure, witness the preparations of a really great repast without a certain jealousy. They grudge spending money (ask guards, coachmen, inn-waiters, whether this be not the case). They will give their all, heaven bless them to serve a son, a grandson, or a dear relative, but they have not the heart to pay for small things magnificently. They are jealous of good dinners, and no wonder. I have shown in a former discourse how they are jealous of smoking, and other personal enjoyments of the male. I say, then, that Lady Pogson or Mrs. Snorter can never conduct their husbands' table properly. Fancy either of them consenting to allow a calf to be stewed down into gravy for one dish, or a dozen hares to be sacrificed to a single puree of game, or the best Madeira to be used for a sauce, or half a dozen of champagne to boil a ham in. They will be for bringing a bottle of Marsala in place of the old particular, or for having the ham <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> But of these matters--of kitchen philosophy--I have no practical or theoretic knowledge; and must beg pardon if, only understanding the goodness of a dish when cooked, I may have unconsciously made some blunder regarding the preparation.|$|E
