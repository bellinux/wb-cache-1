50|$|A <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge</b> is a {{measurement}} instrument intended to adjust a double seamer. It replaces a filler gauge (also known as feeler gauges or gauge wires).|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a central track {{was built in}} {{preparation}} for a future mixed-gauge operation with a correspondingly large <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge</b> so that it could handle Soviet broad-gauge wagons (1520 mm gauge). The narrow gauge part remained unchanged.|$|E
50|$|These {{detectors}} can use {{a variety}} of sensors (video, laser, infrared), but typically they are a safety curtain arrangement: a gantry over the rail with sensors to detect anything outside the <b>Clearance</b> <b>Gauge.</b> They therefore check the envelope of safety and alert if anything is detected outside of it.|$|E

50|$|One {{important}} {{part is the}} seamer setup. This process is usually performed by an experienced technician. Amongst the parts that need setup are seamer rolls and chucks which have to be set in their exact position (using a feeler gauge or a <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge).</b> The lifter pressure and position, roll and chuck designs, tooling wear, and bearing wear all contribute to a good double seam.|$|E
50|$|Seamer {{setup is}} usually done by an {{experienced}} individual, typically using a lifter height gauge, lifter height pressure gauge, and feeler gauges (small {{pieces of metal}} for go/no go testing of the distances between the roll and chuck toolings). New products like the <b>Clearance</b> <b>Gauge</b> are able to let even novice users adjust seamers and optimize them, as well as locate problems with broken/damaged tooling, shank/bushing issues, seamer adjustment issues, or broken bearings.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Radebeul West Station was rebuilt in {{preparation}} for a future mixed-gauge operation and correspondingly large <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge</b> so that it could handle Soviet broad-gauge wagons (1520 mm gauge). A modern signal box with relay interlocking (WSSB GS II Sp 64 b type) was installed during the reconstruction of the station with four platform tracks. This was the first of this type installed by Deutsche Reichsbahn. It went into operation on 27 March 1969.|$|E

40|$|Trains need to {{be bigger}} and faster, which places strains on the {{interface}} {{between them and the}} infrastructure. This thesis examines the nature of one of these interfaces, namely <b>clearance</b> or <b>gauging.</b> There is little published work on the management of clearances beyond regulatory documents. This thesis considered many aspects of the engineering of clearance to develop a mathematic simulation of the gap between moving trains and the infrastructure. It proposes the concept of replacing <b>gauge</b> <b>clearance</b> with a comparison between measured infrastructure and dynamic simulations of trains. The thesis follows four themes. A model is developed which allows the swept envelope of a moving train to be calculated, using simulation techniques. This is followed by an examination of infrastructure measuring methods {{and the development of a}} measuring system for determining the size and shape of the railway network. Finally, the modelling process is used to determine the maximum size of train that may run on specific routes by optimising the fit between train and infrastructure.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the {{northern}} track was relaid and a central track {{was built in}} preparation for a future mixed-gauge operation with a correspondingly large <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge</b> so that it could handle Soviet broad-gauge wagons (1520 mm gauge). The run-down southern track was dismantled. Starting in 1982, the southern track was relaid and subsequently the other two tracks were rehabilitated. The middle track could be used for trains running in both directions, but they could not stop in Radebeul-Weintraube because it lacked a platform. Westbound traffic generally ran on the northern track and traffic to Dresden ran on the southern track. The middle track was used for express train running west to overtake or for a normal traffic towards Dresden.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{a survey of}} mobile scanning systems for measuring the railway <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge.</b> The research was completed {{as part of the}} project carried out for the PKP (PKP Polish Railway Lines S. A., Warsaw, Poland) in 2011 – 2013. The authors conducted experiments, including a search for the latest solutions relating to mobile measurement systems that meet the basic requirement. At the very least, these solutions needed to be accurate and have the ability for quick retrieval of data. In the paper, specifications and the characteristics of the component devices of the scanning systems are described. Based on experiments, the authors did some examination of the selected mobile systems to be applied for measuring the <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge.</b> The Riegl (VMX- 250) and Z+F (Zoller + Fröhlich) Solution were tested. Additional test measurements were carried out within a 30 -kilometer section of the Warsaw-Kraków route. These measurements were designed so as to provide various elements of the railway infrastructure, the track geometry and the installed geodetic control network. This ultimately made it possible to reduce the time for the preparation of geodetic reference measurements for the testing of the accuracy of the selected systems. Reference measurements included the use of the polar method to select profiles perpendicular to the axis of the track. In addition, the coordinates selected were well defined as measuring points of the objects of the infrastructure of the <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge.</b> All of the tested systems meet the accuracy requirements initially established (within the range of 2 cm as required by the PKP). The tested systems have shown their advantages and disadvantages...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} shape optimization of {{a tunnel}} excavation cross-section. The study incorporates optimization procedure of the simulated annealing (SA). The {{form of a}} cost function derives from the energetic optimality condition, formulated in the authors’ previous papers.

Unlike other approaches presented in literature, the one introduced in this paper takes into consideration a practical requirement of preserving fixed <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge.</b> Itasca Flac software is utilized in numerical examples. The optimal excavation shapes are determined for five different in situ stress ratios. This factor significantly affects the optimal topology of excavation. The resulting shapes are elongated {{in the direction of a}} principal stress greater value. Moreover, the obtained optimal shapes have smooth contours circumscribing the gauge...|$|E
40|$|The final thesis {{will deal}} with an {{immersed}} tunnel design of 13. 37 km long based on the Flyland project, a project to expand Schiphol Airport on an artificial island (Flyland) in North Sea. Approximately 111 immersed tunnel elements {{will be needed to}} connect Flyland with an intermediate island between the Netherlands and Flyland itself, which each element consists of six segments of 20 m. In addition, the thesis will focus in the design for the deepest tunnel element (cross and longitudinal sections including the reinforcement and post-tensioning) of the project and later on remarks are given for other tunnel elements. Based on the technical criteria mentioned in the report such as the <b>clearance</b> <b>gauge,</b> number of the traffic lanes, width of the pedestrian/inspection lanes, area for the ballast concrete, area for the interior equipment (ventilations, lightings, and signs), area of the service galleries, area to put on the GINA gasket, and area to put on the pre-stressed cables, then we come up with three tubes of 7. 5 m and two service galleries of 1. 35 m. The cross sections of the tunnel it self eventually has height of 11. 2 m and width of 30. 8 m. The reinforcement in the tunnel element cross section will be designed in Indonesian code (SKSNI) by inserting several comparisons to NEN (Dutch Code) especially for the crack width control since there is no SKSNI crack width control parameter for the sea environment. The result shows that using the SKSNI (with steel yield stress of 400 MPa), the amount of reinforcement needed is 124 kg/m 3, which is in between the normal range of 110 - 130 kg/m 3 for the tunnel constructions in the Netherlands which normally use steel yield stress of 500 MPa. Meanwhile the density of reinforced concrete got is 24. 4 kg/m 3 (the density includes the post-tensioned cables) For the longitudinal direction, post-tensioned cables design is applied mainly to bond the segments together in one whole element during the phases from the fabrication until the end situation. Design of the maximum positive moment is achieved from the transport phase with 1. 5 meter cosinus wave (minimum design) and the maximum negative moment is taken from the transport phase without wave consideration (maximum design). Minimum compression stress of 0. 3 MPa is given as a parameter on the total cross section of the element. Hence, the cables needed are 29 tendons of strands 19 ol 5 7 (FeP 1860) which is distributed as follows: 11 cables in the roof and 18 cables in the floor. Eventually, total losses in the cables are calculated according to NEN 6720. Due to the importance of flexibility needed within the segments of 20 meters, the expansion joints are fixed-in between the tunnel segments. The main purpose to this joint is to withstand the tunnel movements and make a water tight layer. The principle, details, and the incoming problem for the expansion joint subjected to Flyland project have been brought out in this report. The element/unit joint are maintained firstly by the GINA gasket to get a temporary water seal. The GINA is then totally compressed by the horizontal water pressure after the room in between two elements is de-watered. Later on, omega seal as the main water seal will be put on. As the main water seal system, the service life time of the omega seal will be made twice of that for the tunnel itself. The details, the trial of the omega seal, and the incoming problems subjected to Flyland project are described in this report. In between the last immersed tunnel element and the "cut and cover" tunnel, there will be a final/closure joint. A new design of the final joint is ought to be in situ constructed, then a new developed final joint is brought up in the discussion. A collar around the cast in situ tunnel is developed to have dry circumstances during constructing the closure joint of the tunnel. Moreover, improvements to a better construction and easier execution are the m...|$|E

50|$|The {{future of}} freight using the line through Denton {{seems to be}} more assured. It is {{proposed}} to improve <b>gauge</b> <b>clearance</b> to allow intermodal trains to/from Trafford Park to divert via Denton. A lack of a diversionary route for some freight trains to/from Trafford Park causes poor performance when there is disruption on the primary route. It also means that this trafﬁc cannot run when there is a planned closure of the route. It is proposed to carry out this work provided it can be done at little or no extra cost through renewal works.|$|R

40|$|While a {{wheelset}} is centring {{itself in}} the <b>gauge</b> <b>clearance</b> due to the coupling of the wheel rotation and the wheel profiles, this effect is missing at independently rotating wheels.

50|$|The {{route is}} double track {{throughout}} with passing loops at certain locations. The highest line-speed {{on the route}} is 100 mph. The route has a loading <b>gauge</b> <b>clearance</b> of W7 except Reading to Westbury and Taunton to Exeter which are the larger W8, and is open to rolling stock up to Route Availability 8. Signalling requires four minutes between trains {{on most of the}} route, but 8 minutes approaching Cogload Junction and 6 minutes west of Newton Abbot. Signalling is by multiple-aspect signals, controlled from panel signal boxes at Reading, Westbury, Exeter, and Plymouth, and level crossing boxes at Colthrop (near Thatcham) and Kintbury. Most of the signals are three-aspect, but some sections of two- or four-aspect signalling also exist. During 2010, control of the area currently signalled by Reading panel will transfer to the new Thames Valley Signalling Control Centre at Didcot.|$|R

50|$|The {{resulting}} {{report concluded}} that the Afro 4000's structure gauge does not fit in the South African infrastructure clearance envelope. While the PRASA rolling stock, the Class 7E and 7E2 locomotives which were used during the tests, also do not comply with the structure <b>gauge</b> <b>clearance</b> under the bridge, there was no direct contact of the carbody with the overhead contact wire since the pantographs are insulated from the roof. The Afro 4000, however, has a minimum calculated roof clearance of only 10 mm, which poses an operational electrical risk. Since it does not fit the designed earth clearances at bridges and tunnels and {{the height of the}} locomotive encroaches too close to the contact wire, the risk to the driver and the locomotive is high. One of the recommendations was that delivery of the Afro 4000 should be delayed, pending a suggested design review.|$|R
50|$|The line, {{constructed}} and {{owned by the}} State of New York, opened in 1998 to allow better freight rail access to the city by eliminating the {{need to use the}} Port Morris Branch, a more circuitous route that crossed busy commuter lines and whose tight turns (at Mott Haven and Melrose) limited the length of freight cars. It was funded in part by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The new line was built with loading <b>gauge</b> <b>clearances</b> high enough for trailer-on-flat car (TOFC) intermodal freight transport service, but is not high enough for double stack container service, due to limits imposed by city bridges crossing over the line and the high tides on the Harlem River. Construction of the line began in 1983 and cost $187 million to complete. Including that sum, more than $375 million of public money has been spent to upgrade track to TOFC clearance between Selkirk Yard near Albany and Fresh Pond Junction yard on Long Island.|$|R
40|$|Sir Henry Parkes in October 1889 at his {{definitive}} Tenterfield {{call for}} federation of the Australian Colonies had stated {{the need for}} a uniform railway gauge on the through lines between Brisbane Sydney Melbourne and Adelaide. The paper notes that this took until 1995 to be achieved, and explores the reasons why it took so long. The main reason is that under the 1897 agreements for federation, railways were left under State control. This was in contrast to Commonwealth being given express powers to control defence, and services such as post and telepraphs. The paper explores the current cost of multiple gauges and other substandard aspects of Australian railways. These include an overdependence on roads and road vehicle transport whose total costs are estimated at over 10 per cent of GDP, with a high dependence on imported oil with excessive emissions and external costs. The suggested remedies are: * expansion and upgrading of urban rail in Sydney and other large cities, * bringing mainline interstate track towards Canadian and US Class I railroad standards by straightening and strengthening the track with better <b>clearances,</b> * residual <b>gauge</b> standardisation, particularly of broad to standard gauge, * rehabilitation of branch lines and completion of better rail links to ports, * construction of an inland Melbourne Parkes Brisbane railway, and, * road pricing reform...|$|R
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{has been used}} to analyze the flow fields generated by FDG in the quasi-stagnant configuration to allow that technology to give simultaneous measurements of deposit thickness and strength. Stress field predictions were generated by solving the governing equations using the numerical solver Fastflo™, and validated by comparison with experimental hydrostatic pressure measurements. Moreover, an analytical approximation for the shear stresses imposed during the gauging experiments has been shown to yield reasonably good agreement with the CFD predictions. Particular predictions of note were that the surface shear stress is largest in the area directly underneath the rim of the gauging nozzle, and that shear stresses characteristic of industrial cleaning-in-place systems could be generated in these quasi-stagnant systems by suitable selection of the hydrostatic suction head and the <b>clearance</b> between the <b>gauging</b> nozzle and the surface. This enhanced FDG tool was employed to study the removal characteristics of tomato paste soils and weak calcium sulphate scale deposits. The critical shearing yield stress for the tomato paste was found to be strongly dependent on the extent of baking (ageing), approaching an asymptote as the material was transformed from a soft, malleable paste into a hard, brittle semi-solid. It was also found that after extended deposition and ageing, calcium sulphate layers could not be removed by these gauging flows, implying that liquid velocities customarily used in industry {{would not be able to}} dislodge such deposits. Polystyrene co-polymer fouling layers were fabricated in the laboratory. The kinetics and mechanisms of cleaning them from stainless steel surfaces using NaOH, MEK and TPU solvents were successfully investigated using FDG. NaOH was found to be a non-solvent across the range of experimental conditions, in the sense that the polymer films simply swelled to constant thickness after an induction period, without dissolving. In contrast, the polymer films were removed completely in MEK and TPU, more rapidly in the former case, in terms of swelling and dissolution rates, and overall cleaning time. The removal characteristics of different polymer films in MEK and TPU were shown to differ fundamentally, and an improved 'campaign' strategy for polymerization reactors is thereby identified. Experiments on pilot plant samples immersed in MEK and TPU indicated that the results from the laboratory samples are applicable to pilot plant scale.
