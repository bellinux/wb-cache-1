5|$|The {{diagnosis}} and classification of AML <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging,</b> {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, {{in the absence of}} such features, diagnosis may be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E

25|$|Quality {{controls}} are achievable and indeed performed in many ABC-based works, but for certain problems, {{the assessment of}} the impact of the method-related parameters <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging.</b> However, the rapidly increasing use of ABC can be expected to provide a more thorough understanding of the limitations and applicability of the method.|$|E
25|$|Examples for coarse {{graining}} (CG) {{methods are}} discontinuous molecular dynamics (CG-DMD) and Go-models. Coarse-graining is done sometimes taking larger pseudo-atoms. Such united atom approximations {{have been used}} in MD simulations of biological membranes. Implementation of such approach on systems where electrical properties are of interest <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> owing to the difficulty of using a proper charge distribution on the pseudo-atoms. The aliphatic tails of lipids are represented by a few pseudo-atoms by gathering 2 to 4 methylene groups into each pseudo-atom.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} phase, differentiation, {{children}} begin {{to learn that}} written language regularly differs in structure and style from spoken language. The growth from consolidation to differentiation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> for some children to grasp. Children can 'struggle with the transformation from the basically overt language of speech to the essentially covert activity of writing'. In this phase, the child learns that writing is generally considered more formal than spoken language, which {{is thought to be}} casual and conversational. Here, it is believed that children begin to understand that writing serves a purpose.|$|E
25|$|Given that films {{inherently}} have {{a shorter}} {{amount of time}} to develop characters and carry out storylines, the task of convincing the audience that the film's couple are adequately suited for each other <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging.</b> This is especially evident in cases where there is not enough plot focusing on the buildup of the characters' interaction, which can make the love story seem contrived. A memorable line or catchphrase spoken between the characters has been suggested as a remedy to this, since it can elevate a pairing's popularity.|$|E

However, fabrication of the OLED substrate is currently more costly {{than that of}} a TFT LCD. Roll-to-roll vapor-deposition methods for organic devices do allow mass production of thousands of devices per minute for minimal cost; however, this technique also induces problems: devices with multiple layers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> to make because of registration—lining up the different printed layers to the required degree of accuracy.|$|E

25|$|Explicit phylogenetic methods {{rely upon}} the {{accuracy}} of the input rooted gene and species trees, yet these <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> to build. Even when {{there is no doubt in}} the input trees, the conflicting phylogenies can be the result of evolutionary processes other than HGT, such as duplications and losses, causing these methods to erroneously infer HGT events when paralogy is the correct explanation. Similarly, in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, explicit phylogeny methods can erroneously infer HGT events. That is why some explicit model-based methods test multiple evolutionary scenarios involving different kinds of events, and compare their fit to the data given parsimonious or probabilistic criteria.|$|E
25|$|Some of Tchaikovsky's piano works <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> technically; nevertheless, {{they are}} mostly charming, unpretentious {{compositions}} intended for amateur pianists. It would therefore {{be easy to}} dismiss the entire œuvre as mediocre and merely competent. While this view could hold true to some point, there is more attractive and resourceful music {{in some of these}} pieces than one might be inclined to expect. The difference between Tchaikovsky's pieces and many other salon works are patches of striking harmony and unexpected phrase structures which may demand some extra patience but will not remain unrewarded from a musical standpoint. Many of the pieces have titles which give imaginative pointers on how they should be played.|$|E
25|$|In this chapter, Innis {{outlines}} {{the history of}} the world's first civilizations in Mesopotamia. He starts with the fertile plains between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, but as the history unfolds, his discussion extends to large parts of the modern Middle East. Biographer Paul Heyer's warning that Innis's work <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> applies to this three thousand year history. Innis's condensed, elliptical prose demands careful reading as he traces the origins of writing from clay tablet and cuneiform script to the efficient Phoenician alphabet written on parchment and papyrus. Along the way, Innis comments on many aspects of the ancient Middle Eastern empires, including power struggles between priests and kings, the evolution of military technologies and the development of the Hebrew Bible.|$|E

25|$|Moving {{during the}} summer months <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging.</b> Courses {{students}} have taken at their old schools may not fulfill the graduation requirements at their new school. Moving during the winter holidays or mid-year, however, has traditionally been viewed as the worst time to move. The student is forced to join classes that have already begun. Social groups become even more difficult to break into, and activities that the student enjoyed may be barred to him or her. For example, an athlete {{may not be able to}} join his or her sport because they missed tryouts and the season had already begun. A student who excelled at their old DoDDS or DDESS school suddenly feels inadequate at the larger school. Recent studies, however, show that mobility during the school year may be less traumatic than summertime moves.|$|E
25|$|For {{listeners}} {{unfamiliar with}} experimental music, Bailey's distinctive style <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging.</b> Its most noticeable feature is {{what appears to}} be its extreme discontinuity, often from note to note: there may be enormous intervals between consecutive notes, and rather than aspiring to the consistency of timbre typical of most guitar-playing, Bailey interrupts it as much as possible: four consecutive notes, for instance, may be played on an open string, a fretted string, via harmonics, and using a nonstandard technique such as scraping the string with the pick or plucking below the bridge. Many of the key features of his music—radical discontinuity, the self-contained brevity of each gesture, an attraction to wide intervals—owe much to Bailey's early fascination with Anton Webern, an influence most audible on Bailey's earliest available recordings, Pieces for Guitar (1966–67, issued on Tzadik).|$|E
25|$|Arable land {{in small}} {{alluvial}} flats of most rural river valleys in South Korea {{are dedicated to}} paddy-field farming. Farmers assess paddy fields for any necessary repairs in February. Fields may be rebuilt, and bund breaches are repaired. This work is carried out until mid-March, when warmer spring weather allows the farmer to buy or grow rice seedlings. They are transplanted (usually by rice transplanter) from the indoors into freshly flooded paddy fields in May. Farmers tend and weed their paddy fields through the summer until {{around the time of}} Chuseok, a traditional holiday held on 15 August of the Lunar Calendar (circa mid-September by Solar Calendar). The harvest begins in October. Coordinating the harvest <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging</b> because many Korean farmers have small paddy fields in a number of locations around their villages, and modern harvesting machines are sometimes shared between extended family members. Farmers usually dry the harvested grains in the sun before bringing them to market.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral health {{disorders}} are {{prevalent in the}} United States, but accessing treatment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>challenging.</b> Nearly 1 in 5 adults experience a mental health condition for which approximately only 43% received treatment. When asked about access to mental health treatment, two-thirds of primary care physicians {{reported that they were}} unable to secure outpatient mental health treatment for their patients. This is due, in part, to the workforce shortage in behavioral health. In rural areas, 55% of US counties have no practicing psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Overall, 77% of counties have a severe shortage of mental health workers and 96% of counties had some unmet need. Some {{of the reasons for the}} workforce shortage include high turnover rates, high stress position, and inadequate compensation. Annual turnover rate is 33% for clinicians and 23% for clinical supervisors. This is compared to an annual PCP turnover rate of 7.1%. Compensation in behavioral health field is notably low. The average licensed clinical social worker, a degree that requires master's degree and 2000 hours post graduate experience, earns $45,000/year on average. As a point of reference, the average physical therapist earns $75,000/year on average. Substance abuse counselor earnings are even lower, with an average salary of $34,000/year. Job stress is another factor that may lead to the high turnover rates and workforce shortage. It is estimated that 21-67% of mental health workers experience high levels of burnout including symptoms of emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Researchers have offered various recommendations to reduce the critical workforce gaps in behavioral health. Some of these recommendations include the following: expanding loan repayment programs to incentivize mental health providers to serve in underserved (often rural) areas, integrating mental health into primary care, and increasing reimbursement to health care professionals.|$|E
