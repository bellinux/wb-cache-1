40|$|It {{is shown}} that all <b>creep</b> data in metals {{ascribed}} to the Nabarro-Herring (N-H) diffusional <b>creep</b> mechanism cannot in fact be definitively described by the N-H <b>creep</b> theory. Rather, the <b>creep</b> mechanism is associated with either Harper-Dorn (H-D) dislocation <b>creep</b> or grain boundary sliding (GBS). Specific responses are presented to work by Fiala and Langdon (F-L) who have presented opposing views to the above conclusions. <b>Creep</b> data for copper used by F-L to support N-H <b>creep</b> are shown to be incompatible with the theory, since the experimental <b>creep</b> rates are about three orders of magnitude higher than predicted. The copper <b>creep</b> data, however, can be predicted by phenomenological equations for GBS and H-D <b>creep.</b> It is concluded {{that as long as}} rigorous and physically sound theories for <b>creep</b> controlled by GBS and H-D <b>creep</b> are not forthcoming, researchers will continue to use, erroneously in the authors' view, the N-H diffusional <b>creep</b> mechanism to explain low stress <b>creep</b> behavior of polycrustalline solids.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that the <b>creep</b> characteristics at high temperatures are mainly evaluated by a minimum <b>creep</b> rate. Although, {{the shape of a}} <b>creep</b> curve may vary depending on deformation conditions, the apparent steady state or minimum <b>creep</b> rates can be the same. Thus, for detailed analysis and prediction of <b>creep</b> behavior, other values, which reflect the shape of each <b>creep</b> curve, should be considered. For this purpose, the authors have proposed Sato’s strain-acceleration-parameter (Strain Acceleration and Transition Objective index, SATO-index) which reflects strain rate change during <b>creep</b> deformation. Based on the concept of the SATO-index, the entire <b>creep</b> curve can be represented by a small number of numerical parameters, and can be extrapolated from a part of the <b>creep</b> curve. In this paper, application of the SATO-index to <b>creep</b> curves of aluminum-magnesium solid solutions which show both the Alloy-type and Metal-type <b>creep</b> behavior is discussed. The <b>creep</b> curve can be extrapolated by the concept from the transient part of the <b>creep</b> curve, and the stress dependence of the extrapolated <b>creep</b> rates at the minimum <b>creep</b> rate agrees well with experiments. Efficiency of the concept of the SATO-index to <b>creep</b> experiments is presented...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryMichael D. TokachFive {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} {{determine the influence of}} <b>creep</b> feeding on individual consumption characteristics and growth performance of neonatal and weanling pigs. These evaluated the effects of lactation feed intake and <b>creep</b> feeding (n = 84 litters; Exp. 1), <b>creep</b> feeding duration (n = 54 litters; Exp. 2), <b>creep</b> feeder design and feed accessibility (n = 54 litters; Exp. 3), organoleptic properties of the <b>creep</b> feed (n = 50 litters; Exp. 4) and <b>creep</b> diet complexity (n = 96 litters; Exp. 5). In summary, <b>creep</b> feeding did not affect preweaning gains and weaning weights of pigs weaned at 3 weeks of age. <b>Creep</b> feeding for 18 d did not influence sow performance. However, <b>creep</b> feeding tended to improve litter weaning weights due to improved survivability. <b>Creep</b> feed consumption was related to piglet maturity rather than the induction of <b>creep</b> feeding. In both experimental and field conditions, pigs that consumed <b>creep</b> feed (eaters) had greater post-weaning feed intake and daily gains compared to non-eaters (pigs that did not consume <b>creep</b> feed) and non-creep fed pigs. This led to improvements in pig weight uniformity and reduction of the severity of post-weaning lag. These benefits were achieved regardless of weaning weight, the complexity of the <b>creep</b> diet, and the duration of <b>creep</b> feeding. The proportion of eaters of <b>creep</b> feed in whole litters can be manipulated. Longer duration of <b>creep</b> feeding increased the proportion of eaters. A rotary <b>creep</b> feeder with a hopper created the most eaters with the lowest <b>creep</b> feed disappearance. <b>Creep</b> diet complexity had the greatest effect in increasing the proportion of pigs consuming <b>creep</b> feed. On the other hand, low feed intake of lactating sows and adding feed flavors to the <b>creep</b> feed did not affect <b>creep</b> feed consumption and the proportion of pigs consuming <b>creep</b> feed. Therefore, <b>creep</b> feeding that focuses in encouraging more suckling piglets to eat is beneficial in producing weanling pigs that are better adapted to weaning, which improves post-weaning performance...|$|R
5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water <b>creeps</b> across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have great}} powers of {{regeneration}} and can reproduce asexually, by budding, fragmentation, or by longitudinal or transverse binary fission. Some {{species such as}} certain Anthopleura divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing halfway up the column before it splits horizontally. Some species can also reproduce by pedal laceration. In this process, a ring of material may break off from the pedal disc {{at the base of}} the column which then fragments, the pieces regenerating into new clonal individuals. Alternatively, fragments detach separately as the animal <b>creeps</b> across a surface. In Metridium dianthus, fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells, and all the new individuals had tentacles within three weeks.|$|E
5|$|The slug-like larva of Phoronis ovalis swims {{for about}} 4 days, <b>creeps</b> on the sea-bed for 3 to 4 days, then bores into a {{carbonate}} floor. Nothing {{is known about}} three species. The remaining species develop free-swimming actinotroch larvae, which feed on plankton. The actinotroch is an upright cylinder with the anus {{at the bottom and}} fringed with cilia. At the top is a lobe or hood, under which are: a ganglion, connected to a patch of cilia outside the apex of the hood; a pair of protonephridia (smaller and simpler than the metanephridia in the adult); the mouth; and feeding tentacles that encircle the mouth. After swimming for about 20 days, the actinotroch settles on the seabed and undergoes a catastrophic metamorphosis (radical change) in 30minutes: the hood and larval tentacles are absorbed and the adult lophophore is created round the mouth, and both now points upward; the gut develops a U-bend so that the anus is just under and outside the lophophore. Finally the adult phoronid builds a tube.|$|E

40|$|An {{incremental}} {{format of}} <b>creep</b> model {{was presented to}} take account of the development of concrete <b>creep</b> due to loading at different ages.

Two <b>creep</b> curves were combined by introducing an ageing parameter whose value was obtained from two sets of time-dependent laboratory experiments on cylindrical specimens. The presented <b>creep</b> description takes the advantage that a single <b>creep</b> curve due to the initial loading describes the entire development of <b>creep</b> under the persistent change of creep-causing stress.

2500|$|Coble <b>creep</b> is {{a second}} form of {{diffusion}} controlled <b>creep.</b> In Coble <b>creep</b> the atoms diffuse along grain boundaries to elongate the grains along the stress axis. This causes Coble <b>creep</b> to have a stronger grain size dependence than Nabarro–Herring <b>creep,</b> thus, Coble <b>creep</b> will be more important in materials composed of very fine grains. For Coble <b>creep</b> k {{is related to the}} diffusion coefficient of atoms along the grain boundary, Q = Q(grain boundary diffusion), m = 1, and b = 3. Because Q(grain boundary diffusion) < Q(self diffusion), Coble <b>creep</b> occurs at lower temperatures than Nabarro–Herring <b>creep.</b> Coble <b>creep</b> is still temperature dependent, as the temperature increases so does the grain boundary diffusion. However, since the number of nearest neighbors is effectively limited along the interface of the grains, and thermal generation of vacancies along the boundaries is less prevalent, the temperature dependence is not as strong as in Nabarro–Herring <b>creep.</b> It also exhibits the same linear dependence on stress as Nabarro–Herring <b>creep.</b> Generally, the diffusional <b>creep</b> rate should be the sum of Nabarro–Herring <b>creep</b> rate and Coble <b>creep</b> rate. Diffusional <b>creep</b> leads to grain-boundary separation, that is, voids or cracks form between the grains. To heal this, grain-boundary sliding occurs. The diffusional <b>creep</b> rate and the grain boundary sliding rate must be balanced if there are no voids or cracks remain. When grain-boundary sliding couldn't accommodate the incompatibility, [...] grain-boundary voids are generated, which is related to the initiation of <b>creep</b> fracture.|$|R
