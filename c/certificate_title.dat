50|$|Curtain {{principle}} - {{one does}} not need to go behind the <b>Certificate</b> of <b>Title</b> as it contains all the information about the title.

All of the necessary information regarding ownership is on the <b>Certificate</b> of <b>Title.</b>|$|R
40|$|Plaintiff {{insurance}} company paid {{the owner of}} a stolen automobile full value for his loss, and received in return the <b>certificate</b> of <b>title</b> with a proper assignment thereon. Later, having found the automobile in the possession of the defendant, a purchaser from a thief, plaintiff sued out a writ of replevin without first obtaining a new <b>certificate</b> of <b>title</b> in its own name.

It is a well-established rule of law that the plaintiff in a replevin action must bring the action on the strength of his own title, prior possession or right to possession. Here, because the plaintiff had failed to apply for a new <b>certificate</b> of <b>title</b> “within three days after delivery” of the automobile as required by Nebraska statute, the defendant was able to prove that title remained in the original owner...|$|R

50|$|Generally, each {{separate}} <b>certificate</b> of <b>title</b> {{is considered}} to be its own rating unit.

So, for example, a farmer with land on four different titles, on both sides of a road that goes through the middle of his property, would most likely have his four titles deemed to be a single rating unit.|$|R
