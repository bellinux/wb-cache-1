5|$|Van der Sloot's mother, Anita, {{stated in}} a Dutch {{interview}} {{that her son}} <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Flores and that she will not visit him at the prison. She said in another interview that she hopes {{to talk to the}} family of the victim and apologize to them.|$|E
5|$|One B-26, {{after being}} seriously damaged by {{anti-aircraft}} fire, made a suicide run on Akagi. Making {{no attempt to}} pull out of its run, the aircraft narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's bridge, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Nagumo and his command staff. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.|$|E
5|$|When Sivanandam and Naidu {{interrogate}} Pattabi, {{who feels}} remorse for Rajan's death, {{he admits that}} he did not treat his brother well nor understand his good intentions. He recounts an incident in which his wife Hema fought with Rajan because he refused to apportion the property. Pattabi states that Hema <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Rajan for the money as she loses her sanity when overpowered by anger.|$|E
50|$|Many more villagers <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been <b>killed</b> <b>had</b> {{they not}} been in the local theatre {{watching}} a film that night.|$|R
25|$|These actions {{convinced}} the Tsar that Karaite ancestors <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Jesus and that thus their descendants were free of familial guilt, {{which was an}} underlying reason or pretext given at that time for antisemitic laws.|$|R
50|$|Stockdale was a {{close friend}} of Charlotte Shelby. He testified on the witness stand that he was with Mrs. Shelby, a major suspect in the murder of William Desmond Taylor, and {{therefore}} she <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him.|$|R
5|$|Sivanandam leaves Naidu to {{interrogate}} Hema. She is initially impudent {{and refuses to}} give a statement about the crime, but she later agrees when Sivanandam threatens to arrest her husband. She reveals Rajan's extramarital affair with a dancer named Ambujam, who is pregnant with his child. As Rajan treated the news with a reckless attitude, Hema suggests that Ambujam <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him. When questioned, Ambujam accuses Chinnaiah of murdering Rajan, saying that Chinnaiah was her foster father and wanted her {{to stay away from}} Rajan after the three met during a picnic. As their relationship continued, Chinnaiah became infuriated and wanted to end the affair.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 2016, {{after the}} {{campaign}} for the local elections, Berlusconi was hospitalized to the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan because of heart problems. After two days, on 9 June, his personal doctor Alberto Zangrillo announced that the stroke <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him and he must have a heart surgery to replace a defective aortic valve.|$|E

50|$|In July 1995, {{members of}} the Animal Liberation Front {{allegedly}} sent a pipe bomb to Thompson's office in Toronto. His assistant <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been <b>killed,</b> except that the device's battery had become disconnected through mishandling by Canada Post.|$|R
50|$|Preliminary {{results of}} a study {{performed}} by Dr. Clarence A. Mills of the University of Cincinnati and released in December 1948 showed that thousands more Donora residents <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been <b>killed</b> if the smog had lasted any longer than it had.|$|R
25|$|One {{analysis}} of the fight gives credit to either Holliday or Morgan Earp for firing the fatal shot at McLaury on Fremont Street. Holliday may have been on McLaury's right and Morgan Earp on his left. McLaury {{was shot in the}} right side of the head, so Holliday is often given credit for shooting him. However, Wyatt Earp had shot McLaury in his torso earlier, a shot that alone <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him. McLaury would have turned away after having been hit and Wyatt could have placed a second shot in his head. A 30-day-long preliminary hearing found that the Earps and Holliday had acted within their duties as lawmen, although this did not pacify Ike Clanton.|$|E
25|$|Other {{observers}} {{have criticized the}} thoroughness of the investigation, and the validity of its conclusions. The author James Baldwin, in his essay The Evidence of Things Not Seen (1985), raised questions about Williams' guilt. Members of his community {{and several of the}} victims' parents did not believe that Williams, the son of two professional teachers, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> so many. On May 6, 2005, DeKalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ordered the reopening of the murder cases of four boys killed in that county between February and May 1981 that had been attributed to Williams. The announcement was welcomed by relatives of some victims, who said they believe the wrong man was blamed for many of the murders.|$|E
25|$|Doctors {{told him}} he was lucky: it could have broken his cheekbones, jaw or removed his {{eyesight}} if it had hit any of the surrounding areas. It <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him if it had struck him where his skull was previously fractured. He married after the match and had to mumble his wedding vows through a swathe of bandages. Benaud went on to play in the final four Tests. He made 124 runs at 20.66, making double figures in four of seven innings, but was unable to capitalise on his starts, with a top score of 45. His leg spin yielded ten wickets at 30.60, with a best of 4/118 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide when he was given a heavy workload, totalling 58 overs, when Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller broke down during the match. In another match for New South Wales against the touring team, he took a total of 5/95.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, {{the film}} The Taint {{required}} buying a steam-engine and then destroying it in a staged derailment. The stunt {{did not go}} as planned and the train overturned close to the actors who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been <b>killed.</b> No one was hurt however.|$|R
5000|$|Castleman, however, {{believes}} that Bonniwell committed suicide. Simon determines {{that there is}} clear evidence of two shots, and understands that Bonniwell <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> himself. Joyce tells the sheriff that Sam had lost all his money. She denies any knowledge of the ranch and of Sam’s relationship with Evelyn.|$|R
50|$|Curphey was {{the chief}} coroner during the {{investigation}} into the death of Marilyn Monroe. On August 7, 1962, Two days after Monroe’s death, Curphey announced that a massive overdose of barbiturates was the cause of death. He later said she had lethal doses of both Nembutal or Chloral hydrate and she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been <b>killed</b> by either.|$|R
25|$|In 2009 a {{group of}} British doctors who had not {{had access to the}} evidence, {{including}} Michael Powers who is a doctor, barrister and former coroner, challenged Hutton's verdict, offering their opinion based on published reports that {{the cause of death was}} untenable; they argued that the artery is small and difficult to access, and severing it would not have triggered sufficient blood loss to cause death. This opinion was challenged by several forensic pathologists who also had not had access to the evidence, who told The Guardian that the combination of Kelly's heart disease and the overdose would have meant a smaller loss of blood <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him than would be needed to kill a healthier person. In August 2010 the former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, called for a full inquest, and Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General for England and Wales, confirmed that he was considering re-opening it.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013 it was {{revealed}} that {{on the morning of the}} ceremony, Britain's surveillance headquarters GCHQ had detected a credible cyber attack threat that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> the lighting system in the stadium. [...] Counter-measures were taken, and in the afternoon contingency plans were discussed with government ministers at a meeting in the Cabinet Office briefing room. [...] However, this attack never materialised.|$|E
500|$|Gavia Baker-Whitelaw, {{writing in}} The Daily Dot, {{said that the}} removal of a female {{character}} was [...] "An unfortunate occurrence that neatly fits in with Moffat's track record with female characters in both Doctor Who and Sherlock", Baker-Whitelaw goes on to question whether Mary <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Mikkelsen, instead of [...] "playing right {{into the hands of}} fans who believe Moffat is a misogynist who writes all of his female characters into the same corner", and questions whether Moffat is indeed a misogynist.|$|E
50|$|Mike's body is {{eventually}} found, dismembered and burned. Military officials initially attempt {{to block the}} police investigation; they suggest Mike's death was due to drug-related violence. His platoon mates who last saw him lie to Deerfield and the police. Deerfield tells the police that although he suspects the soldiers are lying about something, he believes they <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> their comrade.|$|R
50|$|The villagers, now {{convinced}} that Hercules killed Serena, form a lynch mob and come after Hercules. Hercules flees from the mob and hides {{out in an}} old man's house. As Hercules hides from the mob, he cradles Serena's necklace {{in his hands and}} asks why. The man knows that Hercules grief is real and he <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> his wife.|$|R
5000|$|The long recension of {{the text}} claims that the Chaulukya king Bhima II killed Prithviraj's father Someshvara. Later, Prithviraj {{defeated}} and killed Bhima. This {{is known to be}} historically false, as the reign of Bhima lasted nearly half a century after Prithviraj's death. Also, Bhima was a child at the time of Someshvara's death, and therefore, <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him.|$|R
500|$|On 1 May 2007, No Smoke [...] The Shocking Truth About British Justice, by Sandra Lean, was {{published}} by Exposure Publishing. This book features the stories of seven high-profile convicted murderers, including Park, Luke Mitchell and Sion Jenkins. The book claims that the expert testimonies in the Lady in the Lake trial were flawed, that certain evidence was withheld, and that the sensationalist reporting of the press at the time influenced the court by persuading them that Park {{was the only person}} who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> his wife.|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Karen Geurtsen, a Dutch {{journalist}} {{from the}} magazine HP-De Tijd, revealed a painful breach of security. She spent four months working undercover, posing as an intern, for the PVV party. She claimed {{that she had}} had unchecked access to Wilders. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him", were the first words of the article that she published about this operation. According to her, she had [...] "dozens" [...] of opportunities to take his life. In July 2010, after Wilders complained that his security was inadequate, the Special Security Assignments Brigade, a special unit of Dutch military police, made four attempts to smuggle a firearm into the heavily guarded offices of Wilders' Freedom Party, two of which were successful. Following these breaches, security at the offices was increased.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Gray {{spoke with}} TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: [...] "At first, {{they had no}} idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch." [...] However, Gray was {{upgraded}} to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it [...] "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, [...] "I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [...] I swear to you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him!" ...|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Colonel Smith {{heard the}} {{exchange}} of fire from his position in the town moments after he received the request for reinforcements from Laurie. He quickly assembled two companies of grenadiers to lead toward the North Bridge himself. As these troops marched, they met the shattered remnants of the three light infantry companies running towards them. Smith {{was concerned about the}} four companies that had been at Barrett's, since their route to town was now unprotected. When he saw the Minutemen in the distance behind their wall, he halted his two companies and moved forward with only his officers to take a closer look. [...] One of the Minutemen behind that wall observed, [...] "If we had fired, I believe we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> almost every officer there was in the front, but we had no orders to fire and there wasn't a gun fired." [...] During a tense standoff lasting about 10 minutes, a mentally ill local man named Elias Brown wandered through both sides selling hard cider.|$|E
500|$|In January 1966, Eastwood met {{producer}} Dino De Laurentiis in New York City {{and agreed}} to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production named Le Streghe ("The Witches") opposite De Laurentiis' wife, actress Silvana Mangano. Eastwood's nineteen-minute installment took {{only a few days}} to shoot, but his performance did not please the critics, one writing that [...] "no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'." [...] Two months later Eastwood began work on the third Dollars film, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with Eli Wallach portraying the cunning Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of Confederate gold buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. [...] "I know about these things," [...] he said. [...] "Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can." [...] Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word [...] "Vaya!" [...] resulted in a premature explosion that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Wallach.|$|E
500|$|She {{accompanied}} Lennon to America on {{the first}} Beatles' tour there, with Lennon allowing the press to photograph them together, which infuriated Epstein, as {{he had wanted to}} keep their marriage a secret. On the tour, she was left behind in New York when Lennon and the other Beatles were quickly ushered into a car, and in Miami she had to ask the help of fans to convince a security guard who she was. Lennon's response was, [...] "Don't be so bloody slow next time—they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> you". It would be the only time Cynthia would go on tour with them. [...] At the Emperor's Gate address the situation grew worse, with fans sticking chewing gum in the lock of the flat and tearing at any article of clothing when she or Lennon were leaving or arriving. American girls would write her letters proclaiming their desperate love for John; the women {{in the lives of the}} other Beatles received equivalent missives. As late as 1967, Beatles' wives were still dealing with occasional physical danger from female Beatles' fans, with Cynthia being kicked in the legs by one who demanded she [...] "leave John alone!" ...|$|E
