500|$|In the NME, Neil Spencer {{wrote that}} [...] "Though Extra Texture isn't the Harrison revival that many might have hopes for, it's still several leagues {{superior}} to Hari's more recent efforts; {{and just as}} All Things Must Pass {{would have made a}} great single album, so Extra Texture would make a more than commendable single side." [...] Spencer described the album's content as [...] "the customary mournful and doom-laden Harrison we've come to know and fear, only this time the rigours of love take precedence over matters spiritual", and he advised his readers: [...] "I've played it, I don't mind it... Hari fans <b>can</b> <b>anticipate</b> purchase with glee. Others approach with cautious optimism." [...] Reviewing for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman described it as [...] "splendid" [...] and approved of Harrison's return to his 1960s musical influences. Coleman especially admired the first three songs and said that the album was a [...] "re-statement of the fundamentals we should all cherish".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Ravenloft module {{has been}} revised and expanded three times. In 1993, TSR published House of Strahd (module code RM4). It was updated to include rules {{from the second}} edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The module credits the original work by the Hickmans, but was revised by Bruce Nesmith, who along with Andria Hayday created the Ravenloft campaign setting. Nesmith introduced some new creatures, developed Strahd's tactics further, and added a Time-Track Table so that the referee <b>can</b> <b>anticipate</b> the sunset. In October 2006, Wizards of the Coast released an updated and expanded version of the original module for Dungeons & Dragons version 3.5 as a 226-page hardcover book entitled Expedition to Castle Ravenloft. It {{was based on the}} original module, and not the Ravenloft material made in the intervening years. Expedition to Castle Ravenloft is designed to be played as a mini-campaign lasting about 20 game sessions, much longer than the original module, although it contains options for running long 8-session or short 4-session adventures. The book also includes suggestions for incorporating the adventure into an existing generic setting, Forgotten Realms, Eberron or d20 Modern campaign. Wizards of the Coast released the board game Castle Ravenloft in 2010 as part of the [...] "Adventure System" [...] series of board games using a simplified 4th edition rule set. In 2016, Wizards of the Coast published Curse of Strahd, an adaptation of the original Ravenloft module for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, which was generally well received, earning the 2016 ENnie Awards for Best Adventure and Best Art/Cover and runner up for Product of the Year.|$|E

2500|$|Beckett {{also wanted}} to explore themes about making hard choices. To {{think outside the box}} {{sometimes}} requires not only [...] "transgressive" [...] but extremely [...] "cruel" [...] behavior, he told Kirkus Reviews. The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number of unintended ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a reactionary response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of patriarchy) but in ways no one <b>can</b> <b>anticipate.</b> Beckett said much of {{the latter part of the}} novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and force people to make sacrifices they do not wish to make.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prognosis}} for a ruptured cerebral aneurysm {{depends on the}} extent and location of the aneurysm, the person's age, general health, and neurological condition. Some individuals with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm die from the initial bleeding. Other individuals with cerebral aneurysm recover {{with little or no}} neurological deficit. [...] The most significant factors in determining outcome are the Hunt and Hess grade, and age. [...] Generally patients with Hunt and Hess grade I and II hemorrhage on admission to the emergency room and patients who are younger within the typical age range of vulnerability <b>can</b> <b>anticipate</b> a good outcome, without death or permanent disability. [...] Older patients and those with poorer Hunt and Hess grades on admission have a poor prognosis.

Attenborough visits the Met Office in Exeter to learn their conclusions. Their findings include several factors, and allow for natural climate change as well as man-made carbon dioxide emissions. A graph shows that up until around 1970, the variance in Earth's temperatures was largely due to inherent anomalies, but from then on there is a marked escalation, {{which can only be}} explained by human activity. A computer model reveals that, for example, the 2003 European heat wave — by present reckoning a 1 in 200 years event — will be something that occurs every other summer by 2040, and by 2080 would be considered to be cool weather.

New York publicist Mortimer Matz recommends an old raincoat. In addition to concealing the handcuffs, he says, {{it is not a}} problem when the garment inevitably gets smudged by fingerprint ink remaining on the defendant's hands. New York Mafia boss John Gotti wore the expensive custom-tailored suits that earned him his [...] "Dapper Don" [...] nickname during perp walks, in contrast to the sweatpants and jackets seen among other contemporary organized-crime figures.|$|E

Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. An airline system developed by Douglas A. Lawson uses swarm theory, or swarm intelligence—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. [...] "The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, {{and it turns out}} that that's the best solution for the airline," [...] Lawson explains. As a result, the [...] "colony" [...] of pilots always go to gates they can arrive and depart quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>anticipate</b> that it's going to happen, so we'll have a gate available," [...] says Lawson.|$|E
