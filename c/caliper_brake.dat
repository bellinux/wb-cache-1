50|$|Touring {{bicycles}} {{usually have}} linear-pull brakes or cantilever brakes, {{instead of the}} <b>caliper</b> <b>brakes</b> used on racing bicycles. <b>Caliper</b> <b>brakes</b> are less suitable because, to fit around mudguards (fenders) and wide tires, they become large and may flex when trying to stop a heavy bike. Some newer touring bikes use disc brakes, because of their greater stopping power in wet and muddy conditions and also to avoid outer rim wear. However, they are more complicated, so repairing them in remote locations can be difficult; they also weigh more than a cantilever brakes, increase the stresses on spokes, and require the front wheel to be dished, which reduces the durability of the wheels.|$|R

For 1976 to 1979 models the front brake was a pivot caliper ATE disc actuated from the controls via cable to a brake master cylinder under the tank. From 1980 models onwards front brakes were changed to a Brembo fixed <b>caliper</b> <b>brake,</b> and the master cylinder was moved from undertank to the right handlebar. With the introduction of Monolever models in 1986, the Brembo fixed calipers were mounted on the fork tubes. The back brake was initially a drum brake.

40|$|A twin <b>caliper</b> <b>brake</b> {{system is}} {{investigated}} using {{the whole body}} visual technique of holographic interferometry. It is shown that the disc mode of vibration has a preferred position where a disc antinode is situated under one caliper and a disc node under the second caliper. The maximum angular space occupied by the pad antinode is, as predicted by the theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry, the angle subtended by the pad length. For a four- piston opposed caliper the minimum distance is slightly larger than the piston centers. There {{is evidence that the}} disc mode position, in relation to the two calipers, may be antinode/node, node/node or antinode/antinode. With these arrangements an accompanying revised theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry predicts two stable conditions are possible - if the calipers are positioned either at an angle between 125 to 130 or 165 to 175. The smaller angle was not tested but the brake became quiet at angles greater than 166. A brief study of the caliper modes and pad spring retainer is included in the holographic results...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that the application of open-loop dither control to a brake provides an effective means of suppressing brake squeal. Dither control is a method by which high frequency disturbances are introduced into a system. Dither suppresses the friction induced squeal response at lower frequencies, thus eliminating audible brake squeal. Dither control when applied at 100 % duty cycle {{has been shown to be}} an effective means of suppressing brake squeal. This paper documents an investigation into the use burst-mode dither control for suppression of brake squeal. Burst mode dither control is characterized by duty cycles of less than 100 %. Dither is introduced to a brake by placing a piezoelectric stack actuator in the piston of a floating <b>caliper</b> <b>brake.</b> The piezoelectric stack actuator is driven by a 20 kHz burst mode signal, and the impact upon the squeal is assessed. Burst mode dither with duty cycles as low as 50 % are shown to be as effective in suppressing brake squeal as dithering at 100 % duty cycle...|$|E
40|$|Dither {{control is}} a method of {{introducing}} high frequency control efforts into a system to suppress a lower frequency disturbance. Dither {{control is a}}n effective means of suppressing automotive brake squeal. Brake squeal is a problem that has plagued the automotive industry for years. In fact many makers of materials for brake pads spend up to 50 % of their engineering budgets on noise, vibration and harshness issues. A normal dither signal may be introduced to an automotive braking system by placing a piezoceramic stack actuator in the piston of a floating <b>caliper</b> <b>brake.</b> Many theoretical models indicate a reduction in the braking torque due to the dither signal. Under the assumption of Hertzian contact stiffness the loss in braking torque is due to lowering of the average normal force. There are also theories that the dither signal eliminates the stick-slip oscillation causing an effective decrease in the friction force. Yet another theory indicates that the effective contact area is reduced, lowering the mean coefficient of friction. It is not apparent whether any of these models accurately portrays the interaction of the brake pads and rotor. M. S.
