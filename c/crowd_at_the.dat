Later that year they suffered a record home loss, 41–3 to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 {{points to}} 8 and {{defeating}} Germany 27 points to 17. Other sources list the German team as second, {{because of the}} points difference, but no such determination was made in 1900. 6,000 people watched the game between France and Great Britain, which was the largest <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> games.

5|$|However, the prisoners' time {{in prison}} was brief, as Diệm was deposed and killed in a coup in November 1963. On November 8, {{political}} opponents who had been imprisoned {{on the island of}} Poulo Condore were released by the military junta. Đán was garlanded and taken to military headquarters, and on November 10, Suu was released and welcomed by a large <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> town hall. Suu later served as president for a brief period and Dan as a deputy prime minister. Thi, Đông and Lieu returned to South Vietnam and resumed their service in the ARVN.|$|E

5|$|Machine Head headlined the True Metal {{stage at}} the 2005 Wacken Open Air festival to 40,000 fans—the band's largest {{headlining}} <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.

They also played in Dubai for the annual Dubai Desert Rock Festival in 2005. This was their first show in the Middle East. The band also played at the farewell concert of Böhse Onkelz on the Euro Speedway Lausitz.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} {{that if they}} can find the Isolus pod and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both {{in one of her}} sketches and forcing Rose to try to find the pod herself. She rationalises that the pod is located on the hottest spot on the street, a patch of freshly laid tar, and is able to dig it up. Meanwhile, Chloe has caused the entire <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Olympic stadium to disappear and now is set on making everyone in the world disappear. Rose tries {{to find out how to}} power the pod, and uses visual indications from the Doctor's picture to understand that the pod needs heat mixed with emotion. Rose throws the pod towards the Olympic Torch - a symbol of hope, courage, and love - as it passes down the street. The missing children and the <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Olympics reappear, and Rose realises that the drawing Chloe had made of her father will similarly come to life. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe by singing the Kookaburra song, causing the unseen monster - having fed off of Chloe's emotions and fears - to disappear.|$|E

Heavier stars slow down and <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cluster's core, while lighter stars pick up speed and tend to spend more time at the cluster's periphery. The globular star cluster 47 Tucanae, which is made up of about 1 million stars, is one of the densest globular clusters in the Southern Hemisphere. This cluster was subjected to an intensive photographic survey, which allowed astronomers to track the motion of its stars. Precise velocities were obtained for nearly 15,000 stars in this cluster.|$|E
5|$|UConn {{advanced}} to the Final Four and outscored rival Tennessee in the semifinals by 23 points. In front of a record-breaking <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Alamodome in San Antonio, UConn defeated Oklahoma for the championship 82–70 to complete a perfect 39–0 season. The starting five of Bird, Taurasi, Cash, Jones, and Williams {{is widely regarded as}} the best starting five in women's college basketball history. The championship game that year shattered ratings for ESPN and at the time was the highest rated college basketball game to air on the network, men's or women's.|$|E
5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test {{in front of}} his home <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests; his teammates felt that their captain had been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E

In January 2014, Batista returned to WWE after having left in May 2010, and promptly won the 2014 Royal Rumble match for a slot in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Batista's win and Daniel Bryan's lack {{of participation in the}} Royal Rumble match was heavily booed by the live <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> event. At Elimination Chamber, Randy Orton successfully defended his championship in the Elimination Chamber match to set up Orton versus Batista (who still received a negative fan reaction at Elimination Chamber when he defeated Alberto Del Rio) for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Daniel Bryan also participated in the Elimination Chamber match, but was the last wrestler eliminated due to interference by Director of Operations Kane, who was affiliated with the Authority.|$|E
5|$|At the 1999 Women's World Cup in the United States, the German {{team also}} failed to qualify directly, but managed to beat the Ukraine in a {{qualifying}} play-off. Germany started their World Cup campaign by drawing with Italy and winning 6–0 over Mexico. In the last group game, Germany drew 3–3 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently {{had to face the}} hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President Bill Clinton, the <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Jack Kent Cooke Stadium was the biggest the German team had ever played in front of. Despite leading twice, they lost 2–3 to the eventual World Cup winners.|$|E
5|$|Despite his severe manner Stevenson was {{extremely}} sociable, {{and he was}} often the centre of a lively <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bar of the Garrick Club, {{of which he was}} a member. His home on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views, but the area had been known by that name for many years before his arrival. Following his retirement Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders, and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail. Among the programmes he took part in was Granada Television's six-part series The Bounds of Freedom, broadcast in 1979.|$|E

5|$|From 1925, Bayern {{shared the}} Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich. Until World War II, the stadium {{was owned by}} 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as Sechz'ger ("Sixties") Stadium. It was {{destroyed}} during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season. In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, {{the vast majority of}} the stadium was given over to terracing. Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Bain first played {{competitive}} {{ice hockey}} when he answered a classified ad {{placed in a}} newspaper by the Winnipeg Victorias, who were looking for new players. Though he played with a broken stick held together by wire, Bain made the team only five minutes into the tryout. Bain quickly became a star centre and leader for the Victorias. This was proven during a February 14, 1896 game against the Montreal Victorias for the Stanley Cup, the trophy for the national hockey championship in Canada. It was a 2–0 victory for Winnipeg that gave them the Cup. This victory {{marked the first time}} a team outside of Quebec had won the trophy. The team was greeted by a huge <b>crowd</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Pacific Railway station when their train, decorated with hockey sticks and the Union Jack, returned to Winnipeg. They were led to a feast in their honour in a parade of open sleighs, where fans gathered to celebrate the championship.|$|E
5|$|John Hutchinson {{currently}} {{holds the}} team record for number of total games played with 268 matches in all competitions.

As of 2014, Central Coast's all-time highest goalscorers in all competitions is Matt Simon with 45 goals, one more than Adam Kwasnik. Daniel McBreen has scored the third most goals for the club with 29. Central Coast's highest attendance at its home stadium, Central Coast Stadium, is 19,238 against Newcastle Jets in their round 19 match of the 2007–08 season.
