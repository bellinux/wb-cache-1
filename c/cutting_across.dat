Bridges were broken down, roads blocked by deep <b>cuttings</b> <b>across</b> them, convoys attacked, small French posts at Tordesillas, Fuentelapena, and Valparaiso captured--the French {{soldiers}} being disarmed, and then taken under an escort to within ten miles of Salamanca. Toro was entered suddenly, and a garrison of three hundred men taken by surprise, and forced to lay down their arms. The powder, bullocks, and waggons with their stores were sent, by circuitous routes, to the bridge across the Douro at Miranda, and then up to their stronghold.|$|R

5|$|Cultivation is {{intensive}}. The valley {{areas have}} fertile and rich soil. There is intensive cultivation on terraced hill slopes, but irrigation facilities are deficient. The Siwalik Range which forms the southern {{foothills of the}} Himalayas, slopes down into a boulder bed called 'bhadhar'.

It has rich forests, <b>cutting</b> <b>across</b> it are innumerable streams which swell into raging torrents during the monsoon.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several {{other types of}} tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands <b>cutting</b> <b>across</b> cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down {{only a few hundred}} meters into the crust. Many have probably been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture. Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by Voyager 2 and seen at a much higher resolution by Cassini. These linear grooves can be seen <b>cutting</b> <b>across</b> other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they are among the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.|$|E

At an intersection right on the state line, SR 161 begins to the west, and Oregon Route 39 continues northwest towards Klamath Falls.|$|E
40|$|Lace {{is liable}} to stretch as it is passed through the feed mechanism, in which a vision system is engaged to detect the changes of the motif and find the <b>cutting</b> path (river) <b>across</b> the lace pattern. The vision system has to work with many {{different}} lace patterns, sizes and tolerate misalignment, stretch and other distortions. A Fuuy Reasoning Rule-based technique is employed in order to overcome the problems of flexibility. Several experiments have been canied out using lace patterns of varying complexity. All <b>cutting</b> paths <b>across</b> the patterns were successfully found. Experimental results indicate that this method can correctly detect the river path in different lace patterns. I...|$|R

Cortés left Tenochtitlan on 12 October 1524 with 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, artillery, munitions and other supplies. Cortés marched into Maya territory in Tabasco; the army crossed the Usumacinta River near Tenosique and crossed into the Chontal Maya province of Acalan, where he recruited 600 Chontal Maya carriers. Cortés and his army left Acalan on 5 March 1525.|$|E
5|$|In the Kingdom of Mysore, the Veerashaiva {{literary}} {{school was}} {{challenged by the}} growing influence of the Srivaishnava intelligentsia in the Wodeyar court. The Srivaishnava writers (followers of a sect of Vaishnavism) of Kannada literature were also in competition with Telugu and Sanskrit writers, their predominance continuing into the English colonial rule over the princely state of Mysore. Meanwhile, the radical writings of 16th-century poet Ratnakaravarni had made way for {{a new kind of}} poetry heralded by those who were not poets in the traditional courtly sense, rather itinerant poets who travelled across the Kannada-speaking region, <b>cutting</b> <b>across</b> court and monastery, writing poems (in the tripadi metre) and influencing the lives of people with their humanistic values which overcame the social barriers of caste and religion. Sarvajna (often compared to Telugu poet Vemana), Sisunala Sherif, Mupina Sadakshari, Navalingayogi and Kadakolada Madivalappa are the best-known among them. These maverick poets heralded yet another epoch of unconventional literature in Kannada language, free of courtly conservatism and established literary tastes.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Nebi Samuel has officially been {{identified}} by the British as beginning on 17 November and finishing on 24 November 1917. But until 21 November infantry from the 75th Division was still continuing its advance towards Bireh. On that day, as the infantry division turned north east <b>cutting</b> <b>across</b> {{the front of the}} 52nd (Lowland) Division, their progress was blocked at Biddu by Ottoman forces entrenched on the height of Nebi Samuel, dominating Jerusalem and its defences. This hill, the traditional site of the tomb of the Prophet Samuel, was taken late in the evening by the 234th Brigade, 75th Division, after fierce fighting. The 52nd (Lowland) Division had taken the more difficult line, while the 75th Division was directed to the south western approaches. Several counterattacks by Ottoman forces during the following days failed. In close fighting, Ottoman soldiers strongly counterattacked, reaching the gates of the mosque before Gurkha infantry fought them off. Fevzi's Seventh Army had fought Allenby's two infantry divisions to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Tripura can be characterised by {{high rate of}} poverty, low capital formation, {{inadequate}} infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood. However agriculture and allied activities to Gross State Domestic Production (GSDP) is only 23%, this is primarily because of low capital base in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resources for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought consistence progress in {{quality of life and}} income of people <b>cutting</b> <b>across</b> all sections of society. The state government through its Tripura Industrial Policy and Tripura Industrial Incentives Scheme, 2012, has offered heavy subsidies in capital investment and transport, preferences in government procurement, waivers in tender processes and fees, yet the impact has been not much significant beyond a few industries being set up in the Bodhjungnagar Industrial Growth Center.|$|E
5|$|The highway turns westward along Wirtz Road {{and past}} the {{southern}} terminus of county road F-97 {{in the northern part}} of Gladwin County. Near a crossing with the Cedar River, M-18 turns north along Bard Road and then west again along Renas Road. The highway returns to its northerly course when it turns to run along Clarwin Road, which runs along the Clare–Gladwin county line. The roadway angles to the northwest briefly, <b>cutting</b> <b>across</b> the extreme northeast corner of Clare County as the highway crosses into Roscommon County. Through the southern portion of the county, the road runs through the Roscommon forest management unit of the Au Sable State Forest as it approaches Prudenville.
