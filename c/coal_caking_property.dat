30|$|Stockpiling of coal {{for long}} time causes the coal getting exposed to various {{oxidative}} conditions known as weathering of coal. The exposure of coal to that condition leads to oxidation of coal that {{might result in}} deterioration of coal’s gross calorific value (GCV), in modified coal behavior during grinding and combustion and finally in large amount of ash generation. As a result weathering of coal {{is a matter of}} great importance for the power plants. Certain work has been reported in literature on weathering of coal. Crelling et al. (1979) reported the effect of weathering on metallurgical <b>coal</b> where <b>caking</b> <b>properties</b> declined. Xia and Yang (2014) studied the changes in surface properties of anthracite coal before and after the weathering process and also inside and outside the weathering process. They observed that, C–C and C–H groups on the surface of anthracite coal was decreased after weathering process while the content of C–O, C=O and O=C–O groups were increased. Wagner 2008, studied the combustion behavior of weathered coal and reported that combustion performance varied between samples taken from within the same stockpile at different depths, and also between samples with different particle sizes, chemical and petrographic compositions, between weathered state and the original coals. Therefore, it can be stated that, weathering of coal largely affects the coal properties by changing the surface properties, chemical bonding between C, H, O and other elements present in coal that largely affects the coal properties. In the only major published work on Indian coal, Banerjee et al. (2000) reported coal-quality deterioration in a coal stockpile of a utility. In their study, they showed that significant amount of GCV was lost during storage. They also reported that, due to weathering, coal loose its cohesion and disintegrates into progressively smaller pieces, which may be washed away.|$|R
40|$|Self-heating or even {{spontaneous}} combustion of stockpiled coal, {{which is likely}} to outbreak under favourable circumstances during its transport, process, and storage, is a long-standing thermal dynamic hazard. This hazard is harmful in diverse aspects: causing loss of <b>coal</b> resource and <b>caking</b> <b>property,</b> raising safety concerns upon occurrence of open fire, and giving off noxious/greenhouse effect gases. Due to the complexity of involved physical process (e. g. heat and mass transport) and chemical process (e. g. coal oxidation), formulating an analytical solution to the problem with or even without a transient approach would be a daunting task and the problem is thus more often addressed numerically. So far many numerical models to self-heating of coal have been developed and to summarise these erratic findings, this work critically reviewed theses numerical solutions since the last four decades. Mechanism of self-heating on coal mass and low temperature coal oxidation especially kinetic modelling of coal oxidation is firstly investigated to clarify the involved physical and chemical processes. On basis of the mechanistic understanding, theoretical derivations and progressive advances on governing equations like energy, mass, and momentum conservation are reviewed and compiled in details. Through parametric studies or sensitivity check these models produced fruitful but slightly inconsistent findings. Therefore to provide industry more unbiased and comprehensive guides, the present work examined the influences of various contributors including wind flow, stockpile dimensions, coal particle size, moisture content, and packing porosity on the self-heating behaviour of stockpiled coal. Last not the least, major challenges and perspectives this subject may have are briefly discussed...|$|R

Likewise, the Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample had the highest fixed carbon content which would translate into more carbon for coke formation[15]. The crucible number of 3.0 for the Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample shows that it can agglomerate on heating to an extent for coking.

40|$|During {{the current}} quarter, pilot-scale testing with the {{modified}} air nozzle {{version of the}} PC burner was completed with PRB coal at the Riley Power Inc. (RPI) test facility. A total of 8 different burner configurations were tested utilizing various burner air nozzle arrangements {{in place of the}} burner air channels. It was found that with the arrangements tested, a stable flame could not be maintained at coal feed rates above 100 lb/h. While it is felt that the air nozzle approach can ultimately be used effectively, in the interest of holding to the current project schedule it was decided to proceed with the balance of the project using the air channel design. The pilot-scale PC burner was therefore restored to the air-channel configuration and benchmark testing with PRB coal to confirmed previous operating results. A series of tests was then conducted with PRB and West Virginia <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> to evaluate modifications to the gas combustor configuration and operation for improved performance with <b>caking</b> <b>coal.</b> Continuous operation was achieved with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> up to 50 lb/h vs. the full load target of 150 lb/h. Impingement and deposition of partially devolatilized coal occurred at various points within the combustor when the <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> feed was increased above 50 lb/h. The 100 MMBtu/h commercial-scale prototype design was continued with coal burner design input from both RPI and VTI. Based on typical burner installation layout considerations, it was decided that the preheat combustor should be oriented horizontally on the axial centerline of the coal burner. Accordingly, the pilot gas combustor was changed to this orientation so that the pilot results with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> will be directly applicable to the preferred 100 MMBtu design. Testing with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> in the horizontal pilot combustor achieved feed rates up to 126 lb/h, although some deposition and LOI issues remain. Several promising approaches to further improve operation with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> were identified. NOx results with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> are promising, with NOx as low as 150 ppmv at exit oxygen levels of 4 % and higher. The 100 MMBtu/h commercial-scale prototype design is nearing completion.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} for the project during the quarter was {{shakedown}} testing of the large-scale coal preheater prototype in the CBTF with non-caking PRB coal. Additional pilot-scale tests were conducted in the PSCF in support of developing a preheating system design suitable for use with <b>caking</b> <b>coals.</b> Thirty-two additional pilot tests were conducted during the quarter with <b>caking</b> <b>coal.</b> These tests further evaluated {{the use of the}} air-bleed and indirect air-cooled liner designs to reduce or eliminate combustor plugging with <b>caking</b> <b>coal.</b> The air-bleed configurations tested used air injection holes perpendicular to the liner's longitudinal axis with the number, size and air flow though the air-bleed holes varied to determine the effect on combustor plugging. The indirect cooling configurations tested included a stainless steel liner with spiral fins in the annular space between the liner and the combustor wall, and a silicon carbide liner without fins. Continuous pilot operation was maintained for up to 30 minutes at a coal feed rate of 50 lb/h with the air-bleed liner. The best result achieved was for the stainless steel indirect air-cooled liner with 20 minutes of continuous operation at 126 lb/h of coal followed by an additional 20 minutes at 150 lb/h. The NOx results from these continue to indicate that even greater NOx reduction is possible with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> than with the PRB coal tested.

40|$|The {{presence}} of sulphur in coal possesses important environmetal problems in its usage. The sulphur dioxide (S 02) emissions produced during coal combustion {{account for a}} significant proportion of the total global output of anthropogenic SO 2. The extent of sulphur separation depends on several variables such as the form of sulphur in coal, intimacy of contact between minerals and the products of devolatilization. The total sulphur in coal varies in the range of 0. 2 - 11 wt %, although in most cases it is beetwen 1 and 3 wt %. Sulphur occurs in a variety of both inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic sulphur is found mainly as iron pyrite, marcasite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopirite and as sulphates (rarely exceeds w = 0, 1 %). Organic sulphur is found in aromatic rings and aliphatic functionalities usually as mercaptans, aliphatic and aryl sulfides, disulfides and thiophenes. Organic and pyritic sulphur quantities depend on coal rank. Higher rank coals tend to have a high proportion of labile sulphur. All the organic sulphur is bivalent and it is spread throughout the organic coal matrix. Sulphur occurs in all the macerals and most minerals. Vitrinite contains the major part of organic sulphur and metals. Elemental sulphur is produced during coal weathering. The depolymerization methods as pyrolysis and hydrogenation are very drastic methods wich change the structure of the coal and the sulphur groups. In the case of pyrolysis, high levels of desulphurization, in chars and additional production of liquid hydrocarbon can be achieved. Thiophenes and sulphides were the major sulphur components of tars from coal pyrolysis. Hyrdogen sulphide and the lower mercaptans and sulphides were found in the volatile matters. Hydrogen sulphide and thiophenes are practically the only sulphur products of coal hydrogenation. H 2 S is produced in char hydrodesulphurization. A number of options are available for reducing sulphur emissions including the utilisation of coals with low sulphur concentrations (typically < 1 wt %), the removal of cleaning prior to utilisation. The methods for the removal of sulphur from coal can be divided into: physical, chemical and microbiological. The mineral sulphur components can be removed or reduced by commercial methods of coal washing, flotation and agglomeration. A number of chemical desulphurization for the removal of, both, pyritic and organic sulphur have been advocated. The chemical desulphurization methods however, have two major drawbacks. Namely, they are often expensive and they destroy the <b>caking</b> <b>properties</b> of <b>coal.</b> Certain microorganisms have been used to consume or convert selectively most of the pyritic sulphur {{as well as some of}} the organic sulphur in coal.

40|$|<b>Caking</b> <b>coal</b> is {{difficult}} to be gasified in fluidized bed (FB) because of the inevitable particle agglomeration caused by caking in the dense bottom of the bed. Literature {{studies have shown that}} pre-oxidizing the coal can suppress its caking propensity, while quick dispersion of coal particles, for example, by gas jetting in the plastic stage of heating is critical to such a suppression of the caking agglomeration. Thus, the so-called jetting pre-oxidation fluidized bed gasification (JPFBG) is devised in this study to gasify <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> in FB. Coal particles usually below 5 mm are blown into the space above the bottom dense bed surface by an O- 2 -containing gas jet to disperse and meanwhile to pre-oxidize the particles. The resulting char particles with little, even without caking propensity fall into the dense bottom of the bed to allow their gasification there. After validating the destruction of caking agglomeration by jetting pre-oxidation in a laboratory FB apparatus, a 150 kg/h pilot JPFBG plant was built and the <b>coal</b> with the <b>caking</b> index of about 20 was successfully gasified in this plant using normal air and O- 2 -enriched air. The heating vale of the produced gas varied in 2. 9 - 5. 0 MJ/m(N) (3) and decreased with raising the oxygen percentage applied to the jet feeding. Raising the oxygen percentage for the jet caused more of the produced gas formed in the bottom dense bed of char gasification to burn off in the jetting zone. The optimal proportion of the oxygen applied to the jet feeding or coal pre-oxidation was found to be about 37 % against the total oxygen supply. Enriching the 02 content in the gasification agent to about 30 vol. % enhanced greatly the gasification rate of the tested low-reactivity coal in JPFB. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermal cracking of volatiles was investigated in a tubular reactor in tandem with the fluidised-bed/fixed-bed reactor where the nascent volatiles were generated in situ from the pyrolysis of coal. Our experimental results indicate that, in addition to coal rank, the petrographic composition and/or geographic origin of the coal are important factors influencing the formation of HCN and NH 3 during pyrolysis. Among the few Chinese and Australian coals studied, the inertinite-rich Chinese coals tend to give more NH 3 during pyrolysis than the Australian coals of similar carbon contents. It is believed that the structure of inertinites of less <b>caking</b> <b>properties</b> favours the formation of H radicals in the pyrolysing solid over a ‘correct’ temperature range to overlap with the activation and subsequent hydrogenation of the N-containing ring systems for the formation of NH 3 in the solid.

40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{plasticity}} of coal during pyrolysis is {{of significant}} importance, since {{it affects the}} reactivity, porosity, particle size and {{the density of the}} char and thus also the behaviour of the char during further utilisation processes. The main focus {{of this study was to}} characterize the chemical and physical changes which the thermally treated coal undergoes, in order to better understand the pyrolysis process of caking and non-caking South African coals. The pyrolysis behaviour of three South African <b>coals</b> with different <b>caking</b> indices was investigated. The coal samples included; (1) Highveld (TWD), a medium rank C coal with a free swelling index (FSI) of 0, (2) Grootegeluk (GG), also a medium rank C coal, with a FSI of 6. 5, and (3) Tshikondeni (TSH), a medium rank B coal with the highest FSI of 9. The three coal samples were classified as vitrinite-rich coals consisting of mainly aliphatic structures. Thermogravimetric experiments were used to determine the different temperatures relating to specific percentages of mass loss using set conditions. The pyrolysis process was stopped at various percentages of mass loss (thus at various stages of the reactions) to characterize the chemical structural changes that occurred at the specific mass loss percentages. The results obtained from characterization analyses indicated that the three coals differ in chemical composition and thus were expected to behave differently during pyrolysis. The coal samples consist of different amounts of macerals and minerals according to X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses. The Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFT) results indicated that some of the functional groups within the coal samples evolved with the increase in temperature. The highly <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> (TSH) exhibited the highest aromaticity and ring condensation. The surface areas were determined by CO 2 adsorption and an increase in surface area was observed with an increase in temperature. The surface area of the GG and TSH coal-derived char samples decreased at some stage, which is an indication of thermoplastic behaviour and subsequent swelling of the coal samples.

This study confirmed the adverse effect of weathering on the <b>caking</b> <b>properties</b> of <b>coals</b> such as fluidity, dilation and swelling behaviours as well as coal melting temperature range. The study illustrated that effect of short term and long term weathering on the modification of rheological properties of coals is significantly different. Unlike general idea like low rank coals normally get greater impact of weathering than high rank coals, {{this study suggests that}} long term weathering may have a strong impact on the modification of rheological properties of relatively higher rank coals with high ash yield. With increasing weathering time, inert textures and small pores increased, while calorific values of all cokes marginally decreased. The coke cold strength from weathered coals decreased as well as their size. However the rank of coals and fluidity loss didn't show clear relationship with this quality drop. On the other hand, the coke size decreased in accordance with the fluidity drop. The fluidity of coal blending remained stable for a while, and then it dropped seriously according to weathering time with narrowed fluid ranges of individual coals. Coke strength of coal blending in both cold and hot state decreased significantly and continuously. Therefore, this study suggests that even though the individual coals may not be affected seriously by weathering, the weathering effects can be severe when different rank coals are use together...|$|R

Based on a famous coal model FG/DVC created by Solomon et al. (1992), we analyzed these data or information gotten from QMS, GC, and 13 C NMR systematically, and then presented {{the relationships between the}} substituents on aromatic rings in coal and the evolution products, as well as the potential mechanisms of gas formation during coal pyrolysis.|$|R
40|$|The least {{expensive}} way to produce gas from coal is by low Btu gasification, a {{process by which}} coal is converted to carbon monoxide and hydrogen by reacting it with air and steam. Low Btu gas, which is used near its point of production, eliminates {{the high costs of}} oxygen and methanation required to produce gas that can be transmitted over long distance. Standard low Btu fixed bed gasifiers have historically been plagued by three constraints; namely, the production of messy tars and oils, the inability to utilize <b>caking</b> <b>coals,</b> and the inability to accept coal fines.

40|$|Researchers have {{demonstrated}} that the hygroscopicity of bulk potash exposed to 	humid air causes the adsorption and condensation of water vapour on potash particle surfaces. The accumulated water forms liquid bridges near contact points between potash particles and dissolves salt impurities on potash particle surfaces until the brine bridges are saturated. When the ambient air becomes dry, the accumulated water evaporates, the dissolved salt recrystallizes, and the crystalline bridges form between potash particles. A sufficient number of crystal bridges per unit volume in bulk potash can cause strong potash cakes. This can lead to costly handling problems. It {{is the purpose of}} this research to investigate the effects of external compressive load and ambient air humidity on <b>caking</b> <b>properties</b> and cake strengths of bulk potash during long duration storage. The research is separated into the four parts: discrete element modelling, potash sample preparation and fracture testing, simulation of water vapour diffusion into test cells, and cake strength correlations. The discrete element method (DEM) was used to predict the tensile force distributions on particles and cake strength of a compressed potash ring specimen when the specimen is fractured in the centrifuge. In the planar DEM model, a tensile force concentrating on an inter-particle contact region can be transformed to the local-averaged tensile stress distributed on the equivalent cross section corresponding to the particle. The local-averaged tensile stresses are consistent with the microscopic tensile stresses in the solid continuum model when the Poisson’s ratio is small. The DEM model indicates that the tangential tensile forces are the main factor causing fractures of potash specimens while the radial tensile forces are insignificant. The uniform tangential tensile forces imply that the fracture interface of a specimen should be parallel to the radial direction of the specimen (i. e. normal to the main tensile force). During sample preparation, potash ring specimens were subjected to four nominal sample depths (0, 4, 8, and 16 m) and three values of moisture adsorption humidity (69, 75, and 84 %). Two values of moisture desorption humidity (52 and 11 %) were used to make crystal bridges in the potash samples. Test sample preparation periods from weeks to months were used. Springs were used to generate the external compressive loads equivalent to the nominal sample depths. The <b>caking</b> <b>properties</b> of potash specimens, such as mass, height, porosity, and moisture content, were measured during sample preparation. After caking, specimens were ruptured in the centrifuge to test their fracture rotary speeds. Data for fracture rotary speed were input into the DEM model to compute cake strengths of potash specimens. The data analyses showed that the higher external equivalent loads during sample preparation cause the bigger variations of sample height and porosity. The moisture content of potash specimens was determined by the moisture adsorption and desorption humidity. When the moisture adsorption humidity was not higher than 75 %, cake strengths of potash samples were enhanced with an increase of the external equivalent load. If the moisture adsorption humidity reached 84 %, the external load hardly affected the potash cake strength. A numerical model of water vapour diffusion with the boundary condition of free mass convection was developed for two sub-groups of uncompressed potash specimens corresponding to those with the complete and reduced top sample surfaces exposed to the ambient air. The numerical model predicted the spatial distributions of local relative humidity and moisture content in transient states inside a potash specimen and the variations of free mass convection coefficient and macroscopic sample moisture content over time. The predictions of sample moisture content for the two sample sub-groups were in agreement with the corresponding experimental data. The big free mass convection coefficient during moisture desorption meant a high mass transfer rate near the potash sample top surface. The almost uniform spatial distributions on the maximum and residual local moisture contents in a potash specimen showed that the variations of local moisture content were similar inside the specimen during moisture adsorption and desorption. It was also expected that the crystal bridges forming in the specimen after caking were analogous. A correlation was developed to predict cake strengths of potash specimens by using the ambient air humidity for moisture adsorption and desorption and the external equivalent load. The upper limitations of relative humidity and external load were 75 % and 16 m. The correlation showed that cake strength of potash specimens was enhanced with an increase of moisture adsorption relative humidity conditions and external load, and with a decrease in moisture desorption relative humidity conditions...|$|R

As on today, among the various commercially established coke making technologies, non-recovery/heat recovery ovens are established to be the sustainable ones. It has been investigated that the north eastern region (NER) of India has a number of coke ovens which are non recovery types and without heat recovery systems. Huge volume of coke oven gases released from these ovens which have high calorific values and contribute to major environmental degradation. In this paper, an attempt has been made for maximum utilization of these coke oven gases (COG) for heat recovery.

40|$|In {{the quest}} for a search of a {{suitable}} coal deposit of metallurgical importance, the qualities of three Nigerian coal samples, Lafia-Obi, Doho and Lamja, were assessed for possible utilization in metallurgical coke production. Several parameters that determine coking quality, such as moisture content, ash, volatile matter, free swelling index, sulphur content, Gray-King coke test, dilatation and plasticity (fluidity), were investigated. Lafia-Obi has the lowest moisture and volatile matter and the highest fixed carbon content. Its ash and sulphur contents are greater than that required by a coking but washing prior to use is expected to improve it. The volatile matter places Lafia-Obi in the medium-volatile bituminous rank, while Lamja and Doho are of medium-volatile bituminous rank. The rheological properties show that Lafia-Obi is the only <b>caking</b> <b>coal.</b> This put together single out Lafia-Obi as a potential candidate for coke making.

In this paper, quadrupole mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance are applied to real-time monitoring the formations of volatile products, off-line quantitative determination of the total products from the pyrolysis of a sub-bituminous coal (SC), and the changes of diverse substitents in the SC along with coke foamation, respectively. These measurements are also performed for the pyrolysis of a <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> to contrast SC. The qualitative and quantitative data reveal that, during coal pyrolysis, the functional groups related {{with the formation of}} CO, i.e., ether, carbonyl, and anhydride, can directly generate CO via bond breaking, or take a detour of the formation of other intermediates via condensation and recombination firstly. Moreover, the formations of CO 2 and CH 4 are related to the direct removal of -COO- and -CH 3, respectively.|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} efficiency and high-quality results in industrial processes usually rely {{on how well}} product characteristics are understood {{as well as how}} well processes are controlled in order to obtain specific results. Therefore, in a billion-dollar industry as is the case of the instant coffee market, understanding the properties of the compounds produced using different techniques is a very important tool to enhance performance and delivery of high-quality coffee powders. The aim of the present study is to provide a framework of some powder properties such as particle size, shape, diameter, circularity, convexity, aspect ratio and surface energy among others, which govern powder behavior. To do so, five coffee samples were analyzed using Malvern Morphologi 3 G ID for particle characterization and QuantaTM 3 D FEG scanning electron microscope to visualize surfaces in great detail. Wettability and flowability of all samples were studied under different humidity conditions. Afterwards, in an effort to enhance flowability, flow-enhancing agents were added to the samples that showed the worst flowability. The results revealed that while all the samples presented different particle size distributions, they showed similar circularity, convexity and aspect ratio values. Measurements indicated passable flowability for most of the powders. Even so, they revealed poor flowability and high values of angle of repose for the sample with finer particles as well as no significant improvement when adding flow-enhancing agents. Additional tests showed that at high relative humidity in the environment (RH= 60 %) wettability increased. This effect was observed as indicated by low contact angle values, thereby contributing to powder agglomeration and <b>caking.</b> The <b>properties</b> regarded throughout this study provide detailed information and allow the comprehension of the parameters that need to be modified in order to enhance performance and stability in the food industry...|$|R
