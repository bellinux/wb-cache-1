50|$|The Roadtown {{idea has}} a utopian aspect. The {{drawings}} and text almost read like science fiction. Chambless acquired rights {{to some of}} the patents needed to implement the concept. In particular, Thomas A. Edison contributed his <b>cement</b> <b>pouring</b> patents needed to construct the buildings. Chambless proselytized for his Roadtown concept for decades until {{the end of his life}} in 1936. Hastings had by then moved on to other things.|$|E
5000|$|In 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of WWI, Scott {{appeared}} in New York City. Scott worked in various construction camps, where he picked up on-the-job engineering experience, and in 1918 was working in a <b>cement</b> <b>pouring</b> gang at Muscle Shoals. Following this, Scott established himself in Greenwich Village as [...] "a kind of Bohemian engineer". Scott also ran a small business called Duron Chemical Company which made paint and floor polish at Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Scott's job was to deliver his goods and show his customers how to use the floor polishing material.|$|E
50|$|A. Byron Chase was {{the first}} pastor of the church, and served until 1942 when he left to become a {{chaplain}} in the U.S. Army. Both the Parsonage and the Sanctuary were built by {{the men of the}} church. The men made the cement blocks which formed the church by <b>pouring</b> <b>cement</b> into hand-made forms. A basement provided space for classes as well as social activities at the time.|$|R
40|$|Subject of the diploma thesis was {{to resolve}} {{influence}} of {{grey cast iron}} on penetration into cement sand. Methodology of trial was designed and its attestation was implemented in experimental and running conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was {{to make certain that}} the river met the Massachusetts water quality {{standards}} of a Class A river. We are concerned that the Abbott Run remains a Class A river because it {{is the source of the}} drinking water for Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Abbott Run is located in the western section of North Attleboro within the Blackstone River Watershed. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the west, Plainville to the north and Attleboro to the south. The watershed section in North Attleboro is approximately four square miles. Land use is predominately single-family, residential except for the Interstate 295 right of way segment. Major transportation facilities include Interstate 295 and Route 120. The section of the river that runs through North Attleboro passes through Chemawa Golf Course, an 18 -hole course, on its way to Rhode Island. The river was studied at two different sites about a half-mile from each other on October 25 - 26, 2006. The first site was just off Cushman Road, downstream from the second site at Shady Pines. We went to Shady Pine because they were doing construction on Hunts Bridge were the class went to on Oct. 2005. The river passed through the golf course between the two sites. To make sure that Abbott Run met the Massachusetts Class A water standards, the river was tested for pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, temperature, and fecal colonies. We also collected benthic macro-invertebrates at both sites. Our class kept a record of the amount of precipitation in the week preceding our study of the river, and depth, and flow was determined. The values for nearly everything that we tested were similar at both sites and met the Class A standards. The only exception was the pH at Shady Pines, Site B. It was above the standard and we felt this was due to the <b>cement</b> <b>pouring</b> that occurred in the month before our study. Site A and Site B had about the same number of net-spinning caddisflies. This is a significant change for site B when compared to the 2006 data. This type of caddisfly can tolerate a higher level of organic pollution. Also of note, the Family Biotic Index (FBI) values increased at both sites. Site A went from excellent to very good water quality and Site B is still in the excellent range. Written by Steven Kummer Environmental Science, 200...|$|E
60|$|Festing {{followed}} him along the descending track, which presently ended at a ledge of rock sixty or seventy {{feet above the}} river. Wire ropes spanned {{the gap between the}} banks, and near the middle a rock islet broke the surface of the savage flood. Here men were <b>pouring</b> <b>cement</b> into holes among the foundations of an iron frame, while suspended trollies clanged across the wires. On the other bank was a small flat where shacks of log and bark stood among dripping tents. The roar of the river filled the gorge, but its deep note was broken by the rattle of hammers, clash of shovels, and clang of thrown-down rails.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{ministries}} of {{the organization}} include correspondence and online courses in Spanish, a night school with both English and Spanish course offerings, Christian video courses, and a Spanish AM and FM radio ministry. In addition, RGBI has its own art department and print shop which produce devotional, informational, and promotional literature. The campus bookstore provides Bibles, books, CDs, DVDs and supplies {{not only for the}} students but also for the public. Each year more than one hundred retirees known as [...] "Winter Volunteers" [...] descend on campus to provide much appreciated help throughout the winter months. For the past thirty years these energetic people, mostly from the North, have constructed most of the campus buildings and done a myriad of other tasks from sewing, quilting, and cooking to <b>pouring</b> <b>cement,</b> repairing roofs and building a wall around the campus. About six miles from the Edinburg campus, Bibleville, a Christian conference center, attracts another five hundred [...] "Winter Texans" [...] each winter. There the residents, who live in their own homes or RVs, enjoy Bible conferences every other week and music concerts each Saturday as well as Sunday services. They become involved in a variety of outreach ministries including volunteering at the Bible Institute, as tutors in local schools, or at area churches.|$|R
50|$|When {{face powder}} (instead of cash) {{arrives in the}} mail, an irate Craig gives Ted and Tommy 24 hours to return his money. The boys attempt to contact {{everyone}} on the mailing list until they finally locate the recipient, Carol (Cathy Downs), who informs them that she {{spent most of the}} money and has only about $2,000 left. The three of them go to the race track hoping to gamble the remaining cash to win enough money to pay back Craig. They encounter a strange fellow named Julius Caesar (Leon Errol), who claims to have never lost a bet. They refuse to follow his betting advice, only to see his horse win, and they are left with nothing. Ted, abandoning hope, decides that they would be safest in jail, so they run up a huge tab in a nightclub. Just as they are about to be arrested, Craig and his henchmen show up and demand the money. After Ted and Tommy reply {{that they do not have}} it, the thugs take them to a nearby construction warehouse and begin <b>pouring</b> <b>cement</b> in which to dump them. Meanwhile, Carol and Caesar have been sitting at the bar, betting large amounts on fish at the club's aquarium. Caesar loses and hands her the $50,000 that she has just won, to her amazement. It turns out Caesar is actually an eccentric millionaire named J.C. MacBride, and they all arrive at the warehouse in time to pay back Craig.|$|R
5000|$|The play {{starts in}} modern times at the European Cultural Centre of Delphi {{presenting}} it as a modern construction site where Labourers are preparing to pour cement on the foundations of a new theatre at the Centre called the [...] "Phrynichos Theatre". At first, concrete is being poured to create the orchestra of the new theatre but the chorus gets trapped in the cement. This {{is used as a}} device by Harrison to examine the interaction between the audience and the play. As the Labourers carry on their duties <b>pouring</b> <b>cement,</b> the Voice of the Silo delivers the only known extant ancient Greek fragment phrase from Phrynichos' play Alcestis referring to Herakles's epic struggle as he is wearing down the body of Death by wrestling with him: [...] at which time a statue of Herakles starts rising from the construction site. Subsequently, Labourer 4 gets possessed by the Spirit of Heracles and goes into a [...] "manic percussion solo" [...] while Labourer 1 begins posing as Hercules arranging his shirt to look like Hercules's lionskin and placing his shovel in a similar manner to how Hercules is traditionally depicted as holding his club. Eventually Hercules's madness transfers to Labourer 1 who then destroys Hercules's statue attacking it with his shovel. He then opens-up two cement bags, as red and white tape starts flowing out of the opened bags, symbolising the guts of the victims. Subsequently, Labourer 1 opens-up two smaller cement bags, symbolising the killing of Hercules's two children, and then withdraws assuming the pose of Hercules.|$|R
