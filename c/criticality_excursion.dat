25|$|A nuclear {{meltdown}} is {{a severe}} nuclear reactor accident {{that results in}} reactor core damage from overheating. It {{has been defined as}} the accidental melting of the core of a nuclear reactor, and refers to the core's either complete or partial collapse. A core melt accident occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear fuel element exceeds its melting point. This differs from a fuel element failure, which is not caused by high temperatures. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion</b> in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits. Alternately, in a reactor plant such as the RBMK-1000, an external fire may endanger the core, leading to a meltdown.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{computer}} simulation of hypothetical <b>criticality</b> <b>excursions</b> involving significant quantities of fissionable materials, especially in fissile aqueous system. The need arises due to the requirements for the emergency planning of facilities where the fissionable materials are handled, processed, or stored; and the regulatory requirements associated with facility operation or conversion. It is proposed here that a data base of fission yeilds for critical experiments and known accidents (both aqueous and solid) should be generated by using existing or new computer codes. The success in compiling this data base would provide useful source-terms for <b>criticality</b> <b>excursions,</b> realistic estimates of emergency-response boundary, as well as a replacement for the ``rule-of-thumb`` or ``bounding`` method. 10 refs...|$|R
50|$|On 3 February 1954 and 12 February 1957, {{accidental}} <b>criticality</b> <b>excursions</b> occurred causing {{damage to}} the device, but only insignificant exposures to personnel.

50|$|The Vinča Nuclear Institute {{was officially}} {{established}} on 21 January 1948 by the Serbian top physicist Pavle Savić as the Institute for Physics, though {{construction of the}} site began in 1947. On 15 October 1958, the institute {{was the site of}} a fatal <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion</b> in its heavy water-moderated research reactor. One researcher was killed and four others injured. The institute operated two research reactors. The larger 6.5 MW reactor achieved criticality in 1959 and was shut down in 1984. Another very low power reactor achieved criticality in 1958 and as of 2002 was operational. The institute was named the Institute for Physical Sciences 'Boris Kidrič' in 1953 and has its present name since 1 January 1992.|$|E
50|$|On 24 July 1964, a fatal {{criticality}} accident {{occurred at the}} Wood River Junction nuclear facility. This facility was designed to recover highly enriched uranium in scrap material from fuel element production. Technician Robert Peabody was working with a tank containing radioactive uranium-235 in a sodium carbonate solution, which was being agitated by a stirrer. Intending to add a bottle of trichloroethylene to remove organics, he erroneously added a bottle of uranium solution to the tank, producing a <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion</b> (uncontrolled chain reaction) accompanied by {{a flash of light}} and the splashing of about 20% of the tank's contents (about 10 L out of 40 to 50 L, including the bottle contents) out of the tank.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of a {{criticality}} accident scenario occuring {{in a simple}} fast metal system using the coupled neutronic-hydrodynamic method is demonstrated by examining the last Godiva-I {{criticality accident}}. The basis tools and information for creating a coupled neutronic-hydrodynamic code are presented.

50|$|The K-431, {{completed}} around 1965 as unit K-31, was a Project 675 (Echo II) class submarine {{with two}} pressurized water reactors, each 70 MWt capacity and using 20% enriched uranium as fuel. On 10 August 1985, the submarine was being refuelled at the Chazhma Bay naval facility near Vladivostok. The submarine had been refuelled and the reactor tank lid was being replaced. The lid was laid incorrectly {{and had to}} be lifted again with the control rods attached. A beam was supposed to prevent the lid from being lifted too far, but this beam was positioned incorrectly, and the lid with control rods was lifted up too far. At 10:55 AM the starboard reactor became prompt critical, resulting in a <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion</b> of about 5&middot;1018 fissions and a thermal/steam explosion. The explosion expelled the new load of fuel, destroyed the machine enclosures, ruptured the submarine's pressure hull and aft bulkhead, and partially destroyed the fuelling shack, with the shack's roof falling 70 metres away in the water. A fire followed, which was extinguished after 4 hours, after which assessment of the radioactive contamination began. Most of the radioactive debris fell within 50-100 metres of the submarine, but a cloud of radioactive gas and particulates blew to the northwest across a 6 km stretch of the Dunay Peninsula, missing the town of Shkotovo-22, 1.5 km from the dock. The contaminated forest area was later surveyed as 2 km2 in a swath 3.5 km long and 200 to 650 metres wide. Initial estimates of the radioactive release were about 74 PBq (2 MCi) of noble gases and 185 PBq (5 MCi) of other fission products, but most of this was short-lived isotopes; the estimated release inventory one hour after the accident was about 37 TBq (1000 Ci) of non-noble fission products. In part because the reactor did not contain spent fuel, the fraction of biologically active isotopes was far smaller than {{in the case of the}} Chernobyl disaster.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to evaluate {{the consequences of a}} postulated accident to onsite security personnel stationed near the facility during operations of the Godiva IV critical assembly and to identify controls needed to protect these personnel in case of an extreme <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion</b> equivalent to the design-basis accident (DBA). This paper presents the methodology and results of the source-term calculations, building ventilation rates, air concentrations, and consequence calculations that were performed using a multidisciplinary approach with several phenomenology models.

40|$|In {{addition}} {{to the ability to}} solve the static transport equation, the authors have also incorporated time dependence into the parallel S{sub N} code PARTISN. Using a semi-implicit scheme, PARTISN is capable of performing time-dependent calculations for both fissioning and pure source driven problems. They have applied this to various types of problems such as shielding and prompt fission experiments. This paper describes the form of the time-dependent equations implemented, their solution strategies in PARTISN including iteration acceleration, and the strategies used for time-step control. Results are presented for a iron-water shielding calculation and a <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion</b> in a uranium solution configuration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} criticality {{analyses for}} spent nuclear fuels in a geologic repository. The analyses investigated criticality potential, <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion</b> consequences, and the probability frequency for nuclear criticality. Key findings include: expected number of fissions per excursion range from 10 {sup 17 } to 10 {sup 20 }, repeated rate of criticalities range from 3 to 30 per year, and the probability frequency for criticality initiators (based on rough-order-of-magnitude calculations) is 7 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 7 }. Overall {{results indicate that}} criticality consequences are a minor contribution to the biological hazards caused by the disposal of spent nuclear material...|$|E

SKI Project Number 99006 Summary SKB’s concept for underground disposal of spent fuel includes requirements on the repository’s barrier system that are aimed at ensuring long-term safety. This report is concerned with the requirement on disposal canister design that there is no risk of criticality in the event of water entering the canister after disposal. In particular, recent changes in disposal canister design have led to the need to re-evaluate the possibility of a <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion</b> occurring after disposal. This report presents the results of criticality calculations that have been performed based on current disposal canister designs, and presents the findings of reviews of previous criticality studies that were undertaken as part of th...|$|E
40|$|The United States Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management's (DOE/EM's) National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program (NSNFP), {{through a}} {{collaboration}} between Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is conducting a systematic Nuclear Dynamics Consequence Analysis (NDCA) of the disposal of SNFs in an underground geologic repository sited in unsaturated tuff. This analysis is intended to provide interim guidance to the DOE {{for the management of}} the SNF while they prepare for final compliance evaluation. This report presents results from a Nuclear Dynamics Consequence Analysis (NDCA) that examined the potential consequences and risks of criticality during the long-term disposal of spent nuclear fuel owned by DOE-EM. This analysis investigated the potential of post-closure criticality, the consequences of a <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion,</b> and the probability frequency for post-closure criticality. The results of the NDCA are intended to provide the DOE-EM with a technical basis for measuring risk which can be used for screening arguments to eliminate post-closure criticality FEPs (features, events and processes) from consideration in the compliance assessment because of either low probability or low consequences. This report is composed of an executive summary (Volume 1), the methodology and results of the NDCA (Volume 2), and the applicable appendices (Volume 3) ...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear {{aspect of}} the CBRN* threat is often divided amongst {{radiological}} substances posing no criticality risk, {{often referred to as}} 'dirty bomb' scenarios, and fissile threats. The latter have the theoretical potential for <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion,</b> resulting in elevated neutron fluxes in addition to the γ-ray component that is common to dirty bombs. Even in isolation of the highly-unlikely criticality scenario, fissile substances often exhibit radiation fields comprising a significant neutron component which can require considerably different counterterrorism measures and clean-up methodologies. The contrast between these threats can indicate important differences in the relative sophistication of the perpetrators and their organizations. Consequently, the detection and discrimination of nuclear perils in terms of mixed-field content is an important assay in combating terrorist threats. In this paper we report on the design and implementation of a fast digitizer and embedded-processor for onthe- fly signal processing of events from organic liquid scintillators. A digital technique, known as Pulse Gradient Analysis (PGA), has been developed at Lancaster University for the digital discrimination of neutrons and γ rays. PGA has been deployed on bespoke hardware and demonstrates remarkable improvement over analogue methods for the assay of mixed fields and the real-time discrimination of neutrons and γ rays. In this regard the technology constitutes an attractive and affordable means for the discrimination of the radiation fields arising from fissile threats and those from dirty bombs. Data are presented demonstrating this capability with sealed radioactive sources...|$|E
40|$|In a fire {{involving}} fissile material, {{the mixture}} of the fissile material ash with fire fighting water {{may lead to a}} <b>criticality</b> <b>excursion</b> if there are nearby sumps that permit a critical geometry. The severity of the resulting energy release and pressure pulse is dependent on {{the rate at which the}} mixing occurs. To calculate these excursions, a non-equilibrium equation of state for the water ash mixture or slurry is needed that accounts for the thermal non-equilibrium that occurs due to finite heat transfer rates. We are developing the slurry EOS as well as a lumped neutronic and hydrodynamic model to serve as a testing ground for the non-equilibrium EOS before its incorporation into more sophisticated neutronic-hydrodynamics codes. Though the model lacks spatial dependence, it provides estimates of energy release and pressure pulses for various mixture assembly rates. We are also developing a non-equilibrium EOS for critical solution systems in which the fissile material is dissolved in water, which accounts for chemical non-equilibrium due to finite mass transfer rates. In contrast to previously published solution EOS, our solution EOS specifically accounts for mass diffusion of dissolved radiolytic gas to bubble nucleation sites. This EOS was developed to check our overall modeling against published solution excursion experiments and to compare solution excursions with slurry excursions initiated under the same conditions. Preliminary results indicate a good match between solution EOS calculations and experiments involving premixed 60 - 80 g U/l solutions for both low rate and high rate reactivity insertions. Comparison between slurry and solution calculations for the same composition show comparable energy release and pressure peaks for both low and high rate reactivity insertions with the slurry releasing less energy but generating more pressure than the solution for the amount of energy released. Calculations more appropriate to actual fire fighting scenarios will also be presented...|$|E
