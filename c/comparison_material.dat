5000|$|Tagg is {{probably}} {{best known for his}} work in the field of music analysis. Using mainly pieces of popular music as analysis objects, he stresses the importance of non-notatable parameters of expression and of vernacular perception in understanding [...] "how music communicates what to whom with what effect" [...] in today's world. He has adapted Charles Seeger's notion of the museme to demonstrate how combinations of such units are used to create both syncritic (intensional) structures inside the extended present, and diatactical (extensional) ones over time. These combinatory structures can be understood, he argues, {{with the help of an}} overall sign typology consisting of anaphones (sonic, tactile, kinetic, social), style flags (style determinants, genre synecdoches, etc.) and episodic markers. The semiotic theory is basically Peircean but it draws also on Umberto Eco's theories of connotation. The actual analysis method is based on both metamusical information about the analysis object (reception tests, opinions, ethnographic observation, etc.) to arrive at paramusical fields of connotation (PMFCs), and on intertextuality. The latter involves identifying sounds observed in the analysis object with sounds in other music - interobjective <b>comparison</b> <b>material</b> (IOCM) - and in connecting that IOCM with its own PMFCs. Tagg argues that this sort of music semiotics is musogenic, not logogenic, i.e. suited to expression in music rather than in words, and that the combination of intersubjective and interobjective procedures can, inside a given cultural context, provide reliable insights into the mediation of meaning through music.|$|E

40|$|A micromechanical {{model is}} {{proposed}} for multiphase metals {{consisting of a}} ductile matrix reinforced by hard, equiaxed inclusions. The model belongs to a class of incremental mean-field theories of the first order and is suitable for general, non-monotonic loading paths. This paper specifically addresses {{the definition of the}} effective, instantaneous shear modulus of the isotropic <b>comparison</b> <b>materials</b> which intervene in the solution of the linearized, homogenisation problem. Time integration of the composite response is calculated using a Newton-Raphson scheme and a consistent tangent operator is derived. Predictions of the phase stresses developed under various loading modes and {{for a wide range of}} volume fractions of inclusions are assessed by a comparison with finite element simulations of periodic unit cells. It is argued that the latter predictions depend dramatically on the topological arrangement of the inclusions. Considering a cubic ordering of inclusions, it is possible to reproduce FE predictions with the mean-field model on the condition that the <b>comparison</b> <b>materials</b> are stiffer than the real phases during the first few percent of plastic strain. The mean-field model provides an accurate prediction of the average stress developed within individual phases. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work {{deals with}} {{comparing}} {{the prediction of}} the development of rolling textures by using a homogenization method that is based on a homogeneous reference material. The proposed ho-mogenization scheme, assuming constant stress polarisations in each phase, has in a natural way the potential to model the transition between Taylor- and Sachs-type textures. Therefore, the stiffness of the homogeneous reference material has to be varied between infinitely stiff and infinitely compliant. In the present study, texture evolution during rolling is simulated, showing that the application of dif-ferent <b>comparison</b> <b>materials</b> in the homogenization scheme leads to the development of different main texture characteristics (Cube, Cu, Bs, Goss) in the orientation distribution function. For efficiently car-rying out the rolling simulations using the proposed method, the measured texture information of the bulk aluminum sample is representatively reduced by using a partitioning technique of the orientation space...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Ideology Project at the University of Oslo (Department of Psychology) is {{presently}} developing an archival method for measuring ideological changes in society through statistical {{changes in the}} frequency of specific words and phrases in written mass media language. At present, in psychological research, the method of choice for answering research questions on a society-wide scale is population surveys. This new method, using internet archives on newspapers going back several decades, constitutes a potential new way of studying ideology, hopefully supplementing the information gained through surveys. Research on media archives has many advantages over existing research methods, being unobtrusive, retrospective in nature, and relatively inexpensive. The Ideology Project has used statistical changes in the use of words and phrases to reveal and describe ideological changes in Norway, England, USA, Ghana and Turkey. Aim: This thesis has three main purposes. The first is to present the method as it has been used in recent articles. The second and primary purpose is to present various improvements on the method as an instrument for measuring ideological change through changes in language use. The third is to perform preliminary validation against results from the longitudinal population survey Norsk Monitor. Presented improvements: Automated data acquisition, increasing speed by a factor of more than 1000. Statistical data on the development of 10 000 “neutral” words has been compiled as <b>comparison</b> <b>material.</b> Baseline adjustment has been implemented on the basis of mean changes in the development patterns of the compiled <b>comparison</b> <b>material.</b> An empirical approach to testing if conceptual word clusters are used together in natural language is presented. Methods for determining representativity of development trends for words and clusters of words from one newspaper have been improved. Trend analysis for words and clusters of words has been systematized and improved. Preliminary validation: The presented comparison between value indexes from the longitudinal population survey Norsk Monitor and development patterns for selected clusters of words show strikingly similar development, indicating an exiting area of future research...|$|E

40|$|Substance use {{disorders}} {{represent a}} consistent {{threat to our}} health care and financial resources. Although mental health professionals are likely to encounter individuals diagnosed with substance use disorders, {{they are less likely}} to receive formal graduate training in the area. Furthermore, 12 -step groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous are popular, evidence-based recovery options, yet little is known about perceptions of such groups among clinical trainees. In addition, quantitative evaluations of substance use training modules have seldom been conducted, including a notable lack of methodologically rigorous approaches. To fill these gaps in the literature, the current study examined the efficacy of a brief computer-mediated training intervention, or e-training, designed to increase future clinicians 2 ̆ 7 knowledge and intentions to engage in 12 -step-related professional activities (e. g., making an appropriate referral to a 12 -step group). Secondary outcomes were beliefs and attitudes about 12 -step groups. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to receive the e-training, a brief audio/visual presentation reviewing 12 -step recovery philosophy but focusing on academic 12 -step literature. Fifty-three participants were randomly assigned to read <b>comparison</b> <b>materials,</b> which were comprised of online readings geared toward professionals, made available by Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Outcomes were assessed at pretest, posttest (i. e., immediately following exposure to intervention or <b>comparison</b> <b>materials),</b> and 4 -week follow-up periods. Results of random effects regression analyses showed that the e-training led to significantly greater increases in 12 -step recovery knowledge than comparison readings, and that these gains were maintained through follow-up. An intervention effect on intentions to perform 12 -step-related professional activities also emerged by follow-up. Exploratory moderation analyses revealed that the intentions effect was more pronounced for women and for trainees who had never attended a 12 -step meeting. Secondarily, the e-training led to significantly greater increases in 12 -step-positive beliefs and attitudes, though the beliefs effect attenuated by follow-up. Taken together, these data suggest that future clinicians may benefit from a brief e-training about 12 -step recovery. More broadly, the study supports the notion that e-trainings are easily disseminated and may help address current limitations in graduate-level substance use clinical training...|$|R
