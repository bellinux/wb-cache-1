Using data gathered in the last 10 years by the International Satellite <b>Cloud</b> <b>Climatology</b> Project using new satellite-based instruments that can measure cloud cover from space, they set out to investigate the claims outlined in this book.

40|$|A {{comparison}} is made between a new operational NOAA AVHRR global cloud amount product to those from established satellite-derived <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies.</b> The new operational NOAA AVHRR cloud amount is derived using the cloud detection scheme in the extended Clouds from AVHRR (CLAVR-x) system. The cloud mask within CLAVR-x is {{a replacement for}} the CLAVR- 1 cloud mask. Previous analysis of the CLAVR- 1 <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies</b> reveals that its utility for climate studies is reduced by poor high latitude performance and inability to include data from the morning orbiting satellites. This study demonstrates, through comparison with established satellite-derived <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies,</b> the ability of CLAVR-x to overcome the two main shortcomings of the CLAVR- 1 derived <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies.</b> While systematic differences remain in the cloud amounts from CLAVR-x and other climatologies, no evidence is seen that these differences represent {{a failure of the}} CLAVR-x cloud detection scheme. Comparisons for July 1995 and January 1996 indicate that for most latitude zones, CLAVR-x produces less cloud than ISCCP and UW/HIRS. Comparisons to MODIS for April 1 - 8, 2003 also reveal that CLAVR-x tends to produce less cloud. Compariso...|$|R

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{cycle of}} low stratiform clouds is studied {{using data from}} surface-based <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies.</b> The impact of low clouds on the radiation budget is illustrated by comparison of data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment with the <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies.</b> Ten regions of active stratocumulus convection are identified. These regions fall into four categories: subtropical marine, midlatitude marine, Arctic stratus, and Chinese stratus. With {{the exception of the}} Chinese region, all the regions with high amounts of stratus clouds are over the oceans. In all regions except the Arctic, the season of maximum stratus corresponds to the season of greatest lower-troposphere static stability. Interannual variations in stratus cloud amount also are related to changes in static stability. A linear analysis indicates that a 6 percent increase in stratus fractional area coverage is associated with each 1 C increase in static stability. Over midlatitude oceans, sky-obscuring fog is a large component of the summertime stratus amount. The amount of fog appears to be related to warm advection across sharp gradients of SST...|$|R

It infers clouds' global distribution and properties, along with their diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations.

The International Satellite <b>Cloud</b> <b>Climatology</b> Project (ISCCP) method begins with the detection of clouds and corrections for ozone, Rayleigh scatter, and seasonal variations in irradiance to produce surface reflectances.

5000|$|... 1983-1994 global {{low cloud}} {{formation}} {{data from the}} International Satellite <b>Cloud</b> <b>Climatology</b> Project (ISCCP) was highly correlated with galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux; subsequent to this period, the correlation broke down. Changes of 3-4% in cloudiness and concurrent changes in cloud top temperatures correlated to the 11 and 22-year solar (sunspot) cycles, with increased GCR levels during [...] "antiparallel" [...] cycles. Global average cloud cover change was measured at 1.5-2%. Several GCR and cloud cover studies found positive correlation at latitudes greater than 50° and negative correlation at lower latitudes. However, not all scientists accept this correlation as statistically significant, and some who do attribute it to other solar variability (e.g. UV or total irradiance variations) rather than directly to GCR changes. Difficulties in interpreting such correlations include {{the fact that many}} aspects of solar variability change at similar times, and some climate systems have delayed responses.|$|E

40|$|The {{representation}} of clouds in Global Climate Models (GCMs) remains {{a major source}} of uncertainty in climate change simulations. <b>Cloud</b> <b>climatologies</b> have been widely used to either evaluate climate model cloud fields or examine, in combination with other data sets, climate-scale relationships between cloud properties and dynamical or microphysical parameters. Major <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies</b> have been based either on satellite observations of cloud properties or on surface observers views of cloud type and amount. Such data sets provide either the top-down view of column-integrated cloud properties (satellites) or the bottom-up view of the cloud field morphology (surface observers). Both satellite-based and surface <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies</b> have been successfully used to examine cloud properties, to support process studies, and to evaluate climate and weather models. However, they also present certain limitations, since the satellite cloud types are defined using radiative cloud boundaries and surface observations are based on cloud boundaries visible to human observers. As a result, these data sets do not resolve the vertical distribution of cloud layers, an issue that is important in calculating both the radiative and the hydrologic effects of the cloud field. Ground-based cloud radar observations, on the other hand, resolve with good accuracy the vertical distribution of cloud layers and could be used to produce <b>cloud</b> type <b>climatologies</b> with vertical layering information. However, these observations provide point measurements only and it is not immediately clear to what extent they are representative of larger regimes. There are different methods that can be applied to minimize this problem and to produce <b>cloud</b> layering <b>climatologies</b> useful for both cloud process and model evaluation studies. If a radar system is run continuously over a number of years, it eventually samples a large number of dynamical and microphysical regimes. If additional data sets are used to put the cloud layering information into the context of large-scale dynamical regimes, such information can be used to study interactions among cloud vertical distributions and dynamical and microphysical processes and to evaluate the ability of models to simulate those interactions. The U. S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program has established several Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) that provide continuous, long-term observations of clouds and radiation. ARM, with its overall goal of improving the treatment of radiation and clouds in climate models has provided unique observing systems for accelerating progress on the {{representation of}} cloud processes. In this project, {{six and a half years}} (January 1998 to June 2004) of cloud observations collected at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) Oklahoma ACRF were used to produce a cloud-type climatology. The <b>climatology</b> provides <b>cloud</b> amounts for seven different cloud types as well as information on the detailed structure of multi-layer cloud occurrences. Furthermore, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model output was used to define the dynamic regimes present during the observations of the cloud conditions by the vertically pointing radars at the SGP ACRF. The cloud-type climatology and the ECMWF SGP data set were then analyzed to examine and map dynamical conditions that favor the creation of single-layer versus multi-layer cloud structures as well as dynamical conditions that favor the occurrence of drizzle in continental stratus clouds. In addition, output from the ECMWF weather model forecasts was analyzed with the objective to compare model and radar derived cloud type statistics, in order to identify the major model deficiencies in cloud vertical distribution and map their seasonal variations. The project included two primary goals. The first was to create a <b>cloud</b> type <b>climatology</b> over the Southern Great Planes site that will show how cloud vertical distribution varies with dynamic and thermodynamic regime and how these variations would affect cloud climate feedbacks. The second was to compare this <b>climatology</b> to <b>clouds</b> derived by a numerical model in order to identify the major model deficiencies in cloud vertical distribution and map their seasonal variations...|$|R

Cloud analyses {{in the form of}} monthly <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies</b> are extracted from NOAA. AVHRR data which are compared to corresponding cloud forecast information from the HIRLAM and ECMWF numerical weather prediction models. The satellite-based cloud information is extracted for a summer month in 1994 and a winter month in 1995 by use of the SMHI cloud classification model SCANDIA. Cloud analyses are conducted for an area covering a substantial part of northern Europe. Deficiencies in forecasted cloud amounts are found for both models, especially the underestimation of cloudiness for short forecast lengths with the HIRLAM model. Forecast improvements using the HIRLAM model are indicated when introducing a cloud initialisation technique using cloud fields from initial 6 -hour forecasts (first-guess fields). Future systematic validations using this technique are, however, needed to make firm conclusions on the general model behaviour. SCANDIA-derived cloud information is proposed as a valuable complement to other datasets used for cloud forecast validation (e. g., the SSM/I- and ISCCP data sets) ...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate models}} {{have shown a}} strong {{sensitivity}} to conditions in the arctic and they indicate that the arctic climate is particularly sensitive to perturbation. Only very limited arctic <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies</b> are available. Quantitative information on the optical properties of arctic clouds and hazes is needed to verify radiation codes in climate models. In addition, accurate synoptic information on cloud altitudes and cloud phase are needed in verification of forecast models. The University of Wisconsin High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) provides vertical profiles of optical depth, backscatter cross section, depolarization and backscatter phase function. All HSRL measurements are absolutely calibrated by reference to molecular scattering which is measured at each point in the lidar profile (Grund and Eloranta 1991, Pirronen and Eloranta 1994). This enables the HSRL to measure backscatter cross section and optical depth without a prior assump-tions about the scattering properties of the atmosphere. The depolarization observations allow robust discrimination between ice and water clouds. Rigorous error estimates can be computed for all measurements.

40|$|International audienceClouds {{represent}} the largest uncertainty in future climate projections. As a result, unbiased long-term vertically-resolved cloud observations must be collected and analyzed {{in order to}} produce regional <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies.</b> In the present study, we use model outputs to evaluate the impact of conditional temporal sampling and instrumental effects on the 2 -year statistics of frequency of cloud occurrence and cloud fraction. We then quantify the radiative significance of the ice clouds undetected by cloud radars. We find that in order to evaluate the representation of all types of clouds in operational models both a cloud radar and a lidar must be used. The cloud radar alone can do a reasonable job at describing cloud properties up to 8 – 9 km, however the lidar is mandatory to detect most of the high-altitude clouds above 9 km. The sampling should be regular but not necessarily continuous, and should not be driven by meteorological conditions. This result applies to all sites having a lidar without a radome. It is finally suggested that a cloud radar of around ? 60 dBZ sensitivity at 1 km range would be required to detect almost all radiatively-significant ice clouds...|$|R

However, while MODIS reflectance data are often interrupted by clouds, terrestrial processes like photosynthesis are continuous, so MODIS photosynthesis data {{must be able to}} cope with cloudy pixels. We developed cloud-correction algorithms to improve retrievals of the MODIS photosynthesis product (PSNnet) corresponding to clear sky conditions by proposing four alternative cloud-correction algorithms, which have different levels of complexity and correct errors associated with cloudy-pixel surface reflectance. The cloud-correction algorithms were applied at four weather stations, two fluxtower sites and the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of the USA to test a range of <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies.</b> Application of the cloud-correction algorithms increased the magnitude of both daily and annual MODIS PSNnet results. Our results indicate that the proposed cloud correction methods improve the current MODIS PSNnet product considerably at both site and regional scales and weekly to annual time steps for areas subjected to frequent cloud cover.

Unlike Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) -type comparisons it does not mix potential errors in the cloud amount {{with those in the}} radiation code embedded in the model. Long term <b>cloud</b> <b>climatologies</b> were used to compare global cloud amounts and regional seasonal cycles. The AGCM successfully reproduced the signatures of the warm pool and North Pacific seasonal cycle cloudiness but failed in the low stratus region off the coast of South America, a known problem for AGCMs. The data sets also reproduced the anomaly signature associated with El Nino in the warm pool region, but the model amounts were lower. Global results had a similar success rate, with the model generally producing lower total cloud compared to the satellite and in situ measurements. To compare cloud vertical distributions the cloud height may need to be validated using the corresponding radiation fields. Unfortunately there were also some large discrepancies between the two observed cloud data sets. While tremendously improved over the last decade the character of the observed cloud data sets, must be substantially enhanced before they will be useful in validating AGCMs by any but the crudest levels of comparison...|$|R

The time of its maximum concurs with the time of the sea ice extent minimum (early summer–late autumn) and vice versa (late spring). The main reason for the discrepancies among observations is the difference in the cloud-detection algorithms, especially when clouds are detected over the ice/snow surface (during the whole year) or over the regions with the presence of strong low-tropospheric temperature inversions (mostly in winter).

For the temperature thresholding methods, using the commonly used threshold of 260 K, the difference in liquid water phase ratio is 30 - 35 % during the summer and autumn months, decreasing to ~ 20 % during the remainder of the period investigated. Further, brightness temperature difference 10. 8 - 12. 0 μm (BTD 10. 8 - 12. 0) has a poor quality in deriving <b>cloud</b> phase <b>climatology.</b> Thirdly, the difference in seasonal liquid water phase ratio between CTT and BT 10. 8 is only a few percent, which raises the suggestion that correction for cloud emissivity does not play a large role at the threshold of 260 K.
