Here I present some preliminary results relating recorded peak ground accelerations in the near-source field to <b>current</b> <b>attenuation</b> models.

The one-sided configuration afforded direct, real-time observation of the tissue response to bare (unmodified, smooth surface) sensors and sensors coated with porous poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA). Microvessel length density and red blood cell flux (blood perfusion) within 1 mm of the sensors were measured bi-weekly over 2 weeks. When non-functional sensors were fully implanted beneath the windows, the porous coated sensors had two-fold more vasculature and significantly higher blood per-fusion than bare sensors on Day 14. When functional sen-sors were implanted percutaneously, as in clinical use, no differences in baseline current, neovascularization, or tis-sue perfusion were observed between bare and porous coated sensors. However, percutaneously implanted bare sensors had two-fold more vascularity than fully implanted bare sensors by Day 14, indicating the other fac-tors, such as micromotion, might be stimulating angiogen-esis.

Engineers usually face significant design challenges such as size, cost and weight while working with these components.

40|$|Near-source ground-motion records {{affected}} by directivity may show unusual {{features in the}} signal resulting in low-frequency cycle pulses in the velocity time history, especially in the fault-normal component. Such an effect causes the seismic demand for structures to deviate from that of so-called ordinary records. This circumstance may be particularly hazardous for structural engineering applications {{if it is not}} properly accounted for. In fact, <b>current</b> <b>attenuation</b> laws are not able to capture such effects well, if at all, and therefore current probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) is not able to predict this peculiar spectral shape.

40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed that {{thermionic}} current flow through a plasma {{is limited by}} a "space-charge limited" (SCL) cathode sheath that consumes the hot cathode's negative bias and accelerates upstream ions into the cathode. Here, we formulate a fundamentally different current-limited mode. In the "inverse" mode, the sheath potentials at both electrodes are positive, trapping the ions in the plasma. The bias is consumed by the anode sheath. There is no potential gradient in the neutral plasma region from resistivity or presheath. The inverse cathode sheath potential phi_inv pulls some thermoelectrons back to the cathode, attenuating the current by a factor exp(qe*phi_inv/Temit). Thermoelectrons entering the zero-field region that undergo collisions may also {{be sent back to}} the cathode. In planar geometry, the plasma density linearly decreases across the gap and the <b>current</b> <b>attenuation</b> factor from collisions is emfp/(Lp+emfp) in terms of the mean free path and plasma length.

Inverse operating modes should therefore be present or possible in many plasma devices that rely on hot cathodes. Evidence from past experiments is discussed.
