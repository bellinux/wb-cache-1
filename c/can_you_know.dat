It was first {{recorded}} by American pop singer Katy Perry, recording the track as a demo for her debut album One of the Boys, though it was never fully executed for the album and was passed to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals, soon after a leaked version of Katy Perry on the Internet. Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine: [...] "My vocals are actually on Breakout. I thought, 'Yes, I'm singing on a Miley single'." [...] Cyrus said naming the album Breakout {{was influenced by the}} song as it was [...] "one of [...] favorite songs" [...] on the album; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups: [...] "Moms, dads, sisters, brothers <b>can,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> relate to it. And it's basically because you just {{want to go out and}} have fun with your friends and sometimes, you know, go out dancing and let loose once in a while." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Robert Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in 1968, Alice again {{supported}} her friend Richard Nixon, {{just as she had}} done in his 1960 campaign against John F. Kennedy.

[...] This infuriated Alice, who spat curse words at her television screen as she watched him compare his early departure from the White House (in the face of probable impeachment and possible criminal prosecution) to her idealistic young father's loss of his wife and mother on the same day due to illness. Nixon, however, called her [...] "the most interesting [...] " [...] and said, [...] "No one, no matter how famous, could ever outshine her." ...|$|E
