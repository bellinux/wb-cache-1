We construct an equilibrium model with imperfect insurance of labor earnings shocks. The variance of shocks varies across industries.

We find that permanent shocks are highly priced, whereas temporary shocks are not. Two additional results arise.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{yield curve}} {{models for the}} United Kingdom, where the underlying determinants have a macroeconomic interpretation. The first factor is an unobserved inflation target, the second factor is annual inflation, and the third factor is a ‘Taylor rule residual’, which, among other things, captures {{the effects of the}} output gap and monetary policy surprises in the Taylor rule. We find that the long end of the yield curve is primarily driven by changes in the unobserved inflation target. At shorter maturities, yield curve movements reflect short-run inflation and the Taylor rule residual. For holding periods of one month, our preferred model implies that agents require <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>risks</b> associated with cyclical and inflation shocks but do not require compensation for shocks to the inflation target. For holding periods beyond one month, agents require compensation for all three sources of risks. Time series of risk premia on long forward rates from the preferred yield curve model have declined since the 1970 s, which is consistent with perceptions of declining macroeconomic uncertainty or perhaps more efficient macroeconomic stabilisation policies. Model-implied risk premia at short maturities match up reasonably well with survey-based risk premia, which indicates that the model could be useful for the purpose of extracting market-based interest rate expectations. ...|$|E

Today’s standards are similar to those of the former American ‘sweat of the brow’ doctrine.  But, unlike foreign legal systems that set comparatively low standards of protectability, the Russian judiciary has not yet evolved mechanisms of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>risks</b> of monopolization of public domain content.  First of all, there is no practice of granting exclusive rights to a work that is similar to an earlier work but has been created independently. Secondly, the practice of refusing protection to non-unique, standard, generally known, and generally available content is dying out. Thirdly, there is currently a trend for giving a large scope of protection to works of low authorship.  As a result, exclusive rights are granted to standard or generally accessible content – content that must belong to the public domain – which puts unjustified restrictions on the creative activities of other authors. Moreover, it makes their legal status unpredictable as it establishes a basis for unintended copyright violations being penalized. This amounts to a classical case of overprotection. </p...|$|E

The measurement of the volatility risk premium rests on a simple model according to which variance forecasts are generated under the objective probability measure. Results show that especially between September 2001 and mid- 2003 dollar implieds were embodying a large - negative - <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> volatility <b>risk,</b> a component which was smaller in absolute terms - but not relative {{to the level of the}} respective implied volatilities - for the other two currencies. While the negative <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> volatility <b>risk</b> is in line with previous studies focusing on other asset classes, we also document that it exhibits a term structure, more evident for dollar and euro rates than for pound rates. The volatility risk premium is strongly changing through time but much less than implied volatilities. Estimates of risk aversion based on the physical skewness and kurtosis of {{interest rate}} changes suggest that (minus) the volatility risk premium can almost directly be read as risk aversion, as its proportionality with such risk aversion measure is about 0. 8. Also, <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> volatility <b>risk</b> is positively related to expected volatility, although the relation is not completely linear.

First, the magnitude of the risk premia is measured by contrasting the three-month Euribor with its secured counterpart, namely the three-month Eurepo.

To measure whether the effectiveness of monetary policy has increased during the financial crisis compared with the past, the parameters of the employed state-space model are allowed to vary with time. The frequency decompositions, along with the estimation of the model, are performed with a low-, band-pass filter, which also corrects for the performance degradation due to model simplifications and misspecifications and data measurement errors...|$|R

40|$|During the 15 {{years prior}} to the global {{financial}} crisis the volume of securitized assets transacted in the US grew substantially, reflecting a change {{in the nature of the}} financial intermediation process. Together with increased securitization of assets, financial entities, who participate more heavily in the asset-backed security (ABS) market and hold a diversified portfolio of assets, have also become more relevant. As a result, the volume of securitization, although traditionally associated with credit markets, influences the outcomes of other asset markets. We investigate the link between securitization and asset prices and show that increases in the growth rate of the volume of ABS issuance lead to a decline in both the bond and equity premia. We then build a model of bank portfolio choice where the creation of synthetic securities may occur. The pooling and tranching of credit assets relaxes both the funding and the risk constraints financial entities face allowing them to increase balance sheet holdings. This increase in asset demand depresses the <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> undertaking <b>risk</b> in the economy, confirming our empirical results.
