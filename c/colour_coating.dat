40|$|International audienceThis study {{characterizes the}} {{influence}} of automotive coating composition on the adhesion of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA). Automotive topcoats are generally constituted of a basecoat/clearcoat system, but a layer of lacquer is used for white <b>colour</b> <b>coating.</b> X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) are used to study the topcoat surface composition. Siloxane additives are detected on the clearcoat surface {{but not on the}} lacquer surface. Peel tests show that the adhesion of PSA to the lacquer is higher than to the clearcoat. Moreover, study of clearcoat formulated without additives confirms that the siloxane additives are unfavourable to the adhesion of PSA. When the PSA is peeled from a clearcoat, analyses of failure surfaces indicate that the failure seems to propagate within the PSA near the interface. On the contrary, the failure seems to propagate within the bulk of the lacquer during peeling. This difference is explained by XPS analysis of lacquer: the outermost surface is constituted of a layer of oxygenated unidentified compounds, which are detected on the failure surface of PSA. Chemical bonds between these compounds and the lacquer network seem to be weaker than the bonds between these compounds and the PSA. Analyses point out that the ethanol cleaning can remove the additives from the topcoat surface and improve considerably the adhesion to the clearcoat. If the topcoat is cleaned before applying the PSA, the failure propagates deeper within the PSA than if the topcoat is not cleaned...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{thermally}} protected load-carrying structures of reusable launch vehicles capable {{to withstand the}} environment and manoeuvre loads during re-entry needs ground test facilities simulating at least the thermal input and mechanical loads under ambient atmospheric conditions. By this means, the predicted structural behaviour can be confirmed. As a consequence, the DLR-Institute of Structural Mechanics developed the THERMEX test facilities and still improves the test procedures. Within {{the first part of}} the presentation the recent challenging test series on European contributions to the X- 38 re-entry vehicle will be highlighted. Testing the rudder model surface temperatures up to 1175 °C have been achieved by enforcing infrared lamp radiation. A strongly curved panel, the so-called nose skirt, was heated by accommodation of the heater arrays to the geometry of the test article. Because the nose skirt panel was manufactured from C/SiC very small deformations were measured by high-resolution displacement transducers. Within the preceding FESTIP activities cryogenic tank wall panels with an outer high-temperature insulation were tested simultaneously by an outside heating up to 950 °C and an inside cryogenic cooling by liquid nitrogen. Within the second part new developments for forthcoming tests will be illustrated. Such as testing of structures with complicated shapes under combined hot and cryogenic temperature loading will be considered. The concept of modular assemblage of facility components will allow a variety of applications, e. g. ablation exclusively caused by heat irradiation and even brazing of stringers to a titanium panel by fast infrared heating. Another attempt of improvement will be the feasibility to study kinematics of hot structures such as flaps or rudders. Again, the hot gas test facility, part of the THERMEX assembly, will be used to simulate in addition to the thermal loading aerodynamic pressure and flow as well as acoustic excitation. Measurement and data recording will be refined by new amplifiers allowing also the use of type S thermo-couples. For temperature determination even the application of <b>colour</b> <b>coating</b> and infrared camera recording will be studied. The presentation will close with considerations on realisation of successful test procedures. The most important aspect is pre-testing on dummy structures to optimise thermal input and temperature distribution within the tested structure, to adapt the ranges of measurement, and to determine the control parameters of thermal and mechanical loading, especially in the case of kinematics...|$|E

Accessions of same cluster generally have similar seed <b>coat</b> <b>colours</b> with only few exceptions. Some of these exceptions are Gh 2281 and Gh 7185 with dark seed <b>coat</b> <b>colours</b> clustering in the red to brown seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> group while Gh 2284 and Gh 5048 with red seeds clustered with dark <b>colours.</b> Seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> is a frequently used as a morphological trait in classifying crop varieties (Adesoye and Ojobo 2012) and may also be linked with other important traits (Atis et al. 2011). The clusters according to the seed <b>coat</b> <b>colours</b> are; Dark, Cream to White and Brown to Red (Figure  3). The boundaries between the dark seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> cluster {{and the other two}} were very conspicuous. However, the boundary between the white and red seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> clusters was not very clear. Six accessions in the purple outlined circle formed a sub-cluster between the white and red seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> clusters. Even though, the six accessions formed a sub-cluster, each individual was closely linked to its respective major cluster, with the exception of IT 82 E- 18 (Figure  3). In contrast, Asare et al.

40|$|The {{variation}} in the seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> of adzuki beans among varieties, harvest years and growing locations, using a two-dimensional colour mapping technique was investigated. It {{was found that the}} differences of the seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> among varieties contributed to the variation of chroma (C*) values, while the differences of the seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> among harvest years were associated with lightness (L*) values. The L* values for the seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> increased when the temperature during the maturing period of adzuki beans was low, and decreased when the temperature was high. The difference in the seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> among the samples from different growing locations was much larger in the L* values than the C* values for samples of the same variety. The seed <b>coat</b> <b>colours</b> of adzuki beans harvested in Hokkaido and China had significantly different C* values, and were easily discriminated by the colour mapping method. This study showed that the two-dimensional colour mapping was useful for evaluating the seed <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> of adzuki beans, which varies among samples of different varieties, harvest years and growing locations...|$|R

40|$|Objective Qingyu pig, a Chinese {{indigenous}} pig breed, exhibits {{two types}} of <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> phenotypes, including pure black and white with black spotting respectively. Melanocortin receptor 1 (MC 1 R) and agouti signaling protein (ASIP) are two widely reported pivotal genes that significantly affect the regulation of <b>coat</b> <b>colour.</b> The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate whether the polymorphisms of these two genes are associated with <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> and analyze the molecular mechanism of the <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> separation in Qingyu pig. Methods We studied the phenotype segregation and used polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing to investigate the polymorphism of MC 1 R and ASIP in 121 Qingyu pigs, consisting of 115 black and 6 white with black spotted pigs. Results <b>Coat</b> <b>colour</b> of Qingyu pig is associated with the polymorphisms of MC 1 R but not ASIP. We only found 2 haplotypes, EQY and Eqy, based on the 13 observed mutations from MC 1 R gene. Among which, Eqy presented a recessive inheritance mode in black spotted Qingyu pigs. Further analysis revealed a g. 462 – 463 CC insertion that caused a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon, thus changed the first transmembrane domain completely and lost the remaining six transmembrane domains. Altogether, our results strongly support that the variety of Qingyu pig’s <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> is related to MC 1 R. Conclusion Our findings indicated that black <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> in Qingyu pig was dominant to white with black spotted phenotype and MC 1 R gene polymorphism was associated with <b>coat</b> <b>colour</b> separation in Qingyu pig...|$|R
