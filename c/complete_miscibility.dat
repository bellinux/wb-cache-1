40|$|Abstract: Usnic acid, {{a potent}} {{antimicrobial}} and anticancer agent, poorly soluble in water, was complexed to novel antimicrobial polyacrylamides by establishment of strong acidic-base interactions. Thermal and spectroscopic analysis evidenced a molecular dispersion {{of the drug}} in the polymers and a <b>complete</b> drug/polymer <b>miscibility</b> for all the tested compositions. The polymer/drug complexes promptly dissolved in water and possessed a greater antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis than both the free drug and the polymer alone. The best results were obtained with the complex based on the lowest molecular weight polymer and containing a low drug content. Such a complex showed a larger inhibition zone of bacterial growth and a lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with respect to usnic acid alone. This improved killing effect is presumably due to the reduced size of the complexes that allows an efficient cellular uptake of the antimicrobial complexes. The killing effect extent seems to be not significantly dependent on usnic acid content in the samples...|$|R

In this work we use simple molecular models for n-alkanes, perfluoroalkanes and perfluoroalkylalkane diblock molecules to predict, from a molecular perspective, the phase behaviour of selected model mixtures of perfluoroalkylalkanes with n-alkanes and perfluoroalkanes. In particular, we focus our interest on the understanding of the microscopic conditions that control the liquid-liquid separation and the stabilisation of these mixtures. We have obtained the phase behaviour of different kind of mixtures and studied the effect of the molecular weight of n-alkanes and perfluoroalkanes on the type of phase behaviour observed in these mixtures. In addition, we have analyzed the effect of the number of the alkyl and perfluoroalkyl chemical groups in the surfactant molecule on the phase behaviour. As well as the usual vapour-liquid phase separation, liquid-liquid, positive azeotropes, and Bancroft points are found for different mixtures. This rich phase behaviour is a consequence of a delicate balance between the alkyl-alkyl, perfluoroalkyl-perfluoroalkyl, and alkyl-perfluoroalkyl interactions in different molecules. We have used the SAFT-VR microscopic description of chainlike systems to analyse the conditions that the n-alkane + and perfluoroalkane + perfluoroalkyalkane mixtures should posses in order to exhibit <b>complete</b> liquid <b>miscibility...</b>|$|R

40|$|Very-low-density polyethylenes (VLDPEs) {{with short}} branches, formed by {{metallocene}} or Ziegler-Natta catalysts, were blended with low-density polyethylenes (LDPEs) or VLDPEs with long branches. The crystallization and melting behavior of these blends were examined by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). The blends of metallocene-catalyzed VLDPE 1 and LDPEs showed a smooth change in both crystallization and melting peak temperatures, indicating that there was co-crystallization and, hence, partial miscibility at all compositions. However, the blends of VLDPE 1 and long-chain branched VLDPE 2 co-crystallized at 50 % or less VLDPE 2 content, whereas Ziegler-Natta-catalyzed VLDPE 3 -VLDPE 2 blends showed co-crystallization at 50 % or higher VLDPE 2 compositions. It is concluded that either <b>complete</b> or partial <b>miscibility</b> has occurred between the two polyethylenes {{in each of the}} blends with VLDPE 2. Nevertheless, VLDPE 2 did not cause a significant change in the morphology of VLDPE 1, perhaps because of the reduced number of long branches present in VLDPE 2 compared with LDPEs. The molar masses or melt flow indices of the polyethylenes were not significant in controlling the morphology; only the distribution of branches along the chains was important...|$|R
40|$|High-voltage cables are a {{critical}} component of tomorrow’s power grids that seamlessly integrate hydro, wind and solar power. Further improvements in transmission capacity of both high-voltage alternating- and direct-current, HVAC and HVDC, cables are likely reached through improved insulation materials. A number of approaches to improve insulation materials are currently being considered. This thesis explores two concepts for future insulation materials: (i) polymer:metal oxide nanoparticles, and (ii) polymer:polymer blends. To investigate the former, nanocomposites containing Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles dispersed in a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) matrix are considered. The addition of nanoparticles is found to improve the DC insulation properties, i. e. reduces the residual electrical conductivity, but increases the risk for electrical breakdown under AC conditions. This first part of the thesis leads {{to the conclusion that the}} use of nanocomposites can require a trade-off between AC/DC behaviour. In the second part of this thesis polyethylene blends are investigated as an alternative to nanocomposites. The addition of minute amounts of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to LDPE reduces the DC electrical conductivity by one order of magnitude. Moreover, trace amounts of HDPE did not appear to influence the dielectric strength under AC conditions. Besides an improvement in electrical performance polyethylene blends display superior thermo-mechanical properties. Additive-like amounts of HDPE are able to prevent creep above the melting temperature of LDPE, which offers an alternative to crosslinking. It can be anticipated that such thermoplastic insulation instead of commonly used crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) would considerably ease cable manufacture. The thermo-mechanical properties are rationalised with a favourable blend microstructure. In particular, <b>complete</b> melt <b>miscibility</b> is found to give rise to a fine distribution of HDPE lamellae that, through tie chains, maintain a continuous network in molten LDPE. The extent of creep correlates with the molecular weight of HDPE. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that the use of polyethylene blends is a promising avenue, which may lead to insulation materials with improved electrical and mechanical performance...|$|R

50|$|Without {{interactions}} between the compounds {{there would be no}} enthalpy of mixing and the entropy of mixing would be ideal. The ideal entropy of mixing of multiple pure compounds is always positive (the term -T∙ΔS is negative) and ΔG would be negative for all compositions, causing <b>complete</b> <b>miscibility.</b> Therefore, the fact that miscibility gaps are observed can only be explained by interaction. In the case of polymer solutions, polymer-polymer, solvent-solvent and polymer-solvent interactions have to be taken into account. A model for the phenomenological description of polymer phase diagrams was developed by Flory and Huggins (see Flory-Huggins solution theory). The resulting equation for the change of Gibbs energy consists of a term for the entropy of mixing for polymers and an interaction parameter that describes the sum of all interactions.|$|E

Temperature-composition phase diagrams for both NMEA/DMPE and NPEA/DPPE binary systems were established from high sensitivity DSC. The structures of the phases involved were determined by 31 P-NMR spectroscopy. For both systems, <b>complete</b> <b>miscibility</b> in the fluid and gel phases is indicated by DSC and ESR, up to 35 mol % of NMEA in DMPE and 40 mol % of NPEA in DPPE. At higher contents of the NAEs, extensive solid-fluid phase separation and solid-solid immiscibility occur depending on the temperature. Characterization of the structures of the mixtures formed with 31 P-NMR spectroscopy shows that up to 75 mol % of NAE, both DMPE and DPPE form lamellar structures in the gel phase as well as up to at least 65 °C in the fluid phase. ESR spectra of phosphatidylcholine spin labeled at the C- 5 position in the sn- 2 acyl chain present at a probe concentration of 1 mol % exhibit strong spin-spin broadening in the low-temperature region for both systems, suggesting that the acyl chains pack very tightly and exclude the spin label.
