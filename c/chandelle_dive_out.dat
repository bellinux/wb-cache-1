60|$|The coffin <b>dived</b> <b>out</b> of sight, eased {{down by the}} men straddled on the gravetrestles. They {{struggled}} up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{one could}} <b>dive</b> <b>out</b> through the passage {{and sit on}} that ledge of rocks, and fish either inside them or in the sea outside." ...|$|R
5000|$|The strip often employs surreal humor, with bizarre {{recurring}} gags such as [...] "cat-copters" [...] (cats which <b>dive</b> <b>out</b> {{of the sky}} {{and knock}} people unconscious).|$|R
6000|$|... "Do tell Miss Orne, or get the police;" [...] then <b>dived</b> <b>out</b> {{of sight}} again, and lay quaking like an ostrich with its {{head in the}} sand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{fit to be}} seen," [...] muttered Ben, {{glancing at}} his tatters as if he'd like to <b>dive</b> <b>out</b> of sight into the dark coach again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you must}} know," [...] began Jack, [...] "after you had <b>dived</b> <b>out</b> of the cave, {{on the day}} you were taken away from us, we waited very patiently for half-an-hour, not expecting you to return {{before the end of}} that time. Then we began to upbraid you for staying so long when you knew we would be anxious; but when an hour passed we became alarmed, and I {{resolved}} at all hazards to <b>dive</b> <b>out</b> and see what had become of you, although I felt for poor Peterkin, because, as he truly said, `If you never come back, I'm shut up here for life.' However, I promised not to run any risk, and he let me go--which, to say truth, I thought very courageous of him!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Kame's D1A1. Kame later {{reported}} that his machine {{was attacked by}} [...] "a lone Hawk III <b>diving</b> <b>out</b> of the sun" [...] and damaged, with the gunner PO1c Kuroki killed. Kame did however manage to safely return with his damaged airplane to the Kunda airfield in Shanghai.|$|R
60|$|He <b>dived</b> <b>out</b> of {{the galley}} door, or glided rather, with a {{swiftness}} and smoothness of gait {{that struck me}} as being not so much cat-like as oily. In fact, this oiliness, or greasiness, as I was later to learn, {{was probably the most}} salient expression of his personality.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you start}} something, always {{be sure you}} can finish it," [...] admonished Bob Nixon. And then {{he picked up a}} third chunk of snow; but before he could make use of it the Rover twins had <b>dived</b> <b>out</b> of sight around a corner of the school building.|$|R
50|$|Final: 22 August — Each diver {{performed}} five <b>dives</b> <b>out</b> {{of a group}} {{consisting of}} a front dive, a back dive, a reverse dive, an inward dive, a twisting dive and an armstand dive.

6000|$|When the old gentleman {{caught my}} eye, he <b>dived</b> <b>out</b> of sight {{with a loud}} [...] "Hem!" [...] but he was peeping again directly, for there was {{something}} irresistibly attractive about the unconscious lassie opposite; and one could no more help looking at her than at a lovely flower or a playful kitten.|$|R
50|$|Semi-final: 28 August — Each diver {{performed}} four <b>dives</b> <b>out</b> {{of a group}} {{consisting of}} a front dive, a back dive, a reverse dive, an inward dive, a twisting dive and an armstand dive.

60|$|Steps {{crashed through}} the bushes, {{and then over}} the wall came an active figure, {{at the sight of}} which Sam was almost ready to <b>dive</b> <b>out</b> of sight, for, of all {{possible}} boys, who should it be but Ben, the last person in the world whom he would like to have see him in his present pitiful plight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Plenty to do. But I'm {{not paid}} for it. I walk {{a great number}} of blocks and jump into {{a great number of}} cars and dive into {{elevators}} and <b>dive</b> <b>out</b> again and open doors and say 'Good morning' when people tell me they haven't a job for me. My days are quite full, but my pocket-book isn't!" ...|$|R

50|$|The {{third time}} was charm, as Hempel won {{silver in the}} 10 m platform, scoring 663.27. He saved his toughest dive for last. He nailed the back 1½ {{somersault}} with 4½ twists from the free position, earning 92.88 points. It {{was one of the}} two <b>dives</b> <b>out</b> of the 72 in the finals with a 3.6 degree of difficulty.|$|R
60|$|He meant Tom, and Dick {{instantly}} made up {{his mind}} that the best thing he could do would be to get to the engine room and warn his fun-loving brother of their peril. He made a turn, sent Sack Todd and Dan Baxter sprawling, and an instant later was <b>diving</b> <b>out</b> of sight down the ladder leading to the machinery.|$|R
60|$|On awaking, it {{was some}} time ere we could collect our faculties so as to {{remember}} where we were, {{and we were in}} much uncertainty as to whether it was early or late. We saw by the faint light that it was day, but could not guess at the hour; so Jack proposed that he should <b>dive</b> <b>out</b> and reconnoitre.|$|R
50|$|Following several {{practice}} <b>dives</b> <b>out</b> of Coco Solo, she transited the Panama Canal on 27 January 1920 for drydock work at Balboa. Returning to Coco Solo, R-21 {{continued to}} refine her diving, approach, and torpedo tactics through {{the spring and}} summer. During two trips to Almirante Bay, 30 March-2 April and 17-20 May, she practiced with other units of the first division.|$|R
50|$|Unfavorable weather {{prevented}} operations until 25 November, when a kamikaze roared toward Hancock, <b>diving</b> <b>out</b> of the sun. Antiaircraft fire exploded {{the plane}} some 300 ft above the ship, but {{a section of}} its fuselage landed amidships, {{and a part of}} the wing hit the flight deck and burst into flames. Prompt and skillful teamwork quickly extinguished the blaze and prevented serious damage.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 February {{just prior}} to sunset while {{cruising}} in formation {{with a group of}} LSTs, an enemy [...] "Jill" [...] <b>dived</b> <b>out</b> of the clouds and hit Keokuk on the starboard side, knocking out most of the starboard 20 mm guns battery. The fires were extinguished by 18:50; the ship had 17 killed and 44 wounded in the action.|$|R
2500|$|Graphs safe diving depth was {{discovered}} to be —much {{deeper than the}} British thought {{for this kind of}} boat. At the time, Royal Navy depth charges had a maximum depth setting of [...] so the Germans could <b>dive</b> <b>out</b> of their reach. Depth charges were soon modified to take account of this. The boat's acoustic and magnetic characteristics were examined by different Admiralty research establishments.|$|R

At last he is driven insane by the enigma of Pat and <b>dives</b> <b>out</b> the window.|$|R
50|$|Graphs safe diving depth was {{discovered}} to be 230 m—much {{deeper than the}} British thought {{for this kind of}} boat. At the time, Royal Navy depth charges had a maximum depth setting of 170 m so the Germans could <b>dive</b> <b>out</b> of their reach. Depth charges were soon modified to take account of this. The boat's acoustic and magnetic characteristics were examined by different Admiralty research establishments.|$|R
50|$|The Wii version also {{includes}} motion and pointer controls during normal gameplay. Flicking the nunchuk tosses Lara's grapple, and the Wii remote's pointer aims her weapons and flashlight. Also, Lara can speed up while swimming, shimmying, or climbing by quickly shaking the nunchuck. Finally, the adrenaline dodges are activated with motion gestures matching the in-game events (such as throwing a punch or <b>diving</b> <b>out</b> of harm's way).|$|R
50|$|Jason Alexander {{performed}} his own stunt in this episode, actually <b>diving</b> <b>out</b> of {{the path}} of an oncoming truck and being showered with the shrapnel of the crushed Frogger machine as the truck ran it over. He later recounted that two large and heavy pieces of paneling {{from the side of}} the game landed uncomfortably close to his head during the shooting of this scene.|$|R
5000|$|The next day, Buffy {{returns to}} Angel. She notices her diary askew {{and tries to}} explain away entries that reveal fantasies about [...] "A". Angel assures her {{that he did not}} read the diary. He then confesses his {{attraction}} towards her. They kiss. Suddenly, Angel pulls back with a snarl of distress, showing his vampire face. Buffy screams in shock and he <b>dives</b> <b>out</b> the window.|$|R

60|$|As old John {{was not in}} the way at the moment, Joe, who {{was sitting}} in the bar ruminating on his dismal fate and the {{manifold}} perfections of Dolly Varden, ran out to hold the guest's stirrup and assist him to mount. Mr Chester was scarcely in the saddle, and Joe was in the very act of making him a graceful bow, when old John came <b>diving</b> <b>out</b> of the porch, and collared him.|$|R

25|$|By the mid-seventies, much of Lee's work {{displayed}} a more romantic, soft-focus approach, {{similar to that}} of Sarah Moon and Deborah Turbeville, such as the hazy Selfridges/Bathers 1976 and the poignant Reflections 1975. Often displaying a surreal aspect, his Austin Reed/Rome 1976 appears to show men <b>diving</b> <b>out</b> of a swimming pool, whilst Ossie Clark/Aeroplane 1969 has the model wearing a floaty Ossie Clark dress, flying towards her mirror image flanked by a pair of fighter aircraft.|$|R
6000|$|Dominic went forward. He {{paused to}} look down at Cesar, who, as I have said before, was lying full length face down by the foremast, then stepped over him, and <b>dived</b> <b>out</b> of my sight under the foresail. I saw nothing ahead. It was {{impossible}} for me to see anything except the foresail open and still, like a great shadowy wing. But Dominic had his bearings. His voice came to me from forward, in a just audible cry: ...|$|R
