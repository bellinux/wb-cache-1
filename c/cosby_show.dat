He was featured in the 1989 dance film Tap, along with Sammy Davis Jr., Gregory Hines and Savion Glover, demonstrating classic challenge dancing.

5|$|Many of the {{producers}} were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top ten while airing on Sunday, and they felt the move would destroy its ratings. Ratings wise, new episodes of The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Show</b> beat The Simpsons every time during the second season and The Simpsons eventually fell out of the top ten. At {{the end of the season}} Cosby averaged as the fifth highest rated show on television, while The Simpsons was thirty eighth.|$|E
5|$|Our World premiered to {{indifferent}} critical response but as {{the series}} progressed critics became effusive with their praise. Despite being critically well received and profitable for the network, Our World performed poorly in the Nielsen ratings, as its first half-hour was programmed against the extremely popular The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Show.</b> ABC canceled the show after one season. Ellerbee tried to move the series to PBS but was unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|Airing Monday through Thursday at 10pm ET, it also replayed in late night, at 1 a.m. ET. It {{originally}} aired at 9pm ET, {{and in that}} timeslot was the network's highest-rated program.

500|$|Typically playing {{straight}} {{woman to}} Cosby's humorous Cliff, Rashad's character began to adopt more comedic material during the show's second season, although she maintains her disciplinarian status within her own household. Since The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Shows</b> inception, <b>Cosby</b> had always intended for Clair {{to reflect the}} ways in which women's roles have evolved in both the home and workplace. Clair is depicted as a hardworking career woman with strong feminist principles, most evident in the character's early confrontations with chauvinistic son-in-law Elvin. One particularly memorable interaction, dubbed Clair's [...] "feminist rant" [...] by the media, has become so popular that the scene continues to be heavily circulated on the Internet and social media, 30 years after its initial appearance.|$|R
5|$|With {{its first}} season, The Simpsons became the Fox network's first series to {{rank among the}} top thirty highest rated shows of a {{television}} season. Due to this success, Fox decided to switch The Simpsons timeslot in hopes that it would result in higher ratings for the shows that would air after it. The series moved from 8:00p.m. on Sunday nights to the same time on Thursdays, where it competed with The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Show,</b> the number one show at the time.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{response}} {{was much less}} effusive. The show averaged 9 million viewers per episode, as compared to The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Show,</b> which garnered an average 63 million viewers per week. Our World was the lowest rated prime time show of the 104 that aired during the 1986-7 television season, bringing in only a 6.5/10 rating/share. One segment of the public who responded very favorably to the program was teachers, who assigned Our World as homework. ABC created a study guide for the show, mailing out some 39,000 copies a month to educators and fans.|$|E
5|$|Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, Ken Griffey, Jr., Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, José Canseco, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Scioscia all guest starred as themselves, {{playing the}} ringers hired by Mr. Burns. Terry Cashman sang a song over the end credits. The guest stars were {{recorded}} over several months, with differing degrees of cooperation. The episode is often named among the show's best, {{and was the}} first to beat The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Show</b> in the ratings on its original airing. In 2014, showrunner Al Jean selected it as one of five essential episodes in the show's history.|$|E
50|$|Warfield {{picked up}} alto {{saxophone}} {{when he was}} nine years old, and switched to tenor {{when he was a}} teenager. After a short period at Howard University he became a jazz musician full-time.

50|$|Within {{months of}} her debut, Denise became The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Show's</b> most popular character, well-received among young adult viewers who {{identified}} with her unique sense of fashion and free-spirited attitude. Bonet's performance earned her a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1986. Some fans criticized Bonet's performance in Angel Heart for dishonoring Denise's wholesome reputation. Critically, the character did not fare {{as well on}} A Different World; critics found Bonet uninteresting and often blamed her performance for the unimpressive reviews the series received during its inaugural season. Revered as a fashion icon, the character's eclectic style has had profound impact on modern-day fashion trends, particularly boho chic; media publications frequently rank Denise among television's best-dressed characters.|$|R
5000|$|Cosby {{performed}} {{his first}} TV standup special in 30 years, [...] "Bill Cosby: Far From Finished", on Comedy Central on November 23, 2013. <b>Cosby's</b> last <b>show</b> of the [...] "Far From Finished" [...] tour was {{performed at the}} Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Atlanta, Georgia on May 2, 2015.|$|R
5|$|The Simpsons {{first season}} was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows.

It would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Show,</b> the number one show at the time. Many of the producers were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top 10 while airing on Sunday and they felt the move would destroy its ratings.|$|E
5|$|NBC {{ordered a}} full season of Homicide: Life on the Street before a pilot episode was even produced. Planned as a mid-season replacement, the network ordered six episodes for their 1993 winter season, and then ordered another three after {{watching}} the completed pilot episode. The network had been consistently placing third behind their competitor networks ABC and CBS, and was suffering due {{to the loss of}} several successful shows in 1992, including The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Show,</b> The Golden Girls and Matlock, as well as the upcoming end of Cheers in 1993. NBC had tried appealing to audiences in their 20s through several comedies, but those efforts proved unsuccessful and the network decided to focus on high-quality dramas like Homicide. NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield considered it the most promising new series of the season.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Cosby</b> <b>Show</b> {{spent five}} {{consecutive}} seasons {{as the number}} one rated show on television.

It told {{a brief history of}} the franchise from its radio days to the CBS series, and featured interviews with then-surviving cast members, as well as then-popular black television stars, such as Redd Foxx and Marla Gibbs, reflecting on the show's impact on their careers. Foxx and Gibbs emphasized the importance of the show featuring black actors in lead roles and expressed disagreement with the NAACP's objections that had contributed to the program's downfall. The film also contained a select complete episode of the classic TV series ("Kingfish Buys a Lot") that had not been seen since it was pulled from the air in 1966.|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of that experience, they met William Morris agent Michael Ovitz, who was himself a fan of the Stein and Illes radio show.

50|$|The Vikings {{called their}} {{farmsteads}} a ‘thorpe’, and designated {{who owned the}} land with the word ‘by’.

The name Elmesthorpe, originally Aylmersthorpe, derived from a Saxon lord named Aylmer and Thorpe, a Danish word for village. Earl Shilton retained its Saxon name of Sheltone despite the settlement of Danes in the area. The name relates to a ‘shelf’ as the original village was perched on the hill around Hilltop.|$|R
