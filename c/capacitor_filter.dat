40|$|Design of {{switched}} capacitor circuits in scaled CMOS technologies is becoming {{difficult because of}} low device intrinsic gain and reduced power supply voltage. To solve these problems, comparator-based switched-capacitor (CBSC) circuits and zero-crossing based circuits (ZCBC) were suggested as a possible solution to the op-amp based circuits. In this thesis, we explore zero-crossing based circuits (ZCBC) in high-order differential switched-capacitor filters to replace area inefficient op-amps-based continuous-time baseband filters. For the prototype for the zero-crossing based high-order switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter,</b> a low-pass ladder filter network will be used which is less sensitive to component variations. Several transformation steps from this low-pass passive ladder filter network to a differential high-order switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter</b> will be explored. To verify this architecture, SWITCAP will be used. And then ZCBC circuit implementation in Cadence will be explored. by Sungah Lee. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Low-sensitivity {{switched}} capacitor filters imitating 'R','L' and 'C' {{can be built}} by means of capacitances, ordinary switches and voltage inverter switches (VIS). These structures carry the inherent bilinear transformation of their doubly resistively terminated ladder reference filters. This one to one correspondence between the 's-domain' and the 'z-domain' results in the Nyquist criterion being the only limitation on the sampling frequency. This eliminates the necessity for oversampling and VIS filters can be designed for high operating rates. Filters based on VIS principle were analysed in previous literatures in the 'phi-domain'. In this thesis work, a successful attempt {{has been made to}} formulate an analysis procedure for discrete-time filters based on VIS principle in the 'z-domain'. Significant details have been brought out in comparison with the respective reference filter. A fifth-order lowpass filter has been designed and implemented to exhibit the closeness to the bilinearly transformed continuous-time reference filter. Settling time analysis has been done to justify the need for filters using VIS principle as compared to the filters employing integrator based switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter.</b> It is shown that VIS filter can be made to settle within half the period required for a conventional integrator based switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter...</b>|$|E
