40|$|In many {{precision}} machining {{processes such as}} surface grinding, coolant is typically used to provide functions such as lubrication and cooling. In order to reduce surface grinding temperatures effectively, an active <b>coolant</b> <b>cooling</b> system is proposed. The system {{is based on the}} use of forced convection of the heat generated during the machining process. The <b>coolant</b> <b>cooling</b> system utilizes a commonly used air conditioner for ease of use and to reduce costs. In the proposed design, the evaporator of the heat pump is connected to the coolant tank of a surface grinding machine to reduce grinding temperatures for improved stability of accuracy and surface quality. This can be done without compromising production efficiency. System structure is explained, and a coolant temperature model presented. Experimental testing on a prototype active cooling system is presented. The coolant temperature can be reduced to approximately - 2 degreesC under no load condition, and to approximately 3 degreesC under loaded condition. The time constants of the cooling system were estimated The results of the experimental tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system for applications in surface grinding for active <b>coolant</b> <b>cooling</b> in comparison with passive cooling.

Designing effective and efficient cooling configu-rations requires detailed understanding on how geometry and operating conditions affect the way <b>coolant</b> <b>cools</b> the turbine materials. Experimental measurements that can reveal such information are difficult and costly to obtain because gas turbines operate at high temperatures (up to 2000 K), high pressures (30 þ bar), and the dimensions of many key features in the cooling configurations are small (millimeters or smaller). This paper presents a method that enables experiments to be conducted at near room temperatures, near atmospheric pressures, and using scaled-up geometries to reveal the temperature and heat-flux distributions within turbine materials as if the experiments were conducted under engine operating conditions. The method is demonstrated by performing conjugate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses on two test problems.

The basic idea is to insert a heat pipe {{at the center of}} the drill tool with the evaporator close to the drill tip and the condenser at the end of the drill.

Experimental studies were involved in three cases, including solid drill without coolant, solid drill with coolant, and heat pipe drill. Drilling tests were conducted on a CNC machining center with full immersion cutting. The cast iron square block was used as the workpiece, and the high-speed steel was chosen for the drill tool material. Flank wear is considered as the criterion for tool failure, and the wear was measured using a Hisomet II Toolmaker’s microscope.

Usually, the fuel cooling {{is necessary to}} increase its density and provide heat compensation during prelaunch operation of SPM. The fuel temperature control systems (FTCS) using different principles of operation and types of coolants are applied for fuel cooling. To determine parameters of LPC cooling process through the fuel heat exchange in the heat exchanger with <b>coolant,</b> which is <b>cooled</b> by liquid nitrogen upon contact heat exchange in the coolant reservoir, a mathematical model of this process and a design technique are necessary.
