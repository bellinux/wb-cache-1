25|$|A {{gastrointestinal}} <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> is a rare, slow-growing form {{of cancer}} that affects certain cells in {{the lining of the}} stomach and intestines. The cells it affects make hormones that regulate the production of digestive juices and muscles that move food through the stomach and intestines. This kind of cancer usually occurs in the appendix, small intestine, or rectum. Its presence is associated with an increased risk of cancers affecting the other parts of the digestive system. It is usually treated with surgery.|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> of {{the lung}} are rare, and account for 1 % of all primary {{tumors of the}} lung. This study was {{undertaken}} to investigate the histological characteristics and clinical behavior of <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> of the lung. Methods: We have retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of 11 consecutive patients undergoing surgical treatment for <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> of the lung between 1992 and 2007. Results: Patients with <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> accounted for 0. 8 % (11 of 1319) of the patients undergoing surgical treatment for nonsmall cell lung cancer. The group comprised six males and five females {{with a mean age}} at presentation of 58. 6 years (range 27 – 78 years). All of the operations were lobectomies, including two sleeve lobectomies. Six patients had typical and five had atypical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors.</b> Seven patients had stage IA disease, two had stage IB, one had stage IIA, and one had stage IIIA. Recurrent tumors developed in two of the five patients affected by atypical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors,</b> but none of the six patients with typical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors.</b> Overall, the 5 -year survival rate of patients with both typical and atypical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> was 90. 9 %. Conclusion: Survival of <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> was favorable. In this analysis, two patients with atypical carcinoid had postoperative recurrences. Recurrence was more common among patients with atypical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> are {{the most}} common type of small bowel tumor, and the {{incidence}} is rising. The majority of small bowel <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> arise within 60 cm of the ileocecal valve. The addition of ileoscopy to screening colonoscopy can detect asymptomatic small bowel <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> and improve long-term prognosis through early surgical resection. Ileoscopy is a brief procedure with a high success rate and minimal complications beyond those of colonoscopy. The use of ileoscopy during screening colonoscopy has led to an increase in the early-stage detection of locoregional small bowel <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> that can be completely treated with surgery alone, and as such has improved long-term prognosis in these patients. Five asymptomatic Caucasian patients, 3 males and 2 females, from 53 to 70 years old (mean age, 60 years old), were diagnosed with locoregional ileal carcinoids during routine colonoscopy with ileoscopy. Since having an ileocolectomy and without adjuvant treatment, no patient has developed tumor recurrence over a follow-up period of one and half to 12 and a half years. The early detection of <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> by ileoscopy during screening colonoscopy can lead to increased long-term survival in patients with locally invasive disease. The high success rate and brief duration of the procedure, in addition to the lack of associated morbidity and mortality suggest that with further studies, routine ileoscopy during colonoscopy may be promising in the diagnosis of small bowel <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims. Conventional {{endoscopic}} submucosal resection (EMR) of <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> {{often involves}} the resection margin, which necessitates further intervention. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely accepted for removing <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors.</b> We aimed {{to evaluate the}} clinical usefulness of ESD with that of EMR for resection of type I gastric <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors.</b> Patients and Methods. The study enrolled 62 patients (37 males, 25 females; median age, 50 years; range, 40 – 68 years) who were treated with EMR or ESD at three hospitals; the study group had 87 type I gastric <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> with an estimated size of ≤ 10 [*]mm. The complete resection rate and the complications associated with these two procedures were analyzed. Results. The overall ESD complete resection rate was {{higher than that of}} the EMR rate (94. 9 % versus 83. 3 %, P value = 0. 174). A statistically lower vertical margin involvement rate was achieved when ESD was performed compared to when EMR was performed (2. 6 % versus 16. 7 %, P value = 0. 038). The complication rate was not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions. ESD showed a higher complete resection rate, particularly for the vertical margin, with a similar complication rate. We mildly recommend ESD rather than EMR for removing type I gastric <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R
