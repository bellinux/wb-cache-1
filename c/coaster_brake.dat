25|$|The {{rear linkage}} {{mechanism}} {{is complicated by}} the need to allow rotation where the fork and handlebars attach to the frame. A common setup was to combine a front rod brake with a rear <b>coaster</b> <b>brake.</b> Although heavy and complex, the linkages are reliable and durable and can be repaired or adjusted with simple hand tools. The design is still in use, typically on African and Asian roadsters such as the Sohrab and Flying Pigeon.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the California Motor Company {{was formed}} in 1901 to sell {{complete}} gasoline-engine motorbikes in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. The company began with a 200cc single-cylinder, 1.5-horsepower, four-stroke engine designed by R.C. Marks. Mounted to a standard bicycle frame, the California could reach speeds of approximately 25mph (40km/h). The California weighed around 75-80 pounds, and featured a leading-link front fork, a leather spring saddle, a front Duck roller brake, and an Atherton rear <b>coaster</b> <b>brake.</b> A leathern belt-drive directly connected the engine output shaft to the rear wheel. During the summer of 1903, George A. Wyman rode a 200cc, 1.5-horsepower California from San Francisco to New York City, becoming {{the first person to}} cross the North American continent aboard a motor vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Little 500 {{bikes are}} rather distinctive. They are single gear, <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> racing bicycles. There are two {{different}} versions of the bike: the men's and the women's. The only difference between the men's and women's bikes is the frame size; the men race on a 56 cm frame, the women's bikes are built on 54 cm frames. Men and women race on the same 46x18 gearing. Every year {{a new version of the}} bike is made and then two are given to each team. The cost of the bikes are, for the most part, covered in the team registration fees and race sponsorship money. At the end of the season, team's are given the option to keep their bikes or to sell them back to IUSF. The used bikes are then kept at the track and are rented out by those teams that do not have old bikes.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{applications}} of -based lubricants include two-stroke engines (such as motorcycle engines), bicycle <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes,</b> automotive CV and universal joints, ski waxes and bullets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> and rim brakes were common. The 1968 Schwinn Krate models had a {{front drum}} brake. The 1972 Schwinn Pea Picker {{included}} a rear disc brake.|$|R
5000|$|Until about 2000 Kronan bikes {{were only}} {{available}} in {{a limited number of}} colors, with a single gear and <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes.</b> New models have been added with 3-speed SRAM hub gears and drum brakes.|$|R
500|$|The {{rear brake}} of an upright bicycle can only produce about 0.25g (~2.5m/s2) {{deceleration}} at best, {{because of the}} decrease in normal force at the rear wheel as described above. All such bikes with only rear braking are subject to this limitation: for example, bikes with only a <b>coaster</b> <b>brake,</b> and fixed-gear bikes with no other braking mechanism. There are, however, situations that may warrant rear wheel braking ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike most {{drum brakes}} (but like a Shimano roller brake) a <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> is {{designed}} to run with all its internal parts coated in grease for quiet operation and smooth engagement. [...] Most grey molybdenum disulphide greases work well in a <b>coaster</b> <b>brake,</b> with its metal-to-metal friction surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|In 1898, {{after the}} advent of {{freewheel}} coasting mechanisms, the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel. [...] The <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> was contained in the rear wheel hub, and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling, thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear. [...] In the United States, the <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> was the most commonly fitted brake throughout {{the first half of}} the 20th century, often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle.|$|E
50|$|Some {{innovations}} {{introduced in}} bicycles designed for military use {{found their way}} to civilian markets as well, such as <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> and the cyclometer. In modern times bicycles and electric bicycles are still used by many armies around the world but there are no separate bicycle infantry units.|$|R
50|$|In 1975 {{he was one}} of {{the first}} racers to covert from <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> to freewheels and caliper brakes. By {{comparison}} Stu Thomsen would not covert until 1978. He also was one of the first to use light weight components in an era of 30 to 40 pound race bikes.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, Bendix {{automotive}} brakes blossomed {{with the}} introduction of fixed-caliper disc brakes and the [...] "Duo-Servo" [...] system (which became, virtually, a de facto world standard for drum brakes). During the 1960s, Bendix also dabbled in bicycle hardware, producing a reliable, totally self-contained, 2-speed [...] "Kick-Back" [...] planetary rear axle with <b>coaster</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need to repack their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|E
2500|$|Though made {{obsolete}} by {{the introduction}} of the duck brake, <b>coaster</b> <b>brake,</b> and rod brake, spoon brakes continued {{to be used in the}} West supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s, and on children's bicycles until the 1950s. [...] In the developing world, they were manufactured until much more recently.|$|E
2500|$|First {{invented in}} 1898 by Willard M. Farrow, the [...] "coaster brake", {{also known as}} a [...] "back pedal brake" [...] or [...] "foot brake" [...] ("torpedo" [...] or [...] "contra" [...] in some countries, in Italy [...] "contropedale"), is a type of drum brake {{integrated}} into the back hub with an internal freewheel. [...] Freewheeling functions as with other systems, but when back pedaled, the brake engages after a fraction of a revolution. The <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> can be found in both single-speed and internally geared hubs.|$|E
50|$|With {{hand-operated}} brakes, {{force is}} applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or hydraulic lines to the friction pads. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> which were popular in North America until the 1960s, and are common in children's bicycles.|$|R
25|$|With {{hand-operated}} brakes, {{force is}} applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> which were popular in North America until the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|A {{key element}} of this program is the [...] "culturally appropriate" [...] bicycle, {{specially}} {{designed to meet the}} needs of the local populations and to withstand the African terrain. The single-speed bike, weighing in at 55 lb, is equipped with a heavy-duty rack capable of transporting 220 lb, automotive-grade nylon ply tires, <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes,</b> reinforced spokes, and a frame constructed of higher-gauge steel tubing.|$|R
2500|$|Invented in 1897, {{the duck}} brake or duck roller brake used a rod {{operated}} by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers (usually made of wood or rubber) against the front tyre. [...] Mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set {{at an angle to}} conform to the shape of the tyre, the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre, thus braking the front wheel. [...] A tension spring held the rollers away from the tyre except when braking. [...] Braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar, which provided additional leverage when braking (two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary). [...] Used in combination with a rear <b>coaster</b> <b>brake,</b> a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear <b>coaster</b> <b>brake.</b> [...] Known colloquially as the duck brake, the design was used by many notable riders of the day, and was widely exported to England, Australia, and other countries. [...] In 1902, Louis H. Bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the Duck Roller Brake (Patent 708,114) for use on motorized bicycles (motorcycles).|$|E
2500|$|Coaster-brake {{bicycles}} {{are generally}} {{equipped with a}} single cog and chain wheel and often use ⅛ in (3.2mm) wide chain. [...] However, {{there have been several}} models of <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> hubs with dérailleurs, such as the Sachs 2x3. These use special extra-short dérailleurs which can stand up to the forces of being straightened out frequently and do not require an excessive amount of reverse pedal rotation before the brake engages. Coaster brakes have also been incorporated into hub gear designs - for example the AWC and SRC3 from Sturmey-Archer, and the Shimano Nexus 3-speed. They can have up to eight gears, like the Nexus inter-8.|$|E
2500|$|In 1893, BSA {{commenced}} making bicycle hubs {{and continued}} to supply the cycle trade with bicycle parts up to 1936. BSA bought The Eadie Manufacturing Company of Redditch in 1907 and so began to manufacture the Eadie two speed hub gear and the Eadie <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> hub. BSA also {{signed an agreement with}} the Three Speed Gear Syndicate in 1907 to manufacture a 3 speed hub under licence. [...] This was later classified as the Sturmey Archer Type X. BSA introduced a 'Duo' hub in the late 1930s which was capable of one fixed gear and one gear with a freewheel. [...] All BSA hub gear production temporarily ceased in 1939, until they recommenced making their 3 speed hub around 1945. The Eadie coaster hub made a brief return in 1953 on two BSA bicycle models. BSA forever ceased production of their hub gears in 1955.|$|E

25|$|Further {{innovations}} increased {{comfort and}} {{ushered in a}} second bicycle craze, the 1890s Golden Age of Bicycles. In 1888, Scotsman John Boyd Dunlop introduced the first practical pneumatic tire, which soon became universal. Soon after, the rear freewheel was developed, enabling the rider to coast. This refinement led to the 1890s invention of <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes.</b> Dérailleur gears and hand-operated Bowden cable-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.|$|R
25|$|The primary modern {{mechanical}} {{actuation mechanism}} uses brake levers coupled to Bowden cables to move brake arms, thus forcing pads against a braking surface. Cable mechanisms are usually less expensive, but may require some maintenance related to exposed {{areas of the}} cable. Other mechanical actuation mechanisms exist: see <b>Coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> for back-pedal actuation mechanisms, and Rod-actuated brakes for a mechanism incorporating metal rods. The first Spoon brakes were actuated by a cable that was pulled by twisting {{the end of a}} handlebar.|$|R
50|$|Many {{were sold}} as either single speed with <b>coaster</b> <b>brake</b> or {{fitted with a}} Sturmey-Archer AW three-speed hub. The New-Zealand-manufactured version was offered with a duomatic {{two-speed}} hub, which shifted gears by kicking back the pedals and also had a built-in <b>coaster</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E

50|$|Skid brakes {{essentially}} {{involve a}} long piece of material, often ceramic-covered, {{situated in the}} middle of the track parallel to the rails. When the brake is engaged, the skid raises and friction against the underside of the train causes the train to slow and eventually stop. Skid brakes were one of the first advancements in roller <b>coaster</b> <b>braking</b> and are typically not utilized in modern creations with the exception of Twister at Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, PA and the Matterhorn at Disneyland in California.|$|R
5000|$|The Schwinn Racer was {{a bicycle}} in the {{lightweight}} series of bikes built by Schwinn Bicycle Company in Chicago from the 1950s-1970s. They had a Sturmey Archer 3 speed with 26 x 1 3/8 tires. They also came with single speed <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> (Schwinn 1960 catalog) Many were accessorized with speedometers, generators, baskets and rear racks. These parts made by Schwinn and installed by the selling dealer. As the ten-speed road bikes with derailleurs became more fashionable, these bikes lost their appeal. Today, they are mostly seen on college campuses, on casual riding bike paths and in museums.|$|R

The next year, Fisher participated in the Repack downhill race, promoted by his roommate Charlie Kelly. This used a tortuous downhill route on Pine Mountain near Fairfax, California, just north of San Francisco, in which riders used their <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> so much that they had to repack the smoking hubs with grease after every run. Fisher holds the record time on the Repack course at 4:22.|$|R
25|$|The ladies' {{version of}} the roadster's design {{was very much in}} place by the 1890s. It had a step-through frame rather than the diamond frame of the gentlemen's model so that ladies, with their dresses and skirts, could easily mount and ride their bicycles, and {{commonly}} came with a skirt guard to prevent skirts and dresses becoming entangled in the rear wheel and spokes. As with the gents' roadster, the frame was of steel construction and the positioning of the frame and handlebars gave the rider a very upright riding position. Though they originally came with front spoon-brakes, technological advancements meant that later models were equipped with the much-improved <b>coaster</b> <b>brakes</b> or rod-actuated rim or drum-brakes.|$|R
