40|$|The {{reason for}} the {{existence}} of any company is to make a profit, which means increasing turnover and keeping costs as low as possible. Optimisation of the Value Chain and Procurement were identified as the two largest contributors when one needs to improve the bottom line of any company. The purpose of this research was to develop an integrated Value Chain and Procurement <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> methodology and system specifications for a software solution which captures, tracks and accurately reports the impact of the improvement initiatives. The main research question was structured as follows: What should the specifications of a software solution be that will integrate the <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> processes of the Value Chain and of Procurement, in a manner that will ensure maximum sustainable bottom-line savings for companies in the manufacturing or service industries? The objective was to define the key phases in the Value Chain and Procurement <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> process and to determine how and where they integrate. It {{is important to note that}} according the literature review and the survey, both the Value Chain and Procurement <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> processes consist of seven phases. The phases of the Value Chain <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> process were: • Phase 1 : Budget/ABC costing and data analysis • Phase 2 : Generate ideas • Phase 3 : Evaluate and approve ideas • Phase 4 : Implementation planning and approval • Phase 5 : Development of project (idea) specific KPI's • Phase 6 : Implementation of ideas • Phase 7 : Track and report savings 7 The phases of the Procurement (Strategic Sourcing) <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> process were: • Phase 1 : Team selection/data collection/spend analysis/work plan development • Phase 2 : Access requirements/internal and external analysis • Phase 3 : Develop strategy/shape value proposition • Phase 4 : Screen suppliers, issue RFI/P/Q, implementation planning • Phase 5 : Conduct commercial event/negotiate/finalise contract • Phase 6 : Implement contract • Phase 7 : Contract management/track and reporting The above two <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> processes integrate at each phase of the respective processes and should thus be implemented at the same time due to their interdependencies. Based on the findings of the research it was clear that an integrated Value Chain and Procurement <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> process alone is not going to solve the <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> problems of companies. It is essential for the successful implementation of the integrated <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> process to develop skills and knowledgeable resources to implement the integrated <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> process, improve collaboration between the Value Chain and Procurement, and to implement a system to track and report performance during implementation. Further research should include how to adapt the current company processes, structures, procedures and systems in order to gain maximum benefit from the implementation of an integrated <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> process. The integrated Value Chain and Procurement <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> process, supported by a software system, should improve the success of <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> projects in companies. It is, however, important to note that the application of the methodology will vary between industries and that service-related industries might put more emphasis on Procurement <b>cost</b> <b>reduction,</b> while the manufacturing industries might place a bigger emphasis on <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> in operations. In conclusion, irrespective of the industries, it is evident that this methodology will enhance the <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> results previously obtained from similar efforts...|$|R

He became an aide-de-camp to his brother-in-law, the Marquess of Buckingham, who was serving as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in November 1787. On Buckingham's departure from Ireland, Nugent became commanding officer of the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards in 1789. Nugent became Member of Parliament for Buckingham in 1790. He exchanged into the Coldstream Guards as a company commander in October 1790 and served at the Siege of Valenciennes in May 1793, the Battle of Lincelles in August 1793 and the Siege of Dunkirk also in August 1793 under the Duke of York during the Flanders Campaign.|$|E
25|$|One major {{hallmark}} of McNamara's <b>cost</b> <b>reductions</b> was {{the consolidation of}} programs from different services, most visibly in aircraft acquisition, believing that the redundancy created waste and unnecessary spending. McNamara directed the Air Force to adopt the Navy's F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsair combat aircraft, a consolidation that was quite successful. Conversely, his actions in mandating a premature across-the-board adoption of the untested M16 rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat. McNamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well, resulting in the TFX dual service F-111 project. It was to combine Navy requirements for an Fleet Air Defense (FAD) aircraft and Air Force requirements for a tactical bomber. His experience {{in the corporate world}} led him to believe that adopting a single type for different missions and service would save money. He insisted on the General Dynamics entry over the DOD's preference for Boeing because of commonality issues. Though heralded as a fighter that could do everything (fast supersonic dash, slow carrier and short airfield landings, tactical strike, and even close air support), in the end it involved too many compromises to succeed at any of them. The Navy version was drastically overweight and difficult to land, and eventually canceled after a Grumman study showed it was incapable of matching the abilities of the newly revealed Soviet MiG-23 and MiG-25 aircraft. The F-111 would eventually find its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the Air Force.|$|E

30|$|It is {{difficult}} to specify {{the extent of the}} <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> in frugal innovation. This question is not sufficiently answered in the literature. As {{we have seen in the}} literature review, characterisations such as “minimum cost”, “much lower price”, “significantly lower costs” or “ultra-low cost” indicate that the <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> must be significant for an innovation to be considered a frugal innovation. It is hard to determine a specific threshold value for the criterion substantial <b>cost</b> <b>reduction,</b> since there are no representative samples. Rao (2013) compared the prices of 13 frugal innovations with ordinary products and services, mainly based on Internet searches. On the basis of his comparison, the extent of <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> can be calculated and between 58 and 97 % on an average of 80 %. Rao’s understanding of frugal innovation here is mostly in line with our criteria, despite his short definition of “scarcity-induced-, minimalist- or reverse-innovation” (Rao 2013). While Rao’s (2013) sample is not representative and quite small, it gives an indication of the extent of <b>cost</b> <b>reduction.</b> As long as no representative publications are available, we propose that frugal innovation’s substantial <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> must be at least one third of comparable products but strongly depends on the user context.|$|R
