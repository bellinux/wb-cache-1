Several cases of moderate variation in mitochondrial substitution rates {{have been reported in}} plants, but these mostly involve correlated changes in chloroplast and/or nuclear substitution rates and are therefore thought to reflect whole-organism forces rather than ones impinging directly on the mitochondrial mutation rate. Only a single case of extensive, mitochondrial-specific rate changes has been described, in the angiosperm genus Plantago. Results We explored a second potential case of highly accelerated mitochondrial sequence evolution in plants. This case was first suggested by relatively poor hybridization of mitochondrial gene probes to DNA of Pelargonium hortorum (the <b>common</b> <b>geranium).</b> We found that all eight mitochondrial genes sequenced from P. hortorum are exceptionally divergent, whereas chloroplast and nuclear divergence is unexceptional in P. hortorum. Two mitochondrial genes were sequenced from a broad range of taxa of variable relatedness to P. hortorum, and absolute rates of mitochondrial synonymous substitutions were calculated on each branch of a phylogenetic tree of these taxa. We infer one major, ~ 10 -fold increase in the mitochondrial synonymous substitution rate {{at the base of the}} Pelargonium family Geraniaceae, and a subsequent ~ 10 -fold rate increase early in the evolution of Pelargonium. We also infer several moderate to major rate decreases following these initial rate increases, such that the mitochondrial substitution rate has returned to normally low levels in many members of the Geraniaceae. Finally, we find unusually little RNA editing of Geraniaceae mitochondrial genes, suggesting high levels of retroprocessing in their history. Conclusion The existence of major, mitochondrial-specific changes in rates of synonymous substitutions in the Geraniaceae implies major and reversible underlying changes in the mitochondrial mutation rate in this family. Together with the recent report of a similar pattern of rate heterogeneity in Plantago, these findings indicate that the mitochondrial mutation rate is a more plastic character in plants than previously realized. Many molecular factors could be responsible for these dramatic changes in the mitochondrial mutation rate, including nuclear gene mutations affecting the fidelity and efficacy of mitochondrial DNA replication and/or repair and – consistent with the lack of RNA editing – exceptionally high levels of "mutagenic" retroprocessing. That the mitochondrial mutation rate has returned to normally low levels in many Geraniaceae raises the possibility that, akin to the ephemerality of mutator strains in bacteria, selection favors a low mutation rate in plant mitochondria. </p...|$|E

50|$|Pelargonium vitifolium is {{a species}} of {{geranium}} known by the <b>common</b> name grapeleaf <b>geranium.</b> It is native to South Africa, {{and it is a}} commonly grown ornamental plant. This is a mostly erect, branching shrub approaching one meter in maximum height. The stems are soft and coated in soft hairs when young and become more woody with age. The glandular, stiffly-hairy aromatic leaves are about 6 centimeters long and 8 wide, divided into 5 or 7 toothed, heart-shaped lobes. The inflorescence is a dense umbel of several flowers with five petals each around a centimeter long. The flowers are pink with purplish markings.|$|R
50|$|Pelargonium grossularioides is {{a species}} of {{geranium}} known by the <b>common</b> names gooseberry <b>geranium</b> and coconut geranium. It is native to southern Africa and it is known in coastal California and parts of India as an introduced species. It is sometimes grown as a garden geranium. This is a glandular, aromatic perennial herb with an erect, angular, reddish stem 20 to 50 centimeters tall. The green to reddish leaves are a few centimeters long and slightly lobed with toothed edges. The inflorescence is an umbel of 3 to 50 flowers in shades of light pink to dark reddish purple. There are five narrow petals no more than 6 millimeters long.|$|R

It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. It is commonly grown as an ornamental plant. This is a subshrub which can reach two meters in height, its branches prostrate, spreading, trailing, or climbing. The thin, somewhat succulent leaves are peltate, their petioles attached at {{the middle of the}} ivy-shaped leaf blades. The inflorescence is an umbel of 2 to 9 pink flowers, with 5 dark-streaked or marked petals each up to 2 centimeters long. The smaller leaves of the plant are edible, tasting sour and astringent. Pelargonium peltatum is included in the Tasmanian Fire Service's list of low flammability plants, indicating that it is suitable for growing within a building protection zone.|$|R

5000|$|Since the Mexican Revolution, Patzcuaro {{has worked}} to keep its {{traditional}} colonial-indigenous look. Unlike the capital, houses in Pátzcuaro are made of adobe and/or wood and generally have tiled roofs. Cobblestone streets dominate {{the center of town}} down to the lake. The town is filled with stores and vendors selling a wide variety of crafts, many in bright colors. Patzcuaro is the market hub of the region, with smaller villages bringing in their own specialized crafts such as copperware, black pottery, musical instruments, baskets etc. Local dishes include tamales filled with fish, tarasca soup, red pozole, atole, trout dishes, and a number of cold drinks based on corn. The courtyards and balconies are almost always filled with flowering plants, which is a tradition in Patzcuaro, with many homeowners sharing tips and plants with each other, sometimes even cross breeding a new variety of flower. The most common flower to be seen is the begonia, which blooms best between July and September. Other <b>common</b> plants include <b>geraniums,</b> mallows, bougainvilleas, , azaleas, hydrangeas, roses and others. Non-flowering plants that can also be seen include palm trees, selaginella and various cacti. Some grow medicinal and culinary herbs such as aloe, chamomile, mint, basil and others. Patzcuaro was named as one of the 100 Historic World Treasure Cities by the United Nations. This generated funds for restoration projects such as repairing the old cobblestone streets. It is also one of Mexico's [...] "Pueblos Mágicos" [...] (Magic Towns).|$|R
