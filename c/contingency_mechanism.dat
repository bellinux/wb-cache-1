40|$|Integrating {{insights}} from cognitive psychology into current network theory {{on the social}} capital of brokering and closed networks, we argue that cognitive style is a critical contingency explaining the relation between social network position and innovative performance. Based on a “complementary fit ” argument, we posit that a social network rich in structural holes enhances the innovative performance of employees with an adaptive cognitive style; however, individuals with an innovative cognitive style are most innovative when embedded within a closed network of densely interconnected contacts. Using data on the individual cognitive styles and complete workplace social networks of all employees within a design and manufacturing firm, we show that our theorized <b>contingency</b> <b>mechanism</b> accounts for {{a large share of}} empirical variation in employee innovative performance over and above existing social network explanations.

The method responds {{to the needs of the}} new regulatory scheme to guarantee the reliability in the supply of the electric energy in Colombia called the Reliability Charge, which includes a voluntary load reduction (VLR) program in the form of a <b>contingency</b> <b>mechanism.</b> According to the international experience, a voluntary load reduction programs have been design to operate when the expected demand surpasses the maximum installed capacity; these situation usually occur at the peak periods and have a short duration. The objective of the VLR is then to translate high peak consumptions to lower periods of consumption in exchange of an incentive. In the Colombian scenario, the method must be designed to cover scarcity of hydro resources. For this reason, the System Operator (ISO) requires a methodology to calculate a proper Base-Line from which could determine an effective reduction. Then, the authors propose a statistical method appropriate to be used for time series with the following characteristics: i) Easy to implement and upgradeable ii) Flexible and as General as possible. iii) Must take into account seasonality, slope and level change. iv) Generates a value that indicates accuracy to estimate the forecasted values of the CBL...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. IT {{governance}} is {{a highly}} researched field with {{a majority of the}} literature focusing on structural (form) and processual (<b>contingency)</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The theoretical foundations of agency theory, which has a strong focus on control, predominantly underpin the current IT governance practices. The field is lacking in research contributions on relational mechanisms of IT governance and how they influence governance outcomes. Despite the amount of prescriptive models and “best practice frameworks” available in the field, achieving key IT governance outcomes remains amongst the highest ranked management concerns. This paper seeks to explicate the disharmony between current practices and espoused theory through a case study within an organization in the pursuit to understand multi-stakeholder perspectives as to their impression of governance, its purpose and relevance in the organization; for the purpose of attaining a systemic, multi -perspective view on governance as a practice within organizations, as opposed to those prescribed in mainstream theory. A key objective of this research is to provide more insight on the existing gap between the various stakeholders' perspectives on IT governance in the multiple echelons of an organization, with particular emphasis on the alignment of mental models and the process of sense making; revealing a deeper understanding of current governance practices from the social/relational, structural and processual mechanisms within an organization and highlighting the as-lived perceptions on IT governance purpose, objectives, important IT mechanisms for effective IT governance and perspectives on current IT governance effectiveness within their context. The culmination of the findings from this research reveal in a need for organizations to engage in a sense-making process that enables the inclusive conceptualization of IT governance within their context. At the core, it is about IT governance vision- purpose- practice alignment, and as a (important) consequence, about business and IT alignment...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{resource}} forecasting is {{very important}} for the operation and management of solar power plants. Solar radiation is highly variable because it is driven mainly by synoptic and local weather patterns. This high variability presents challenges to meeting power production and demand curves, notably in the case of photovoltaic (PV) power plants, which have little or no storage capacity. For concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, variability issues are partially mitigated by the thermal inertia of the plant, including its heat transfer fluid, heat exchangers, turbines and, potentially, coupling with a heat storage facility; however, temporally and spatially varying irradiance introduces thermal stress in critical system components and plant management issues that can result in the degradation of the overall system’s performance and reduction of the plant’s lifetime. The variability can also result in lower plant efficiencies compared to operation in stable conditions because optimally operating the plant is more challenging. For PV power plants that have battery storage, forecasts are helpful to schedule the charging process of the batteries at the most appropriate time, optimize the fractions of electricity delivered and stored at any instant, and thus avoid the loss of usable energy. Solar radiation forecasting anticipates the solar radiation transients and the power production of solar energy systems, allowing for the setup of <b>contingency</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to mitigate any deviation from the required production. With the expected integration of large shares of solar power, reliable predictions of solar power production are becoming increasingly important as a basis for efficient management and operation strategies as well as for solar energy trading. Today, solar power prediction systems are an essential part of electric grid management in countries that have substantial shares of solar power generation, among which Germany is a paradigmatic case. For example, in 2016 Germany had an installed PV power capacity of more than 40 GWpeak, supplying more than 40...|$|R

40|$|Any {{information}} technology(IT) {{system needs}} its computing resources to operate correctly (system integrity) and should maintain {{the value of}} its information (data integ-rity). Unfortunately, adverse events may damage data integrity or system integ-rity or both. Contingency planning for IT sys-tems focuses on preserving, enabling recovery, or the graceful degradation of system or data integrity. Unfortunately, <b>contingency</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that work in one adverse situation may be hopelessly inadequate in another. Consequently, different contingency plan types exist for different “disasters. ” The two pri-mary types are physical and logical event plans. Traditional IT contingency plans address physical events such as flood, fire, earthquake, war, or loss of power. Many sources discuss traditional con-tingency planning, which often empha-sizes replication and physical separation to guard against physical disasters. Such traditional planning does not consider logical events. A logical event (LE) strikes all sites that have similar information configura-tions (software, data, and firmware) —no matter how widely separated. The im-pacted system also may corrupt IT that is down the information flow stream. LE contingency planning has two subcat-egories: plans for incompletely under-stood systems and plans for well-under-stood systems. Because the Y 2 K problem is an LE, discussion of LE contingency planning is appropriate. LE contingency planning borrows from systems security principles, which include auditing, system modeling, input and output validation, and in-strumentation. This article outlines the properties that a contingency plan strives to preserve, suggests techniques for further investigation in Y 2 K LE contingency planning, and explains LE contingency plans with respect to tradi-tional plans. Y 2 K planning is about risk manage-ment. Risk management involves • Identifying risks (potential threats and vulnerabilities). • Analyzing risks by evaluating, cat-egorizing, and prioritizing them. • Planning for risks. Contingency planning reduces to • Creating mechanisms to identify the events that trigger contingency actions. • Defining what the contingency actions are (either automatic or manually executed actions). • Preparing the responsible parties by documenting who they are and by training them to be ready...|$|R

40|$|In {{laboratory}} contingency learning tasks, {{people usually}} give accurate {{estimates of the}} degree of contingency between a cue and an outcome. However, if they are asked to estimate the probability of the outcome {{in the presence of the}} cue, they tend to be biased by the probability of the outcome in the absence of the cue. This bias is often attributed to an automatic <b>contingency</b> detection <b>mechanism,</b> which is said to act via an excitatory associative link to activate the outcome representation at the time of testing. We conducted 3 experiments to test alternative accounts of contingency bias. Participants were exposed to the same outcome probability in the presence of the cue, but different outcome probabilities in the absence of the cue. Phrasing the test question in terms of frequency rather than probability and clarifying the test instructions reduced but did not eliminate contingency bias. However, removal of ambiguity regarding the presence of additional causes during the test phase did eliminate contingency bias. We conclude that contingency bias may be due to ambiguity in the test question, and therefore it does not require postulation of a separate associative link-based mechanism. © 2013 Copyright The Experimental Psychology Society...|$|R

Corroborating our predictions, interpersonal cognitive complexity appeared as a conditional mediating variable that can translate an individual's breadth of functional experience into interteam coordination. The strength and direction of this indirect relationship, however, depended on the individual's identification with the organization as a whole. Moreover, on the team level of analysis, we found members' overall interteam coordination to positively relate with team performance in Study 2.

40|$|Abstract. Research {{on social}} {{cognition}} needs {{to overcome a}} disciplinary disintegration. On the one hand, in cognitive science and philosophy of mind – even in recent embodied approaches – the explanatory weight is still overly on individual capacities. In social science on the other hand, {{the investigation of the}} interaction process and interactional behaviour is not often brought to bear on individual aspects of social cognition. Not bringing these approaches together has unfairly limited the range of possible explanations of social understanding to the postulation of complicated internal <b>mechanisms</b> (<b>contingency</b> detection modules for instance). Starting from the question What is a social interaction? we propose a fresh look at the problem aimed at integrating individual cognition and the interaction process in order to arrive at more parsimonious explanations of social understanding. We show how an enactive framework can provide a way to do this, starting from the notions of autonomy, sense-making and coordination. We propose that not only each individual in a social encounter but also the interaction process itself has autonomy. Examples illustrate that these autonomies evolv...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenic {{microbes}} {{have evolved}} highly sophisticated mechanisms for colonizing host tissues and evading or deflecting assault by the immune response. The ability of these microbes to avoid clearance prolongs infection, thereby promoting their long-term survival within individual hosts and, through transmission, between hosts. Many pathogens {{are capable of}} extensive antigenic changes {{in the face of}} the multiple constitutive and dynamic components of host immune defenses. As a result, highly diverse populations that have widely different virulence properties can arise from a single infecting organism (clone). In this review, we consider the molecular and genetic features of antigenic variation and corresponding host-parasite interactions of different pathogenic bacterial, fungal, and protozoan microorganisms. The host and microbial molecules involved in these interactions often determine the adhesive, invasive, and antigenic properties of the infecting organisms and can dramatically affect the virulence and pathobiology of individual infections. Pathogens capable of such antigenic variation exhibit mechanisms of rapid mutability in confined chromosomal regions containing specialized genes designated <b>contingency</b> genes. The <b>mechanisms</b> of hypermutability of contingency genes are common to a variety of bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens and include promoter alterations, reading-frame shifts, gene conversion events, genomic rearrangements, and point mutations...|$|R

A prime {{example of such a}} commensal pathogen is Neisseria meningitidis, which normally resides in the human nasopharynx but is also a leading cause of sepsis and epidemic meningitis. Using N. meningitidis as model organism, we tested the hypothesis that virulence of commensal pathogens is a consequence of within host evolution and selection of invasive variants due to mutations at <b>contingency</b> genes, a <b>mechanism</b> called phase variation. In line with the hypothesis that phase variation evolved as an adaptation to colonize diverse hosts, computational comparisons of all 27 to date completely sequenced and annotated meningococcal genomes retrieved from public databases showed that contingency genes are indeed enriched for genes involved in host interactions. To assess within-host genetic changes in meningococci, we further used ultra-deep whole-genome sequencing of throat-blood strain pairs isolated from four patients suffering from invasive meningococcal disease. We detected up to three mutations per strain pair, affecting predominantly contingency genes involved in type IV pilus biogenesis. However, {{there was not a single}} (set) of mutation(s) that could invariably be found in all four pairs of strains. Phenotypic assays further showed that these genetic changes were generally not associated with increased serum resistance, higher fitness in human blood ex vivo or differences in the interaction with human epithelial and endothelial cells in vitro.

While certain aspects of these two missions are complementary, the two missions are also distinct in many ways. Common between the missions is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) rendezvous, one with the ISS And the other with the LSAM/EDS stack prior to trans-lunar insertion. The lunar missions will additionally require Orion to perform orbit maintenance in LLO, perform contingency lunar orbit operations including RPOD with the LSAM, perform the TEI maneuver sequence, and execute the trans-Earth cruise. The NASA-led team developed a reference configuration orbit GN&C system capable of executing all of these activities with the same navigation sensor suite and control effectors while fully meeting the requirements being developed for System Requirements Review in advance of prime contractor selection. This paper will present an overview of the analyses performed to support system trade studies, demonstrate the feasibility of the NASA reference configuration, and validate the Orion system requirements. These analyses include linear covariance techniques, 3 -DOF Monte Carlo simulations, 6 -DOF Monte Carlo simulations, and analytical evaluations of GN&C systems performed by the NASA-led Orion team to characterize the sensitivities of Orion s various missions and assess the unique challenges of each.

40|$|A typical {{sale and}} {{purchase}} agreement in an M&A transaction {{will include a}} variety of representations and warranties that the seller, {{and to some extent}} the buyer, will make as a result of extensive negotiations between the parties. The purpose of seller's representations and warranties when they are combined with indemnification provisions is to provide the buyer additional information about the target of the transaction and a mechanism whereby the buyer can be compensated for damages that are suffered as a result of untrue or inaccurate seller's representations and warranties, i. e. {{in the event of a}} breach. Representation and warranty insurance ("R&W Insurance") is a relatively new product in a sense that its use has increased more significantly only in recent years. There are a number of other risk management and allocation tools that parties frequently use, either in lieu of or in connection with the use of R&W Insurance. These other tools include, without limitation, 1) providing security to buyer's ability to recover losses from the seller due to breach of (representations and warranties or) contract by withholding some of the seller's proceeds e. g. via an escrow or other holdback mechanism, 2) providing other security for compensation of buyer's losses with the use of guarantees or sureties, e. g. provided by a third party or a parent company, and 3) providing an incentive for the seller to ensure that certain post-closing actions occur and/or potential post-closing risks do not realize by delaying the payment of a portion of the seller's proceeds with purchase price adjustment, earn-out and/or <b>contingency</b> payment <b>mechanisms.</b> This thesis evaluates some of the alternative risk management and allocation tools, including their relative strengths and weaknesses as compared to R&W Insurance, and identifies the circumstances wherein R&W Insurance may potentially address the parties' needs better or more appropriately. The two different types of R&W Insurance policies, i. e. buy-side and sell-side policies, are also evaluated with respect to the coverage and benefits that they provide in order to determine whether it is advantageous for the parties' to choose one type of policy over another type. With respect to the use of R&W Insurance, this thesis evaluates the ways in which a decision to use R&W Insurance can alter or change the parties' behavior or other aspects of the M&A transaction thereby increasing risk and/or undesirable effects. For example, does the use of a buy-side R&W Insurance policy cause the seller to engage, or provide an opportunity to engage, in riskier behavior since R&W Insurance transfers seller's liability for breach of seller's representations and warranties to a third-party insurer, thereby potentially causing the seller to become less engaged or more dishonest in the negotiation phase with respect to the content of the representations and warranties given by the seller? If yes, what are the potential strategies the buyer can use to deter undesirable behavior by the seller? This thesis also looks at certain qualifiers that parties often use, or at least discuss using during contract negotiations, such as knowledge. Since R&W Insurance is intended to cover unknown risks, parties' knowledge precludes coverage under R&W Insurance policy. In this regard, among other questions, the discussion in this thesis evaluates what the knowledge exclusion means, whether it impacts the buyer' behavior by potentially discouraging continued due diligence efforts by the buyer after signing and before closing, and how concepts such as sandbagging fit into a transaction wherein parties are contemplating the use of R&W Insurance...|$|R
40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) {{are characterized}} by inflexible and repetitive behaviour. Response monitoring involves evaluating the consequences of behaviour and making adjustments to optimize outcomes. Deficiencies in this function, and abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on which it relies, have been reported as contributing factors to autistic disorders. We investigated whether ACC structure and function during response monitoring were associated with repetitive behaviour in ASD. We compared ACC activation to correct and erroneous antisaccades using rapid presentation event-related functional MRI in 14 control and ten ASD participants. Because response monitoring {{is the product of}} coordinated activity in ACC networks, we also examined the microstructural integrity of the white matter (WM) underlying this brain region using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) in 12 control and 12 adult ASD participants. ACC activation and FA were examined in relation to Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ratings of restricted and repetitive behaviour. Relative to controls, ASD participants: (i) made more antisaccade errors and responded more quickly on correct trials; (ii) showed reduced discrimination between error and correct responses in rostral ACC (rACC), which was primarily due to (iii) abnormally increased activation on correct trials and (iv) showed reduced FA in WM underlying ACC. Finally, in ASD (v) increased activation on correct trials and reduced FA in rACC WM were related to higher ratings of repetitive behaviour. These findings demonstrate functional and structural abnormalities of the ACC in ASD that may contribute to repetitive behaviour. rACC activity following errors is thought to reflect affective appraisal of the error. Thus, the hyperactive rACC response to correct trials can be interpreted as a misleading affective signal that something is awry, which may trigger repetitive attempts at correction. Another possible consequence of reduced affective discrimination between error and correct responses is that it might interfere with the reinforcement of responses that optimize outcomes. Furthermore, dysconnection of the ACC, as suggested by reduced FA, to regions involved in behavioural control might impair on-line modulations of response speed to optimize performance (i. e. speed-accuracy trade-off) and increase error likelihood. These findings suggest that in ASD, structural and functional abnormalities of the ACC compromise response monitoring and thereby contribute to behaviour that is rigid and repetitive rather than flexible and responsive to <b>contingencies.</b> Illuminating the <b>mechanisms</b> and clinical significance of abnormal response monitoring in ASD represents a fruitful avenue for further research.
