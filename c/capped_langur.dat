The park {{is also the}} National Studbook Keeper for the endangered lion-tailed macaque, nominated by the CZA.

25|$|Nameri National Park - Nameri National Park is in {{the foothills}} of the Eastern Himalayas in the Sonitpur District of Assam. This is {{excellent}} elephant country and was considered to be an elephant reserve. It is an ideal habitat for a host of other animals including the tiger, leopard, sambar, dhole (the Asiatic wild dog), pygmy hog, muntjac, gaur, wild boar, sloth bear, Himalayan black bear, <b>capped</b> <b>langur</b> and Indian giant squirrel.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Trachypithecus should be considered only a subgenus of Semnopithecus. If maintaining the two as separate monophyletic genera, the purple-faced langur and Nilgiri langur belong in Semnopithecus instead of the usual Trachypithecus. At present it is unclear where the T. pileatus species group (consisting of the <b>capped</b> <b>langur,</b> Shortridge's langur and Gee's golden langur) belongs, as available mtDNA data place it in Semnopithecus, while Y chromosome data place it in Trachypithecus.|$|E
50|$|The fauna of the {{sanctuary}} include Indian elephants, Indian rhinoceros, gaurs, Asian water buffaloes, barasingha, Indian tigers, Indian leopards, clouded leopards, Asian golden cats, dholes, <b>capped</b> <b>langurs,</b> golden langurs, Assamese macaques, slow loris, hoolock gibbons, smooth-coated otters, sloth bears, barking deers, hog deers, black panthers, sambar deers and chitals.|$|R
25|$|The {{endangered}} species that {{live within the}} Sundarbans and extinct species {{that used to be}} include the royal Bengal tigers, estuarine crocodile, northern river terrapins (Batagur baska), olive ridley sea turtles, Gangetic dolphin, ground turtles, hawksbill sea turtles and king crabs (horse shoe). Some species such as hog deer (Axis porcinus), water buffalos (Bubalus bubalis), barasingha or swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli), Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), single horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and the mugger crocodiles or marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) started to become extinct in the Sundarbans towards the middle of the 20th century, because of extensive poaching and man hunting by the British. There are other threatened mammal species, such as the <b>capped</b> <b>langurs</b> (Semnopithecus pileatus), smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata), Oriental small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea), and great Bengal civets (Viverra zibetha).|$|R
50|$|The park {{is managed}} under several {{conservation}} management units {{such as the}} Core Zone, the Buffer Zone, and the Economic Zone. The park {{is known for its}} rare and endangered endemic wildlife such as the tigers, elephants, Assam roofed turtle, hispid hare, golden and <b>capped</b> <b>langurs</b> and pygmy hog, one-horned rhinoceros, Asiatic buffalo, swamp deer, barking deers, leopards, clouded leopards, marbled cats, sloth bears, hoolock gibbons, wild boar, gharials, crocodiles, and river dolphins. Reptiles consist of pythons, common Indian crocodile, common wolf snake, cat snake and many other species. Birds listed include hornbills, common crane, common redshank, Eurasian woodcock, spotted eagles, black-throated diver, little grebe, different types of herons, black ibis, Eurasian sparrowhawk, spot-bellied eagle-owl and several others. The park is home for 22 endangered mammal species. Fish species identified are: katli, jurraha, chenga, telliah, labeo and mahaseer. Conservation measures have been undertaken to prevent poaching, overfishing, encroachments, and many other related issues. These measures are meant to minimise human interference in the fragile core zone, creation of a data base and carry out research on animal and plant populations for better conservation of the ecosystem.|$|R
25|$|The Chital {{deer are}} widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include the black giant squirrel, <b>capped</b> <b>langur,</b> Bengal fox, sambar deer, jungle cat, king cobra, wild boar, mongooses, pangolins, pythons and water monitors. Bangladesh {{has one of}} the largest {{population}} of Irrawaddy dolphins and Ganges dolphins. A 2009 census found 6,000 Irrawaddy dolphins inhabiting the littoral rivers of Bangladesh. The country has numerous species of amphibians (53), reptiles (139), marine reptiles (19) and marine mammals (5). It also has 628 species of birds.|$|E
25|$|Assam has {{wildlife}} sanctuaries, {{the most}} prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage sites-the Kaziranga National Park, {{on the bank of the}} Brahmaputra River, and the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, near the border with Bhutan. The Kaziranga is a refuge for the fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The state is the last refuge for numerous other endangered and threatened species including the white-winged wood duck or deohanh, Bengal florican, black-breasted parrotbill, red-headed vulture, white-rumped vulture, greater adjutant, Jerdon's babbler, rufous-necked hornbill, Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, pygmy hog, gaur, wild water buffalo, Indian hog deer, hoolock gibbon, golden langur, <b>capped</b> <b>langur,</b> barasingha, Ganges river dolphin, Barca snakehead, Ganges shark, Burmese python, brahminy river turtle, black pond turtle, Asian forest tortoise, and Assam roofed turtle. Threatened species that are extinct in Assam include the gharial, a critically endangered fish-eating crocodilian, and the pink-headed duck (which may be extinct worldwide). For the state bird, the white-winged wood duck, Assam is a globally important area. In addition to the above, there are three other National Parks in Assam namely Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park and the Orang National Park.|$|E

50|$|François' langur {{is found}} only in {{southwest}} China and northern Vietnam. The range of the white-headed langur is much smaller—only in southern Guangxi and Cát Bà Island in Vietnam. Phayre's leaf monkey is native to Yunnan and a larger swath of Indochina. The <b>capped</b> and Shortridge's <b>langurs</b> live along the Yunnan-Myanmar border.

50|$|It houses Bangladesh's richest {{wildlife}} resource after Sunderbans.

40|$|Numerous morphology-based {{classification}} schemes {{have been}} proposed for langurs and leaf monkeys of South Asia but {{there is very little}} agreement between them. An incorrect classification scheme when used as a basis for biogeographic studies can support erroneous hypotheses. Further, lack of taxonomic resolution will also confound conservation efforts, given that conservation biologists use traditional morphology-based-classification schemes to prioritize species for conservation. Here, I have revisited recent molecular phylogenetic studies done on langurs and leaf monkeys of South Asia. Results from these studies are in turn used to derive a rational and scientific basis for prioritizing species for conservation. Molecular data support the classification of langurs of the Indian subcontinent-Hanuman, Nilgiri and purple-faced langurs-in the genus Semnopithecus, whereas Phayre's leaf monkey along with other Southeast Asian leaf monkeys form another distinct clade (Trachypithecus). The phylogenetic position of <b>capped</b> and golden <b>langurs</b> remains unresolved. Molecular data suggest that they are closely related to each other but this group might have evolved through past hybridization between Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus. Additionally, genetic data also support the splitting of the so-called Hanuman langurs into at least three species. The scores for taxonomic uniqueness of langurs and leaf monkeys of South Asia were revised using this molecular phylogeny-based classification. According to the revised scores, Phayres leaf monkey and golden langur are priority species for conservation followed by <b>capped</b> and Nilgiri <b>langurs...</b>|$|R
