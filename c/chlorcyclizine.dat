5000|$|<b>Chlorcyclizine</b> (Di-Paralene, Mantadil, Pruresidine, Trihistan) is a first-generation {{antihistamine}} of the phenylpiperazine class marketed in the United States {{and certain}} other countries. It is used primarily to treat allergy {{symptoms such as}} rhinitis, urticaria, and pruritus, and may {{also be used as}} an antiemetic. In addition to its antihistamine effects, <b>chlorcyclizine</b> also has some anticholinergic, antiserotonergic, and local anesthetic properties. [...] It also has been studied as a potential treatment for hepatitis C.|$|E
40|$|Sensitization to the cardio-accelerator {{action of}} {{adrenaline}} and noradrenaline by five antihistamines was examined on the acutely denervated {{heart of the}} cat. Antazoline (Antistin), <b>chlorcyclizine</b> and promethazine (Phenergan) increased the cardio-accelerator responses to both amines equally. Mepyramine (Anthisan) increased noradrenaline more than adrenaline action. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) resembled cocaine in potentiating the responses to noradrenaline but not to adrenaline...|$|E

The recorded isotherms evidenced {{the existence of a}} stable monolayer undergoing a lengthy rearrangement. SERT/ligand interactions appeared to be dependent {{on the nature of the}} studied molecules. Whereas an unrelated drug (<b>chlorcyclizine)</b> did not bind to the spread SERT, it interacted with its specific ligands. Compared to heterocyclic drugs, for which binding appeared to be concentration-dependent, a ‘two-site’ mechanism was evidenced for pinoline and imipramine...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effects of H 1 -antihistamines of the 1 st generation (antazoline, bromadryl, brompheniramine, dithiaden, cyclizine, <b>chlorcyclizine,</b> chlorpheniramine, clemastine) and the 2 nd generation (acrivastine, ketotifen, and loratadine) on the respiratory burst of phagocytes. Reactive oxygen species generation in neutrophils isolated from rat blood was measured using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Changes in nitrite formation and iNOS protein expression by RAW 264. 7 macrophages were analysed using Griess reaction and Western blotting. The antioxidative properties of drugs in cell-free systems were detected spectrophotometrically, luminometrically, fluorimetrically, and amperometrically. The majority of the H 1 -antihistamines tested (bromadryl, brompheniramine, <b>chlorcyclizine,</b> chlorpheniramine, clemastine, dithiaden, and ketotifen) exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the chemiluminescence activity of phagocytes. H 1 -antihistamines did not show significant scavenging properties against superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical, thus this could not contribute to the inhibition of chemiluminescence. H 1 -antihistamines had a different ability to modulate nitric oxide production by LPS-stimulated macrophages. Bromadryl, clemastine, and dithiaden were the most effective since they inhibited iNOS expression, which was followed by a significant reduction in nitrite levels. H 1 -antihistamines had no scavenging activity against nitric oxide. It can be concluded that the effects observed in the H 1 -antihistamines tested are not mediated exclusively via H 1 -receptor pathway or by direct antioxidative properties. Based on our results, antihistamines not interfering with the microbicidal mechanisms of leukocytes (antazoline, acrivastine and cyclizine) could be used preferentially in infections. Other antihistamines should be used, under pathological conditions accompanied by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species...|$|E

The anticonvulsant effects of four benzhydryl piperazines, SC- 1 3504 (ropizine, an anticonvulsant), hydroxyzine (HDX, an anxiolytic), <b>chlorcyclizine</b> (CCZ, an antihistaminic) and bucli-zine (BUC, an antihistaminic), were investigated utilizing a modified maximal electroshock seizure test in rats. In addition to detecting {{the presence or}} absence of tonic hindlimb exten-sion, the modified method quantified various phases of the seizure.

40|$|Pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital, barbital, phenylbutazone, {{orphenadrine}} or amino-pyrine shortens {{the duration}} of hexobarbital hypnosis by increasing {{the activity of the}} enzyme system in liver microsomes that metabolizes hexobarbital (Conney et at., 1960). Recently, Thompson et at. (1959) found that pretreatment of rats with the antihistaminic drug, chlor-cyclizine, shortens {{the duration of}} action of a subsequent dose of pentobarbital by an unknown mechanism. This observation {{can be explained by the}} results presented here. Liver microsomes from chlorcyclizine-pretreated rats metabolize pentobarbital more rapidly than liver micro-somes from control rats. it is further shown that <b>chlorcyclizine</b> administration stimulates the activity of liver microsomal enzymes that meta-bolize hexobarbital, zoxazolamine and 3 -methyl- 4 - monomethvlaminoazobenzene (3 - methyl-MAB).

40|$|Intradermal {{injection}} of synthetic substance P (10 - 7 – 10 - 5 M) in humans produced flare, wheal and itching. These responses were inhibited by oral pretreatment {{of the subjects}} with an antihistaminic drug (<b>chlorcyclizine)</b> or by local pretreatment with Compound 48 / 80 administered to deplete the local stores of mast-cell bound histamine. The findings indicate that the responses induced by substance P were mainly mediated by histamine released from the dermal mast cells. In contrast to previously studied histamine liberators, substance P was less potent when acting on rat mast cells in vitro than on human skin mast cells in vivo. When incubated with rat peritoneal mast cells, about 100 times higher concentrations (10 - 5 M) were required to induce histamine release than in the in vivo studies on humans. It was concluded that substance P is a potent histamine liberator in human skin...|$|E

Biliary {{flow and}} wet liver weight were {{determined}} in rats after treatment with various microsomal enzyme inducers for one, two, three, five or seven days. Phenobarbital (PB) {{was the only}} agent which produced {{a significant increase in}} biliary flow (control vs. treated: 60 vs. 90 Ll/min/kg). With chlordane, nikethamide, phenylbutazone and <b>chlorcyclizine</b> treatment, there was a tendency in the direction of an increase in biiary flow (60 vs. approximately 75 d/min/kg), but the increases were not statistically significant. Biiary flow was not altered in rats pretreated with 3, 4 -benzpyrene and 3 -methylcholanthrene. Significant increases in drug-metabolizing activity were demonstrated by a decrease in zoxazolamine paralysis time with PB, 3 -methylcholanthrene, 3, 4 -benzpyrene and chlordane, but only PB significantly enhanced biiary flow. Therefore, microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme induction itself does not result in an increase in biliary flow. Livers from the PB- and 3 -methylcholanthrene-treated rats exhibited the greatest increase in wet weight followed by 3, 4 -benzpyrene, nikethamid...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of chlorcyclizine- “C was studied by whole-body autoradiography in preg-nant AJJAX mice at 12. 5 and 17. 5 days of gestation. In the mice at 12. 5 days of gestation studied 3. 9. and 24 hr after injection, {{the amount of}} radioactivity in the embryos was much less than that in most maternal tissues. Only embryonic central nervous system has a dis-cernible concentration of radioactivity. The concentration of radioactivity is low in maternal blood, but high in maternal liver, bile, intestinal contents, salivary gland. Harder’s gland, lung. kidney, bone marrow, follicular walls, corpora lutea, and adrenal cortex. The yolk sac. decidua basalis, endometrium, and uterine lumen contain {{a high concentration of}} radioactivity. In the mice at 17. 5 days of gestation. the same pattern of {{distribution of}} radioactivity is seen in maternal tissues, yolk sac, and uterine lumen as that seen at 12. 5 days. However, fetal tis-sues in late gestation have a higher concentration than in mid-gestation and the pattern of distribution is more nearly similar to that in maternal tissues. Secretion of <b>chlorcyclizine</b> or its metabolites by the fetal yolk sac is a possible explanation for the lower concentration of drug in the embryo and fetus than in the mother at all time intervals after injection.

Therap. 159 : 362 - 371, 1968. Treatment of immature female rats with phenobarbital for 4 days stimulates the activity of liver microsomal enzymes that metabolize estradiol- 17 p and estrone, inhibits the estradiol- or estrone-induced increases in uterine wet weight and decreases the amount of tritiated estrogen found in the uterus after an injection of tritiated estradiol or estrone. Treatment of rats with as little as 1 mg of phenobarbital per kg twice daily for 4 days causes a 37 % inhibition in the uterotropic action of a 02 -sg injection of tritiated estrone, and the concentration of radioactive steroid in the uterus is decreased. The metabolism of estradiol by liver microsomes in vitro is enhanced when the microsomes are harvested from animals pretreated with several unrelated microsomal enzyme inducers such as phenobarbital, chlordane, orphenadrine, <b>chlorcyclizine,</b> norchlor-cyclizine and phenylbutazone. Pretreatment of rats with these chemicals also inhibits the action of estradiol on the uterus and decreases the concentration of estradiol in this organ. Treatment of animals with many commonly used drugs, insecticides and other foreign chem-icals increases the levels of liver microsomal enzymes that hydroxylate androgens, estrogens, corticoids and progestational steroids (Conne...|$|E
40|$|Current {{compendial}} {{methods of}} assay {{for the analysis}} of cyclizine tablets involve the use of UV spectrophotometry. Since this is a non-selective technique its application to more complex dosage forms, such as suppositories, is unlikely to be appropriate. There is therefore a need {{for the development of a}} highly specific quantitative analytical method, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or capillary electrophoresis (CE). The latter technique was chosen in view of some specific advantages over HPLC, such as the use of relatively non-toxic aqueous buffers, as opposed to organic solvents, which obviates the use of expensive HPLC grade solvents making CE more cost effective. Cyclizine was analyzed in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2. 3) and run at an applied voltage 25 kV. Detection sensitivity was enhanced by using a wavelength of 200 nm and samples were loaded hydrodynamically onto an uncoated fused-silica capillary (60 cm× 50 mm i. d.). <b>Chlorcyclizine</b> was used as the internal standard and resolution of both compounds was achieved in less than 7 min. Stress testing was undertaken in order to investigate the appearance of breakdown products. The method has the requisite accuracy, selectivity, sensitivity and precision to assay cyclizine in tablets and suppositories. Degradation products resulting from the stress studies did not interfere with the detection of cyclizine and the assay is thus stability-indicating...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} of mesenchymal cells to the basal lamina underlying {{regions of the}} palatal-shelf epithelium that are known to increase in cell density during shelf reorientation are quantitatively {{different from those of}} cells underlying neighboring regions that do not increase in cell density. Chlorcyclizine-induced alterations of the extracellular matrix were used to investigate the possible contribution of extracellular matrix to these differences. <b>Chlorcyclizine</b> causes hyaluronate and the chondroitin sulfates to be degraded into pieces with smaller molecular weights and lower charge densities, with little or no effect on their synthesis, and also results in cleft palate. Pregnant CD- 1 mice were gavaged with chlorcylizine on days 10. 5, 11. 5, and 12. 5 of gestation, and the fetuses were harvested on day 13. 5. Some palatal shelves were excised immediately and fixed for electron microscopy; other heads were partially dissected and incubated for 4 hr prior to fixation. In normal heads differences in mesenchymal cell configurations are detectable after 4 hr in vitro. Electron micrographs were taken of the epithelial-mesenchymal interface in nasal and oral regions that increased in epithelial cell density and in nasal and oral regions which did not. Several variables of mesenchymal cell configuration were measured in a 500 -nm-wide zone delimited on photographic prints. Chlorcyclizine-induced glycosaminoglycan alterations resulted in quantifiable, region-specific differences in mesenchymal cell relationships to the basal lamina and in the ultrastructural appearance of the zone immediately subjacent to the basal lamina. These results suggest that the epithelial-mesenchymal interface and sublaminar zone of the nasal and oral regions as well as their active and inactive segments may be constitutively different...|$|E
30|$|Using a {{chemical}} biology strategy, we {{have demonstrated that}} 5 -HT 2 AR is a HCV entry factor that functions in the late endocytosis stage at or before membrane fusion. To our best knowledge, {{this is the first}} time to dissect the role of a GPCR in HCV lifecycle. Notably, CLDN- 1 is a HCV entry factor and confers HCVcc and HCVpp entry. CLDN 1 does not directly interact with HCV glycoproteins and contributes to the post-binding steps of HCV entry by interacting with CD 81 (Evans et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2010; Lindenbach and Rice, 2013). Because 5 -HT 2 AR plays a role in the correct plasma membrane localization of CLDN- 1 for HCV entry, the impacts to HCVcc and HCVpp, no influence on HCV attachment, and function in HCV late endocytosis of PBZ treatment and 5 -HT 2 AR silencing are well fit with reported observations of CLDN 1 in HCV lifecycle. Recently, another GPCR antagonist <b>chlorcyclizine</b> (CCZ), a first-generation of H 1 -antihistamines, was reported to potently inhibit late-stage HCVcc entry, while its action mode is yet clear (He et al., 2015). A significant discrepancy on anti-HCV activity of 5 -HT 2 AR antagonist and antihistamines is that PBZ inhibits both HCVcc and HCVpp, but CCZ exhibits no inhibitory effect on HCVpp (He et al., 2015). The dual-inhibition on HCVcc and HCVpp of PBZ is consistent with the crucial role of CLDN 1 in HCV entry, and the precise working mode of antihistamines on HCV is warranted further investigation. Lastly, though in vivo synergistic anti-HCV activity remains to be determined, the strong synergistic effect of of PBZ in the combination with currently used anti-HCV drugs will probably provide a great potential for the optimal anti-HCV therapy.|$|E
