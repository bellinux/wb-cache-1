40|$|Silicon {{nanowires}} {{are prepared}} by the method of the two step metal assisted wet chemical etching. We analyzed the structure of solid, rough, and porous nanowire surfaces of boron doped silicon substrates with resistivities of rho gt; 1000 Ohm cm, rho 14 23 Ohm cm, and rho lt; 0. 01 Ohm cm by scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen gas adsorption. Silicon nanowires prepared fromhighly doped silicon reveal mesopores on their surface. However, we found a limit for pore formation. Pores were only formed by etching below a critical H 2 O 2 concentration c[H 2 O 2] lt; 0. 3 M. Furthermore, we determined the pore size distribution dependent on the etching parameters and characterized the morphology of the pores on the nanowire surface. The pores are in the regime of small mesopores with a mean diameter of 9 13 nm. Crystal and surface structure of individual mesoporous nanowires were investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The vibrational properties of nanowire ensembles were investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Heavily borondoped silicon nanowires are highly porous and the remaining single <b>crystalline</b> silicon nanoscale <b>mesh</b> leads to a redshift and a strong asymmetric line broadening for Raman scattering by optical phonons at 520 cm 1. This redshift, lambda[Si bulk] 520 cm 1 gt; lambda[Si nanowire] 512 cm 1, hints to a phonon confinement in mesoporous single crystalline silicon nanowire...|$|R
40|$|Shock {{initiated}} {{chemical reaction}} experiments {{have been performed}} on a 1 : 1 atomic ratio mixture of 20 - to 45 -µm nickel and – 325 <b>mesh</b> <b>crystalline</b> silicon powders. It has been observed that no detectable or only minor surface reactions occur between the constituents until a thermal energy threshold is reached, above which the reaction goes to completion. The experiments show the energy difference between virtually no and full reaction is {{on the order of}} 5 percent. Differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) of statically pressed powders shows an exothermic reaction beginning at a temperature which decreases with decreasing porosity. Powder, shock compressed to just below the threshold energy, starts to react in the DSC at 621 °C while powder statically pressed to 23 % porosity starts to react at about 30 °C higher. Tap density powder starts to react at 891 °C. The DSC reaction initiation temperature of the shock compressed but unreacted powder corresponds to a thermal energy in the powder of 382 J/g which agrees well with the thermal energy produced by a shock wave with the threshold energy (between 384 and 396 J/g). (Thermal energies referenced to 20 °C.) A sharp energy threshold and a direct correlation with DSC results indicates that the mean thermal energy determines whether or not the reaction will propagate in the elemental Ni+Si powder mixture rather than local, particle level conditions. From this it may be concluded that the reaction occurs on a time scale greater than the time constant for thermal diffusion into the particle interiors...|$|R
