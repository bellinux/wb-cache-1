It uses a so-called Mills Cross array <b>configuration,</b> <b>installed</b> underneath a survey ship, transmitting a beam wide perpendicular to the ship’s moving direction (across-track) and narrow parallel to the ship’s moving direction (along-track) and forming multiple receiving beams narrow across-track and relatively wide along-track[1]. Hence, a strip of bottom points’ across-track is obtained from one transmission. One major problem with such a system is that the footprint spreads wider as the beam is steered away from the broadside direction; this, added with weakened bottom scattering strength at small grazing angles, causes serious degradation in resolution.|$|E

Fast luminosity monitoring is required for luminosity feedback and optimisation in presence of dynamic imperfections. The aimed relative precision is about 10 - 3 in 1 ms, which can be in principle achieved thanks to the very large cross-section of the radiative Bhabha process at zero degree scattering angle.

The sealed system includes accommodations for two flight-design habitat modules, which can be deployed in either a rotational or a non-rotational <b>configuration.</b> <b>Installed</b> within the apparatus are scaled-down versions of a subset of flight-equivalent atmospheric reconditioning subassemblies together with sensors, actuators and a computer to perform autonomous feedback-driven supervisory control.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{circulation}} control to deflect turbofan engine thrust beyond 90 deg. has been proven in full-scale static ground tests of the circulation-control-wing/upper-surface-blowing (CCW/USB) concept. This powered high-lift system employs a circular, blown trailing edge to replace the USB mechanical flaps to entrain engine-exhaust flow, and to obtain both a vertical-thrust component and an augmented circulation lift for short takeoff and landing (STOL) applications. Previous tests (Phase 1), done in 1982, of a basic <b>configuration</b> <b>installed</b> on the Quiet Short Haul Research Aircraft confirmed these CCW/USB systems capabilities. A second phase (Phase 2) of full-scale, static, thrust-deflection investigations has reconfirmed the ability to deflect engine thrust from 40 to 102 deg., depending on thrust level. Five new configurations were evaluated and performance improvements noted for those configurations with larger blown span, fences or favorable engine interactions, smaller slot height, and larger radii with less than 180 deg. of CCW surface arc. In general, a 90 deg. circular arc with a smaller slot height provided the best performance, demonstrating that adequate thrust turning can be produced by a trailing-edge shape which may have minimal cruise-performance penalty. Thrust deflections were achieved at considerably lower blowing momentum than was required for the baseline case of Phase 1. Improved performance and versatility were thus confirmed for the CCW/USB system applied to STOL aircraft, where the potential for developing a non-moving-parts pneumatic thrust deflector to rapidly vary horizontal force from thrust to drag, while maintaining constant vertical force, appears quite promising. The conversion from high-lift to lower-drag cruise mode by merely terminating the blowing provides an effective STOL aircraft system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{investigation of the}} flow in an aggressive inter-turbine duct (AITD). The goal {{is to improve the}} understanding of the flow mechanisms within the AITD and of the underlying physics of lowprofile vortex generators (LPVGs). The flow structures in the AITD are dominated by counter-rotating vortices and boundary layer separations in both the casing and hub regions. At the first bend of the AITD, the casing boundary layer separates in a 3 D mode because of the upstream wakes; this is followed by a massive 2 D boundary layer separation. Due to the effect of the radial pressure gradient at the first bend, the streamwise vorticity generated by the casing 3 D separation stays close to the casing endwall, and later mixes with the casing counter-rotating vortices formed at the second bend. By using LPVGs with different <b>configurations</b> <b>installed</b> on the casing, the casing boundary layer separation is significantly reduced. The streamwise vortices generated by the LPVGs have the potential to generate another pair of counter-rotating vortices at the AITD second bend, which help to delay/prevent the boundary layer separation. Therefore, the total pressure loss in the AITD was significantly reduced. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
