5|$|The {{king vulture}} (Sarcoramphus papa) {{is a large}} bird found in Central and South America. It {{is a member of}} the New World vulture family <b>Cathartidae.</b> This vulture lives {{predominantly}} in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. It is the only surviving member of the genus Sarcoramphus, although fossil members are known.|$|E
5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} (Cathartes aura), also known in some North American regions as the turkey buzzard (or just buzzard), {{and in some}} areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow, is the most {{widespread}} of the New World vultures. One of three species in the genus Cathartes of the family <b>Cathartidae,</b> the turkey vulture ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. It inhabits a variety of open and semi-open areas, including subtropical forests, shrublands, pastures, and deserts.|$|E
25|$|In 1779 English {{illustrator}} John Frederick Miller was {{the first}} European to describe the secretarybird, and it was soon after assigned to its own genus Sagittarius by French naturalist Johann Hermann in his Tabula Affinitatum Animalium. It was not until 1935 that the species was moved to its own family, distinct from all other birds of prey—a classification confirmed by molecular systematics. Recent cladistic analysis has shown Sagittariidae to be an older branch of the {{diurnal birds of prey}} than Accipitridae and Falconidae, but a younger divergence than <b>Cathartidae.</b> Sometimes, the enigmatic bird Eremopezus is classified as an early relative of the secretarybird, though this is uncertain as the bird is only known from a few fragmentary body parts such as the legs. The earliest fossils associated with the family are two species from the genus Pelargopappus. The two species, from the Oligocene and Miocene respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family. In spite of their age, it is not thought that the two species are ancestral to the secretary bird.|$|E
500|$|The Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) is a South American {{bird in the}} New World vulture family <b>Cathartidae</b> and is {{the only}} member of the genus Vultur.

500|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture (Cathartes melambrotus), {{also known}} as the forest vulture, is a species of bird in the New World vulture family <b>Cathartidae.</b> It was {{considered}} to be the same species as the lesser yellow-headed vulture until they were split in 1964. It is found in South America in tropical moist lowland forests. It is a fairly large bird, with a wingspan of , a weight of [...] and a body length of [...] The body plumage is black, and the head and neck, which are featherless, range in color from deep yellow to pale orange. It lacks a syrinx, and its vocalizations are therefore limited to grunts or low hisses.|$|E

It is found in Mexico, Central America, and South America in seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, swamps, and heavily degraded former forest. It is a large bird, with a wingspan of [...] The body plumage is black, and the head and neck, which are featherless, are pale orange with red or blue areas. It lacks a syrinx, so therefore its vocalizations are limited to grunts or low hisses.|$|E
500|$|The {{black vulture}} (Coragyps atratus), {{also known as}} the American black vulture, is a bird in the New World vulture family whose range extends from the southeastern United States to Central Chile and Uruguay in South America. Although a common and {{widespread}} species, it has a somewhat more restricted distribution than its compatriot, the turkey vulture, which breeds well into Canada and south to Tierra del Fuego. [...] It is the only extant member of the genus Coragyps, which is in the family <b>Cathartidae.</b> Despite the similar name and appearance, this species is unrelated to the Eurasian black vulture, an Old World vulture in the family Accipitridae (which includes eagles, hawks, kites and harriers). It inhabits relatively open areas which provide scattered forests or shrublands. With a wingspan of , the black vulture is a large bird though relatively small for a vulture. It has black plumage, a featherless, grayish-black head and neck, and a short, hooked beak.|$|E
500|$|The {{turkey vulture}} {{received}} its common {{name from the}} resemblance of the adult's bald red head and its dark plumage {{to that of the}} male wild turkey, while the name [...] "vulture" [...] is derived from the Latin word vulturus, meaning [...] "tearer", and is a reference to its feeding habits. The word buzzard is used by North Americans to refer to this bird, yet in the Old World that term refers to members of the genus Buteo. The generic term Cathartes means [...] "purifier" [...] and is the Latinized form from the Greek kathartēs/καθαρτης. The turkey vulture was first formally described by Linnaeus as Vultur aura in his Systema Naturae in 1758, and characterised as V. fuscogriseus, remigibus nigris, rostro albo ("brown-gray vulture, with black wings and a white beak"). It {{is a member of the}} family <b>Cathartidae,</b> along with the other six species of New World vultures, and included in the genus Cathartes, along with the greater yellow-headed vulture and the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Like other New World vultures, the turkey vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.|$|E

5000|$|While it {{was unclear}} to which order the New World {{vultures}} (family <b>Cathartidae)</b> should be assigned, they were placed in Aves incertae sedis. It was later agreed to {{place them in a}} separate order, Cathartiformes.|$|E
5000|$|Vultures are carrion-eating raptors of two {{distinct}} biological families: the Accipitridae, which only {{occurs in the}} Eastern Hemisphere; and the <b>Cathartidae,</b> which only occurs in the Western Hemisphere. Members of both groups have heads either partly or fully devoid of feathers.|$|E
5000|$|First, {{multiple}} {{lines of}} evidence in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that the New World vultures <b>Cathartidae</b> were closer related to storks and herons (Ciconiiformes), though more recent place them outside that group as well. Consequently, New World vultures are now often raised {{to the rank of}} an independent order Cathartiformes not closely associated with either birds of prey or storks or herons. In 2007, the American Ornithologists' Union's North American checklist moved <b>Cathartidae</b> back into the lead position in Falconiformes, but with an asterisk that indicates it is a taxon [...] "that is probably misplaced in the current phylogenetic listing but for which data indicating proper placement are not yet available".|$|E

[...] The AOU's draft South American checklist places the <b>Cathartidae</b> in their own order, Cathartiformes.

5000|$|The New World {{vultures}} comprise seven {{species in}} five genera. The genera are Coragyps, Cathartes, Gymnogyps, Sarcoramphus, and Vultur. Of these, only Cathartes is not monotypic. The family's scientific name, <b>Cathartidae,</b> comes from cathartes, Greek for [...] "purifier". Although New World vultures have many resemblances to Old World vultures {{they are not}} very closely related. Rather, they resemble Old World vultures because of convergent evolution. [...] Phylogenetic analyses including all <b>Cathartidae</b> species found two primary clades: (1) Black Vulture (Coragyps atratus) together with the three Cathartes species (Lesser C. burrovianus and Greater C. melambrotus Yellow-headed Vultures, and Turkey Vulture C. aura), and (2) King Vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), California (Gymnogyps californianus) and Andean (Vultur gryphus) Condors.|$|E
50|$|These {{families}} were traditionally grouped {{together in a}} single order Falconiformes but are now split into two orders, the Falconiformes and Accipitriformes. The <b>Cathartidae</b> are sometimes placed separately in an enlarged stork family, Ciconiiformes, and may be raised to an order of their own, Cathartiiformes.|$|E
50|$|Condors {{are part}} of the family <b>Cathartidae,</b> whereas the 15 species of Old World {{vultures}} are in the family Accipitridae, that also includes hawks, eagles, and kites. The New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors. However, they both are carrion-eaters and have distinctive bare heads.|$|E
50|$|This bird is an Old World vulture, {{and is only}} distantly {{related to}} the New World vultures, which are in a {{separate}} family, <b>Cathartidae,</b> of the same order.

50|$|The Accipitridae, one of {{the four}} {{families}} within the order Accipitriformes (the others being <b>Cathartidae,</b> Pandionidae and Sagittariidae), are a family of small to large birds with strongly hooked bills and variable morphology based on diet. They feed on a range of prey items from insects to medium-sized mammals, with a number feeding on carrion and a few feeding on fruit. The Accipitridae have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found on all the world's continents (except Antarctica) and a number of oceanic island groups. Some species are migratory.|$|E
50|$|In {{agreement}} with the split of Falconiformes and Accipitriformes, comparative genome analysis published in 2008 suggested that falcons are {{more closely related to}} the parrots and passerines than to other birds including the Accipitridae, so that the traditional Falconiformes are paraphyletic even if the <b>Cathartidae</b> are excluded. Indeed, a 2011 analysis of transposable element insertions shared between the genomes of falcons, passerines, and parrots, but not present in the genomes of other birds, confirmed that falcons are a sister group of the combined parrot/passerine group, together forming the clade Eufalconimorphae.|$|E
