500|$|The Statute of Anne is {{traditionally}} seen as [...] "a historic {{moment in the}} development of copyright", and the first statute in the world to provide for copyright. Craig Joyce and Lyman Ray Patterson, writing in the Emory Law Journal, <b>call</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> [...] "too simple understanding [...] ignores the statute's source", arguing that it is at best a derivative of the Licensing Act. Even considering this, however, the Statute of Anne was [...] "the watershed event in Anglo-American copyright history... transforming what had been the publishers' private law copyright into a public law grant". Patterson, writing separately, does note the differences between the Licensing Act and the Statute of Anne; the question of censorship was, by 1710, out of the question, and in that regard the Statute is distinct, not providing for censorship.|$|E

500|$|While Carle Place was {{complaining}} about the inability to access their section of town, a January 1990 article in The New York Times mentioned that the Court's decision put Westbury alone against the state, then-Governor Mario Cuomo and regional planners, who were worried {{about the safety of}} the roughly 140,000 drivers who used the interchange daily. Local business leaders claimed that Westbury was being selfish in opposing inconvenient construction. Even after the ruling, Strada continued to claim that they wanted to be informed on the impacts of a nearby widening project on the Northern State. NYSDOT officials worried that this would add more bureaucratic levels to getting approval for local road projects and that it could set the project back three years. Officials also {{went out of their way}} to <b>call</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> simple [...] "not in my backyard" [...] case. NYSDOT continued to claim that the projects were separate, and filed three years apart, despite the court's ruling that they were similar projects. Cuomo, worried about the safety of drivers, invited Strada to come to Albany to meet with NYSDOT Commissioner Franklin White and State Senator Norman J. Levy to make an agreement. Strada, however, felt that in order to compromise, they would have to continue the original [...] "violation" [...] of not giving a report.|$|E

50|$|InterSwitch Trunk (IST) is {{one or more}} {{parallel}} point-to-point links (Link aggregation) {{that connect}} two switches {{together to create a}} single logical switch.
