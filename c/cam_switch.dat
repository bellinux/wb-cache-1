5000|$|Friedrich Natalis (1864-1935), who {{had been}} working for the Schuckert-Werke (later Siemens-Schuckertwerke) since 1897, had already {{developed}} the cam-switching principle in Germany before 1900. In 1895, however, Johann Sigmund Schuckert founder of the electrical engineering company Schuckert & Co supplied cam switches with cam rollers and spring-loaded individual switches (DRP 88586). Thus the term <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> has been used for such and similar devices over the years. Schuckert also supplied the [...] "carbon control switch" [...] designed by Natalis since 1901 with copper-carbon switching devices with spark-blowers (common spark blowers for direct current or single-spark blowers for direct and alternating current). The main current <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> retained some significance, even when the rifle control pushed it where it was more economical. In miniature machine construction, the <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> probably did not appear until the early 1930s. In 1931 the American company General Electric GE released their switch SBl, a 20A auxiliary current control switch, basically a miniaturized image of the large main current control switches. The devices had simple interruption and silver crossover, in some cases they were equipped with a snap mechanism. in Europe around 1940, the first <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> from Ghielmetti, Solothurn / Switzerland, began to replace conventional roller switches. Switches could also be supplied as auxiliary current control switches with corresponding circuits. They were marketed under the trade name Ghielmetti-Clavier. In September 1948, Kraus & Naimer(of Vienna) produced C15(15 A), the first company-owned <b>cam</b> <b>switch.</b> In 1949, the company also presented the world's first cam-designed <b>cam</b> <b>switch.</b> At the beginning of 1950, Kraus & Naimer cam switches C30 (30A) were followed with the same design. The Kraus & Naimer cam switches C16 to C200, which came into the market in the spring of 1951, had a decisive influence on the advancement of the <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> and the introduction of the roller switch in electrical engineering. They had a double interruption and a motor switching capacity appropriate to the rated current. The large number of possible combinations and the extensive additional equipment as characteristic features were responsible for the later development of cam switches as an industrial standard. Kraus & Naimer developed the world's smallest <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> (model CA4N), which is in the market since 1994.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{milestone}} in the company's history was {{the development of}} the world smallest <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> (model CA4N), which has been available since 1994.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Erstling" [...] IFF {{transceiver}} was activated {{from ground}} stations by switching the {{pulse repetition frequency}} from 3,750 Hz to 5,000 Hz. The on-board device replied by sending a pre-programmed morse code signal on 156 MHz. The coding unit was a motor-driven <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> encrypted with two ten-bit code keys.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cam</b> <b>switches</b> {{are mainly}} used within the low voltage range. On a shaft, <b>switching</b> <b>cams</b> {{are made of}} {{abrasion-resistant}} conductive material. By rotating the shaft, the contacts are opened or closed by the cams. Often, a plurality of cams are seated on a shaft, which simultaneously switch or switch several pairs of contacts.|$|R
50|$|This method uses two cam profiles, with an {{actuator}} to swap between the profiles (usually {{at a specific}} engine speed). <b>Cam</b> <b>switching</b> can also provide variable valve lift and variable duration, however the adjustment is discrete rather than continuous.|$|R
50|$|The {{specialty}} of Kraus & Naimer are load and disconnect switches {{as well as}} modular <b>cam</b> <b>switches,</b> where the company is world market leader. Kraus & Naimer is a supplier of switchgear for industrial customers {{in the fields of}} transport (railways, vehicles, ships, etc.,), conveyor systems, lift systems, mechanical engineering and power generation and power distribution systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{unit was}} {{controlled}} via resistors {{over which the}} voltage was dropped in a configuration of series and parallel electrical circuits. The circuit breakers that switched these circuits worked under very high power and voltage and were therefore all pneumatically operated for insulation purposes. Compressed air was required to open or close the switch actions and air was also used for the weak-field <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> that also switched under very high currents.|$|E
5000|$|In essence, MIVEC {{serves the}} same {{function}} as [...] "swapping cams", something that car racers might do when modifying older-design engines {{to produce more}} power. However, such swaps come with a compromise - generally yielding either greater low-end torque or more high-end horsepower, but not both. MIVEC achieves both goals. With MIVEC, the [...] "cam swap" [...] occurs automatically at a fixed engine speed. The <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> operation is transparent to the driver, who is simply rewarded with a smooth flow of power.|$|E
50|$|When the {{traction}} motors were operated in full-field, be it in series or parallel mode, they were performing at maximum power for normal operation. To increase {{the speed at}} this point, if necessary, higher power output was required from the {{traction motors}}. The only way to increase power was to force a higher current flow. To accomplish this, the weak-field <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> switched resistance in parallel with the field coils, which reduced the overall resistance of the field coils. This increased the magnetic flux and more power was generated by the traction motors, but only over short periods.|$|E
40|$|To improve {{reliability}} of rolling stock and save on maintenance labor, {{we have been}} replacing <b>cams,</b> <b>switches</b> and other mechanical parts and components with electronic devices. But, occurrence of failures has tended to increase as more electronic devices {{have been put in}} use. Thus, improvement of reliability for these devices has become an issue we must deal with. JR East set up an electronic device committee that included outside experts in 1998 and clarified characteristics and factors of dete-rioration of electric devices by carrying out surveys on causes of failures and their deterioration process. Concurrently, we estab-lished lifespan evaluation methods for electronic devices for rolling stock by acceleration tests based on surveys on conditions sur-rounding their use so that we could reflect those evaluation results in maintenance of devices for each series of rolling stock.

5000|$|The first CamPro engine {{made its}} debut in 2004 fitted to the newly {{released}} Gen•2 models. It was codenamed S4PH and was a DOHC 16-valve 1.6-litre engine that produced [...] of power at 6,000 rpm and 148 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. The S4PH engine was ironically not equipped with <b>Cam</b> Profile <b>Switching</b> (CPS) even though its Campro designation was an abbreviation of <b>Cam</b> Profile <b>Switching.</b> It also lacked the Variable Inlet Manifold (VIM) technology of later CamPro engines. Proton also produced a 1.3-litre version of this original CamPro engine and codenamed it S4PE.|$|R
5000|$|The PIGA {{was based}} on an {{accelerometer}} developed by Dr Fritz Mueller, then of the Kreiselgeraete Company, for the LEV-3 and experimental SG-66 guidance system of the Nazi era German V2 (EMW A4) ballistic missile and was known among the German rocket scientists as the MMIA [...] "Mueller Mechanical Integrating Accelerometer". This system used precision electrical contacts to actuate the torque motor and achieved an accuracy of 1 part in 1000 to 1 part per 10000 known in technical parlance as a scale error of 1000 to 100. This was equivalent to about 600m of accuracy over the V2 1500m/s speed and 320km flight. Since the number of shaft rotations represented speed, a <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> was used to initiate missile control sequences such as engine throttle-down and shut-off.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone of}} the company was laid in Vienna in 1907 in the Wattgasse 53 in the 16th district Ottakring. The company initially produced knife switches, the forerunners of today's disconnectors, which are counted from construction to the simplest and the first electrical switches {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. The other main products in the first four decades of the company's existence were lever and roller switches. At the end of the 1920s the new plastic material bakelite was used in switch construction. Kraus & Naimer is the patent owner of numerous innovations in switchgear technology. For the first time, the company introduced a <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> in the modular design (model C15) to the market in 1948, whereby customer-specific switches can be manufactured. The method of mass production of individual products is generally known in the industry also under the term mass customization.|$|E
40|$|Multi-mode {{combustion}} is {{an ideal}} combustion strategy to utilize HCCI for internal combustion engines. It combines HCCI combustion mode for low-middle load and traditional SI mode for high load and high speed. By changing the cam profiles from normal overlap for SI mode to the negative valve overlap (NVO) for HCCI mode, {{as well as the}} adjustment of direct injection strategy, the combustion mode transition between SI and HCCI was realized in one engine cycle. By two-step <b>cam</b> <b>switch,</b> the throttle action is separated from the cam action, which ensures the stabilization of mode transition. For validating the feasibility of the stepped switch, the influence of throttle position on HCCI combustion was carefully studied. Based on the research, the combustion mode switch was realized in one engine cycle; the whole switch process including throttle action was realized in 10 cycles. The entire process was smooth, rapid and reliable without any abnormal combustion such as knocking and misfiring. Copyright © 2007 SAE International...|$|E

The entire value-added chain from research and development to sales is handled by the company itself with specially founded logistics and dispatch centers as well as worldwide dispatch cooperation partners. As one of the world's leading manufacturers of rotary <b>cam</b> <b>switches</b> which uses a small amount of gold and tin, Kraus & Naimer took necessary steps to avoid the use of materials from illegal and unethical sources in their products. They purchase their needed raw material from companies, that are listed on the CFSI Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative CFSI.|$|R

40|$|Clusia is {{the only}} genus with bona fide {{dicotyledonous}} trees performing Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). Clusia minor L. is extraordinarily flexible, being C 3 /CAM intermediate and expressing the photosynthetic modes C 3, CAM, CAM-cycling, and CAM-idling. C 3 photosyn-thesis and CAM can be observed simultaneously in two opposite leaves on a node and possibly even within the same leaf in the interveinal lamina and the major vein tissue, respectively. The relative activity of photosys-tem II (FPSII) indicating photosynthetic energy use, is larger under photorespiratory than under non-photorespiratory conditions due to the particular en-ergy demand of photorespiration. The heterogeneity of FPSII over the leaves as visualized by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging in the C 3 mode is larger under non-photorespiratory conditions than under photores-piratory conditions. These observations indicate that photorespiration, presumably by its particular energy demand, synchronizes photosynthetic activity over the leaves. In the CAM mode, the heterogeneity of FPSII is more dependent on the transitions between CAM phases. Free-running circadian oscillations of photo-synthesis are strongly dampened in both the C 3 and the CAM mode. Photorespiration is under circadian clock control in both the C 3 and the CAM mode. FPSII and the heterogeneity of FPSII oscillate in phase with CO 2 uptake and photorespiration only under non-photorespiratory conditions. Under photorespiratory conditions, FPSII does not oscillate {{and there is no}} heterogeneity, again indicating the stabilizing function of photorespiration.

50|$|An {{electric}} motor drives a shaft on which is arranged {{a series of}} cams or a drum studded with pegs along its surface. Associated with each cam is one or more switches. The motor rotates at a fixed speed, and the camshaft is driven through a speed reducing gearbox at a convenient slow speed. Indentations or protrusions on the <b>cams</b> operate the <b>switches</b> at different times. By arrangement of the <b>cams</b> and <b>switches,</b> complex sequences of opening and closing switches can be made. The switches then operate different elements of the controlled system - for example motors, valves, etc.|$|R
5000|$|The motor {{operates}} {{by simple}} magnetic attraction between {{one of the}} electromagnets {{and one of the}} iron bars. The bar is not permanently magnetized, nor does electric current flow through any part of the rotor. Unlike the visually somewhat similar squirrel cage motor, no current flow is induced in the bars. The <b>cams</b> and <b>switches</b> are arranged so that as each bar approaches within range of the magnet the current is first switched on and the bar is pulled towards it. As it approaches closer, the current is then switched off and so the bar continues to rotate past the magnet, rather than being attracted to it and stopping there. Each of the coils, <b>cams</b> and <b>switches</b> is so arranged that each of the bars is attracted in turn and so the motor rotates continuously.|$|R
50|$|The CamPro CPS engine uses a {{variable}} valve lift system (<b>Cam</b> Profile <b>Switching</b> system) and {{a variable}} length intake manifold (VIM; {{not to be}} confused with the stand-alone IAFM used in the 2008 Proton Saga) to boost maximum power and improve the CPS engine's torque curve over the original CamPro engine.|$|R

40|$|Precursory lunar lander {{experiments}} on growing plants in locker-based chambers will increase {{our understanding of}} effect of lunar conditions on plant physiology. The inducible CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) -plants are reasonable model {{for a study of}} relationships between environmental challenges and changes in plant/bacteria gene expression. In inducible CAM-plants the enzymatic machinery for the environmentally activated <b>CAM</b> <b>switches</b> on from a C 3 - to a full-CAM mode of photosynthesis in response to any stresses (Winter et al., 2008). In our study, Kalanchoe spp. are shown to be promising candidates for putative lunar experiments as resistant to irradiation and desiccation, especially after inoculation with a bacterial consortium (Boorlak et al., 2010). Within frames of the experiment we expect to get information about the functional activity of CAM-plants, in particular, its organogenesis, photosystem, the circadian regulation of plant metabolism on the base of data gaining with instrumental indications from expression of the reporter genes fused to any genes involved in vital functions of the plant (Kozyrovska et al., 2009) ...|$|R
25|$|Two {{different}} systems were employed. The earlier, fitted to the 1965 through 1968 Ford-built {{cars and the}} 1971–1972 Nissan Cedric, employed an electric motor driving, through reduction gearing, a set of three slow-turning cams. These <b>cams</b> would actuate <b>switches</b> {{to turn on the}} lights in sequence. Later Ford cars and the 1969 Imperial used a transistorised control module with no moving parts to wear, break, or go out of adjustment.|$|R
50|$|Since their introduction, {{automatic}} washing machines {{have relied on}} electromechanical timers to sequence the washing and extraction process. Electromechanical timers consist {{of a series of}} cams on a common shaft driven by a small electric motor via a reduction gearbox. At the appropriate time in the wash cycle, each <b>cam</b> actuates a <b>switch</b> to engage or disengage a particular part of the machinery (for example, the drain pump motor).|$|R
50|$|By using {{a simple}} {{centrifugal}} governor, {{the speed of}} the motor may be controlled. When the governor detects an over-speed it interrupts the cam linkage so that the switches are activated for less time and so the motor slows. As there is already a <b>cam</b> and <b>switch</b> mechanism required, the addition of a governor link is a relatively simple addition. The use of a geared-up camshaft, as was common on the large power-producing motors, is also beneficial to permitting a smaller and more sensitive centrifugal governor. The ability to govern the power of the motor by switching the contact times gradually meant that this motor, unlike most other designs where the regulator shut off power altogether, meant that it could be governed very precisely.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cam</b> Profile <b>Switching</b> (CPS) {{system uses}} a tri-lobe {{camshaft}} to switch between two different cam profiles. One cam profile provides low valve lift, {{while the other}} cam profile has a high valve lift. The low valve lift cam profile is used at low to mid engine speeds to maintain idling quality and reduce emissions, while the high lift cam profile is used when the engine is spinning at mid to high engine speeds improve peak horsepower and torque. Unlike the other similar variable valve timing systems such as the Honda VTEC, the Toyota VVT-i and the Mitsubishi MIVEC which use rocker arm locking pins to change the valve timing, the CPS system uses direct-acting tappets with locking pins to change the valve timing and lift profile.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2009, Proton {{launched}} a CPS {{version of the}} Satria Neo, replacing the high-end H-Line version of the Satria Neo.

It {{is powered by a}} 1.6-litre CamPro CPS engine with [...] and 150 Nm of torque which reportedly does not suffer from the torque dip of older CamPro engines; however, the timing of the <b>cam</b> profile <b>switching</b> mechanism is slightly modified for aggressive driving - the CPS mechanism in the Satria Neo CPS changes from low cam to high cam at 4,400 rpm rather than at 3,800 rpm as in the other CPS-equipped models such as the Proton Waja and Proton Gen-2, as well as the Proton Exora.|$|R
5000|$|Volvo {{designed}} the SI6 ("short inline 6") straight-6 automobile engine {{for use in}} 2007 models. An evolution of the company's long-used straight-5 Volvo Modular engine, which itself is an evolution of the Volvo B6304 straight six engine, the SI6 can be mounted transversely for front wheel drive or all wheel drive applications. Despite the added cylinder and displacement, the engine remains compact, and is in fact 1 mm shorter than the previous straight-5. The engine was initially offered in two displacements [...] - [...] a 3.0 L turbocharged version and a 3.2 L naturally aspirated version. Both offered variable cam timing, though only the turbo version varies both the intake and exhaust valves. On top of the variable cam timing used on the intake cam of the naturally aspirated engine it also had variable valve lift by using <b>Cam</b> Profile <b>Switching</b> (CPS).|$|R
50|$|CAM {{tables are}} often the target of layer 2 network attacks in a local area network to set up man-in-the-middle attacks. A threat agent which has control of a device {{connected}} to an Ethernet switch can attack the <b>switch's</b> <b>CAM</b> table. This attack usually involves exploiting a vulnerability in switch design that appears when the switch runs out of space to record all of the MAC address to port mappings it learns. If the table fills up due to MAC flooding, most switches are {{no longer able to}} reliably add new MAC addresses.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} effects of valve timing and how it {{influences}} the in-cylinder fluid flow, the combustion, and the efficiency of the engine. An engine load of 4. 0 bar imepdndedt was achieved by setting the inlet valve closing time early or late to enable unthrottle operation. Inlet valve deactivation was also used and asymmetrical valve timing, i. e., valve timing with the two inlet valves opening and closing at different times.

40|$|Controlled {{auto-ignition}} (CAI) combustion, {{also known}} as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{can be achieved by}} trapping residuals with early exhaust valve closure in a direct fuel injection in-cylinder four-stroke gasoline engines (through the employment of low-lift cam profiles). Due to the operating region being limited to low and mid-load operation for CAI combustion with a low-lift cam profile, {{it is important to be}} able to operate SI combustion at high-load with a normal cam profile. A 3. 0 L prototype engine was modified to achieve CAI combustion, using a <b>Cam</b> Profile <b>Switching</b> mechanism which has the capability to switch between high and low-lift cam-profiles. A strategy was used where a high-profile could be used for SI combustion and a low-lift profile was used for CAI combustion. Initial analysis showed that for transitioning from SI to CAI combustion, misfire occurred on the first CAI transitional cycle. Subsequent experiments showed that the throttle opening position and switching time could be controlled avoiding misfire. Further work investigated transitioning at different loads and from CAI to SI combustion...|$|R

40|$|In {{a future}} 'hybrid' mode {{internal}} combustion engine capable of running in spark ignition (SI) and controlled auto ignition-CAI (also known as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition-HCCI) modes, transition between these modes, during changes in engine load and speed, will play a crucial role. The valve train and engine management system (EMS) must provide a fast and smooth transition between these two very different combustion modes keeping all relevant engine and combustion parameters in an acceptable range. In order to obtain such transition between SI and HCCI and SI, a valve event (duration, timing and lift) has to be variable, which consequently leads to high demands on the valve train and therefore a need for its higher degree of flexibility. Two valve train concepts, one with a <b>Cam</b> Profile <b>Switching</b> (CPS) and phaser system and the other camless using Fully variable Valve Train (FVVT) are presented. The use of both concepts for transitions from SI to HCCI to SI are experimentally investigated on a single cylinder research engine fuelled with commercially available gasoline fuel (95 RON). Experimental results obtained together with benefits and obstacles in using each of these strategies are presented and discussed. ...|$|R
