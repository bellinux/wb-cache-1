An up to 45% reduction in fuel consumption is claimed, corresponding to 2.9l/100km (81 mpg, 69 g CO2/km) on the NEDC cycle for a compact frame like Peugeot 208. The system is claimed to be much more affordable than competing electric and flywheel KERS systems and is expected on road cars by 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{winemaking}} {{technique of}} flotation {{was adapted from}} the froth flotation process used in the mining industry for ore refining. In this process, small bubbles of air (or <b>compressed</b> <b>nitrogen)</b> are injected {{into the bottom of}} a tank. As the bubbles rise through the must, grape solids, including phenolic compounds prone to oxidation and browning, will tend to cling to the bubbles, creating a froth that can be removed from the wine. This must be done prior to fermentation, since yeast will inhibit the flocculation involved.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{thermodynamic}} characteristics of two proposed power generation systems (PGSs) : {{one is a}} CO 2 -capturing PGS with regenerative cycle based on an oxy-fuel combustion method {{and the other is}} a PGS with a similar structure but which uses air to combust fuel. In each of the proposed PGSs, steam (H 2 O), which is produced by utilizing a heat energy resource outside of the system, is used as the main working fluid for a kind of gas turbine: this feature is different from a conventional gas turbine in which air is used. Exergy efficiency is used in evaluating the thermodynamic characteristics of the PGSs, since energy with different qualities, fuel and steam, are used as input energy in each system. It is estimated under assumed conditions that the oxygen-combustion PGS (OCS) has higher exergy efficiency than the air-combustion PGS (ACS). The reasons are as follows. The turbine outlet pressure of the air-combustion PGS is higher than that of the oxygen-combustion PGS. Additional energy is consumed for the air-combustion PGS; power to <b>compress</b> <b>nitrogen</b> gas included in the air for injecting it into a combustor, heat energy to raise the nitrogen gas to the turbine inlet temperature, and power to compress the condenser outlet gas to the atmospheric pressure for exhausting it to the atmosphere. For example, from the simulation study performed, the exergy efficiency of the OCS is estimated to be 54. 4 %, higher by 0. 87 %, compared to the highest exergy efficiency (53. 8 %) of the ACS.
