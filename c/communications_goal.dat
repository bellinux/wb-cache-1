This chapter places our future climate in this ‘bigger picture’ that has many names including Gaia and Earth system science. We recognize that climate has been used frequently as a way of illustrating emergent Earth system behaviour and so we explore how future climates are integral to this whole-of-Earth system. Recognizing that future climate and Earth system challenges have to be communicated clearly and effectively to the public (who demand or refuse policy direction changes), we choose to illuminate aspects of our narrative by metaphor and format some diagrams as cartoons. Such readily accessible modes of sharing are in keeping with the clear <b>communications</b> <b>goal</b> of Stephen Schneider, to whom this book is dedicated, and also the aim of James Lovelock, the creator of the Gaia hypothesis around which this chapter is organized. 21 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—With each {{successive}} generation, network adapters for high-performance networks {{are becoming more}} powerful and feature rich. High-performance NICs can now provide support for performing complex group communication operations on the NIC without any host CPU involvement. Several “offloading interfaces ” have been designed with the collective <b>communications</b> <b>goal</b> being the complete offloading of arbitrary communication patterns. In this work, we analyze the offloading model offered in the Portals 4 specification in detail. We perform a theoretical analysis based on abstract communication graphs and show several protocols for implementing offloaded communication schedules. Based on our analysis, we propose and implement an extension to the portals 4 specification that enables offloading any communication pattern completely to the NIC. Our measurements with several advanced communication algorithms confirm that the enhancements provide good overlap and asynchronous progress in practical settings. Altogether, we demonstrate a complete and simple scheme for implementing arbitrary offloaded communication algorithms and hardware. Our protocols {{can act as a}} blueprint for the development of communication hardware as well as middleware while optimizing the whole communication stack. I...|$|E

40|$|As {{advertising}} {{becomes an}} important part of our daily lives, researchers are increasingly becoming interested in this topic. AIDA, NAIDAS and similar models are the first models trying to explain how consumers are affected from the marketingcommunications efforts directed at them, the processes that they are going through, and factors that make them buy products andservices. In a short period of time, new studies and models are added to these, and researches that are trying to examine theeffects of advertising have gained speed. The DAGMAR model is a result of this process. Similar to AIDA and NAIDAS,DAGMAR model is an hierarchy-of-effects model and is a combination the “first letters”. This model tries to explain thehierarchical steps in the buying behavior of consumers like other models. Hierarchy-of-effects models are proposed to define the steps that consumers are going through when they are exposed tomarketing communications efforts. Thinking, feeling and doing are included in the steps defined. These models assume thateverything happens in order and consumers should complete one step to be able to pass to the next step. These models are alsocalled “linear models”. Similar to the Maslow model, one cannot pass to the next step before fulfilling the requirements of theprevious steps. The first and most widely known hierarchy-of-effects model is AIDA. AIDA is an acronym for Attention,Interest, Desire and Action. It has been the inspiration for most of the models. The models developed after AIDA has beenbased on the steps defined by it. For instance, Robert Lavidge and Gary Steiner’s model identified the steps as Awareness,Knowledge, Liking, Preference, Conviction and Purchase. After Elmo Lewis’s AIDA, Sheldon’s AIDAS model, Kitson’s AIDCAmodel, Rogers’s AIETA model, Robertson’s ACALTA model, and Colley’s ACCA, or as widely known, DAGMAR model havebeen proposed. Colley related the hierarchical models with goals. Unlike other models, every step defined by the DAGMAR model isconnected to a marketing <b>communications</b> <b>goal.</b> According to Colley, defining a marketing <b>communications</b> <b>goal</b> has thesebenefits:• People work harder if they have a clear definition of what they are trying to achieve. They can know what is their target andwhat problems they must overcome. • Goals make the team on track and prevent efforts wasted on wrong domains. • Goals let the sources used better and in a more effective way. Goals make results measurable. Organizations can makebetter predictions of budgets looking at the previous performance. DAGMAR acronym stands for Defining Advertising Goals for Measured Advertising Results. This model has been proposedby Russell Colley in 1961. According to Colley, advertising’s job is simply to communicate, to a defined audience, information anda frame-of-mind that stimulate action. It succeeds of fails depending on how well it communicates the desired information andattitudes to the right people at the right time and at the right cost. This model encourages marketers to test advertising’seffectiveness before and after consumers have been exposed to the advertising. The DAGMAR model assumes that consumers are going through awareness, comprehension, conviction and action. Thefirst step is to make consumers aware of the product and service. Consumer’s attention may be distracted by competing brandsand awareness about a brand can be lowered because of this. Marketers should try to keep the awareness of consumers high. Awareness is not enough by itself to make consumers buy a brand. Consumers must have knowledge about the product or the organization. Key features of the brand must be presented to the consumer, because the associated benefits might be veryimportant for them. They must be enlightened on the changes the product or service will make on their lives. Advertisingmessages must be communicated to the right people at the right time and at the right cost. Thus consumers can know the brand,recognize the package, and know what the product does. The third step is to convince people. According to Miller, to persuadepeople is to shape, change or reinforce their responses. To persuade consumers, marketers must shape the beliefs of consumersabout a brand. This is generally achieved by presenting the superior features and associated benefits, so that consumers can thinkthat a brand is better than the competitors. The final step is action, or the purchase of a product or service. Colley argues thatadvertising is not enough to make this process result in a sale. Brand must be of high quality, package must be attractive, and pricemust be right. In this study, we aim to contribute to the local advertising researches that are only focusing on AIDA, and to update this oldmodel and help markets and scientists better understand it. For this purposes, we have examined the DAGMAR model in detailand studied laundry detergent commercials as an example. The finding of our research is as follows:In the “Konsantre Ariel Prozim 7 ” commercial, four steps of the DAGMAR model is present. To raise awareness, asuccessful business woman is shown. In the comprehension step, this protagonist tells his experience of saving money to theviewer. This presentation is appropriate to convince consumers. The aim is to prevent consumers from switching to cheaperproducts because of the economic crisis. The four basic steps of the model is also present in the “Vernel Esintili Persil Gül” commercial. The protagonist is a happyand smart mother and this is used to create awareness. To comprehend, hygiene and nice scent is presented. In addition to these,this detergent has another powerful brands “softness”. With these benefits, emotional cues are also used to convince consumers. In the “Tursilmatik Badem Sütü” commercial, product is the main protagonist. There is only a beautiful flower that maycreate awareness on the viewer. It can be said that the aim of this advertisement is to keep the awareness ratio. Hygiene is impliedby “whiter than white” clothes, and pleasant scent is implied by the beautiful flower. The package is shown to make peopleremember the brand when shopping. The last commercial examined in this study is “Omo Sudaki Ayak İzim”. This commercial is different than the previous ones. Instead of the cleaning power, nice scent or softness of the clothes, it tries to raise awareness to a social topic. It tries to makeconsumers think about the water consumption and its consequences. According to the commercial, global warming is moreimportant than the cleaning power. The awareness it creates is more striking. The apparent action expected from the consumer isvisiting a website created by Omo about the topic and being responsible. The hidden action is of course, making a sale. Although presented in different ways, the basic steps proposed by the DAGMAR model can be seen in these commercials. This model is open for more research in the future...|$|E

The interviews illuminated how tightly or loosely coupled the functions of institutional strategy, communications, and fund raising are within each institution. Further, the research explores how influential the leaders of these functions believe the three functions are upon one another. ^ While strategy and communications are nominally present at almost all institutions examined in the study, those that achieve the most fund raising success tend to have a higher level of integration of strategic planning and communications with core advancement activities.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to note the {{advertising}} business overspending on advertising messages that is often done with minimal consideration to the impact or effects of many consumer exposures. Design/methodology/approach – The paper notes textbooks statement of advertising budget spending as the money needed to attain pragmatic <b>communications</b> <b>goals</b> and compares this to the ongoing business reality of media planning that mostly devolves into maximization of audience exposures to mass media vehicles carrying the brand or company name. Findings – The pragmatic business need is for more questioning the value of media spending, not as return on investment, but how it contributes to overall communications concerns. The media planners dilemma is the uncertainty of the effects of every additional audience exposure, thus (and too often) they take the easy route and simply resolve to purchase as many target audience impressions as possible for as low a price as can be negotiated. Originality/value – This paper asks an important question that many people in the advertising business try to avoid: “Why is so much money being spent?”. While it is difficult to track the impact of every single vehicle placement, the media planners should at least try to question what is the real strategy behind efforts to maximize target audience exposures to vehicles carrying the company logo...|$|R
