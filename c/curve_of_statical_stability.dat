The authors have developed a procedure for obtaining a workable method giving satisfactory accuracy in preliminary ship design for predicting the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> of a vessel when only the principal dimensions and hull coefficients of the vessel are known. The stability data upon which the development is based was obtained by mechanically integrating a parent hull form from Taylor's Standard Series and expanding the resulting righting are data to cover a range of ship forms. The methods of data expansion were those suggested in the 1949 thesis by Church and Robinson entitled "The estimation of transverse statical stability from form coefficients and principal dimensions", but modified as considered desirable to improve accuracy and convenience of application.

40|$|This report, {{which is}} a {{continuation}} of the "Preliminary report on free flight testing" (report no. NACA-TR- 70), presents a detailed theoretical analysis <b>of</b> <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> with free and locked controls and also the results of many free flight test on several types of airplanes. In developing the theory of stability with locked controls an expression for pitching moment is derived in simple terms by considering the total moment as the sum of the moments due to wings and tail surface. This expression, when differentiated with respect to angle of incidence, enables an analysis to be made of the factors contributing to the pitching moment. The effects of slipstream and down wash are also considered and it is concluded that the C. G. Location has but slight effect or stability, and that stability is much improved by increasing the efficiency of the tail surfaces, which may be done by using an "inverted" tail plane. The results of free flight tests with locked controls are discussed at length and it is shown that the agreement between the experimental results and theory is very satisfactory. The theory of stability with free controls is not amendable to the simple mathematical treatment used in the case of locked controls, but a clear statement of the conditions enables several conclusions to be drawn, one of which is that the fixed tail surfaces should be much larger than the movable surfaces...|$|R

Analysis is performed on single and double pendulum loaded with axial force and supported by angular springs. Linear analysis is used to determine critical points, and nonlinear analysis is used to determine behaviour of the system after the loss of stability. The results of calculation of buckling eigenmodes are used to simplify nonlinear analysis and to obtain approximate analytic equations of postbuckling trajectory and phase trajectories, as well as frequencies of small vibrations around current secondary equilibrium position. Increase of the amplitude of vibrations around the primary equilibrium position changes frequencies of these vibrations. Equations presented in this paper show also that this well known fact can be used in the analysis of postcritical behaviour of observed systems...|$|R

40|$|I {{hold that}} the {{essential}} distinction between statics and dynamics, if the terms must be used, {{is not the}} same as, nor even closely related to that between stocks and flows. In fact the most perfect instances <b>of</b> <b>statical</b> problems are those which deal with "steady flows " of labour capital and goods, of wages, interest and prices in a stationary country: in which each year is just like the past, in which each generation is like that which went before. It may be noted, as an incidental confirmation of this opinion, that our choicest illustrations <b>of</b> the <b>statical</b> or stationary state relate to agricultural and not to mineral prices. Now the annual output of a farm is a true flow: but the annual output of a mine is not a true flow, it comes out of stock: and, if the mineral veins are not practically unlimited, the exhaustion of the stock will disrupt the statical rest.

40|$|Diploma work {{discusses}} the dimensioning of intersections of reinforced concrete in states of boundary carrying capacity {{with use of}} tables and diagrams according to European Standard EN 1992. With diagrams of effective use of concrete reinforcement it touches also the boundary states of usability. By the creation of tables I have craved for bigger simplification of preliminary calculus of needed parameters. Tables for single axis big eccentricity are presented for individual material qualities as well as independently of material quality and they offer additionally the possibility to consider the reinforcement hardening. By small eccentricity we can simplify the intersection dimensioning with tables, which give optimal quantity of reinforcement, {{with which we can}} ensure minimal intersection of reinforcement by specified load without retardative searching of suitable pairs of concrete deformations on the edges. Interaction diagrams are created for chosen shapes of intersections with and without consideration of reinforcement hardening. In boundary state of usability we can simply check the effective use of reinforcement with given proper diagrams for the effective use of reinforcement, which are given in dependence <b>of</b> load, <b>statical</b> height <b>of</b> intersection and the reinforcement level.

The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to study the static and dynamic behaviour of a tension leg platform in the intact condition and after partial or total loss of tether at any corner. The exercise involves formulating the statics and dynamics of column stabilised structures with taut moorings and implementing the same in appropriate computer softwares. Formulations are also made to calculate the equilibrium tensions after a loss of tether. [...] The computer program for hydrostatics is capable of generating the standard hydrostatic information as well as locating the equilibrium configuration of the floating body under a given set of external static loads. This is {{used to assess the}} <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the tension leg platform in damaged cases and compare the same with its various other configurations. [...] Under the category of hydrodynamic analysis, two major types of approaches, namely 'frequency domain’ and 'time domain' are employed. In the frequency domain approach, wave amplitudes and all displacements are assumed to be small. Also, integration of the hydrodynamic forces is carried out over the mean wetted surface of the body. The wave excitation forces are calculated via a 'Morison type' formula and an iterative scheme is adopted to handle the nonlinear drag term. This analysis is used to compute the 'response amplitude operators' (RAOs) in intact and damaged conditions. Significant responses are also computed using these RAOs and Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectra for chosen wind speeds. In the time domain analysis, though assumptions similar to frequency domain analysis are made regarding the incident wave. However, no restriction is put on the motion of the body. The excitation and the reactive forces are calculated over the instantaneous wetted surface and at the displaced position. Nonlinear equations of motion are integrated using Adam's method. This analysis is used to obtain time-series data of motion and tension responses in order to study the variation of steady state amplitudes in intact and damaged conditions as well as transients following a loss of tether. [...] A special study of the occurrence of Mathieu type dynamic instability in tension leg platforms is also undertaken. A formulation to calculate unstable combinations of wave height and frequency is developed based on Floquet theory for periodic systems. The effect of various pertinent parameters including loss of tether on instability is also investigated. [...] Furthermore, a 1 : 100 scale model of a representative tension leg platform is designed and fabricated.

[...] It is seen that a complete loss of tether at any corner can reduce the <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> a tension leg platform drastically. A loss of tether, in general, is found to increase the platform motions in vertical planes as well as the static and dynamic tensions in the remaining intact tethers. Total loss of tether at one corner induces snap loads in one or more corners. Depending on the wave height and frequency, these snap loads could be high enough to trigger further tether failures.
