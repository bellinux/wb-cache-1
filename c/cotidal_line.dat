2500|$|For {{an ocean}} {{in the shape}} of a {{circular}} basin enclosed by a coastline, the cotidal lines point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point, the amphidromic point. The amphidromic point is at once cotidal with high and low waters, which is satisfied by zero tidal motion. (The rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island, as it does around New Zealand, Iceland and Madagascar.) Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant amplitude (half the distance between high and low water) which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point. For a semi-diurnal tide the amphidromic point can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face, with the hour hand pointing in the direction of the high water <b>cotidal</b> <b>line,</b> which is directly opposite the low water <b>cotidal</b> <b>line.</b> High water rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and is caused by the Coriolis effect. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the epoch. The reference tide is the hypothetical constituent [...] "equilibrium tide" [...] on a landless Earth measured at 0° longitude, the Greenwich meridian.|$|E

25|$|In the North Atlantic, {{because the}} <b>cotidal</b> <b>lines</b> {{circulate}} counterclockwise around the amphidromic point, the high tide passes New York Harbor approximately an hour ahead of Norfolk Harbor.

25|$|Because the M2 tidal {{constituent}} dominates in most locations, {{the stage}} or {{phase of a}} tide, denoted by the time in hours after high water, is a useful concept. Tidal stage is also measured in degrees, with 360° per tidal cycle. Lines of constant tidal phase are called <b>cotidal</b> <b>lines,</b> which are analogous to contour lines of constant altitude on topographical maps. High water is reached simultaneously along the <b>cotidal</b> <b>lines</b> extending from the coast out into the ocean, and <b>cotidal</b> <b>lines</b> (and hence tidal phases) advance along the coast. Semi-diurnal and long phase constituents are measured from high water, diurnal from maximum flood tide. This and the discussion that follows is precisely true only for a single tidal constituent.|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} and amplification of {{the tide}} at the Gerlache and Bransfield Straits, northwestern {{side of the}} Antarctic Peninsula, was studied by analysis of thirteen series of direct sea level measurements. Harmonic analysis was performed to obtain the amplitudes and phases of the M_ 2, S_ 2, O_ 1 and K_ 1 tidal constituents. Based on the computed harmonic constants, cotidal and corange charts of these main constituents were prepared. The M_ 2 <b>cotidal</b> <b>lines</b> are parallel to the coast and show predominantly southeastward propagation, except at {{the western side of}} the Trinity Peninsula, where the M_ 2 wave pivots to enter the Bransfield Strait from the Weddell Sea and turns southwestward. M_ 2 amplitudes present a southwestward decrease. S_ 2 <b>cotidal</b> <b>lines</b> are normal to the Antarctic Peninsula coast and show southwestward propagation. S_ 2 corange lines increase eastward from the Gerlache Strait to the Antarctic Strait. O_ 1 and K_ 1 <b>cotidal</b> <b>lines</b> are also normal to the Antarctic Peninsula coast. Diurnal amplitudes are alike in the study area except at the northwestern side of the Antarctic Strait where they present a maximum gradient. Amplitudes of the main tidal constituents are higher in the northwestern Weddell Sea than at the northwestern side of the peninsula. This fact explains the maximum tidal amplitudes observed at the Antarctic Strait in comparison to the Bransfield Strait...|$|R
25|$|The {{exception}} is at Cook Strait where the tidal currents periodically link high to low water. This is because <b>cotidal</b> <b>lines</b> 180° around the amphidromes are in opposite phase, for example high water across from low water {{at each end}} of Cook Strait. Each tidal constituent has a different pattern of amplitudes, phases, and amphidromic points, so the M2 patterns cannot be used for other tide components.|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} linear hydrodynamical numerical model, Heaps type, {{was developed}} and applied to the southeastern Brazilian continental shelf, to simulate motions in the sea due to astronomical and meteorological effects. The first experiment of the model reproduced the propagation of the principal lunar tidal component (M 2), allowing the plotting of its <b>cotidal</b> <b>lines</b> and current ellipses. In the second experiment, the circulation generated by astronomical factors only was simulated.
