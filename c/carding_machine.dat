5|$|Peel {{worked with}} one of his weavers, James Hargreaves, to {{investigate}} new technologies. In 1762, Peel and Hargreaves set up a <b>carding</b> <b>machine,</b> but decided against using it. When Hargreaves went on to invent the spinning jenny in 1764, Peel was keen to use the technology. He set them up in his factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked. In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses. The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies within– along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one.|$|E
25|$|The cotton {{comes off}} of the picking machine in laps, and is then taken to carding machines. The carders line up the fibres nicely to make them easier to spin. The <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> {{consists}} mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> {{in the form of}} a sliver; a large rope of fibres.|$|E
25|$|Throughout China, {{a simple}} method of {{producing}} quilts is employed. It involves {{setting up a}} temporary roadside site. A frame is assembled within which a lattice work of cotton thread is made. Cotton batting, either new or retrieved from discarded quilts, is prepared in a mobile <b>carding</b> <b>machine.</b> The mechanism of the <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> {{is powered by a}} small, petrol motor. The batting is then added, layer by layer, to the area within the frame. Between each layer, a new lattice of thread is created with a wooden disk used to tamp down the layer.|$|E

25|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{spinning}} process is carding, initially this was done by hand, but in 1775 {{he took out a}} second patent for a water-powered <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> and this led to increased output. He was soon building further mills on this site and eventually employed 1,000 workers at Cromford. By {{the time of his death}} in 1792, he was the wealthiest untitled person in Britain.|$|E
25|$|In Indiana he {{made several}} {{business}} ventures {{with his partner}} Enoch D. John. Together they operated a hotel in Brookville, became heavily involved in land speculation, and opened a water-powered weaving mill with a wool <b>carding</b> <b>machine.</b> Noble also opened a trading company called N. Noble & Company. The company purchased produce from area farmers and shipped it to New Orleans to be sold. In 1819 a boating accident destroyed one of his shipments and {{left him with a}} large debt that took several years to repay. Later that year he married his cousin, Catherin Stull van Swearingen. The two shared the same great-grandfather. They had three children, but only one survived into adulthood; two died as infants.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} cotton {{mills in}} the United States were horse-powered. The first mill {{to use this}} method was the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, built in Beverly, Massachusetts. It was started on 18 August 1788 by entrepreneur John Cabot and brothers. It was operated in joint by Moses Brown, Israel Thorndike, Joshua Fisher, Henry Higginson, and Deborah Higginson Cabot. The Salem Mercury reported that in April 1788 the equipment for the mill was complete, consisting of a spinning jenny, a <b>carding</b> <b>machine,</b> warping machine, and other tools. That same year the mill's location was finalized and built in the rural outsets of North Beverly. The location had the presence of natural water, but it was cited the water was used for upkeep of the horses and cleaning of equipment, and not for mass-production.|$|E

Lewis's {{invention}} is later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, although this comes about under great suspicion after a fire at Daniel Bourn's factory in Leominster that specifically uses Paul and Wyatt's spindles. Bourn produces a similar patent in the same year.|$|E
