5|$|Tom Mankiewicz, {{who worked}} on the three {{preceding}} Bond films, claims he was <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> do an extensive rewrite of the script.

5|$|A tabloid {{paper offers}} a $10,000 reward for the tiger causing {{the town to}} be {{inundated}} with hunters and reporters. The sheriff forbids anyone from going {{in the woods and}} hunting the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy in the woods. They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> help. The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E

Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent coming from the kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and the fire department is <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> rescue him.

5|$|After {{moving through}} the Tongan islands, the {{remnants}} of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to , to the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every lifeguard in Whangamata, as well as former lifeguards, were <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 {{people out of the}} water. Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made. Rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards.|$|E

Some schools were used as shelter while restaurants and hospitals sent food and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Army Group Centre renewed their {{offensive}} on Moscow in mid-November. Fegelein and the SS Cavalry Brigade {{were held}} back as an operational reserve in the rearward {{area of the}} 9th Army. Massive counter-attacks by the Red Army led to a weakening of the entire German line, and the brigade was <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> fight at the front on 28 December. While Fegelein reported that his forces were the equivalent {{to one or two}} divisions, in reality he had only 4,428 men in total at this point, of which 1,800 were ready for action. The brigade was deployed at the south-eastern sector of the XXIII Army Corps, where it defended against attacks in the rearward area of the 206th Infantry Division in the Battles of Rzhev. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons.|$|E

5|$|As many as 90 sorties a {{day were}} <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> {{suppress}} North Vietnamese forces around Hambleton. In contrast, {{prior to the}} Easter Offensive, the number of daily sorties was about 10, and during the action, peaked at about 300. During the multi-day effort to rescue the men, the Americans hit the North Vietnamese with over 800 air strikes in direct support of the rescue. Search and rescue took priority over almost all strike targets.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
5|$|At 10:10 of {{the third}} quarter Roethlisberger {{completed}} a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14–9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of the end zone on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison—who was <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> replace injured long snapper Greg Warren—snapped the ball out of the end zone to give the Giants a safety and tie the game. The Giants drove after receiving the safety's kickoff to score a touchdown—taking a 21–14 lead with 3:07 remaining. Pittsburgh was unable to convert on their final two drives, as Roethlisberger threw his fourth interception of the day.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{by three}} tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} wreck were unsuccessful, but the next spring tide carried the {{midsection}} up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. A miner named Pope was <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> remove it: he used gelignite without success, though the explosion {{was reported to have}} broken many windows in the town. In 2010 a wreck, identified as almost certainly the Antoinette, surfaced on Town Bar. The Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws.|$|E
5|$|Early in most plots Bond is <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see M, {{the head}} of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (also known as MI6) in his or her office to receive his assignment. In several films, Bond {{receives}} the assignment outside the MI6 offices, or at a local secret office. Bond often finds M in a subdued state of agitation over a new threat to world peace. M typically shows confidence in the service's best agent but feels a need to rein in Bond for his risky methods and often chides him for his indiscretions.|$|E
