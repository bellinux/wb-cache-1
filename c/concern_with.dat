5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E
5|$|Budget and {{management}} {{reforms in the}} 1980s and 1990s saw a change in budgeting, including {{a greater emphasis on}} outcomes, and decreasing emphasis on inputs.

Various organisations, including the Independent Labour Party, joined to make the British Labour Party in 1906, with Keir Hardie as its first chairman. The Unionists and Conservatives merged in 1912, usually known as the Conservatives in England and Wales, they adopted the name Unionist Party in Scotland.|$|E

In particular, Boswell ignored Johnson's early politics and political writings which show a <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> Sir Robert Walpole's political administration.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{gradually}} became clogged with weed, and the railway took {{much of the}} trade. Between 1870 and 1874, income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were: (1) to explore the domain of <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments using a qualitative technique; (2) to develop scales, measuring them in the offline and online shopping contexts; and (3) to examine the relationships among body image self-discrepancy, body dissatisfaction, fashion involvement, <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments, and loyalty intentions based on the self-discrepancy and cognitive dissonance theories.;In Phase 1, the domain of <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments was explored using a focus group interview technique. Results of this phase revealed seven distinct, interrelated themes, encompassing both offline and online shopping.;In Phase 2, based on the findings from Phase 1, two <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garment scales were developed for offline and online shopping. As a result of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, five dimensions, including 22 items, were identified for each of the offline and online shopping contexts. It appeared that both offline and online shopping contexts generated similar <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments to some extent, but at the same time, the <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size in the two different shopping formats were explained by somewhat different dimensions.;In Phase 3, a hypothesized model, examining the relationships among body image self-discrepancy, body dissatisfaction, enduring and situational fashion involvement, <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments, and loyalty intentions, was tested using a SEM technique. The results showed that body image self-discrepancy was positively related to body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction was positively related to enduring and situational fashion involvement. Body dissatisfaction was positively associated <b>with</b> five <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garment dimensions. However, the relationships between enduring and situational fashion involvement and five <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garment dimensions were not significant. Finally, <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> overall appearance and <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> unavailability of size did not influence loyalty intentions; whereas, <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> imagining fit/size in online shopping negatively affected loyalty intentions...|$|R
5|$|Although {{there was}} some fear of Rome and <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} {{and values of the}} day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> plant classification systems has all but disappeared, while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E

5|$|<b>Concern</b> <b>with</b> {{the harm}} of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E
5|$|Education {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} education within the modern borders of Scotland, {{between the end of}} the Middle Ages in the late fifteenth century and the beginnings of the Enlightenment in the mid-eighteenth century. By the sixteenth century such formal educational institutions as grammar schools, petty schools and sewing schools for girls were established in Scotland, while children of the nobility often studied under private tutors. Scotland had three universities, but the curriculum was limited and Scottish scholars had to go abroad to gain second degrees. These contacts were {{one of the most important}} ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. Humanist <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> education and Latin culminated in the Education Act 1496.|$|E
5|$|Feminism in Russia {{originated}} in the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and mostly confined to the aristocracy. Throughout the 19thcentury, the idea of feminism remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20thcentury Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, shifted their focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants and factory workers. After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and nominal equality for women in education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as income inequality and a greater burden of household work. In spite of this, the <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> feminism waned during this period.|$|E

5|$|His <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> public {{education}} was not interrupted by his military campaigns. In 1813 he {{was rewarded with}} 40,000 pesos for his victories at Salta and Tucumán, an amount that would equal almost 80 gold kilograms. Belgrano rejected taking the prize money for himself, considering that a patriot should not seek money or wealth. He gave {{it back to the}} XIII year Assembly, with instructions to build primary schools at Tarija, Jujuy, San Miguel de Tucumán, and Santiago del Estero. He laid out a series of instructions about the methods and requirements for the selection of the teachers. However, the schools were not built, and by 1823 Bernardino Rivadavia declared that the money was lost; Juan Ramón Balcarce included it in the debt of the Buenos Aires province a decade later.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E
5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> the {{business}} of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune {{on the back of}} Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E
