40|$|The European radar {{satellite}} Sentinel 1 A {{was launched in}} April 2014 as {{the first of the}} <b>Copernicus</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Component.</b> A second satellite (B unit) will follow in 2015. Both carry an imaging C-band SAR instrument. The Sentinel 1 system has been conceived to provide repeat-pass interferometric capabilities with wide area coverage for medium resolution applications. Wide-swath is achieved by employing the novel TOPS (Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans) acquisition mode. The repeat cycle has been reduced notably from 35 days for ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 or 30 days for ENVISAT to 12 days for S 1 A, and can still be reduced effectively to 6 days when both units are in space. This supposes an exceptional temporal sampling, allowing a vast range of applications, like the study of Earthquakes, monitoring of volcanoes, glaciers and ground deformation, etc… Our contribution describes the interferometric processing chain developed at the Remote Sensing Technology Institute at DLR.

40|$|The {{current status}} of the planned {{calibration}} of several Sentinel Earth observation hyper-spectral instruments {{as part of the}} <b>Copernicus</b> <b>space</b> <b>component</b> programme, will be presented. Sentinel- 5 and Sentinel- 5 -precursor are low Earth orbit missions and Sentinel- 4, placed in geostationary orbit, supports the monitoring of trace gases concentrations and aerosols in the atmosphere covering air-quality applications, air-quality protocol monitoring and climate protocol monitoring with a high revisit time over Europe. Sentinel- 5 Precursor, developed to reduce data gaps between Envisat, in particular the Sciamachy instrument, and the launch of Sentinel- 5, is planned to be launched end of this year. As a joint initiative between ESA and the Netherlands the mission comprises a satellite and a UVNS instrument called Tropomi. Tropomi has been calibrated on-ground last year. The Sentinel- 4 Ultra-violet/Visible/Near-Infrared (UVN) sounder covering the needs for continuous monitoring of atmospheric composition in high temporal and spatial resolution from a geostationary orbit, is in phase C. Sentinel- 5, its low Earth orbit ‘companion’, undergoes the last procurements for its calibration.

Wide-swath is achieved by employing the novel TOPS (Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans) acquisition mode. The contribution of this talk focuses on an interferometric evaluation of Sentinel- 1 A data. A brief description of the interferometric algorithms of the Integrated Wide Area Processor at DLR is provided. The spectral properties of TOPS data are exposed and the stringent coregistration accuracy emphasized, where a pixelwise ESD-based estimator is proposed. Burst mode data require that repeat-pass acquisitions are synchronized in order to obtain coherence over distributed scatterers. An evaluation of the common Doppler bandwidth for two stack of S 1 A scenes is provided. By exploiting the high sensitivity of TOPS data to the measurement of the along-track shift, an assessment of the shifts is as well provided for two scenarios. In the first place a temporal analysis is done with two stacks of acquisitions in different acquisiton geometries. Geophysical effects as diferential solid Earth tides are compensated. The outcome of this analysis indicates that a mere geometric coregistration is not enough to obtain accurate interferometric results, being necessary to compensate for orbital timing errors. The second analysis focuses on the systematic evaluation of the along-track shifts for a datatake composed by several slices, where good spatial stability is shown...|$|E
40|$|The Sentinel- 4 {{mission is}} part of the Copernicus programme, whose overall {{objective}} is to support Europe’s goals regarding sustainable development and global governance of the environment by providing timely and quality data, information, services and knowledge. Within the <b>Copernicus</b> <b>space</b> <b>component,</b> Sentinel- 4 Ultra-violet/Visible/Near-Infrared (UVN) sounder covers the needs for continuous monitoring of atmospheric composition at high temporal and spatial resolution from a geostationary orbit, in particular with respect to air quality. The Sentinel- 4 /UVN instrument is procured within the ESA Copernicus programme and will be provided to the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) programme for embarkation on the two MTG-Sounder satellites operated by EUMETSAT. The objective of the geostationary mission Sentinel- 4 is monitoring of the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere above Europe. Target species, including the trace gases O 3, NO 2, SO 2, HCHO and aerosols shall be observed to support operational services including forecasts covering air quality protocol monitoring, and climate protocol monitoring. The Sentinel- 4 /UVN instrument targets the troposphere in particular. The Sentinel- 4 /UVN instrument is a high resolution spectrometer operating with designated spectral bands in the solar reflectance spectrum, covering the ultraviolet (305 - 400 nm), visible (400 - 500 nm) and near-infrared (750 - 775 nm). The prime Sentinel- 4 /UVN parameters are a spatial sampling of 8 km over Europe and a fast repeat cycle over Europe and North Africa (Sahara) of one hour. The respective spectral resolutions are 0. 5 nm in the ultraviolet and visible spectral bands, and 0. 12 nm in the near-infrared. In this presentation the Sentinel- 4 /UVN instrument calibration (on-ground and in-flight) and the data processing (level 0 to level 1 b) to meet the required level 1 b data quality status at the beginning of phase C/D are outlined...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Copernicus</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Component</b> Data Access system (CSCDA) {{incorporates}} data {{contributions from}} a wide range of satellite missions. Through EO data handling and distribution, CSCDA serves a set of Copernicus Services related to Land, Marine and Atmosphere Monitoring, Emergency Management and Security and Climate Change. The quality of the delivered EO products is the responsibility of each contributing mission, and the Copernicus data Quality Control (CQC) service supports and complements such data quality control activities. The mission of the CQC is to provide a service of quality assessment on the provided imagery, to support the investigation related to product quality anomalies, and to guarantee harmonisation and traceability of the quality information. In terms of product quality control, the CQC carries out analysis of representative sample products for each contributing mission as well as coordinating data quality investigation related to issues found or raised by Copernicus users. Results from the product analysis are systematically collected and the derived quality reports stored in a searchable database. The CQC service can be seen as a privileged focal point with unique comparison capacities over the data providers. The comparison among products from different missions suggests the need for a strong, common effort of harmonisation. Technical terms, definitions, metadata, file formats, processing levels, algorithms, cal/val procedures etc. are far from being homogeneous, and this may generate inconsistencies and confusion among users of EO data. The CSCDA CQC team plays a significant role in promoting harmonisation initiatives across the numerous contributing missions, so that a common effort can achieve optimal complementarity and compatibility among the EO data from multiple data providers. This effort is done in coordination with important initiatives already working towards these goals (e. g. INSPIRE directive, CEOS initiatives, OGC standards, QA 4 EO etc.). This paper describes the main actions being undertaken by CQC to encourage harmonisation among space-based EO systems currently in service...|$|E

The method of assessment of performance of TFDs also allows the improvement of methodologies for designing high-resolution quadratic TFDs for time-frequency analysis of multicomponent signals. Different TFDs, including the modified B distribution, are optimized using this methodology.
