5|$|Horse rings, {{remnants}} {{of a time when}} horses and horse-drawn vehicles provided the primary mode of transportation, can be found throughout Portland, Oregon. They were removed from <b>curbs</b> and sidewalks for safety purposes until the late 1970s, when one Portland resident complained about the rings disappearing. Today, the city of Portland helps to preserve the rings by requiring them to be replaced following sidewalk construction or repair.|$|E
5|$|In Spring 2011, WSDOT began a $4.63million {{construction}} project to build wider lanes and shoulders on SR22 between I-82 {{and the city}} of Toppenish, because of a number of collisions along the roadway. Other improvements included installing new sidewalks with ADA-compliant <b>curbs</b> and access ramps, as well as adding turn lanes to side roads. The project was completed in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|About 18 percent (40,000) of the Uruguayan {{population}} (220,000) spoke Portuguese {{and regarded}} themselves as Brazilian rather than Uruguayan. Many within Flores' ranks were Brazilians, some hailing {{from the nearby}} Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Life along the frontier between Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay was often chaotic, with hostilities erupting between partisans of various cattle barons, cattle-rustling and random killings. Large landowners {{on both sides of}} the border had long been antagonistic toward Berro's policies. The Uruguayan president attempted to tax the cattle coming from Rio Grande do Sul and to impose <b>curbs</b> on the use of Brazilian slaves within Uruguayan territory; slavery had been outlawed years before in Uruguay.|$|E

5|$|The Village of Lincolnshire {{negotiated}} {{and signed}} an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan. The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents. Lincolnshire is served by a sanitary sewer that connects to the Lake County Sewage Treatment Plant, which lies on the Des Plaines River outside the Village limits; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of Lake County rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the Des Plaines River; to protect the river's cleaniness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains. A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their <b>curbs</b> during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris. The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders.|$|E
25|$|The street {{department}} {{is responsible for}} all town streets, sidewalks, <b>curbs,</b> and street signs. Although budgeted as a separate department the street department does not have dedicated employees. Employees from other utilities crossover to handle street duties. The street department patches holes, plows snow, installs street signs, repairs sidewalks and <b>curbs,</b> and paints <b>curbs.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Cottage Home was built, {{high-quality}} brick {{sidewalks and}} limestone <b>curbs</b> lined the streets. Today, {{some of these}} sidewalks and <b>curbs</b> remain and are cherished by the neighborhood as important features of the historic district. Brick sidewalks remain on portions of Highland Avenue and Dorman Street, including {{in front of the}} Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store. Stone <b>curbs</b> can still be found on portions of Highland Avenue, Dorman Street, Stillwell Street, and Oriental Street.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of types of <b>curb,</b> {{categorized}} by shape, material, height, and whether the <b>curb</b> is combined with a gutter. Most <b>curb</b> is constructed separately from the pavement, and the gutter is formed at the joint between the roadway and the <b>curb.</b> Combined <b>curb</b> and gutter (also called [...] "curb and channel") has a concrete <b>curb</b> and gutter cast together in one piece. [...] "Integral curb" [...] is <b>curbing</b> constructed integrally {{as a part of a}} concrete pavement.|$|R
5000|$|In Nashville, <b>Curb</b> {{has become}} a civic leader and benefactor of Belmont University, where his {{donation}} toward {{the construction of a}} new arena resulted in it being named the <b>Curb</b> Event Center.

50|$|<b>Curb</b> {{markings}} in the United States are {{prescribed by}} the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Local highway agencies may prescribe special colors for <b>curb</b> markings to supplement standard signs for parking regulation. California has designated {{an array of}} colors for <b>curb</b> regulations. A white <b>curb</b> designates passenger pick up or drop off. The green <b>curb</b> is for time limited parking. The yellow <b>curb</b> is for loading, and the blue <b>curb</b> is for disabled persons with proper vehicle identification. The red <b>curb</b> is for emergency vehicles only - fire lanes (no stopping, standing, or parking). In Oregon and Florida, the yellow <b>curb</b> is utilized to indicate no parking. In Georgia either red or yellow {{can be used to}} indicate no parking. In Seattle, Washington, alternating red and yellow <b>curb</b> markings indicate a bus stop.|$|R
25|$|During 1900, Highlands was {{incorporated}} and passed an ordinance prohibiting horses, cows and pigs from running {{loose on the}} streets. It also ordered that three-inch hemlock and chestnut planking be used as <b>curbs</b> along the officially designated streets.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Curb</b> rein: The rein {{used at the}} end of {{the shank}} of a <b>curb</b> bit or pelham. Modern <b>curb</b> reins usually buckle {{together}} at the ends, though reins of the classical <b>curb</b> were sewn together at the ends to create a single rein.|$|R
25|$|ULTra uses {{on-board}} batteries, recharged at stops. This {{increases the}} safety, {{and reduces the}} complexity, cost and maintenance of the guideway. As a result, a street-level ULTRa guideway resembles a sidewalk with <b>curbs</b> and is very inexpensive to construct. ULTRa resembles a small automated electric car, and uses similar components.|$|E
25|$|Original British-made Dinky Toys {{had been}} {{available}} in select cities in India from pre-war days until about 1955, when import <b>curbs</b> on toys came into effect.

50|$|The San Francisco <b>Curb</b> Exchange was a <b>curb</b> {{exchange}} {{opened in}} 1928, formed {{out of a}} re-organization of the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange and the San Francisco Mining Exchange. The San Francisco <b>Curb</b> Exchange replaced the Mining Exchange at the 350 Bush Street building. The <b>Curb</b> Exchange later left the building in 1938, when the <b>Curb</b> Exchange was absorbed by the San Francisco Stock Exchange.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the mining}} boom of 1905 and 1906, the <b>Curb</b> market {{attracted}} some negative publicity for the [...] "wholesale {{use of the}} <b>Curb</b> for swindling." [...] Around late 1907, Mendels as <b>Curb</b> agent began devoting {{most of his time}} to keeping the <b>Curb</b> market [...] "free of swindling stocks." [...] He organized the <b>Curb</b> Market Agency in 1908 that developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers.|$|R
25|$|In February 2010, {{some of the}} <b>curbs</b> on {{the free}} market were eased and a senior party {{official}} sacked after incidents of unrest. Pak Nam-gi, {{the director of the}} Planning and Finance Department of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, was later executed in 2010. North Korea denied any serious crisis relating to the revaluation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{high-quality}} Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems {{also use}} high platforms at station stops to allow fast and efficient level boarding and alighting, but potentially leaving hazardous {{gaps between the}} platforms and the buses. Alignment setups such as Kassel <b>curbs</b> help to reduce platform gaps without requiring time-consuming manual alignment at each BRT station stop.|$|E
25|$|An {{extension}} east of KY 922 (Newtown Pike) was not originally planned. However, Newtown Springs, a {{new development}} project taking place east of KY 922 and the eastern terminus of Citation Boulevard, incorporated {{an extension of the}} route east towards KY 353 (Russell Cave Road). It is being constructed as a two-lane road with <b>curbs</b> and sidewalks.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{undesirable}} consequences {{when using}} {{a very tight}} <b>curb</b> chain. First, the bit immediately exerts <b>curb</b> pressure and increased pressure on the bars as soon as pressure {{is applied to the}} reins. Therefore, a tight <b>curb</b> chain is much harsher, and provides less finesse in signaling the horse than a looser <b>curb</b> chain would, as the horse is never given a chance to respond before the <b>curb</b> chain engages. Secondly, an extremely tight <b>curb</b> chain causes the mouthpiece to constantly push down on the sensitive tongue, never allowing the horse relief.|$|R

25|$|Speed bumps vary in length, but it {{is typical}} to leave space between the bump and either edge of an {{enclosed}} road (i.e. with <b>curbs</b> and gutters) to allow for drainage. Spaces on either side may also allow more expedient passage for emergency vehicles, though effectiveness {{will depend on the}} type of vehicle and specific road design.|$|E
25|$|Dissatisfaction with Man o' War {{has been}} {{widespread}} in Lexington {{almost from the}} road's completion, despite its undeniable usefulness in connecting the rapidly growing suburban areas of southern Lexington to Interstate 75. Common complaints are the number of traffic lights, the presence of high <b>curbs,</b> {{and the lack of}} breakdown lanes to prevent stalled or wrecked vehicles from blocking traffic.|$|E
25|$|The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) {{planned to}} send a large team of {{election}} monitors to Russia for the election, but scuttled the plans after accusing Moscow of imposing <b>curbs</b> and delaying monitors' visas (Russian officials denied the claim). Consequently, only 400 foreign monitors from international organisations (330 of them from OSCE) were on hand to observe at some of Russia's 95,000 polling stations.|$|E
