There was however, even before the elections were in progress, several indicators of conflict such as pervasive use of inflammatory campaign rhetoric. Within minutes of the Electoral <b>Commission</b> of Kenya’s <b>declaration</b> of President Kibaki's victory, tribe-based rioting and violence broke out across the country. The results announced showed both a rapid disintegration of Odinga’s previously large lead during the tallying of votes, and a 2. 5 % margin between the two leading candidates. As a result, suspicions of tampering were high, not least because the opposition had won 99 seats to PNU’s 43 at the parliamentary level.

500|$|Following the 1936 {{general strike}} {{that was to}} {{degenerate}} into the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the most significant outbreak of violence since the Mandate began, a British Royal Commission – a high profile public inquiry – was appointed to investigate {{the causes of the}} unrest. The [...] "Palestine Royal Commission", appointed with significantly broader terms of reference than the previous British inquiries into Palestine, completed its 404-page report after sixmonths of work in June 1937, publishing it a month later. The report began by describing the history of the problem, including a detailed summary of the origins of the Balfour Declaration. Much of this summary relied on Lloyd-George's personal testimony; Balfour had died in 1930 and Sykes in 1919. He told the <b>commission</b> that the <b>declaration</b> was made [...] "due to propagandist reasons... In particular Jewish sympathy would confirm the support of American Jewry, and would {{make it more difficult for}} Germany to reduce her military commitments and improve her economic position on the eastern front".

40|$| {{determine}} {{within those}} sources {{to what extent}} distinct facts affect others. Nonetheless, in a specific sense, one can affirm that theological-catechetical investigations are some sort of movement from the bottom up, and that they influence the above mentioned official normative Church documents, however, in like manner, the documents of the Church’s Magisterium compel further theological-catechetical investigation. Furthermore, for sake of a concrete realization of spiritual formation of catechists, one must mention that present-day scientific theological investigations influence {{the creation of a}} model for the spirituality of catechists which would be seen as a function of such formation. This very topic is the subject of investigation in the third chapter of the dissertation, namely, Models for Spirituality which are Realized in the Life and Work of Catechists along with a Theoretical Review. Of the better-known models arrived at by contemporary theological investigations, one must mention the following: the functional model, (French model), the relational model (Italy), the biblical model, (Italy), the Christocentric-ecclesial model, (Italy), the practical model, (Italy), and the model which integrates spirituality as part of one’s upbringing, (Germany). The investigations of this dissertation {{come to the conclusion that}} no recognizable structural Croatian model as a tenet, and in a formal sense, exists for the spiritual formation of catechists such as is found in the mentioned nations; hence, need compels that one project such a model. The above mentioned theoretical investigations concentrated on a conception of spirituality for lay catechists which engendered the cognition that the spirituality of catechists is one of the fundamental marks of his profile, that is to say, of his identity. Such an identity is shaped in three successive phases, namely, the phase wherein one decides to choose to be a catechist; the phase engaging in fundamental study; and phase of continual formation. This is a matter of a unique process wherein the catechist dynamically integrates these three phases. This, then, brings to light the fact that the spirituality of a lay catechist is not given in advance; rather such spirituality has its very own anthropological-theological origins and its very own fundamental and whole-life path of development. The second part of the dissertation which covers three chapters, namely, The Identification of the Starting Point governing Spirituality based on Contemporary CroatianChurch-Societal Conditions with a View to the Future, establishes through a qualitative and empirical investigation the true state of spirituality of lay catechists in Croatia. The first chapter, namely, A Methodological Approach: qualitative investigation, concentrates on the theoretical-methodological foundations used in the qualitative sociological investigations. As regards the sample used in the qualitative investigation, 41 subjects were used: 24 elementary school catechists and 17 middle school catechists. Two variables were taken into consideration in the choice of subjects, namely, age and experience, (years of service). The age variable for the groups studied ranged from younger subjects (25 - 38 years of age) through older subjects (39 - 60 years of age). As regards the variable governing experience, those with a lower experience level (1 - 9 years) are differentiated from those with a higher work experience (10 - 19 years). As regards age, the sample includes 21 younger subjects and 20 subjects of advanced age. All subjects worked in elementary or middle schools. A clear conclusion is established which indicates that the sample as relates to age is balanced between those who are younger and those who are older. In this manner and in a methodological sense, they represent Croatia in totality. For sake of a concrete insight into the real state of spirituality among lay catechists in Croatia, it was decided that the empirical investigation should aim to be qualitative: the method would make use of a structured-narrative-interview paradigm. In carrying out this approach, all methodological-technical aspects inherent to interviews-in-depth were observed. The plan governing interviews with the participants unfolded on the basis of a prepared set of questions which consisted of ten general questions formulated to be partly open and partly tailored to the situation when it became a matter of relations between the subject and the interviewer. From the point of view of content, the ten questions used in the interviews can, for sake of easy reference, be condensed as three thematic elements. The first element encompasses: the call, the <b>commission,</b> concrete <b>declaration,</b> and realization of spirituality in the lay catechist; the second element encompasses: the sources and growth in spirituality in the lay catechist and its influence on the catechist’s actions; the third element encompasses: the spiritual formation of the lay catechist. Respecting methodological procedures appropriate to deep-probing interviews, the conversations were carried out in various locations wherein those being sampled lived. They took place in a relaxed atmosphere in places such as monastic sites, catechetical offices, pastoral centers, and, in one instance, in a family home. Appropriate space and atmosphere for the nature of such deep-probing interviews sought to be assured and was chosen to be suitable to the person being interviewed. Prior to the start of the interview, each participant was made aware of the purpose of the interview and the approach to be used. This was done in accordance with standard interview procedures and the person being interviewed was sufficiently informed that his anonymity was guaranteed. The average interview lasted between one and one-half hours to as much as two hours. In some cases, the interview lasted even longer due to the degree of ability of the person being interviewed to communicate his thoughts. The conversations with the subjects were digitally recorded and duly transcribed in computer format. Appropriate notations for each of the conversations were simultaneously notated as the conversations were entered into the computer. So as to maintain the necessary degree of concentration for the subject and the interviewer, no more than three conversations were held on any given day. The entire cycle of conversations took place from the end of August to the beginning of December, 2010. In the second chapter, namely, An Analytic Interpretation of the Results of Qualitative Facts, synthetic deliberations of the interviewed catechists are interpreted in light of relevant theoretical reflections. Under the third heading, namely, The Formation of the spirituality of the Catechist with a View to the Future, the results of the investigations covered within the entire dissertation are expressed and particular emphasis on the Croatian Church-society situation regarding the spirituality of lay catechists as regards the future. Hence, this chapter can be considered to be the concluding chapter of the dissertation. The chapter assumes a three-part structure: the first part highlights the results of the deliberations on spirituality by Croatian authors exclusively, thereby making it possible to compare the Croatian actuality regarding the spirituality of lay catechists with that of the universal Church and the European situation. This gives way to the conclusion that in Croatia, at least at present, no recognizable systematic model for the formation of catechists exists. In the second part, the results of the empirical investigation are presented in the form of a condensed formulation of the thesis. On the basis of the first two parts of this chapter, an outline in the form of a model for the formation of lay catechists having an integrated dimension of spirituality is presented in the concluding portion of the dissertation. This model of formation is structured on a universally accepted three-dimensional schematic framework based on competence, that is, competence not only of the teacher, but even more so that of the catechists of the 21 st Century: to be-to know-to know to do. Congruent to the nature of the dissertation, a series of mutually complementary methods follow: the method of analysis and synthesis, the method of description, narration and comparison, a descriptive method for deep-probing interviews, and a method for the projection of formational models. The goal of the dissertation concentrates on creating a recognizably structured contemporary Croatian model for the formation of catechists which would result in an integrated spiritual dimension in their person and would be founded on an expert and scientific basis. At the same time, by doing so, a crucial assist will be offered to those responsible for the formation of catechists so that they can critically evaluate such efforts in this regard up to the present time. Because of the suitably set goal of the dissertation, it is appropriate to conclude that the dissertation, in an original and scientific manner, contributes to the creation of a Croatian model for the formation of lay catechists who would have an integrated spiritual dimension to their person. If one takes into consideration the fact that the question of the spirituality of lay catechists has not been systematically treated in any Croatian language work thus far, then the above mentioned contribution achieves full expression. With the contribution of this dissertation, it can be hoped that specific improvised and inaccurate evaluations regarding the question of the spirituality of lay catechists can be overcome and that it will serve as an innovation to the formation of a spiritual profile for lay catechists in Croatia...|$|R
