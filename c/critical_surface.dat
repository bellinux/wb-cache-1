40|$|Abstract. Boundary {{conditions}} {{and the nature of}} the <b>critical</b> <b>surfaces</b> for the problem of stationary MHD outflows are formulated from the point of view of the causality principle. It is shown that the number of the boundary conditions which have to be specified on the surface of the object ejecting plasma is equal to the number of MHD waves outgoing normally from this surface. The boundary conditions for objects of different nature are formulated. It is shown that the spherically symmetric Parker solution of the pure hydrodynamical outflow of the plasma from the surface of the star with a given temperature and density of the plasma on the surface of the star is not the unique solution. To pick out the unique solution of this problem an additional condition defining the tangential components of the velocity of the plasma on the surface of the star must be specified. The nature and properties of the <b>critical</b> <b>surfaces</b> are studied and the rules to determine the <b>critical</b> <b>surfaces</b> in MHD flow are proposed. In the general case, the <b>critical</b> <b>surfaces</b> where the general solution of the problem is singular are placed on characteristics.

We classify <b>critical</b> <b>surfaces</b> of a real polynomial f into three classes: repeated, intersected and primal <b>critical</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These different <b>critical</b> <b>surfaces</b> are defined by some essential factors of f, where an essential factor of f means a polynomial factor of f - c 0, for some constant c 0. We show that the degree sum of repeated <b>critical</b> <b>surfaces</b> is at most d - 1, where d is the degree of f. When a real polynomial f has only two variables, we give the minimum upper bound {{for the number of}} other isolated critical points even when there are nondegenerate critical curves, and the minimum upper bound of isolated local extrema even when there are saddle curves. We show that a normal polynomial has no odd degree essential factors, and all of its even degree essential factors are normal polynomials, up to a sign change. We show that if a normal quartic polynomial f has a normal quadratic essential factor, a global minimum of f can be either easily found, or located within the interior(s) of one or two ellipsoids. We also show that a normal quartic polynomial can have at most one local maximum. Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|R
