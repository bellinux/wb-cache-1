40|$|Database <b>cracking</b> {{has been}} an area of active {{research}} in recent years. The core idea of database <b>cracking</b> is to create indexes adaptively and incrementally as a side-product of query processing. Several works have proposed different <b>cracking</b> techniques for different aspects including updates, tuple-reconstruction, convergence, concurrency-control, and robustness. However, {{there is a lack}} of any comparative study of these different methods by an independent group. In this paper, we conduct an experimental study on database <b>cracking.</b> Our goal is to critically review several aspects, identify the potential, and propose promising directions in database <b>cracking.</b> With this study, we hope to expand the scope of database <b>cracking</b> and possibly leverage <b>cracking</b> in database engines other than MonetDB. We repeat several prior database <b>cracking</b> works including the core <b>cracking</b> algorithms as well as three other works on convergence (hybrid <b>cracking),</b> tuple-reconstruction (sideways <b>cracking),</b> and robustness (stochastic <b>cracking)</b> respectively. We evaluate these works and show possible directions to do even better. We further test <b>cracking</b> under a variety of experimental settings, including high selectivity queries, low selectivity queries, and multiple query access patterns. Finally, we compare <b>cracking</b> against different sorting algorithms as well as against different main-memory optimised indexes, including the recently proposed Adaptive Radix Tree (ART). Our results show that: (i) the previously proposed <b>cracking</b> algorithms are repeatable, (ii) there is still enough room to significantly improve the previously proposed <b>cracking</b> algorithms, (iii) <b>cracking</b> depends heavily on query selectivity, (iv) <b>cracking</b> needs to catch up with modern indexing trends, and (v) different indexing algorithms have different indexing signatures...|$|R

25|$|Polyethylene with {{multimodal}} {{molecular weight}} distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, stress <b>crack</b> resistance and an increased <b>crack</b> propagation resistance.

The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress <b>crack</b> resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal {{molecular weight distribution}} can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, Vickers {{indentation}} {{was used}} to study the resistance to <b>cracking</b> of electroless nickel phosphorus coatings. For low indentation loads, <b>cracking</b> initiates only at {{the tips of the}} indent (primary <b>cracking).</b> It was shown that these <b>cracks</b> are of the Palmqvist type. For higher loads, new <b>cracks,</b> for which initiation sites are located on the edges of the indent, begin to form (secondary <b>cracking).</b> It was found that this change in the <b>cracking</b> mechanism occurs when the primary <b>cracks</b> reach the interface with the substrate. This result shows that the interface resistance to <b>cracking</b> is higher than the cohesion of the coating. In addition, it was possible to apply the same formulae whatever the <b>cracking</b> process, if the total number of <b>cracks</b> was divided by 4, like for the first <b>cracking</b> process.

50|$|Edge <b>cracking</b> is the {{formation}} of crescent-shaped <b>cracks</b> {{near the edge of}} a road. It is caused by lack of support of the road edge, sometimes due to poorly drained or weak shoulders. If left untreated, additional <b>cracks</b> will form until it resembles fatigue <b>cracking.</b> Like wheel-path fatigue <b>cracking,</b> poor drainage is a main cause of edge <b>cracking,</b> as it weakens the base, which hastens the deterioration of the pavement. Water ponding (a buildup of water which can also be called puddling) happens more frequently near the edge than {{in the center of the}} road path, as roads are usually sloped to prevent in-lane ponding. This leads to excess moisture in the shoulders and subbase at the road edge. Edge <b>cracking</b> differs from fatigue <b>cracking</b> in that the <b>cracks</b> form from the top down, where fatigue <b>cracks</b> usually start at the bottom and propagate to the surface.|$|R
