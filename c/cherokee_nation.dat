5|$|Maldonado {{filed suit}} in the South Carolina U.S. District Court on July 24, 2013, asking that the ICWA be {{declared}} unconstitutional. On July 31, 2013, the Capobiancos legally adopted the child. Concurrently with the South Carolina court finalizing the adoption, the Native American Rights Fund filed a civil rights lawsuit in U.S. District Court {{on behalf of the}} child, alleging that her rights had been violated by the South Carolina court. In addition, a South Carolina court order cannot be enforced in Oklahoma without the agreement of an Oklahoma court, and Brown stated that he would fight the order in Oklahoma, with the aid of the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation.</b> Prior to the South Carolina adoption being finalized, the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> District Court granted temporary guardianship to Brown's wife and parents while Brown was in military training out of state. At the same time, a judge in South Carolina ordered Brown to immediately turn over the child to the Capobiancos, which representatives of the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> said was impossible while Brown was performing his military duties.|$|E
5|$|The elder Hindman {{frequently}} made {{business trips}} to Alabama and even moved {{the family to}} Jacksonville after buying several lots of land there. He {{took advantage of the}} many local business opportunities and was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. He also gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included Cherokee Indian tribes in the area. Hindman became trusted by the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> and was appointed as the sub-agent to the Cherokees by President James Monroe. After Andrew Jackson became President, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of United States Agent for the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation.</b> The elder Hindman frequently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the interests of the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation,</b> and in 1841 was assigned by Acting Secretary of War Albert M. Lea to determine why the Cherokees in North Carolina had rejected the government's suggestion to join other parts of the tribe in Indian Territory. Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to rejoin the rest of their nation further West.|$|E
5|$|The English {{language}} has been {{official in the}} state of Oklahoma since 2010. The variety of North American English spoken is called Oklahoma English, and this dialect is quite diverse with its uneven blending of features of North Midland, South Midland, and Southern dialects. In 2000, 2,977,187 Oklahomans—92.6% of the resident population five years or older—spoke only English at home, a decrease from 95% in 1990. 238,732 Oklahoma residents reported speaking a language other than English in the 2000 census, about 7.4% of the state's population. Spanish is the second-most commonly spoken language in the state, with 141,060 speakers counted in 2000. The two most commonly spoken native North American languages are Cherokee and Choctaw with 10,000 Cherokee speakers living within the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> tribal jurisdiction area of eastern Oklahoma, and another 10,000 Choctaw speakers living in the Choctaw Nation directly south of the Cherokees. Cherokee is an official language in the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> tribal jurisdiction area and in the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.|$|E
2500|$|In 1861, Quantrill went to Texas with a slaveholder named Marcus Gill. There he met Joel B. Mayes {{and joined}} the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nations.</b> [...] Mayes was a half Scots-Irish, half Cherokee Indian Confederate sympathizer and a war chief of the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nations</b> in Texas. [...] He had moved from Georgia to the old Indian Territory in 1838. Mayes enlisted {{and served as a}} private in Company A of the 1st Cherokee Regiment in the Confederate army. It was Mayes who taught Quantrill guerrilla warfare tactics. He would learn the ambush {{fighting}} tactics used by the Native Americans as well as sneak attacks and camouflage. Quantrill, in the company of Mayes and the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nations,</b> joined with General Sterling Price and fought at the Battle of Wilson's Creek and Lexington in August and September 1861.|$|R

5|$|The Overhill town of Chota, {{in present-day}} Monroe County, Tennessee, was {{recognized}} as the de facto capital of the entire <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> {{for most of the}} 18th century, when it was the major settlement. The town of Tanasi became the namesake for the state of Tennessee. Many prominent Cherokee leaders, including Attakullakulla, Oconastota, Nancy Ward, and Sequoyah, were born and raised in Overhill towns.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court (18011835) had {{repeatedly}} {{taken up the}} issue of aboriginal title in the United States. However, with the exception of <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> v. Georgia (1831), which was dismissed for lack of original jurisdiction, all the disputes had been between non-Indianstypically between those who derived their title from the government and those who derived their title from private purchases from Indians. The uniform rule of these cases, enunciated most clearly in Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823), was that non-Indians could not acquire valid land title from such private purchases. However, the purchase at issue in Fellows, the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838), had been ratified by the federal government.|$|E

5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary document and found no proof of Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{along the}} lower Little Tennessee, lower Tellico, and lower Hiwassee rivers, the Overhill towns rose to {{prominence}} within the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> {{in the early}} 18th century, when they began to standardize trade with the British colonists. In {{the early part of}} the century, the Overhill towns' remote location at the far end of the Trading Path meant they were reached only by those traders and explorers adventurous enough to make the difficult journey to the interior over the mountain range. By the middle of the century, the Overhill towns were consistently courted by both British and French emissaries, as the two powers struggled for the control of the continent and the lucrative fur trade.|$|E

5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation.</b> Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{also took}} {{up the issue of}} white {{settlement}} in Indian Territory. For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the Unassigned Lands in what is now Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Five Civilized Tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as Boomers, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the Homestead Acts. The federal government disagreed, as did the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation,</b> which leased its neighboring Cherokee Outlet to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed the Boomers to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw the issue as one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize Indian Territory and the neighboring Neutral Strip into a new Oklahoma Territory. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land to be open to white settlement.|$|E
25|$|The {{judicial}} {{branch of}} tribal government includes the District Court and Supreme Court, which {{is comparable to}} the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court consists of five members who are appointed by the Principal Chief and confirmed by the council. It is the highest court of the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> and oversees internal legal disputes and the District Court. The District Judge and an Associate District Judge preside over the tribe’s District Court and hear all cases brought before it under jurisdiction of the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> Judicial Code. <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> has two tribal courts, the District Court and the Supreme Court. The <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> Marshal Service polices the tribe. A wide range of tribal businesses are operated by <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> Entertainment (CNE) and <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> Businesses (CNB), based in Catoosa, Oklahoma and <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> Industries (CNI), based in Stilwell, Oklahoma. The tribal newspaper is the Cherokee Phoenix. The <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> operates Sequoyah High School and W. W. Hastings Hospital, both based in Tahlequah. The Nation also operates a medical clinic, the Wilma P. Mankiller Clinic, and Marietta School in Stilwell.|$|E

5000|$|Following this treaty, some dispute {{remained}} {{as to whether}} the Iroquois had ceded only the Shenandoah Valley, or all their claims south of the Ohio. Moreover, much of this land beyond the Alleghenies was disputed by claims of the Shawnee and <b>Cherokee</b> <b>nations.</b> The Iroquois recognized the English right to settle south of the Ohio at Logstown in 1752.

25|$|The Delaware Tribe of Indians (Lenape) {{became part}} of the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> in 1867. On 28 July 2009 it {{achieved}} independent federal recognition as a tribe.

25|$|On September 26, 2004, Lucy Allen, a Freedmen descendant, filed {{a lawsuit}} with the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> Supreme Court, asserting that the acts barring Freedmen {{descendants}} from tribal membership were unconstitutional, {{in the case of}} Allen v. <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> Tribal Council. On March 7, 2006, the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> Judicial Appeals Tribunal ruled in Allen's favor in a 2–1 decision that the descendants of the Cherokee Freedmen were Cherokee citizens and were allowed to enroll in the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation.</b> This was based on the facts that the Freedmen were listed as members on the Dawes Rolls and that the 1975 Cherokee Constitution did not exclude them from citizenship or have a blood requirement for membership. This ruling overturned the previous ruling in Riggs v. Ummerteskee. More than 800 Freedmen descendants have enrolled in the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> since the ruling was made – out of up to 45,000 potentially eligible people.|$|E
25|$|Through several legal {{proceedings}} in United States and <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> courts, the Freedmen descendants conducted litigation {{to regain their}} treaty rights and recognition as <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> members. While the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> filed a complaint {{in federal court in}} early 2012, Freedmen descendants and the United States Department of the Interior filed separate counterclaims on July 2, 2012. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld tribal sovereignty, but stated that the cases had to be combined due to the same parties being involved. On May 5, 2014 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, oral arguments were made in the first hearing on the merits of the case. On August 30, 2017, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the Freedmen descendants and the U.S. Department of the Interior, granting the Freedmen descendants full rights to citizenship in the <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation.</b> The <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> has accepted this decision, effectively ending the dispute.|$|E
50|$|After the war, a {{preliminary}} intertribal peace conference with the United States commissioners {{was held at}} Fort Smith on September 8, 1865.
