50|$|Biofuel usage in Sweden {{has been}} {{increasing}} since 1970, growing from around 43 TWh in 1970 to 127 TWh in 2009. This increase is usually linked to the heavy expansion of biomass based district heating in 1980s. The oil crisis between 1973 and 1979 has stimulated the transition from oil to other energy sources such as peat and biomass. Swedish government created financial incentives for transitioning from fossil fuels to biofuels. Simultaneously the wood related industries were growing, using increasing amounts of wood as fuel and providing black liquor to the industry as bi-product. Finally, taxation of other energy sources, {{has contributed to the}} increase of biofuel usage, as taxes on fossil fuels have increased since 1990. One of the examples is <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>tax,</b> introduced in 1991, as a measure to reduce Sweden's environmental impact.

For consumption, currently regulated emissions are reasonably uniform over space, while currently unregulated emissions vary much more substantially and are spatially concentrated in the commuter belts. This suggests that new regulation may run into local opposition. The incidence of a carbon tax correlates negatively with votes for the Green Party in the 2007 general election. Emissions from production are clustered around the cities but the spatial pattern is dominated by a small number of point sources (which are already regulated).

40|$|Simulation {{experiments}} are conducted, comparing {{the effects of}} a common reduction of CO 2 emissions within the European Union to a Swedish unilateral decicion to reduce CO 2 emissions. A numerical general equilibrium model, GEM-E 3, has been used as analytical tool. The model covers all European Union countries, with production disaggregated into 18 sectors. The 13 consumption goods included are classified into three consumption categories (durable, non-linked non-durable and linked durable goods) in order to imporve the energy allocation description. In addition, industry exemption of CO 2 tax is studied. The results indicate that if Sweden unilaterally decides to increase its <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>tax,</b> the total European Union carbon dioxide emissions will increase, i. e. there will be a "carbon leakage" effect. Perhaps more surprisingly, a European Union multilateral implementation of a <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>tax</b> rate will induce a lower welfare (exluding environmental benefits) in Sweden as compared to the situation where the same <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>tax</b> was introduced unilaterally in Sweden.

40|$|How to {{significantly}} decrease {{carbon dioxide emissions}} {{has become one of}} the largest challenges faced by modern society. The standard recipe prescribed by most economists is to put a price on carbon, either through a tax or through emissions trading. Such measures can reduce emissions cost-effectively and create incentives for technological development. There is, however, a growing concern that the carbon prices generated through the European Union emission trading system (EU ETS) have been too low to create the incentives necessary to stimulate technological development. This paper empirically analyzes how the Swedish <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>tax</b> and the EU ETS have affected productivity development in the Swedish pulp and paper industry 1998 - 2008. A Luenberger total factor productivity (TFP) indicator is computed using data envelopment analysis. How the policy measures affect TFP is assessed using a system generalized method of moments estimator. The results show that climate policy had a modest impact on technological development in the pulp and paper industry, and if significant it has been negative. The price on fossil fuels, on the contrary, seems to have created important incentives for technological development. Hence, results suggest that the carbon prices faced by the industry through EU ETS and the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>tax</b> have been too low...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of energy crisis {{and global warming}} necessitates presenting strategies in order to decrease the amount of emissions as well as fuel consumption in large and complex industries such as refineries and petrochemical industries. Generally, refinery steam networks are regarded as units which consume fuel enormously. In this paper, the steam network of Tehran Oil Refinery is considered as an industrial case study. Then, various scenarios are proposed to modify the network. In this regard, the network and suggested scenarios are initially modeled into STAR software environment. Next, they are simulated to estimate process parameters and costs. Afterwards, each scenario is separately optimized and, after comparison, the best scenario is chosen {{from the viewpoint of}} total annualized cost (TAC). The objective function of optimization is to minimize TAC. At the second stage, the amount of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> production is calculated for all the proposed scenarios, before and after optimization. In addition, the tax of production (Kyoto Protocol) is added to the TAC of each scenario. Since in this version of STAR software, the effects of CO 2 emission have not been taken into account, a combination of the results of TAC in the software considering CO 2 and its effect on TAC has been considered as a new investigation. In fact, both economical and environmental issues are taken into account.

Several more countries will probably join them in the near future, for example Finland, Sweden and Spain. The objectives are twofold: to increase efficiency and to contribute both locally and globally to environmental improvement. Even larger regions like the European Union, plan to deregulate their internal electricity markets. For the EU this implies introduction of third party access to the transmission grid within and between the Union member countries. In this context, the Scandinavian push towards deregulation is an interesting experiment. We discuss the consequences of an international deregulation of electricity markets on the basis from simulations on an empirical energy market model for the Nordic countries. Deregulation may have severe effects on the location of new power plants within the Nordic area and implies a large impact on the income distribution both among countries and between electricity producers and consumers. The beneficial effects of deregulation are highly dependent upon the Nordic natural gas trade and prices.

The need for high efficiency becomes important in gas constrained situations where savings in fuel auto consumption of the plant for liquefaction chilling and power generation can be converted into LNG production and also from the standpoint of CO 2 reduction. This paper will provide a comprehensive overview of waste heat recovery approaches in LNG Liquefaction facilities as a measure to boost {{thermal efficiency}} and reduce fuel auto-consumption. The paper will cover types of heating media, the need and use of heat for process applications, the use of hot oil, steam and water for process applications and direct recovery of waste heat. Cogeneration and combined cycle approaches for LNG liquefaction will also be presented along with thermal designs. Parametric studies and cycle studies relating to waste heat recovery from gas turbines used in LNG liquefaction plants will be provided. The economic viability of waste heat recovery {{and the extent to which}} heat integration is deployed will depend on the magnitude of the accrual of operating cost savings, and their ability to counteract the initial capital outlay. Savings can be in the form of reduced fuel gas costs and reduced <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>taxes.</b> Ultimately the impact of these savings will depend on the owner’s measurement of the value of fuel gas; whether fuel usage is accounted for as lost feed or lost product. The negative impacts include the reduction in nitrogen rejection that occurs with reduced fuel gas usage and the power restrictions imposed on gas turbine drivers due to the increased exhaust system back-pressure caused by the presence of the WHRU. When steam systems are acceptable, a cogeneration type liquefaction facility can be attractive.

One of the most expanding sources of electric power in the industrialised world today is the gas-fired combined cycle, combining high efficiency and low investment cost. In this paper, the integration of a post-combustion CO 2 -separation unit into a combined cycle is studied from a thermodynamic and economic point-of-view. A standard dual-pressure combined cycle is chosen as a reference cycle. It is compared to a dual-pressure combined cycle and a triple-pressure combined cycle with the lowest pressure level producing steam for a CO 2 -separation unit. The steam pressure levels in the different cycles are optimised for maximum efficiency and minimum specific cost, respectively, using genetic algorithms. The efficiency drop due to CO 2 -separation is approximately 8 % points, from 54 to 46 %.

For this purpose, we use linked applied general equilibrium (AGE) models for 11 EU member countries. This method enables us to measure the change in competitiveness for domestic industries; the effect on growth, employment and inflation in member countries; and the costs and benefits of a coordinated versus an uncoordinated approach to adhere to an EU target of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Unemployment is high in the EU, and many economists believe that this problem as well as global warming can be solved by a CO 2 tax, where tax revenues are used to reduce employers' contributions to social insurance. Then, hopefully, a'double dividend will result for the environment as well as for the labor market. In one simulation, each country implements a CO 2 tax to limit CO 2 emissions by 10 %.

Since the IGCC* and IGCCM plants have additional costs related to the capture and disposal of the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> a <b>Carbon</b> <b>Tax</b> (adopted in some countries like Sweden) proportional to the number of kilograms of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> released in the environment was assumed. According to the economical analysis, the IGCCM plant proved to be more convenient than the IGCC* one. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 10. 1016 /j. enconman. 2007. 04. 02...|$|R
40|$|The Energy Foundation's China Sustainable Energy Program (CSEP) has {{undertaken}} a major project investigating fiscal and tax policy options for stimulating {{energy efficiency and}} renewable energy development in China. This report, {{which is part of}} the sectoral sub-project studies on energy efficiency in industry, surveys international experience with tax and fiscal policies directed toward increasing investments in energy efficiency in the industrial sector. The report begins with an overview of tax and fiscal policies, including descriptions and evaluations of programs that use energy or energy-related <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO 2) <b>taxes,</b> pollution levies, public benefit charges, grants or subsidies, subsidized audits, loans, tax relief for specific technologies, and tax relief as part of an energy or greenhouse gas (GHG) emission tax or agreement scheme. Following the discussion of these individual policies, the report reviews experience with integrated programs found in two countries as well as with GHG emissions trading programs. The report concludes with a discussion of the best practices related to international experience with tax and fiscal policies to encourage investment in energy efficiency in industry...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the macroeconomic effects of limiting China's CO 2 emissions {{by using a}} time-recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Chinese economy. The baseline scenario for the Chinese economy over the period to 2010 is first developed under a set of assumptions about the exogenous variables. Next, we analyze the macroeconomic implications of two less restrictive scenarios under which China's CO 2 emissions in 2010 will be cut by 20 % and 30 % respectively relative to the baseline, assuming that carbon tax revenues are retained by the government. Then, we compute the efficiency improvement of four indirect tax offset scenarios relative to the two tax retention scenarios above. Furthermore, a comparison with other studies for China, which include the well-known global studies based on GLOBAL 2100 and GREEN, is made {{in terms of both}} the baseline scenarios and carbon constraint ones. The paper ends with some concluding remarks. <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> emissions, <b>carbon</b> <b>tax,</b> China, computable general equilibrium model, energy consumption, GLOBAL 2100, GREEN, macroeconomic effects. ...|$|R
