40|$|The {{realization}} of maximum adhesive forces for a railway vehicle {{is a very}} difficult process, because it involves using tractive efforts and depends on friction characteristics in the contact zone between wheels and rails. Tractive efforts are realized by means <b>of</b> <b>tractive</b> torques <b>of</b> motors, and their maximum values can provide negative effects such as slip and skid. These situations usually happen when information about friction conditions is lacking. The negative processes have a major influence on wearing of contact bodies and <b>tractive</b> <b>units.</b> Therefore, many existing control systems for vehicles use an effect of a prediction of a friction coefficient between wheels and rails because measuring a friction coefficient at the moment of running vehicle movement is very difficult. One of the ways to solve this task is to use noise spectrum analysis for friction coefficient detection. This noise phenomenon has not been clearly studied and analyzed. In this paper, we propose an adhesion control system of railway vehicles based on an observer, which allows one to determine the maximum tractive torque based on the optimal adhesive force between the wheels (wheel pair) of a railway vehicle and rails (rail track) depending on weight load from a wheel to a rail, friction conditions in the contact zone, a lateral displacement of wheel set and wheel sleep. As a result, it allows a railway vehicle to be driven in a tractive mode by the maximum adhesion force for real friction conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{adhesion}} {{in the field}} of rail transport represents an ability <b>of</b> <b>tractive</b> force transmission between wheel and rail. Adhesion characteristics is a property of tangential forces transmission between wheel and rail and represents the dependence <b>of</b> <b>tractive</b> force T or adhesion coefficient μ on creep velocity w, or, divided by speed of travel, dependence on relative creep s. The ascending branch of adhesion characteristics is of great importance and acts as one of significant input parameters to drive regulation systems. It is needed to determine value of initial steepness (cTs or cμs) which is defined as an increment <b>of</b> <b>tractive</b> force or adhesion coefficient, respectively, related to a small increment of relative creep. Knowledge on the descending branch is no less important. Thorough understanding of related phenomena and limits of both parts of adhesion characteristics enables an effective exploitation <b>of</b> vehicle <b>tractive</b> and braking abilities. A theoretical model of the adhesion mechanism is briefly presented in the introduction to this paper. Following, description of a test stand of a tram wheel driven by a synchronous motor is given, as well as description of experiments conducted by the authors at it. Attention is paid to results of experimental research concerning identification of parameters of the ascending and the descending branch of adhesion characteristics. The paper summarizes this results and compares results of authors‘ own experiments to it...|$|R
