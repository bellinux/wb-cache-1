"You kept {{your eyes}} upon the ground--glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw {{you were still}} {{thinking}} of the stones,) until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word 'stereotomy,' a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement. I knew {{that you could not}} say to yourself 'stereotomy' without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday's 'Musée,' the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the <b>cobbler</b> <b>s</b> change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed.

40|$|In scholarship, one writes {{with the}} overt {{aspiration}} to persuade {{but much more}} primitively with the urgent desire to be seriously engaged in ongoing scholarly conversation. To be carefully read and answered by seven commentators of this power and brilliance is a treasure beyond all reasonable expectation. Of course, no one exactly enjoys going under the surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knife,</b> but I am nevertheless deeply grateful for these illuminating and helpful comments, {{as well as for}} Professor James Weinstein 2 ̆ 7 s masterly efforts to organize them. I cannot sufficiently express the loss we have all experienced by Professor C. Edwin Baker 2 ̆ 7 s untimely death as this symposium {{was in the process of}} creation. I should say at the outset that Professor Vincent Blasi most generously catches the fundamental aspiration of my own work, which is to provide an account of First Amendment doctrine that gives 2 ̆ 2 considerable weight to ease of explanation and comprehension, feasibility of implementation in an imperfect institutional environment. 2 ̆ 2 Legal principles should 2 ̆ 2 be made objective enough and authoritative enough to control adaptive rule making. 2 ̆ 2 The inevitable consequence is a certain degree of pragmatic simplification, which is exemplified by my effort to develop a lexically fundamental purpose for First Amendment doctrine...|$|R

50|$|Sati, was {{the first}} wife of Shiva as the first {{incarnation}} of Parvati. She {{was the daughter of}} King Daksha and Queen (the daughter of Brahma). She committed self-immolation at the sacrificial fire of a yagna performed by her father Daksha as she felt seriously distraught by her father’s insult of her husband and also to her by not inviting both of them for the yagna. Shiva was so grieved after hearing of the death of his wife that he danced around the world in a Tandav Nritya (“devastating penance” or dance of destruction) carrying Sati's dead body over his shoulders. Perturbed by this situation and in order to bring Shiv to a state of normalcy, it was then Vishnu who decided to use his Sudarshan Chakra (the rotating <b>knife</b> <b>s</b> carried on his finger tip). He dismembered Sati’s body with the chakra into several pieces and wherever her body fell on the earth, the place was consecrated as a divine shrine oo Shakthi Peeth with deities of Sati (Parvati) and Shiva. These locations have become famous pilgrimage places as Pithas or Shakthi Pithas, and are found scattered all over the subcontinent including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, apart from India. Sati is also known as Devi or Shakthi, and with blessinggs of Vishnu she was reborn as the daughter of Himavat or Himalayas and hence named as Parvati (daughter of mountains). She was born on the 14th day of the bright half of the month of Mrigashīrsha, which marks the Shivarathri (Shiva's night) festival.|$|R
40|$|In 1995 Alan Boye, an English {{professor}} at Lyndon State College in Vermont, began a thousand-mile journey on foot retracing {{the steps of}} Little Wolf 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> and Dull <b>Knife</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Northern Cheyennes in 1878 - 1879 that took them from Indian Territory to Montana. The Cheyennes were escaping from deplorable conditions on the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Reservation at Darlington Agency near Fort Reno, Indian Territory. Troops from four federal military departments were eventually placed {{in the field to}} stop them. Fighting their way through Indian Territory and Kansas, the Indians eventually split into two groups in Nebraska. Dull Knife 2 ̆ 7 s followers were captured and taken to Fort Robinson where on 9 January 1879 they made a dramatic escape for freedom rather than return to Indian Territory. By 22 January, almost half of them had perished. Little Wolf made it to Fort Keogh, Montana, where his people remained. By 1900 the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation was created as a result of one of the great odysseys in American history, one that rivaled the Nez Perce and Navajo journeys. Occasionally joined by tribal members, Boye trekked through four states on a modern spiritual journey where time stood still. For the Northern Cheyennes accompanying him, here was a chance to touch the past and experience some of the same world views their ancestors had dwelled in over a century ago. Boye 2 ̆ 7 s spiritual awakening and inspiration are revealed in illuminating prose. The evocative emotion generated by the journey 2 ̆ 7 s magnitude, its sights, {{and the ways in which}} a sense of place can put an individual in touch with touching history is profound. This book is not, however, a scholarly work of history and should not be promoted as such. Although Boye uses government documents to blend historical commentary with his personal experience, his treatment is not comprehensive. He completely misses a number of important manuscript collections from the Walter Camp Papers, the Ellison Collection in the Denver Public Library, and collections in the Kansas State Historical Society. The most visible omission is Thomas Marquis 2 ̆ 7 s 1926 interview with Iron Teeth, which gave history the only firsthand account of the odyssey by a Cheyenne woman. There are also historical errors. There is meager evidence that Little Wolf traveled to Washington with Stone Calf in 1873. Crazy Horse was stabbed, not shot. The endnotes are non-specific in regard to page citations. Much of the historical narrative is offered through the eyes and words of local ranchers and regional history buffs. There is no index or formal bibliography. Alan Boye 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to this important topic is chiefly literary and spiritual. In this he succeeds. As the works of John Neihardt, Bruce Cutler, and Scott Momaday show, there is an important niche for literary efforts that link the saga of the Indian Wars to the present. Holding Stone Hands merits a respected place among them...|$|R
