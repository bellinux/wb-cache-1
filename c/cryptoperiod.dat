50|$|NSA {{originally}} supplied keys for FASCINATOR {{on paper}} tape for loading using KOI-18 or KYK-13 fill devices {{and a special}} adaptor box and cable. The standard <b>cryptoperiod</b> was 7 days, i.e. keys had to be changed weekly.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cryptoperiod</b> is {{the time}} span during which a {{specific}} cryptographic key is authorized for use. Common government guidelines range from 1 to 3 years for asymmetric cryptography, and 1 day to 7 days for symmetric cipher traffic keys.|$|E
50|$|The DRYAD Numeral Cipher/Authentication System (KTC 1400 D) is a simple, paper {{cryptographic}} system {{employed by the}} U.S. military for authentication and for encryption of short, numerical messages. Each unit with a radio is given a set of matching DRYAD code sheets. A single sheet is valid for a limited time (e.g. 6 hours), called a <b>cryptoperiod.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fourth {{generation}} systems (1990s) {{use more}} commercial packaging and electronic key distribution. Integrated circuit technology allowed backward compatibility with third generation systems. Security tokens, {{such as the}} KSD-64 crypto ignition key (CIK) were introduced. Secret splitting technology allows encryptors and CIKs {{to be treated as}} unclassified when they were separated. Later the Fortezza card, originally introduced as part of the controversial Clipper chip proposal, were employed as tokens. <b>Cryptoperiods</b> were much longer, {{at least as far as}} the user was concerned. Users of secure telephones like the STU-III only have to call a special phone number once a year to have their encryption updated. Public key methods (FIREFLY) were introduced for electronic key management (EKMS). Keys could now be generated by individual commands instead of coming from NSA by courier. A common handheld fill device (the AN/CYZ-10) was introduced to replace the plethora of devices used to load keys on the many third generation systems that were still widely used. Encryption support was provided for commercial standards such as Ethernet, IP (originally developed by DOD's ARPA), and optical fiber multiplexing. Classified networks, such as SIPRNet (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System), were built using commercial Internet technology with secure communications links between [...] "enclaves" [...] where classified data was processed. Care had to be taken to ensure that there were no insecure connections between the classified networks and the public Internet.|$|R
50|$|While crude, the DRYAD Numeral Cipher/Authentication System has the {{advantage}} of being fast, relatively easy and requires no extra equipment (such as a pencil). The presence of more cipher-text columns under the digits 0, 1, 2 and 5, is apparently intended to make ciphertext frequency analysis more difficult. But much of the security comes from keeping the <b>cryptoperiod</b> short.|$|E
5000|$|NSA <b>cryptoperiod</b> {{doctrine}} {{called for}} keys {{to be changed}} every 24 hours. Initially these key changes took place at midnight, local time, taking all secure radios out of service for several minutes. This timing proved particularly inopportune because most contacts with opposing forces took place at night. The key-change time was later changed to 0600 to avoid this problem.|$|E
50|$|First {{generation}} NSA {{systems were}} introduced in the 1950s and were built on the legacy of NSA's World War II predecessors and used rotor machines derived from the SIGABA design for most high level encryption; for example, the KL-7. Key distribution involved distribution of paper key lists that described the rotor arrangements, to be changed each day (the <b>cryptoperiod)</b> at midnight, GMT. The highest level traffic was sent using one-time tape systems, including the British 5-UCO, that required vast amounts of paper tape keying material.|$|E
50|$|Second {{generation}} systems (1970s) {{were all}} electronic designs based on vacuum tubes and transformer logic. Algorithms {{appear to be}} based on linear feedback shift registers, perhaps with some non-linear elements thrown in to make them more difficult to cryptanalyze. Keys were loaded by placing a punched card in a locked reader on the front panel. The <b>cryptoperiod</b> was still usually one day. These systems were introduced in the late 1960s and stayed in use until the mid-1980s. They required a great deal of care and maintenance, but were not vulnerable to EMP. The discovery of the Walker spy ring provided an impetus for their retirement, along with remaining first generation systems.|$|E
5000|$|The keying {{material}} for the Fialka consists of a daily key book, a message key book and a message identifier book for broadcast traffic. The daily key book contains day keys for one month. A day key consists of a key table (in Cyrillic) and a punched card. For fixed rotor systems, the key table specifies {{the order of the}} rotors on the axle and the initial rotor settings to be used to decrypt the indicator of broadcast messages. As its name implies, the day key is valid (has a <b>cryptoperiod</b> in NSA parlance) for 24 hours and was changed at 00:01 hours. For the disassemblable rotors, the table also specifies the electrical insert for each outer rotor, which side was to be up, and the orientation of the insert relative to the outer rotor. Here is a sample M-125-3NM day key table for use on the 14th of the month: ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe implementation of label swapping packet forwarding technology increases the vulnerability to insider attacks. These attacks refer to unauthorized access from within an enclave {{to the outside}} network. In this thesis we propose a protocol to counter this category of attacks. The proposed protocol provides a means for fast packet authentication. High speed is achieved {{by the use of}} a trailer, which allows packet filtering at Layer 2, and the use of cheap and fast message digest algorithms. To overcome the weaknesses of a 128 bit message digest algorithm, each key is designed to have a very short <b>cryptoperiod.</b> Such fast rekeying is implemented by key caching (the host has a table of keys). Initial performance measurements indicated {{that it is possible to}} use our protocol while maintaining very high data throughput. Specifically, our protocol implements an authentication module, called Network Access Controller (NAC). The NAC's modular nature allows it to be easily integrated with a variety of routing technologies and other security mechanisms while remaining totally independent of them.
