40|$|The authors {{thank the}} American Printing House for the Blind and Tristan Pierce {{for their support}} for this {{research}} project. In the past 30 years, the percentage {{of children who are}} overweight has more than tripled, partly because of the prevalence of decreasing levels of physical activity (Pangrazi, 2004). Unfortunately, children with disabilities generally have even lower levels of health-related fitness because of both physical and psychosocial constraints (Longmuir & Bar-Or, 2000). Research has consistently shown that individuals who participate in regular physical activity to improve health-related fitness have higher energy levels and lower their risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, and other chronic diseases. In addition, regular participation in physical activity has also been found to improve psychological health and to lessen depression and anxiety (Kilpatrick, Hebert, & Jacobsen, 2002). Abstract: This study sought {{to determine the effects of}} using a talking pedometer on walking behavior and the value placed on walking by 22 <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired or deaf-blind.

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the {{involvement}} of undergraduate students from the electrical and computer engineering program in civic engagement projects. The main objectives of these projects are: 1) allow {{students to participate in}} an activity that meets identified community needs, 2) allow the students to gain further understanding in their area of specialty, and at the same time, 3) enhance their sense of civic responsibility. To start identifying possible projects for the ECE students, faculty from the ECE department at the University of Minnesota Duluth met with educators and parents of children with special needs from the Duluth district, to identify some of the necessities that could be addressed by student with knowledge and skills in the electrical and computer engineering field. Two main projects were identified. The first project was to have an intelligent toy that could obey voice commands. This toy could motivate <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired, to interact with their environment. The second project was to modify a remote control car in order that it could be controlled by special switches, the type that is used by people with gross motor skills.

40|$|Abstract: A {{student who}} is {{visually}} impaired was trained to evaluate his social behavior and to recruit feedback from his sighted peers, who were trained by him to provide the feedback. The self-recruitment of feedback improved the student's accuracy in evaluating social skills requiring visual cues. In addition, the peers extended their feedback to {{other aspects of the}} social environment than social behavior. Visual impairment (that is, blindness or low vision) can affect a child's social development and the formation of friendships with sighted peers (Rosenblum, 1998). One factor that inhibits a child's social development and formation of friendships is the lack of visual cues. According to MacCuspie (1996, p. 37), "Limited access to both learning and using visual cues can be observed to detract from the social development of children with visual impairment from a very early age. " Similarly, nonverbal communication and feedback, which are important components of social interaction, are available to sighted children but are not easy for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired to follow. It has been observed that unless they are prompted, significant others in the environment (such as teachers, peers, and family members) fail to supply feedback that is meaningful to individuals who are visually impaired (Jindal-Snape, 2004). The lack of such feedback to reinforce appropriate behaviors or to discourage those that ar...|$|E

40|$|This study first {{shows how}} spatial ability {{develops}} in <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired and blind and then suggests {{the use of}} bungee training as an intervention technique that ap-plies the development theory {{to be used for}} these children. Some of the studies conducted on visually impaired children indicate that the range of space sensed by these children is smaller than that sensed by sighted children. This {{is due to the fact}} that visually impaired children, who cannot use the visual sense as a long-range sensor, are unable to educe in-variant structure of distant objects. These children understand their environment through other senses such as sense of touch, hearing and motion; however, it is not easy for these children to understand space by use of these senses alone since they cannot provide the chil-dren with spatial experience equivalent to that given by visual image. For this reason, it is desirable that visually impaired children are given opportunities to experience wider range of space at the earlier stages of their development through their early education. Yamamoto (2000 a) took an approach of bungee training. The experiment, which used a long rubber strap with its one end attached to a child's body and the other end to an object, demonstrated that the child, who moved around an object in this state, could experienc...|$|E

40|$|In my thesis, I {{focus on}} a group of {{children}} with special needs - the gifted <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind or <b>visually</b> impaired. I <b>was</b> interested in what characteristics they have, how to help them develop their talent and whether our educational system is adequate for them. The goal of my thesis is mainly to point out that talent can occur in different groups of children, including children with visual impairment. Furthermore, I would also {{like to point out that}} it is harder to identify gifted visually impaired children because of their deficit and lack of knowledge on the topic of giftedness in the educational staff. The research part of my thesis consists of a study of two case studies and a short questionnaire for mobile teachers. I came to the conclusion that in our educational system, children with visual impairment can be identified as gifted only if educated in elementary schools, where such detection exists. Such cases are very rare, due to small size of population in question. Lack of knowledge on the field of giftedness in blind and visually impaired children and the insufficient education of teachers on this topic is the main reason for the current situation. Problems arise when trying to determine intelligence in blind or visually impaired children, because at this time there are no proper tests which can be used to determine the overall intellectual functioning. In the future more attention should be devoted to identify talent among all groups of children more systematically. To achieve this goal, teachers need additional training to successfully identify these children. ...|$|R
40|$|The major {{topic of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis are physical activities for preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind or <b>visually</b> impaired. My work {{consists of two}} basic parts, the theoretical and practical section. The first part deals with visual impairment, its definition, classification and the most common types of sight disorders and eye diseases. It also focuses on specific features of development of visually impaired children and preschool education. Last but not least it also states the particularities typical for preschool education of visually impaired children and their physical activities. The main goal of the theoretical part is to introduce the problems and needs of development of physical activities (motor development) in context with various types of sight diability. The practical part of my work {{is based on the}} knowledge from the theoretical section and its main goal is to suggest an instruction manual. In order to meet the above mentioned goal of the practical section of my bachelor thesis, I had used methods of qualitative research before, finally, I focused on creating the instruction manual. To be more specific, I had used analysis of available documents and semi-structured interviews. The respondents were teachers from a kindergarten for visually impaired <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> have personal experience in working with these children. Building on the above mentioned data I created an instruction manual consisting of a set of physical games for visually impaired children. This set is aimed to serve as a collection of instructions for kindergartens for children with visual disabilities, visually impaired children integrated at mainstream schools, their teachers and also the parents of these children...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a grounded theory {{investigation into the}} academic, social and cultural roots {{of the theory of}} play for cognitive and emotional development of blind and visually impaired children. Data is analysed through an epistemological model of disability, and through a notion of passive and active exclusion from cultural activities through institutional policy and practice. In common with the findings of a previous study on the development of theory and practice in art and museum education, it is argued that theories on the use of touch over other forms of perception were developed with negative consequences, and that theories were overly influenced by a form of reductionist philosophy of enlightenment from the 17 th and 18 th centuries. Furthermore, it is also argued that such philosophical and pedagogical theories were influenced by the cultural and religious predisposition of their authors. The pedagogical approaches that developed from the enlightenment philosophies, it is additionally argued, have done little to develop a full range of perceptual experiences during play, including visual stimuli of colour and tone, something that is particularly important for children with impaired vision. The study has two main conclusions. The first conclusion is that, in common with art and other forms of creative activity in education, access to multi-modal forms of play that encompass and utilize all of the senses in concert should be favoured for blind and visually impaired children – as indeed it should be for all children – and that the individual needs of the blind and visually impaired child should be considered when designing the environment and toys they use for play. The second conclusion is that research on creativity and play for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind and <b>visually</b> impaired needs to be less influenced by the background of the author and reductionist philosophies, and instead should emphasise the individual physical, social and cultural needs of the blind and visually impaired child...|$|R
