The name XD came from oddly shaped rear lights ("X" [...] shaped) and [...] "D" [...] beginning letter of the company's name.(they've changed the name since then) Loox can travel over 250 km on a single charge with lithium iron phosphate batteries. The car has a low drag <b>coefficient</b> <b>factor</b> of only 0.35. Other features include 360 degree airbags, an integrated safety system for electric stability, ABS brakes and power steering. The XD4 can go from 0-100 km in 4.2 seconds.
