50|$|Whereas {{markets in}} {{commodities}} such as pork bellies or oil have agreed definitions and arbitrating bodies for the commodities they trade, the carrier-carrier market has no agreed definitions of its destinations. Every carrier uses the International Telecommunication Union E.164 standard <b>for</b> country <b>codes,</b> but each carrier uses different <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> <b>destinations</b> within a country, usually {{because it is}} using different suppliers within that country. So one carrier's <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> Cali {{may not be the}} same as another's. This applies especially to mobile operators. While the difference in price between a call to a land-line and a call to a mobile may not seem much at 9 UK pence, the volumes can be one hundred thousand minutes a day or more, leading to losses of over £250,000 a month. When a carrier's dial code table can contain three thousand items, comparing codes is a critical and complex part of the process. The theory of dial code relationships actually involves the mathematical theory of lattices and code comparisons have to be done with computer software.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This work studies {{problems}} of source coding under {{the requirement that}} the encoder can produce an exact copy of the compressed source constructed by the decoder. This requirement, termed here as a common knowledge constraint, is satisfied automatically in rate-distortion theory for single sources. However, in the common formulation of {{problems of}} lossy source coding with side information at the decoder (the Wyner-Ziv problem), distributed source coding, and joint source-channel <b>coding</b> <b>for</b> networks, the <b>destination</b> can exploit the information it receives {{in a manner that}} cannot be exactly reproduced at the sender side. Some applications, like the transmission of sensitive medical information, may require that both sides – the sender and the receiver – will share a common version of the compressed data, for the purpose of future discussions or consulting. The purpose of this work is to study the implications of common knowledge constraints on the achievable rates in scenarios of lossy source coding. A single letter characterization of the rate distortion function is developed, for the problem of source coding with side information at the decoder, under a common knowledge constraint. Implications of this constraint on problems of joint source channel <b>coding</b> <b>for</b> the degraded broadcast channel are studied. Specifically, it is shown that in this setup, a scheme based on separation achieves optimal distortions.

The problem formulation in {{this legal}} research was: 1) {{how is the}} participation of society in managing garbage of Code River to support the development of tourism in Yogyakarta Municipality? and 2) what are barriers faced by society in garbage management <b>for</b> tourism <b>destination</b> in Yogyakarta City? The purpose {{of this research was}}: 1) to comprehend the participation of society in garbage management <b>for</b> tourism <b>destination</b> in Yogyakarta Municipality; and 2) to comprehend the barriers faced by society in garbage management <b>for</b> tourism <b>destination</b> in Yogyakarta Municipality. The type of this research was empirical legal research focusing on the social behavior by using primary data as main data directly gained in location of research, and secondary data as supporting data. The primary data was directly gained from respondent and source person. Secondary data was primary legal source includes regulations and secondary legal source, includes literature, and result of research. Method of data collection used was observation, interview, and literary study. This research was conducted in Code River in Yogyakarta Municipality. In this research the population used was totaled 478 persons, wherein from that amount it was taken as sample of 35 persons. Respondent in this research were: 1) Head of RW I, RW II, and RW III of Ledok Tukangan, and 2) Community who live in RW I and RW II of Ledok Macanan; wherein these two areas are included in Tegalpanggung Subdistrict, Danurejan District. The source person in this research was Head of Environment Sector of Yogyakarta and Head of Tourism Council of Yogyakarta. Technique of data analysis method used in this research was qualitative data, i. e. the data gained from various sources was then used and analyzed one to another. The reasoning process in drawing conclusion used deductive reasoning method based on the general matters to be drawn into specific matters. Based on the discussion and result of the completed research, it was drawn conclusion as follow: 1) participation f society in garbage management in Code River has been conducted, however notmaximally. The society has exploited the garbage and used items to be processed into economy-value item, such as the exploitation of domestic garbage into handicraft and compost. The society also use biopore technique as alternative in coping with the problems of garbage, flood, and in order to have clean water source; 2) barriers of the participation of society in garbage management in <b>Code</b> River <b>for</b> tourism <b>destination</b> in Yogyakarta Municipality is in addition of the passiveness of society towards their environment, also caused by: 1) the existence of limitation on cost, technology, expert in the matter of garbage management; 2) the lack of comprehension and information on garbage management for tourism purpose; 3) the irresolution in enforcement of legal regulation relating to garbage management for tourism destination; and 4) the lack of coordination between the relating institution...|$|R
