40|$|Organo-lead halide perovskites have {{attracted}} much attention for solar cell applications due to their unique optical and electrical properties. With either low-temperature solution processing or vacuum evaporation, the overall conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells with organic hole-transporting material were quickly improved to over 15 % during the last 2 years. However, the organic hole-transporting materials used are normally quite expensive due to complicated synthetic procedure or high-purity requirement. Here, we demonstrate the application of an effective and cheap inorganic p-type hole-transporting material, <b>copper</b> <b>thiocyanate,</b> on lead halide perovskite-based devices. With low-temperature solution-process deposition method, a power conversion efficiency of 12. 4 % was achieved under full sun illumination. This work represents a well-defined cell configuration with optimized perovskite morphology by two times of lead iodide deposition, {{and opens the door}} for integration of a class of abundant and inexpensive material for photovoltaic application. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited...|$|E
40|$|For the {{assessment}} of fat malabsorption, the standard method of measuring faecal fat excretion using a 5 day stool collection has been compared with the alternative methods: stool microscopy, a lipid tolerance test and a continuous marker technique for the estimation of fat content on a single stool sample. The lipid test, using an emulsion of arachis oil (Prosparol), was less reliable than had been expected with a sensitivity of 33 % and a specificity of 45. 4 %. Stool microscopy using Oil Red O to stain fat globules had a sensitivity of 72. 2 % and a specificity of 95. 4 %. Fat estimation of a single stool sample using <b>copper</b> (1) <b>thiocyanate</b> showed a high correlation with that determined on a 5 day stool collection (p less than 0. 001). It is concluded that lipid tolerance tests have little place in the estimation of fat absorption. In laboratories where faecal fats are not measured, microscopic examination of stool for fat globules provides a specific and relatively sensitive method for detecting steatorrhoea. The use of a continuous marker provides a method for assessing the degree of steatorrhoea on a single stool sample without the disadvantages of the conventional method of faecal fat analysis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{application}} of 'booster biocides' Diuron, Tolylfluanid and <b>Copper</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> inbantifouling paints, {{used to prevent}} development of biofouling, needs to be monitored before assessing their impacts on the environment. An alternative approach aims to propose eco-friendly and effective antifoulants isolated from marine organisms such as seaweeds. In this study, the effects of 'booster biocides' and the ethanol and dichloromethane extracts from a brown (Sargassum muticum) and a red alga (Ceramium botryocarpum) have been compared by algal growth inhibition tests of marine diatoms. The most efficient extracts were ethanol fraction of S. muticum and C. botryocarpum extracts with growth EC(50) = 4. 74 and 5. 3 μg mL(- 1) respectively, with reversible diatom growth effect. The booster biocides are more efficient EC(50) = 0. 52 μg mL(- 1), but are highly toxic. Results validate the use of macroalgal extracts as non toxic antifouling compounds, and they represent valuable environmentally friendly alternatives in comparison with currently used biocides...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough <b>copper</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (CuSCN) shows {{potential}} as a substrate for p-type dye sensitised solar cells, its interaction with organic anchoring groups remains largely unexplored. In this ab initio study, we provide atomistic insight into how CuSCN surfaces interact {{with a series of}} nitrogen-based (pyridine, aniline, phenanthroline, benzenediamine) and sulfur-based (thiophenol, thiophenoxide, thiocatechol) anchoring groups. We profile several low-index surfaces, including both polar and nonpolar cleavages, to determine their stabilities and electronic structures. In screening these surfaces for the most favourable adsorption modes and binding sites for organic anchors, we found that adsorption is chiefly driven by the propensity of surface copper atoms to restore a tetrahedronal coordination environment. We show {{that the majority of the}} tested anchors, even the bidentate structures, exhibit low binding energies on CuSCN, which illustrates how chemical intuition may be misleading for identifying the ideal anchors on the basis of nucleophilicity and denticity alone. By pinpointing the causes of modest adsorption energies, we present hints as to how adsorption strength and alignment of the organic-inorganic states can be improved on CuSCN...|$|E

(ATRP) of Me methacrylate onto a poly(ethylene-co-butylene) macroinitiator is described. Copper bromide (CuBr), copper chloride (CuCl) and <b>copper</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (CuSCN) were applied as active ATRP catalysts with N-pentyl- 2 -pyridylmethanimine as ligand, {{in order to}} study {{the effect of the}} copper counter ion on the rate of activation of the bromine-functional polyolefin macroinitiator. The reaction products were subjected to normal phase gradient polymer elution chromatog. (NP-GPEC) in order to sep. residual macroinitiator from the block copolymers. The amt. of residual macroinitiator was monitored for each catalyst system by evaporative light scattering detection, where the chromatograms were normalized on a PS std. which was added to the reaction mixt. before polymn. The rate of activation of the macroinitiator is strongly affected by the copper counter ion and increases in the order CuSCN 2 ̆ 6 lt;CuBr 2 ̆ 6 lt;CuCl.

40|$|AbstractZnO dye {{sensitized}} {{solar cells}} {{have been reported}} to be plagued with issues of dye aggregation which increased current recombination. This dye aggregation has been linked to the pH 5 ruthenium-based dye solutions, which is below ZnO's point of zero charge of pH 9, resulting in positive surface charges on ZnO which form Zn 2 + - dye complexes. In this paper, a heterogeneous architecture of ZnO and bismuth ferrite (BiFeO 3 or BFO) is synthesized using a technique which allows the synthesis using purely chemical solution techniques. BFO is a perovskite studied extensively for its multiferroic properties and its potential for anomalous photovoltages. The solid state solar cells are sensitized with N 719, and uses <b>copper</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (CuSCN) as a hole conductor. The ZnO-BFO-N 719 -CuSCN heterogeneous architecture solar cell showed efficiencies which increased ca four-fold to 0. 38 % and Jsc which doubled to 1. 38 mA/cm 2 compared to ZnO-N 719 -CuSCN architectures. We will report that the addition of BFO improved performances due to the reduction of dye aggregation due to BFO's pzc of pH 6. 5 which is close to the pH 5 of the dye solution, as well as BFO's role as an electron blocking layer which prevents the back tunneling of electrons from ZnO to CuSCN...|$|E
30|$|Organic–inorganic hybrid {{perovskite}} (such as CH 3 NH 3 PbX 3, X[*]=[*]I, Cl, Br) {{solar cells}} has {{attracted much attention}} because of its superior photovoltaic performance, including excellent light-harvesting ability and potential applications [1 – 6]. In previous reports, the high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells was achieved when a conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS thin film that was formed using TiO 2 nano-particles that had been sintered at high temperature {{was used as the}} electron transport layer (ETL) (hole transport layer (HTL)) [7 – 9]. However, a trade-off must be between fabrication cost and device stability, impeding the development of commercialized solar cells. Inorganic p-type materials as hole transport media have the double advantage of excellent chemical stability and simplicity of preparation [10 – 12]. Along with some inorganic HTLs (copper iodide (CuI) [13], <b>copper</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (CuSCN) [14 – 16], graphene oxide (GO) [17], nickel oxide (NiO) [18], cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O), and copper oxide (CuO) [19] have attracted substantial interest owing to their direct gaps of 1.9 – 2.2  eV[20 – 22], and these have been widely used as HTLs in solar cells. Cu 2 O and CuO thin films can be prepared by various methods, including reactive sputtering [23], electrochemical deposition [24 – 27], chemical dissolution [28 – 30], thermal oxidation [31], and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method [12, 32].|$|E
30|$|CuI halogens and pseudohalogens are {{two classes}} of {{inorganic}} CuI salts {{that can be applied}} as HTMs in a DSSC. Copper bromide (CuBr), copper iodide (CuI), and <b>copper</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (CuSCN) are some copper-based compounds which work as a hole conductor and are more effective due to their good conductivity. Although CuSCN {{is one of the best}} pseudohalogen HTMs and despite its high hole mobility, its application results in high series resistance and does not support high current and also shows poor electronic contact between CuSCN and the dye, and poor pore filling due to their fast crystallization rates, which resulted in low η of <[*] 4 % for the corresponding solid-state DSSCs [125]. Thus, to reduce the high recombination rate of electrons, additional blocking layers of insulating materials like SiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 can be applied or coated around the TiO 2 particles which enhance the VOC due to the suppressed recombination rate. With respect to halogens, CuBr showed an efficiency of 1.53 % with thioether as an additive [126] and demonstrated high stability under prolonged irradiation of about 200  h at RT and the application of nickel oxide (NiO) showed moderate PCEs of 3 % [127]. But, due to the easy poor solubility as well as crystallization of these materials, their application became a challenge and, thus, pseudohalogens have proven to be more stable and efficient in DSSCs. But the devices were found to be highly unstable and the reproducibility became dubious.|$|E

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 The organic-metal halide perovskite is emerging technology in photo voltaic solar cells. For any solar cell {{to get the}} significant efficiency depends on various design parameters such as material thickness, device architecture, doping concentration etc [...] There are many solar cell simulation software {{which can be used}} to carry out simulation and thus optimization based on those parameters. Here for this research, we have used wxAMPS because it is freely available, simple, efficient and quite popular in solar cell research society. The software has been used to simulate for single junction as well as multijunction/tandem solar cell. Keeping external parameters constant (one-sun, AM 1. 5 G solar radiation, 1000 w/m² irradiation), numerical simulation and analysis of a perovskite solar cell with a single junction configuration of ETM/Perovskite/HTM and a tandem (double junction) configuration of ETM/Perovskite/HTM/Recombination layer/ ETM/Perovskite/HTM were carried out. In the proposed single junction configuration Zinc oxide (ZnO) was used as Electron Transport Material (ETM) as), mixed halide perovskite (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -xClx) was used as absorber material, and <b>Copper</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (CuSCN) was used as Hole transport material (HTM). Then simulation of double junction tandem solar cell was performed. Tandem cells are solar cells made of multiple junctions with tunable absorbing materials, which aim to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit of single junction solar cells. Recently, organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have stirred enormous interest as ideal candidates for tandem solar cells, due to high open circuit voltage, relatively wide optical bandgap, and low temperature solution processibility. In this research a new architecture of perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell was explored. In this architecture two different types of single junction perovskite solar cells were used for the tandem structure. ZnO/CH₃NH₃PbI₃₋ₓClₓ/CuSCN solar cell was employed as a top cell and ZnO/MAPbBr₃/MAPbI₃/CuSCN was employed as bottom cell. The simulation results shows a significant enhancement in conversion efficiency when compared to individual single junction perovskite solar cells. These simulation results can help researchers to reasonably choose materials and optimally design high performance perovskite single and tandem/multijunction solar cells.
