500|$|The word {{metalloid}} {{comes from}} the Latin metallum ("metal") and the Greek oeides ("resembling in form or appearance"). Several names are sometimes used synonymously although some of these have other meanings that are not necessarily interchangeable: amphoteric element, boundary element, half-metal, half-way element, near metal, meta-metal, semiconductor, semimetal and submetal. [...] "Amphoteric element" [...] is sometimes used more broadly to include transition metals capable of forming oxyanions, such as chromium and manganese. [...] "Half-metal" [...] is used in physics {{to refer to a}} compound (such as <b>chromium</b> <b>dioxide)</b> or alloy that can act as a conductor and an insulator. [...] "Meta-metal" [...] is sometimes used instead to refer to certain metals (Be, Zn, Cd, Hg, In, Tl, β-Sn, Pb) located just {{to the left of the}} metalloids on standard periodic tables. These metals are mostly diamagnetic and tend to have distorted crystalline structures, electrical conductivity values at the lower end of those of metals, and amphoteric (weakly basic) oxides. [...] "Semimetal" [...] sometimes refers, loosely or explicitly, to metals with incomplete metallic character in crystalline structure, electrical conductivity or electronic structure. Examples include gallium, ytterbium, bismuth and neptunium. The names amphoteric element and semiconductor are problematic as some elements referred to as metalloids do not show marked amphoteric behaviour (bismuth, for example) or semiconductivity (polonium) in their most stable forms.|$|E

A practical alternative is to form such coatings using trivalent chromium electrolytes.

Studies show that the inclusion of such hard particles is possible in both electrolyte types but with trivalent electrolytes being more suitable.

50|$|New tape {{formulations}} were introduced. <b>Chromium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (referred to as CrO2 or Type II) was {{the first}} tape designed for extended high frequency response, but it required higher bias. Later, as the IEC Type II standard was defined, a different equalization settings was also mandated to reduce hiss, thus giving up some extension {{at the high end}} of the audio spectrum. Better-quality cassette recorders soon appeared with a switch for the tape type. Later decks incorporated coded holes in the shell to autodetect the tape type. <b>Chromium</b> <b>dioxide</b> tape was thought to cause increased wear on the heads, so TDK and Maxell adapted cobalt-doped ferric formulations to mimic CrO2. Sony briefly tried FerriChrome (Type III) which claimed to combine the best of both; some people, however, stated that the reverse was true because the Cr top layer seemed to wear off quickly, reducing this type to Fe in practice. Most recent decks produce the best response and dynamic headroom with metal tapes (IEC Type IV) which require still higher bias for recording, though they will play back correctly at the II setting since the equalization is the same.|$|E

5000|$|DuPont {{licensed}} {{the product}} to Sony in Japan and BASF in Germany in the early 1970s for regional production and distribution. Japanese competitors developed cobalt-adsorbed (TDK: Avilyn) and cobalt ferrite (Maxell: Epitaxial) [...] "chrome equivalent" [...] Type II audio cassettes and various videotape formats as substitutes. Added to {{that was the problem}} that the production of CrO2 yielded toxic by-products of which Japanese manufacturers had great difficulty properly disposing. BASF eventually became the largest producer of both the <b>chromium</b> <b>dioxide</b> pigment and chrome tapes, basing its VHS & S-VHS video tape, audio cassettes, and 3480 data cartridges on this formulation. Dupont and BASF had also introduced chrome-cobalt [...] "blended" [...] oxide pigments which combined about 70% cobalt-modified iron oxide with 30% chrome oxide into a single coating, presumably to offer improved performance at lower costs than pure chrome.

50|$|An {{ordinary}} cassette {{audio tape}} stores both video and sound.The PXL-2000 holds 11 minutes of footage {{by moving the}} tape at a high speed, nearly 9X normal cassette playback speed.

The higher speed is necessary because video requires a wider bandwidth than standard audio recording. (In magnetic tape recording, the faster the tape speed, the more data can be read/written per second, i.e. higher bandwidth.) The PXL-2000 records the video information on the left audio channel of the cassette, and the audio on the right.|$|E
50|$|The {{system is}} {{technically}} sound, but a nearly complete {{failure in the}} marketplace, with a very low take-up by a few audiophiles only. Apart from {{the problem of the}} bulky cassettes, the performance of compact cassettes had improved dramatically with the use of new materials such as <b>chromium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> Dolby B noise reduction, and better manufacturing quality. For most people, the quality of compact cassettes was adequate, and the benefits of the expensive Elcaset system limited. Audiophiles turned away from Elcaset and towards high-end compact cassette decks from companies like Nakamichi, which began making very high-quality tape decks using the compact audio cassette in late 1973, even three years before the Elcaset was released. The tapes they made could be played on any compact cassette machine. Also, the Elcaset machines were expensive. Elcaset began a fast fade-out in 1978.|$|E

50|$|From {{the early}} 1980s, the {{fidelity}} of prerecorded cassettes began to improve dramatically. Whereas Dolby B {{was already in}} widespread use in the 1970s, prerecorded cassettes were duplicated onto rather poor quality tape stock at (often) high speed and did not compare in fidelity to high-grade LPs. However, systems such as XDR, along with the adoption of higher-grade tape (such as <b>chromium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> but typically recorded {{in such a way}} as to play back at the normal 120 μs position), and the frequent use of Dolby HX Pro, meant that cassettes became a viable high-fidelity option, one that was more portable and required less maintenance than records. In addition, cover art, which had generally previously been restricted to a single image of the LP cover along with a minimum of text, began to be tailored to cassettes as well, with fold-out lyric sheets or librettos and fold-out sleeves becoming commonplace.|$|E
50|$|The mass {{production}} of blank (recordable) Compact Cassettes began in 1964 in Hanover, Germany. Prerecorded music cassettes (also known as Music-Cassettes, and later just Musicassettes; M.C. for short) were launched in Europe in late 1965. The Mercury Record Company, a US affiliate of Philips, introduced M.C. to the US in July 1966. The initial offering consisted of 49 titles.However, the system {{had been designed}} initially for dictation and portable use, with the audio quality of early players not well suited for music. Some early models also had unreliable mechanical design. In 1971, the Advent Corporation introduced their Model 201 tape deck that combined Dolby type B noise reduction and <b>chromium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CrO2) tape, with a commercial-grade tape transport mechanism supplied by the Wollensak camera division of 3M Corporation. This resulted in the format being taken more seriously for musical use, and started the era of high fidelity cassettes and players.|$|E
5000|$|Analog {{recording}} {{is based}} on the fact that remnant magnetisation of a given material depends on the magnitude of the applied field. The magnetic material is normally in the form of tape, with the tape in its blank form being initially demagnetised. When recording, the tape runs at a constant speed. The writing head magnetises the tape with current proportional to the signal. A magnetisation distribution is achieved along the magnetic tape. Finally, the distribution of the magnetisation can be read out, reproducing the original signal. The magnetic tape is typically made by embedding magnetic particles (approximately 0.5 micrometers [...] in size) in a plastic binder on polyester film tape. The most commonly-used of these was ferric oxide, though <b>chromium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> cobalt, and later pure metal particles were also used. Analog recording was the most popular method of audio and video recording. Since the late 1990s, however, tape recording has declined in popularity due to digital recording.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, the Advent Corporation {{combined}} Dolby B {{noise reduction}} system with <b>chromium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CrO2) tape {{to create the}} Advent Model 200, the first high-fidelity cassette deck. Dolby B uses volume companding of high frequencies to boost low-level treble information by up to 9 dB, reducing them (and the hiss) on playback. CrO2 used different bias and equalization settings to reduce the overall noise level and extend the high frequency response. Together these allowed a usefully flat frequency response beyond 15 kHz for the first time. This deck {{was based on a}} top-loading mechanism by Nakamichi, then soon replaced by the Model 201 based on a more reliable transport made by Wollensak, a division of 3M, which was commonly used in audio/visual applications. Both featured an unusual single VU meter which could be switched between or for both channels. The Model 200 featured piano key style transport controls, with the Model 201 using the distinctive combination of a separate lever for rewind/fast forward and the large play and stop button as found on their commercial reel to reel machines of the era.|$|E
50|$|Tape {{formulation}} {{affects the}} retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, print-through, optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician aligning the machine to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types (ferric oxide Fe2O3, <b>chromium</b> <b>dioxide</b> CrO2, etc.) {{and also in the}} precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally align their machines for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the tensile strength and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a pitch error, possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects print-through, the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape wound on a reel picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. Print-through on analog tape causes unintended pre- and post-echoes on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred.|$|E

50|$|The crystal’s {{magnetic}} properties, {{derived from}} its ideal shape such as anisotropy which imparted high coercivity and remanent magnetization intensities, resulted in exceptional stability and efficiency for short wavelengths, {{and it almost}} immediately appeared in high performance audio tape used in audio cassette for which treble response and hiss were always problems. Unlike the spongy looking ferric oxides used in common tape, the <b>chromium</b> <b>dioxide</b> crystals were perfectly formed and could be evenly and densely dispersed in a magnetic coating; and that led to unparalleled low noise in audio tapes. Chrome tapes did, however, require {{a new generation of}} audiocassette recorders equipped with a higher bias current capability (roughly 50% greater) than that used by iron oxide to properly magnetize the tape particles. Also introduced was a new equalization (70 µs) that traded some of the extended high-frequency response for lower noise resulting in a 5-6 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over ferric-oxide audio tapes. These bias and EQ settings were later carried over to “chrome-equivalent” cobalt-modified tapes introduced in the mid 1970s by TDK, Maxell, and others. Later research significantly increased the coercivity of the particle by doping or adsorbing rare elements such as iridium onto the crystal matrix or by improving the axial length-to-deprecated ratios. The resulting product was potentially a competitor to metallic iron pigments but apparently achieved little market penetration.|$|E
