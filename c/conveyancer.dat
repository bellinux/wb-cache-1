25|$|Section 34 {{establishes}} the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board as a statutory corporation.

Alison Jones, in a different article for the same journal, said that [...] "Logically the decision in Hunter v Moss appears a sensible one", but noted that it did create [...] "difficult questions". Other academics were more critical, with David Hayton writing in the Law Quarterly Review that [...] "the unreserved judgment of Dillon LJ.... may well come to be stigmatised".|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} {{conveyancing}} {{work and the}} responsibility of licensed <b>conveyancers</b> in carrying out property transactions in New South Wales is examined {{as a consequence of}} new powers of attorney legislation introduced in that state, which provides for licensed <b>conveyancers</b> to act as prescribed witnesses to enduring powers of attorney. Anomalies in the licensing legislation which defines the nature of legal work available to <b>conveyancers</b> and constrains them in their new role are considered. Some background to the introduction of licensed <b>conveyancers</b> in New South Wales is provided with an overview of changes to the licensing legislation since its inception in 1992. The issues explored suggest there will be confusion for consumers, potential conduct and disciplinary issues for <b>conveyancers</b> and limited benefits for all parties and lead to the conclusion that legislative change is the only solution. 12 page(s...|$|R

500|$|Five {{distinct}} {{methods of}} breaking up a marriage {{existed in the}} early modern period of English history. One was to sue in the ecclesiastical courts for separation from bed and board (a mensa et thoro), {{on the grounds of}} adultery or life-threatening cruelty, but it did not allow a remarriage. From the 1550s, until the Matrimonial Causes Act became law in 1857, divorce in England was only possible, if at all, by the complex and costly procedure of a private Act of Parliament. [...] Although the divorce courts set up {{in the wake of the}} 1857 Act made the procedure considerably cheaper, divorce remained prohibitively expensive for the poorer members of society. [...] An alternative was to obtain a [...] "private separation", an agreement negotiated between both spouses, embodied in a deed of separation drawn up by a <b>conveyancer.</b> Desertion or elopement was also possible, whereby the wife was forced out of the family home, or the husband simply set up a new home with his mistress. Finally, the less popular notion of wife selling was an alternative but illegitimate method of ending a marriage. The Laws Respecting Women, As They Regard Their Natural Rights (1777) observed that, for the poor, wife selling was viewed as a [...] "method of dissolving marriage", when [...] "a husband and wife find themselves heartily tired of each other, and agree to part, if the man has a mind to authenticate the intended separation by making it a matter of public notoriety".|$|E

These people can apply to become authorised conveyancers by applying to the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board, the regulatory body for conveyancing. Section 36 also repeals the section of the Building Societies Act 1986 that covered banks acting as conveyancers, since they are covered as [...] "companies and incorporated bodies".|$|E

25|$|After {{negotiations}} with the government, Mitchell withdrew his bill {{in exchange for a}} guarantee that the government would allow non-solicitors to undertake conveyancing work once a Committee had set out proposals for protecting consumers who used these new <b>conveyancers</b> against losses. The Committee, known as the Farrand Committee (after its chairman, Julian Farrand), finished its report in September 1984. The government almost immediately changed the rules to allow for licensed <b>conveyancers,</b> introducing the changes with a section in the Administration of Justice Act 1985. Despite worries that this would bankrupt solicitors who specialised in conveyancing work, very few licensed <b>conveyancers</b> began practising due to the difficulties in qualifying, and although the field has become more competitive there has been no substantial loss of revenue like that feared.|$|R
