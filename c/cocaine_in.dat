However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack <b>cocaine</b> <b>in</b> his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug smuggling to the U.S., particularly of <b>cocaine.</b> <b>In</b> the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug smuggling grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, {{in return for the}} smugglers receiving immunity from prosecution. A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money laundering through a group of close associates within the military. On June 12, 1986, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering. Hersh recorded a U.S. White House official as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E

This study compares the number of cocaine deaths per capita reported in these two datasets for the years 1981 through 1998 and for 24 U. S. cities. Both datasets identify significant differences <b>in</b> trends <b>in</b> <b>cocaine</b> deaths across U. S. cities. The DAWN dataset is limited to a select number of metropolitan areas, but appears to provide a more comprehensive count of <b>cocaine</b> deaths <b>in</b> those cities. Although the NCHS vital statistics undercount <b>cocaine</b> deaths <b>in</b> many cities, changes over time are well correlated with DAWN data. Therefore, NCHS vital statistics can be used to track variations <b>in</b> <b>cocaine</b> use overtime <b>in</b> regions not surveyed by DAWN...|$|R

5|$|In April 2001, {{while he}} was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him {{wandering}} barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had <b>cocaine</b> <b>in</b> his system. After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet, as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.|$|E
