50|$|Although the K-44 was {{originally}} designed for hauling a logging semi-trailer, the trucks were soon {{being used to}} tow conventional twin <b>axle</b> <b>trailers,</b> which permitted a significantly greater overall load capacity.|$|R
50|$|The M818 {{normally}} towed a 12-ton 2 <b>axle</b> <b>trailer.</b> There were {{stake and}} platform, van, low-bed, and tanker bodies. 6-ton 2 axle expansible vans and 6-ton single axle vans were also used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Automobile chassis usually {{refers to}} the lower body of the vehicle. The frame {{provides}} necessary support to the vehicle components placed on it. The frame should {{be strong enough to}} withstand shocks, twist, vibrations and other stresses. The chassis frame consists of side members attached with a series of cross members. This paper focuses on review of work carried out by researchers in the field of static & dynamic analysis of six <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> frame design. Static & dynamic analysis is helpful to understand and improve the quality of design for six <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> frame design by using CATIA, ANYSYS software...|$|R
50|$|Utility Trailer Manufacturing Company {{was founded}} in 1914 by E.W. Bennett and H.C. Bennett, {{and was one of}} the first truck trailer {{manufacturers}} in the United States. The first product was a single <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> designed to accommodate 60 bales of cotton.|$|R

50|$|The K-72 trailer {{was built}} by the A.J. Miller (Auto Cruiser Trailer Co.). It is a two <b>axle</b> <b>trailer,</b> with one <b>axle</b> on each end. Its net weight is 7,500 lb and is 232¾ inches long, 124½ in high, and 93¾ in wide it has four windows {{including}} {{the one in the}} door.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyses}} {{the operating}} principle of Steady-state Cornering of semitrailer with <b>trailer</b> <b>axle</b> steering mechanism。Analytical method was used for kinematics analysis on <b>trailer</b> <b>axle</b> steering mechanism based on the preceding analysis result. <b>trailer</b> <b>axle</b> steering mechanism was simplified into a five-bar linkage mechanism. Constraint conditions of the five-bar linkage mechanism were discussed based on its actual installing space. Accordingly, size ranges of the critical components of <b>trailer</b> <b>axle</b> steering mechanism were obtained, providing conditions for further study on semitrailer dynamics. ...|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} KB-45, the A-45 {{also has a}} version with Nemo {{hydraulic}} system that enables pulling of trailers with hydraulically driven axles. These vehicles were called AH-45. The hydraulic system increases the hauling capacity so that the maximum weight for a single <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> is 8 000 kg and 12 000 kg for a two-axle trailer.|$|R
50|$|The F94HA (F94HA6x2NA) was an {{articulated}} chassis with remotely mounted Voith gearbox, leaf-spring suspension {{on the front}} axle and air suspension on both drive (2nd <b>axle)</b> and <b>trailer</b> <b>axle</b> (3rd axle). It {{is known as a}} 'puller' artic, where no hydraulic articulation control is needed.|$|R
2500|$|GMC/Baert & Verney - eleven railcars {{constructed}} on GMC 2 ton truck chassis by Baert & Verney at Le Mans. These railcars were {{powered by a}} [...] engine. They seated 24, with 16 standing. They were single ended {{and had to be}} turned on a turntable {{at the end of their}} journey. Single <b>axle</b> <b>trailers</b> were hauled, seating another 20 people.|$|R
50|$|Tractor {{trucks were}} used to tow {{semi-trailers}} up to 37,500 lb with 15,000 lb on their fifth wheel. Semi-tractor/trailers have to stay on relatively flat ground, and are not rated for full off-road use. On improved roads they could tow up to 55,000 lb with 25,000 lb on their fifth wheel. Tractor trucks normally towed a 12-ton 2 <b>axle</b> <b>trailer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Kitson-Still {{locomotive}} used different ends of {{the same}} cylinders for steam or diesel propulsion. The crank was above the frame and a gear train of fixed reduction linked it to the <b>centre</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Renault PR180.2 was {{designed}} around {{an interesting and}} unusual concept. Most articulated buses only have one driving axle - either the <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> or the rear axle, however, the PR180.2 features two driving <b>axles</b> - <b>centre</b> and rear.|$|R
50|$|The M-63 Plamen {{consists}} of 32 Ø128mm tubes, which can fire original Plamen-A and Plamen B rockets {{with a range}} of 8,600m. The effect of each rocket on the target is equivalent to the effect of a 105mm artillery shell. All 32 rockets can be fired in either 6.4, 12.5 or 19.2 seconds. The launcher is mounted on a single <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> which can be towed by vehicles with an 800mm high tow hitch. The towing vehicle carries reserve rockets, so the battle complement is 64 missiles.|$|R
5000|$|Trailer skirts {{comprise}} {{a pair of}} panels affixed to the lower side edges of a trailer, running most {{of the length of}} the trailer and filling the gap between the forward and rear <b>axles.</b> <b>Trailer</b> skirts are typically constructed of aluminum, plastic, or fiberglass, with plastic the most resistant to damage from side or bottom impacts. Skirts may have a modular design, allowing installation on a variety of trailer lengths. Skirts may weigh between 70 and 160 kg. Installation typically requires three to five [...]|$|R

5000|$|The inner {{frame of}} the {{locomotive}} was also used as a water tank. She {{was designed as a}} wet steam locomotive. The boiler had two shell rings and 90 heating tubes. The drive was achieved via a Walschaerts valve gear driving the third axle. The wheels on the <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> were made without flanges to improve curve running.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, Bill Crealock {{designed}} the longest, lightest, trailerable Masthead ketch sailboat ever built, the Clipper Marine 32 Aft Cabin Ketch coastal diesel cruiser racer. About 100 of these sailboats {{were built in}} 1975 and 76, and many still sail {{the waters of the}} world today. CM32's had an 8-foot beam and 4,500 displament, were supplied with a two or three <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> that could be pulled by the family vehicle, put his design in the record books. A heavier displacement blue water CM32 was also built, and was also trailerable, sold in an aft cockpit single mast sloop. A smaller designed CM 30, a 30-foot motorsailor was also offered.|$|R

25|$|Commercial motor {{vehicles}} {{are subject to}} various state and federal laws regarding limitations on truck length (measured from bumper to bumper), width, and truck axle length (measured from axle to axle or fifth wheel to <b>axle</b> for <b>trailers).</b>|$|R
50|$|The four {{coupled axles}} {{were very close}} together, so that tight curves could be negotiated. The <b>centre</b> <b>axles</b> were {{installed}} with side play, which meant the connecting rod had to drive the fourth axle. The wheelbase was only 2.6 metres and, with the overall length of the locomotive being almost 8.5 metres, it had very long overhangs. The result was a relatively rough ride.|$|R
50|$|A {{tandem axle}} {{is a group}} of two or more axles {{situated}} close together. Truck designs use such a configuration to provide a greater weight capacity than a single <b>axle.</b> Semi <b>trailers</b> usually have a tandem axle at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The ten-coupled Italian E550 of 1908 had paired motors, {{each with}} a jackshaft. A {{triangular}} rod was carried between these, rotating in synchrony and so always horizontal. This carried a sliding crankpin journal for the <b>centre</b> <b>axle,</b> and bearings for the long coupling rods to the unevenly-spaced pairs of drivers ahead and behind. A similar arrangement {{was used for the}} Swiss Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon railway Be 5/7 1-E-1 of 1912.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} system uses layered rubber, with pneumatic secondary suspension. The bogie wheel base is 2200 mm (motor bogie) with 820 mm wheels. Braking is by tread brakes, and regenerative braking on power bogies, and by two axle-mounted disc brakes per <b>axle</b> on <b>trailer</b> bogies.|$|R
50|$|The Cleminson {{system is}} not a true bogie, but serves a similar purpose. It {{was based on a}} patent of 1883 by James Cleminson, and was once popular on narrow-gauge rolling stock, e.g. on the Isle of Man and Manx Northern Railways. The vehicle would have three axles and the outer two could pivot to adapt to {{curvature}} of the track. The pivoting was controlled by levers attached to the third (<b>centre)</b> <b>axle,</b> which could slide sideways.|$|R
500|$|Three [...] {{diameter}} cylinders {{drove the}} <b>centre</b> coupled <b>axle.</b> The inside cylinder was steeply inclined at 1:7.5 but the outside cylinders were horizontal.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{study is}} {{reported}} on a two lane in-service pre-stressed concrete bridge having susceptible vibrations under service traffic conditions. The bridge was 1300 ft long with thirteen simple pre- cast post tensioned spans resting on in-situ bridge piers. The client reported significant vibrations under service loads and requested a solution. The bridge {{did not have a}} top wearing surface. Bridge design drawings were provided. The methodology of health assessment included the visual inspection followed by analysis with the help of drawings provided by the client. The records of concrete strengths along with prestressing protocols were missing. The static and dynamic bridge response using static and moving three different loaded vehicles (over loaded tractor trolley, unloaded 5 <b>Axle</b> vehicle loaded <b>trailer</b> and loaded 5 <b>axle</b> <b>trailers)</b> was monitored. Core samples from the bridge deck were taken. NDT, Digital half-cell and electrical resistivity readings were taken at various locations of bridge. The results indicated some design inadequacies, faulty construction methodologies, improper maintenance and lack of awareness even by the professionals to deal with such structures. The remedial measures were suggested in terms of strengthening and maintenance of bridge...|$|R
50|$|Three 18 in {{diameter}} cylinders drove the <b>centre</b> coupled <b>axle.</b> The inside cylinder was steeply inclined at 1:7.5 but the outside cylinders were horizontal.|$|R
50|$|A classic {{feature of}} these engines was the driver’s cab in {{the centre of}} the vehicle which could be used in both {{directions}} and which jutted out above the engine rooms.In the basic design the V 80 had elements, that were also used on all succeeding diesel locomotive classes: a diesel engine that ran at medium-speed, hydraulic gears, power transmission via the <b>centre</b> <b>axle</b> by means of universal joints. Originally three different motors were fitted with 800 to 1000 PS; later 1,100 PS MTU motors were installed. All were supercharged V12 four-stroke diesel engines.|$|R
