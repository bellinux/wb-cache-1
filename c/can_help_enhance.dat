[...] In any of these styles, crossbars are most often absent, allowing a more unrestricted access for the left hand to modify the tone.

We propose a constructive algorithm for solving the complex eikonal equation.

The initial prior may come from the Gaussian beam approximation computed by dynamic ray tracing. Proper boundary conditions can ensure correct update directions.

Then, these clusters are used to (partly) assign la-bels to the unlabeled data. For this purpose, three methods are explored. The first applies Fuzzy C-means (FCM) to estimate the class of the un-labeled data, the second uses a general distance measure, and the third is {{a combination of the two}} methods. The prototypes resulting from the supervised and eventually refined by FCM are used as centers of the radial basis functions of the network. The training data consists of known labeled data and the unlabeled data whose labels have been estimated.
