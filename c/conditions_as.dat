5|$|The {{connection}} between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces {{is described by}} detailed treatment with statistical mechanics. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random <b>conditions</b> <b>as</b> entropy increases.|$|E

Some forms of migraine headache may also produce temporary dysfunction of the cerebellum, of variable severity. Infection can result in cerebellar damage in such <b>conditions</b> <b>as</b> the prion diseases and Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin <b>conditions,</b> <b>as</b> well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair <b>conditions,</b> <b>as</b> rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, {{it is unlikely that the}} Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial <b>conditions.</b> <b>As</b> the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E

The opening tie at the Victoria Ground finished 1–1 in extremely muddy <b>conditions</b> <b>as</b> Banks spilled a shot from Bill Asprey, with Keith Bebbington pouncing on the rebound. Back at Filbert Street, goals from Mike Stringfellow, Dave Gibson and Howard Riley won the game for Leicester 3–2 and settled the tie at 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such <b>conditions</b> <b>as</b> digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E
5|$|Excluding {{insects and}} other arthropods, 192 exotic animal species have {{established}} themselves in Florida as of 2009. More than 50 {{species of fish}} have been introduced. Early recorded species were the pike killifish (Belonesox belizanus) and oscar (Astronotus ocellatus). The extensive network of canals throughout South Florida allows many species to disperse more readily than they would under natural <b>conditions</b> <b>as</b> many regions in the Everglades go dry each year or experience extended drought periods. The overall impact of exotic fishes on the native populations and habitats is largely unknown.|$|E

This historic voyage took his ship into strange waters under difficult and frequently unknown <b>conditions,</b> <b>as</b> a result, the TRITON collected much valuable oceanographic information.

5|$|Hurricane Jeanne {{steadily}} weakened while crossing eastern Hispaniola, and on September 17 it briefly weakened to {{tropical depression}} status after reaching open waters. Its original circulation dissipated {{as a new}} one reformed closer to the main area of thunderstorms. Turning northward, Jeanne slowly reorganized and again reached hurricane status on September 20. It executed a clockwise loop to the west, weakening due to upwelling upon reaching its path again. Jeanne encountered favorable <b>conditions</b> <b>as</b> it continued westward, and it reached major hurricane status before crossing the northern Bahamas on September 25. The next day, it struck Martin County, Florida in nearly the same location as Hurricane Frances just weeks before. Jeanne weakened over land while turning the northwest, deteriorating to tropical depression status over Georgia on September 27. It turned northeastward, becoming extratropical on September 28 before dissipating on September 29 after merging with a cold front.|$|E
