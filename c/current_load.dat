25|$|Since supercapacitors do {{not rely}} on {{chemical}} changes in the electrodes (except for those with polymer electrodes), lifetimes depend mostly on {{the rate of evaporation}} of the liquid electrolyte. This evaporation in general is a function of temperature, of <b>current</b> <b>load,</b> current cycle frequency and voltage. <b>Current</b> <b>load</b> and cycle frequency generate internal heat, so that the evaporation-determining temperature is the sum of ambient and internal heat. This temperature is measurable as core temperature {{in the center of a}} capacitor body. The higher the core temperature the faster the evaporation and the shorter the lifetime.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of <b>current</b> <b>loads</b> on offshore vessels {{is required to}} determine operability of heavy lift and pipe lay operations. Whereas in the past only semi-empirical methods or model tests were suitable to obtain these data, CFD has recently become available as engineering tool to assess <b>current</b> <b>loads</b> on offshore structures. CFD {{has the potential to}} assess <b>current</b> <b>loads</b> more flexible in a numerical manner. Although the application of CFD has proven its value in {{assessment of}} ships resistance and VIV calculations, CFD is still not yet a fully proven method to calculate the <b>current</b> <b>loads</b> on offshore structures. Therefore validation of the results is further required to reach general acceptance of this method for offshore applications. HMC took the initiative to compare and validate CFD results with its model test data of <b>current</b> <b>loads</b> on one of its semi-submersible crane vessels. In this paper a comparison of CFD results with model test data of the <b>current</b> <b>loads</b> of a semi-submersible crane vessel is presented. The CFD calculations are performed as blind computations, so the model tests results were unknown. Afterwards the CFD results are compared with the results of the model tests.

25|$|Supercapacitors (except {{those with}} polymer electrodes) can {{potentially}} support {{more than one}} million charge/discharge cycles without substantial capacity drops or internal resistance increases. Beneath the higher <b>current</b> <b>load</b> is this the second great advantage of supercapacitors over batteries.

40|$|Porous {{carbon black}} was {{modified}} to introduce oxygen and nitrogen surface functionality and characterized using wet titration methods, elemental analysis, XPS, TEM, thermal analysis, adsorption of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Then the electrochemical capacitance was measured for cations and anions in 1 M H(2) SO(4). The results {{were compared to}} those obtained on activated carbons. The modified carbon black samples have four times higher adsorption of anions than cations. It is hypothesized that the graphitic microstructure of carbon blacks with structural defects is responsible for intercalation of anions in-between the graphene layers which take place at potentials higher than 0. 75 V vs. Ag/AgCl and at moderately low <b>current</b> <b>loads.</b> This process is reversible and the deintercalation occurs at approximately 0. 4 V vs. Ag/AgCl during the cathodic reduction. Introduction of nitrogen have generally a detrimental effect on the anion adsorption capacitance due to a structural defects blockage. At high <b>current</b> <b>loads</b> this phenomenon of enhanced anion adsorption capacitance becomes less pronounced due to the kinetic limitations. For amorphous activated carbons enhanced anion electrosorption at low <b>current</b> <b>loads</b> is governed by proton assistance while at high <b>current</b> <b>loads</b> larger cation capacitance {{is due to the}} pseudocapacitive interactions of protons with nitrogen and oxygen functional groups.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{equivalent}} circuit parameters measurement and estimation method for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The parameters measurement method {{is based on}} <b>current</b> <b>loading</b> technique; in <b>current</b> <b>loading</b> test a no load PEMFC is suddenly turned on to obtain the waveform of the transient terminal voltage. After the equivalent circuit parameters were measured, a hybrid method that combines a radial basis function (RBF) neural network and enhanced particle swarm optimization (EPSO) algorithm is further employed for the equivalent circuit parameters estimation. The RBF neural network is adopted such that the estimation problem can be effectively processed when the considered data have different features and ranges. In the hybrid method, EPSO algorithm is used to tune the connection weights, the centers, and the widths of RBF neural network. Together with the <b>current</b> <b>loading</b> technique, the proposed hybrid estimation method can effectively estimate the equivalent circuit parameters of PEMFC. To verify the proposed approach, experiments were conducted to demonstrate the equivalent circuit parameters estimation of PEMFC. A practical PEMFC stack was purposely created to produce the common <b>current</b> <b>loading</b> activities of PEMFC for the experiments. The practical results of the proposed method were studied {{in accordance with the}} conditions for different loading conditions...|$|R

25|$|The {{lifetime}} of electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes {{depends on the}} evaporations rate and therefore on the core temperature of the capacitor. This core temperature {{on the other hand}} depends on the ripple <b>current</b> <b>load.</b> Using the 10-degree-rule with the capacitor case temperature gives a good approach to operational conditions. In case of higher ripple currents the lifetime could be influenced positively with force cooling.|$|E
25|$|Such large {{changes of}} {{electrical}} parameters specified in IEC/EN 62391-2 are usually unacceptable for high <b>current</b> <b>load</b> applications. Components that support high current loads use much smaller limits, e.g., 20% loss of capacitance or double the internal resistance.

25|$|In {{order to}} compare the {{different}} characteristics of the different electrolytic capacitor types, capacitors with the same dimensions and of similar capacitance and voltage are compared in the following table. In such a comparison the values for ESR and ripple <b>current</b> <b>load</b> {{are the most important}} parameters for the use of electrolytic capacitors in modern electronic equipment. The lower the ESR, the higher the ripple current per volume and better functionality of the capacitor in the circuit. However, better electrical parameters come with higher prices.|$|E
25|$|Reliability for {{capacitors}} {{is usually}} specified in numbers of Failures In Time (FIT) {{during the period}} of constant random failures. FIT is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (109) component-hours of operation at fixed working conditions (e.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, at 40°C and 0.5 UR).

25|$|The lifetime, service life, load life or {{useful life}} of {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{is a special}} characteristic of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors, whose liquid electrolyte can evaporate over time. Lowering the electrolyte level influences the electrical parameters of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and the impedance and ESR increase with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. This very slow electrolyte drying-out depends on the temperature, the applied ripple <b>current</b> <b>load,</b> and the applied voltage. The lower these parameters compared with their maximum values the longer the capacitor's “life”.

2500|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} with non-solid electrolyte age as the electrolyte evaporates. This evaporation {{depends on}} temperature and the <b>current</b> <b>load</b> the capacitors experience. Electrolyte escape influences capacitance and ESR.

2500|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolytes have an exceptional position among electronic components because {{they work with}} an electrolyte as liquid ingredient. The liquid electrolyte determines the time-dependent behavior of {{electrolytic capacitors}}. They age over time as the electrolyte evaporates.

This very slow drying-out of the electrolyte depends on the series construction, ambient temperature, voltage and ripple <b>current</b> <b>load.</b> Lowering the electrolyte over time influences the capacitance, impedance and ESR of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and impedance and ESR increases with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. The leakage current decreases because all weaknesses are healed after the long forming time.
