40|$|Reticuloendothelial Fc {{function}} was examined in 24 normal individuals by determining the clearance rates of erythrocytes coated with rhesus antibody (IgG RBC) or chemically modified by treatment with n-ethyl malemide (NEM). The mean <b>clearance</b> <b>times</b> for the IgG RBC (52. 1 +/- 10. 3 min) and the NEM cells (87. 5 +/- 14. 7 min) in the 10 individuals who possessed the HLA antigen DR 3 {{did not differ}} significantly from the mean <b>clearance</b> <b>times</b> observed in the 14 non-DR 3 controls (IgG RBC 51. 5 +/- 6. 9 min and NEM cells 77. 6 +/- 4. 5 min).

These prolonged <b>clearance</b> <b>times</b> could not be attributed to lower numbers of antibody molecules bound to the red cell surface. The prolonged <b>clearance</b> <b>times</b> were reproducible but the putative Fc receptor defect in these individuals could be abolished by using IgG RBC obtained from different donors. When IgG RBC, prepared from a single donor were used to assess Fc function, no difference in the clearance rates of DR 3 positive and DR 3 negative individuals was found. Our results indicate that differences in the distribution of the rhesus antigen on the red cell surface can markedly influence the fate of these cells in vivo. We suggest that this is the explanation for our failure to confirm the association between Fc receptor defects and the HLA antigen DR 3...|$|R

Naked nanoparticles and HSA- or polyethylene glycol (PEG) -coated nanoparticles with/without MTX were studied. In vitro results showed no toxicity and a similar cell-kill efficacy of the MTX-loaded particles via HSA coating to that of free MTX, while MTX-loaded particles via PEG coating showed low efficacy. In vivo, the PEG-coated nanoparticles provided the largest distributions in normal rat brain and long <b>clearance</b> <b>times,</b> but due to their low efficacy in vitro, were not considered optimal. The naked nanoparticles provided the smallest distributions and shortest <b>clearance</b> <b>times.</b> The HSA-coated nanoparticles (with/without MTX) provided good distributions and long <b>clearance</b> <b>times</b> (nearly 50 % of the distribution volume remained in the brain 3 weeks post treatment). No MTX-related toxicity was noted. These results suggest that the formulation in which HSA was bound to our nanoparticles via a unique precipitation method, and MTX was bound covalently to the HSA, could enable efficient and stable drug loading with no apparent toxicity.

40|$|Background: The {{surgical}} {{management of}} recalcitrant frontal sinus disease {{has been a}} dilemma for otolaryngologists for many years. Although the osteoplastic flap with obliteration has been the gold standard of treatment for years, the modified endoscopic Lothrop (MEL) procedure recently has been advocated as an alternative. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of this procedure on the mucociliary drainage of the frontal sinuses postoperatively and this animal study addresses this issue. Methods: Fourteen sheep underwent the MEL procedure. The sheep were randomized regarding the use of postoperative irrigation via minitrephines. Each sheep had a nuclear medicine -scintigraphy frontal sinus clearance study via minitrephines performed on each frontal sinus preoperatively and then 3 months postoperatively. Then, the results of these studies were compared. Results: The scans revealed a trend toward faster <b>clearance</b> <b>times</b> postoperatively. However, this decrease was not statistically significant. Importantly, there was no trend or significant increase in <b>clearance</b> <b>times</b> postoperatively. Also, the use of postoperative irrigation was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward faster <b>clearance</b> <b>times</b> postoperatively. Conclusion: The MEL procedure has no adverse effects on the mucociliary clearance of the frontal sinus at 3 months postoperatively. Irrigation of the frontal sinus in the immediate postoperative period showed a trend toward improved postoperative mucociliary function at 3 months...|$|R
