50|$|From Newton, {{force can}} be defined as an {{exertion}} or pressure which can <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> object to accelerate. The concept of force is used to describe <b>an</b> influence which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> free body (object) to accelerate. It can be a push or <b>a</b> pull, which <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object to change direction, have new velocity, or to deform temporarily or permanently. Generally speaking, force <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object's state of motion to change.|$|R

5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, {{which can}} <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E

The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects <b>an</b> object. This <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> change in the heart's heat, which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of}} the heart also <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{research}} complied by meteorologist and tornado expert Thomas P.

In addition, the Amite-Purvis, 1908 Dixie tornado outbreak and Gainesville, 1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak tornadoes have also both been classified as only F/EF4 tornadoes, making the New Richmond Tornado the fifth deadliest F/EF5 in American history.|$|E
5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> change in the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering {{the activity of the}} enzyme according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E
