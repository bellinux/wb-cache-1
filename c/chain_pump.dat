5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), {{the philosopher}} Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{was the first}} in China to {{describe}} the square-pallet <b>chain</b> <b>pump</b> used to lift water (and other substances). Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and a horizontal axis beam. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.|$|E
5|$|The {{waterwheel}} {{appeared in}} Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by Huan Tan in about 20 AD, {{they were used}} to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers, and were used in pounding, threshing and polishing grain. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the 5th century. The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer Du Shi (d.38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron. Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches. The <b>chain</b> <b>pump</b> was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century-AD Balanced Discourse.|$|E
50|$|From the 1st century onwards, <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> were {{widespread}} {{throughout the}} Chinese countryside. Chinese square-pallet <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> were used mostly for irrigation, though they found use in public works as well. The infamous Eastern Han court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. A.D. 189) once ordered the engineer Bi Lan (畢嵐) {{to construct a}} series of square-pallet <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> outside the capital city Luoyang. These <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> serviced the palaces and living quarters of the Luoyang; the water lifted by the <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> was brought in by a pipe system. Ma Jun, the renowned mechanical engineer of the Three Kingdoms era, also constructed a series of <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> for watering the palatial gardens of Emperor Ming of Wei (226-239).|$|R

The Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. 189AD) ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> outside {{the capital city of}} Luoyang. These <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> was brought in by a stoneware pipe system.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>pumps</b> {{were also}} used in ancient China by at least the 1st century A.D. In China, they were also called dragon backbones. One of the {{earliest}} accounts was a description by the Han Dynasty philosopher Wang Chong (A.D. 27-97) around A.D. 80. Unlike {{those found in the}} West, <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> in China resembled the square-pallet type instead of the pear-shaped bucket. Illustrations of such Chinese <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> show them drawing water up a slanted channel. These were sometimes powered by hydraulics of a rushing current against a horizontal water wheel acting against a vertical wheel, and others by a horizontal mechanical wheel acting upon a vertical wheel that was pulled by the labor of oxen. There were also square-pallet <b>chain</b> <b>pumps</b> operated by pedals.|$|R
25|$|For {{agricultural}} purposes the Chinese {{had invented}} the hydraulic-powered trip hammer by the 1st century BC, during the ancient Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD). Although it found other purposes, its main function was to pound, decorticate, and polish grain {{that otherwise would}} have been done manually. The Chinese also innovated the square-pallet <b>chain</b> <b>pump</b> by the 1st century AD, powered by a waterwheel or an oxen pulling on a system of mechanical wheels. Although the <b>chain</b> <b>pump</b> found use in public works of providing water for urban and palatial pipe systems, it was used largely to lift water from a lower to higher elevation in filling irrigation canals and channels for farmland.|$|E

By the end of the Han dynasty in the late 2nd century, heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards. These would slowly spread west, revolutionizing farming in Northern Europe by the 10th century. (Glick, however, argues for a development of the Chinese plough as late as the 9th century, implying its spread east from similar designs known in Italy by the 7th century.) ...|$|E

500|$|The world's oldest {{illustrated}} {{depiction of}} an endless power-transmitting chain drive is from Su Song's horological treatise. It {{was used in}} the clockworks for coupling the main drive shaft to the armillary sphere gearbox (rotating three small pinions), as seen in Needham's Fig. 410 and Fig. 652. This belonged to the uppermost end of the main vertical transmission shaft, incorporating right angle gears and oblique gears connected by a short idling shaft. The toothed ring gear called the diurnal motion gear ring [...] was fit around the shell of the armillary sphere along the declination parallel near the southern pole. Although the ancient Greek Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) featured a sort of endless belt for his magazine arcuballista, which did not transmit continuous power, the influential source for Su Song's chain drive is most likely the continuously-driven <b>chain</b> <b>pump</b> known in China since the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD).

500|$|There {{were great}} {{innovations}} in metallurgy. In addition to Zhou-dynasty China's (c. 1050 BCE– 256 BCE) previous inventions {{of the blast}} furnace and cupola furnace to make [...] pig iron and cast iron, respectively, the Han period saw the development of steel and wrought iron by use of the finery forge and puddling process. With the drilling of deep boreholes into the earth, the Chinese used not only derricks to lift brine {{up to the surface}} to be boiled into salt, but also set up bamboo-crafted pipeline transport systems which brought natural gas as fuel to the furnaces. Smelting techniques were enhanced with inventions such as the waterwheel-powered bellows; the resulting widespread distribution of iron tools facilitated the growth of agriculture. For tilling the soil and planting straight rows of crops, the improved heavy-moldboard plough with three iron plowshares and sturdy multiple-tube iron seed drill were invented in the Han, which greatly enhanced production yields and thus sustained population growth. The method of supplying irrigation ditches with water was improved with the invention of the mechanical <b>chain</b> <b>pump</b> powered by the rotation of a waterwheel or draft animals, which could transport irrigation water up elevated terrains. The waterwheel was also used for operating trip hammers in pounding grain and in rotating the metal rings of the mechanical-driven astronomical armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere around the Earth.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{use of a}} {{crankshaft}} in a <b>chain</b> <b>pump</b> {{was in one of}} al-Jazari's saqiya machines.

Saqiya machines like the ones he described have been supplying water in Damascus since the 13th century up until modern times, and were in everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world.|$|E

50|$|In 1206, Al-Jazari's Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices {{described}} many hydraulic machines. Of {{particular importance}} were his water-raising pumps.

50|$|A {{version of}} the <b>chain</b> <b>pump</b> was used in Ancient Roman times, {{sometimes}} with pots fixed to the chain, which, as they passed over the top pulley, tipped the water out.

The Sadler engine was a house-built table engine installed in a single-storey engine house with integral boiler; it replaced one of the horse-drives to the <b>chain</b> <b>pumps.</b> This engine was replaced in 1807 in the same house by another, more powerful, table engine made by Fenton, Murray and Wood of Leeds and, in turn, in 1830 by a Maudslay beam engine.|$|R
