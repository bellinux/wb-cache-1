The electrically fed load circuits need to have power isolated to them upon receipt of the following conditions, loss of flammable gases being released (above a predetermined threshold), and seismic(greater than 0. 12 g acceleration) activity. The two circuits requiring power isolation are the pump and heat trace power circuits.

25|$|Governor Thomas Posey reorganized the {{territorial}} courts in 1813 creating three districts and appointing judges to preside in them.

Posey had become familiar with Blackford who as clerk of the House of Representatives was responsible for communications between Posey, who was residing in Jeffersonville, and the General Assembly, which was in Corydon. Posey appointed Blackford to succeed Parke as judge in the 1st Circuit Territorial Court. The first circuit at that time was the largest in the territory and consisted of the eight western counties of the territory.

40|$|Abstract: The double-circuit {{transmission}} lines {{have already been}} the significant component of power system. Because of the symmetric insulation of the two circuits, the case that both <b>circuits</b> <b>trip</b> out often happens when the tower suffer lightning strike. And it harms the stability of power system and causes serious impacts to power equipments. In this paper, an electric-magnetic transient simulation model was established. Using this model, combining the analysis of physical mechanism of back striking trip-out, the influences of earth resistance, height of tower and length of insulator on the lightning withstand level of back striking (LWLBS) were clarified. The LWLBS of high tower is much low, therefore the relative high tower should be {{paid more attention to}} defense the back striking. Reducing the earth resistance and increasing the length of insulator can both upgrade the LWLBS observably. Especially, reducing the earth resistance can enhance the effect of upgrading the LWLBS by increasing the length of insulator...|$|R

50|$|Arcing {{can also}} occur when a low {{resistance}} channel (foreign object, conductive dust, moisture...) forms between places with different voltage.

50|$|The {{preliminary}} {{report from the}} Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) identified that problems started 90 seconds before the eventual failure. The first line to trip was a 66 kV line near Adelaide, and it was automatically reset. The first major fault was 47 seconds later when two phases of the 275 kV line between Brinkworth and Templers grounded. The Davenport-Belalie line tripped with one phase to ground, was automatically reset, but tripped again nine seconds later, so was isolated for manual inspection, with the fault estimated to be 42 km from Davenport. One second later (7 seconds before the state went dark), the Hallett Wind Farm reduced output by 123 MW. Four seconds later, a third 275 kV transmission line showed a fault, the Davenport - Mount Lock {{is on the other}} side of the same towers as Davenport-Belalie, and the fault was estimated to be 1 km further on. The damaged power lines caused 5-6 voltage glitches which stressed the ride-through capability of most of the wind farm capacity, causing 9 of them to shut down: Finally, all within one second, the Hornsdale Wind Farm reduced output by 86 MW, Snowtown Wind Farm reduced output by 106MW, the Heywood interconnector flow increased to over 850 MW and both of its <b>circuits</b> <b>tripped</b> out due to the overload. Supply was then lost to the entire South Australian region of the National Electricity Market, as the Torrens Island Power Station, Ladbroke Grove Power Station, Murraylink interconnector and all remaining wind farms tripped.|$|R
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as <b>circuit</b> breakers <b>tripped</b> all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|R
