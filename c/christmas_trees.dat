5|$|During the post-War years, Americans could select their <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> from {{a variety}} of offerings. Natural trees had become the {{preferred}} choice in America when Christmas tree farms began supplying them to large metropolitan areas in the 1920s. Artificial trees of bristles, aluminum trees, and flocked trees became alternatives to real trees during the post-War period.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, flocked <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> in purple, gold, pink, {{and even}} black became popular. The trees' {{branches}} were coated in a chemically-created, flame retardant substance resembling snow.

Natural trees would return to favor in the 1970s when country arts and crafts became popular.|$|E

5|$|Katie is also {{patron of}} Fair Trees, the {{organisation}} {{that is trying}} to stop exploitation of cone pickers in Ambrolauri, Georgia, by the European Christmas tree industry. The local people in this region of Georgia are paid a pittance to risk their lives climbing 30m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent to Christmas tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, no health insurance and very little pay; every year people are injured and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow and sell the only fair trade <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> in the world (certified by the WFTO).|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The Germans placed {{candles on}} their {{trenches}} and on <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees,</b> then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The artillery {{in the region}} fell silent. The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year's Day in others.|$|E

5|$|Biographies {{published}} {{after his}} death were typically heavy on eulogy. Theodore Martin's five-volume magnum opus was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it is an accurate and exhaustive account. Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-twentieth-century biographers such as Hector Bolitho and Roger Fulford, who (unlike Strachey) had access to Victoria's journal and letters. Popular myths about Prince Albert—such as the claim that he introduced <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> to Britain—are dismissed by scholars. Recent biographers, such as Stanley Weintraub, portray Albert as a figure in a tragic romance, who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for a lifetime. In the 2009 movie The Young Victoria, Albert, played by Rupert Friend, is made into a heroic character; in the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet—something {{that did not happen}} in real life.|$|E
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a {{time when}} the British were {{examining}} and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees.</b> He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several establishments for London's half-starved, illiterate street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of natural <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> in Canada developed similarly {{to that of}} the United States.

25|$|The {{practice}} of cultivating evergreens specifically to sell as <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> {{dates back to}} 1901, when a 25,000tree Norway spruce farm was sown near Trenton, New Jersey. The commercial market for <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> had started fifty years earlier when a farmer from the Catskill Mountains brought trees into New York City to sell. Despite these pioneering efforts, most people still obtained wild-grown <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> from forests into the 1930s and 1940s. More trees were grown in plantations after World War II, and by the 1950s farmers were shearing and pruning trees to meet customer demands. The Christmas tree market burgeoned through the 1960s and 1970s, but from the late 1980s onward prices and the market for natural <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> declined. In the early 21st century, nearly 98percent of all natural (non-artificial) <b>Christmas</b> <b>trees</b> sold worldwide were grown on tree farms.|$|E
