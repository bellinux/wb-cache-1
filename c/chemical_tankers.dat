2500|$|In November 2008, Somali pirates began {{hijacking}} ships well {{outside the}} Gulf of Aden, perhaps targeting ships {{headed for the}} port of Mombasa, Kenya. The frequency and sophistication of the attacks also increased around this time, as did the size of vessels being targeted. Large cargo ships, oil and <b>chemical</b> <b>tankers</b> on international voyages became the new targets of choice for the Somali hijackers. This is {{in stark contrast to}} the pirate attacks which were once frequent in the Strait of Malacca, another strategically important waterway for international trade, which were according to maritime security expert Catherine Zara Raymond, generally directed against [...] "smaller, more vulnerable vessels carrying trade across the Straits or employed in the coastal trade on either side of the Straits." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>tankers</b> {{often have}} a system for tank heating in order to {{maintain}} the viscosity of certain cargoes, typically by passing pressurized steam through stainless steel 'heating coils' in the cargo tanks, transferring heat into the cargo which circulates in the tank by convection. All modern <b>chemical</b> <b>tankers</b> feature double hull construction and most have one hydraulically driven, submerged cargo pump for each tank with independent piping, which means that each tank can load a separate cargo without any mixing. Consequently, many oceangoing <b>chemical</b> <b>tankers</b> may carry numerous different grades of cargo on the same voyage, often loading and discharging these [...] "parcels" [...] at different ports or terminals. This means that the scheduling, stowage planning and operation of such ships requires a high level of coordination and specialist knowledge, both at sea and on shore. Tank cleaning after discharging cargo is a very important aspect of chemical tanker operations, because tanks which are not properly cleaned of all cargo residue can adversely affect the purity of the next cargo loaded. Before tanks are cleaned, they must be properly ventilated and checked to be free of potentially explosive gases. <b>Chemical</b> <b>tankers</b> usually have transverse stiffeners on deck rather than inside the cargo tanks, in order to make the tank walls smooth and thus easier to clean using permanently fitted tank cleaning machines.|$|E
