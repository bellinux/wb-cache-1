5|$|A {{defendant}} who is <b>competent</b> {{to stand}} trial is therefore also <b>competent</b> to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights, but not necessarily <b>competent</b> enough to represent herself at trial {{in the face of}} a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Smith (Roger Curtis) – Jones' right-hand-man {{and also}} a former operative. He is a very <b>competent</b> leader, but distrusts Cate's abilities.|$|E
5|$|A neatly {{assembled}} setup, with regulators, gauges, {{and delicate}} computers stowed inside the BCD, or clipped {{where they will}} not be walked on, and stowed under the boat bench or secured to a rack, is the practice of a <b>competent</b> diver.|$|E
5|$|Black meets up {{with the}} detective, Jim Horn (James Morrison), and sees {{that he is a}} <b>competent</b> and {{experienced}} investigator, although his recent separation from his wife has left him distracted and on edge.|$|E
5|$|General Ngô Quang Trưởng and General Lê Nguyên Khang were spared, {{but both}} men responded {{strongly}} to Thiệu's reaction. Trưởng considered the aforementioned generals to be victims of an injustice, {{as they were}} far more <b>competent</b> than Thiệu's loyalists in Saigon.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward <b>competent</b> commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a <b>competent</b> leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{companies}} {{also provide a}} battery replacement service, returning the original unit with new battery but original case. Alternatively {{it is possible for}} a technically <b>competent</b> user to buy and install a new battery. The task does not require soldering, but is technically challenging.|$|E
5|$|The Jarls Eirik and Svein proved strong, <b>competent</b> rulers, {{and their}} reign was prosperous. Most {{sources say that}} they adopted Christianity but allowed the people {{religious}} freedom, leading to a backlash against Christianity which undid much of Olaf Tryggvason's missionary work.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed psychologists to be <b>competent</b> to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather than be tried separately on each.|$|E
5|$|After {{a mental}} evaluation, a {{psychologist}} concluded Clemmons was <b>competent</b> {{to stand trial}} on the charges, which eliminated him {{as a candidate for}} involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an insanity or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release. Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court.|$|E
5|$|After several days, she {{was found}} by her friend Margaretta D'Arcy. With the {{assistance}} of an Irish parliament member and a therapist-psychiatrist from Dublin, Millett was declared <b>competent</b> and released within several weeks. She returned to the United States, became severely depressed, and began taking lithium again. In 1986, Millett stopped taking lithium without adverse reactions. After one lithium-free year, Millett announced the news to stunned family and friends.|$|E
5|$|Albert Speer {{said that}} though Himmler seemed pedantic and {{insignificant}} on the surface, {{he was a}} good decision maker, had a talent for selecting highly <b>competent</b> staff, and successfully inserted the SS into every aspect of daily life. Historian Peter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system {{under the auspices of the}} SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a <b>competent</b> tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{extremely}} <b>competent</b> administrator, there were reservations within the New Zealand government following Godley's appointment as {{commander of the}} division. Allen, although publicly supportive of Godley, privately believed an alternative commander should be found after the division completed its training. Godley was a distant and remote divisional commander, not popular with most soldiers of his command. He also favoured the professional officers of the NZEF, {{most of whom were}} seconded from the British Army, over those drawn from the Territorial Force.|$|E
5|$|Being born to {{an aristocratic}} family in England, he entered {{military}} service, seeing {{action in the}} French and Indian War, where he served alongside his future opponent George Washington in the 1755 Battle of the Monongahela. After the fall of Montreal in 1760, he was named its military governor. During this time he did not distinguish himself militarily, but proved {{himself to be a}} <b>competent</b> administrator.|$|E
5|$|Billy Homer (Andy Crowe) {{was also}} a {{recurring}} character. A tetraplegic, he is very <b>competent</b> with computer networks, sometimes hacking into the school's database. His storylines {{are some of the}} first representations of the Internet in British television. Moffat felt that he was unable to sustain the character, and he appears only sporadically after the first series.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking {{by the standards of the}} period. He had a reputation as a <b>competent</b> public speaker and was known for his generosity to his household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{chemistry}} positions {{require a}} bachelor's degree or similar {{in a natural}} or physical science as well as laboratory experience in general, organic, and analytical chemistry. Once in the position, individuals are trained in the protocols that are performed at that specific lab until they can prove they are <b>competent</b> to perform all experiments without supervision.. Practicing chemists already {{in the field are}} expected to have continuing education to maintain their proficiency.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by <b>competent</b> officers.|$|E
5|$|Lombardy {{noted the}} shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky {{remained}} glued to his seat. A sympathetic Lothar Schmid came over, {{and the two}} shifted the pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of <b>competent</b> analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{argued that}} {{appreciation}} of the sarangi and him came only after acknowledgment by the Western audience. He attributed the lack of sarangi students {{to a lack of}} <b>competent</b> teachers and said that the Indian government should assist in preserving the instrument. The Pt (Pandit) Ram Narayan Foundation in Mumbai awards scholarships to sarangi students. Narayan has stated he was skeptical the sarangi would survive and said he would never give up promoting the instrument.|$|E
5|$|Narihira {{combined}} all {{the qualities}} most admired in a Heian courtier: {{he was of}} high birth (a grandson of the Emperor Heizei), extremely handsome, a gifted poet, and an all-conquering lover. He was probably also an expert horseman, adept in arms, and a <b>competent</b> official. These aspects of his life are not emphasized in The Tales of Ise, but they distinguish Narihira from other heroes of Heian literature, including Genji.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 2002, ASL Dean Anthony Sutin, Professor Thomas Blackwell, and first-year student Angela Dales {{were shot}} and killed by disgruntled student Peter Odighizuwa, 43, of Nigeria. When Odighizuwa exited the building, he was subdued by two {{students}} armed with personal firearms. At his trial, Odighizuwa was found mentally <b>competent,</b> pleaded guilty to the murders to avoid the death penalty, and was sentenced to multiple life terms in prison.|$|E
5|$|On {{days when}} a large bore is expected, {{hundreds}} of surfing enthusiasts may accumulate, waiting for the waves to arrive. Hazards in high water conditions can include floating trees, collapsing portions of river bank, overhanging branches and even dead farm animals. The Gloucester Harbour Trustees, as <b>competent</b> harbour authority for {{this part of the}} river, have issued safety guidance for surfers, canoeists, small craft and river bank users in relation to the bore.|$|E
5|$|The artistic {{workshops}} {{established by}} Æthelwold reached {{a high standard}} of craftsmanship in manuscript illustration, sculpture and gold and silver, and were influential both in England and on the Continent. In his monasteries, learning reached a high standard, producing <b>competent</b> prose and poetry in the elaborate hermeneutic style of Latin favoured in tenth-century England. His Winchester school {{played an important role}} in creating the standard vernacular West Saxon literary language, and his pupil Ælfric was its most eminent writer.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{underlying}} much of Manhattan is a {{mica schist}} known as Manhattan schist. It is a strong, <b>competent</b> metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed. It {{is well suited}} for the foundations of tall buildings. In Central Park, outcrops of Manhattan Schist occur and Rat Rock is one rather large example.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has been both}} criticised and praised by several commentators. Some viewed her as a <b>competent</b> and professional soldier, and considered her to be less sexualised than other female gaming characters due to her military clothing. Others, however, argued that she was weakened as the protagonist by features that undermined her role as heroine, and criticised some of her sexualised costumes that players receive as rewards for completing certain tasks within the games.|$|E
5|$|The {{church does}} not {{recognise}} divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the <b>competent</b> ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{complicated by the}} American spoils system. After Andrew Jackson assumed the U.S. presidency in March 1829, many <b>competent</b> Indian agents were replaced by unqualified Jackson loyalists, argues historian John Hall. Men like Thomas Forsyth, John Marsh, and Thomas McKenney were replaced by less qualified men such as Felix St. Vrain. In the 19th century, historian Lyman Draper argued that the Black Hawk War {{could have been avoided}} had Forsyth remained as the agent to the Sauks.|$|E
5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly and awkward when on the ground, {{the anatomy of}} some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) suggests that they were <b>competent</b> walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs have long been considered particularly cumbersome locomotors due {{to the presence of}} large cruropatagia, but they too appear to have been generally efficient on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Thus, a {{political}} wire-puller such as Grigori Rasputin enjoys power best when playing off another person's hereditary power, {{or when the}} organisation benefits largely from an air of mystery. By contrast, the wirepuller suffers a wane in power when the organizational élite {{is made up of}} <b>competent</b> individuals (Russell 1938:34).|$|E
5|$|To avoid injury during descent, divers must be <b>competent</b> at {{equalising}} the ears, sinuses and mask; {{they must}} also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good buoyancy control and trim also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using swimfins for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Under the Constitution, all {{laws and}} cabinet orders must be {{signed by the}} <b>competent</b> Minister and {{countersigned}} by the Prime Minister, before being formally promulgated by the Emperor. Also, {{all members of the}} Cabinet cannot be subject to legal action without the consent of the Prime Minister; however, without impairing the right to take legal action.|$|E
5|$|Under the Macedonian emperors, {{the city}} of Constantinople flourished, {{becoming}} the largest and wealthiest city in Europe, {{with a population of}} approximately 400,000 in the 9th and 10th centuries. During this period, the Byzantine Empire employed a strong civil service staffed by <b>competent</b> aristocrats that oversaw the collection of taxes, domestic administration, and foreign policy. The Macedonian emperors also increased the Empire's wealth by fostering trade with Western Europe, particularly through the sale of silk and metalwork.|$|E
5|$|Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour (29 April 1759 – 11 September 1801) was {{a senior}} British Royal Navy officer of the late 18th century who was the fifth son of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford and became known for being both a {{prominent}} society figure and a highly <b>competent</b> naval officer. He served during the American Revolutionary and French Revolutionary Wars and later in his career performed a period of shore duty on the Admiralty board.|$|E
5|$|While it {{achieved}} {{successes and}} proved itself <b>competent</b> in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division {{earned a reputation}} for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by {{the spring and summer}} of 1944.|$|E
