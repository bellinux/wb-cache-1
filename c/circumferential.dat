5|$|As seas {{surrounding}} Banton can {{be rough}} during the wet season, {{the best time}} to visit the island is from March to May during the dry (summer) season. This is also the typical time for Asi families living in Metro Manila or abroad to visit the island since it coincides with the Lenten season and barangay fiestas. Within the island, the main forms of transportation are passenger motorcycles (known elsewhere as habal-habal) and motorized boats. A <b>circumferential</b> road connects the 17 barangays of Banton to each other.|$|E
5|$|High-altitude clouds on Neptune {{have been}} {{observed}} casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude. These <b>circumferential</b> bands have widths of 50–150km and lie about 50–110km above the cloud deck. These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. Unlike Uranus, Neptune's composition has a higher volume of ocean, whereas Uranus has a smaller mantle.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} remained open to {{the public}} until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration. The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing, slightly flared out at the bottom. In the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 <b>circumferential</b> feet that had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored.|$|E
5|$|Among the city's major {{industries}} are shipbuilding, military, and aerospace. Newport News Shipbuilding, owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries, {{and the large}} coal piers supplied by railroad giant CSX Transportation, the modern Fortune 500 successor to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C). Miles of the waterfront {{can be seen by}} automobiles crossing the James River Bridge and Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel, which is a portion of the <b>circumferential</b> Hampton Roads Beltway, linking the city with each of the other major cities of Hampton Roads via Interstate 664 and Interstate 64. Many U.S. defensive industry suppliers are based in Newport News, and these and nearby military bases employ many residents, in addition to those working at the shipyard and in other harbor-related vocations.|$|E
5|$|I-195 curves {{southeast}} and passes under the BWI Trail {{ahead of its}} partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 170 (Aviation Boulevard), {{also known as the}} Airport Loop. The Airport Loop provides access to long-term parking lots, the consolidated rental car facility, hotels, cargo and general aviation facilities, and the BWI Rail Station. The <b>circumferential</b> highway also provides indirect access to I-97 for traffic heading to Annapolis or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. At this interchange, I-195 ends and the roadway continues as MD 995A towards the entrance to BWI Airport.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Pi Vell, Pi Jove {{had escaped}} the attentions of vandals until more recently, {{due to its}} lower {{political}} profile and greater distance (200 m) from the road. In 2010, it was discovered with a <b>circumferential</b> cut through the bark, in addition to apparent shotgun damage. Vandals attacked it in June 2015, attempting to saw through one of its trunks, {{though it was not}} thought that the damage was serious enough to kill the affected trunk. As a precaution, in December 2015 arborists installed a frame to hold the three trunks together and ensure their stability. In January 2016, deeper chainsaw cuts were discovered on the already-damaged trunk which are believed harsh enough to kill the trunk altogether; these vandals also attacked Pi Vell.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} little focus on {{expansion}} of the system because the system {{was in a state}} of disrepair, and funds were allocated to rebuilding and repairing the existing system. However, in the 1990s, with the system in better shape, the construction of the Second Avenue Subway was looked into again. Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the Regional Plan Association have pushed for the further expansion of the system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a <b>circumferential</b> line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further expansion of the Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit unfunded.|$|E
5|$|With many {{residents}} employed at the expansive Newport News Shipbuilding, the joint U.S. Air Force-U.S. Army installation at Joint Base Langley–Eustis, {{and other military}} bases and suppliers, the city's economy is very connected to the military. The location on the harbor and along the James River facilitates a large boating industry which {{can take advantage of}} its many miles of waterfront. Newport News also serves as a junction between the rails and the sea with the Newport News Marine Terminals located at the East End of the city. Served by major east-west Interstate Highway 64, it is linked to others of the cities of Hampton Roads by the <b>circumferential</b> Hampton Roads Beltway, which crosses the harbor on two bridge-tunnels. Part of the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport is in the city limits.|$|E
25|$|Rearranging the Laplace and Poiseuille {{relations}} {{suggests that}} radial growth occurs {{as a result}} of <b>circumferential</b> stretch and <b>circumferential</b> growth {{occurs as a result}} of shear stress. Shear stress is proportional to the speed inside the vessel as well as the pressure drop between two fixed points on the vessel wall. The precise mechanism of vessel remodelling is believed to be high stress on the inner wall of the vessel which can induce growth, which heads toward uniform compressive and tensile stress {{on both sides of the}} vessel wall. Generally, it has been found that <b>circumferential</b> residual stress is compressive and tensile, indicating that inner layers of the endothelial tube grow more than outer layers.|$|E
25|$|Maps of the Nashua area often show {{a stretch}} of freeway forming a <b>circumferential</b> highway through Nashua and the {{neighboring}} town of Hudson. Only a small section of {{the south end of}} this highway (Exit 2 off U.S. Route 3) has been built, and it is unclear whether the highway will ever be completed. If finished, the Nashua-Hudson <b>Circumferential</b> Highway would be part of the Everett Turnpike, and would rejoin the mainline highway at a hypothetical Exit 9 in northern Nashua.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{tourniquet}} cuff is to safely stop or restrict arterial blood flow into a portion of an extremity by applying a uniform <b>circumferential</b> pressure around the extremity at a desired location.|$|E
25|$|Both cast <b>circumferential</b> and wrought wire clasps are supra bulge clasps, in {{that they}} engage an {{undercut}} on the tooth by originating coronal to the height of contour, while Roach clasps are infrabulge clasps and engage undercuts by approaching from the gingival.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} lines being planned. This {{includes}} a subway line under Utica Avenue in Brooklyn; an outer-borough <b>circumferential</b> line, the Triboro RX; a reuse {{of the northern}} part of the Rockaway Beach Branch; and a line to LaGuardia Airport.|$|E
25|$|Grade 3a (severe edema): Lymphedema {{is present}} in one limb and its {{associated}} trunk quadrant. <b>Circumferential</b> difference is greater than 6 centimeters. Significant skin alterations, such as cornification or keratosis, cysts and/or fistulae, are present. Additionally, the patient may experience repeated attacks of erysipelas.|$|E
25|$|A <b>circumferential</b> abdominoplasty is an {{extended}} abdominoplasty plus a buttock lift. The resulting scar runs {{all the way}} around the body, and the operation is also called a Belt Lipectomy or lower body lift. This operation is most appropriate for patients who have undergone massive weight loss.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal {{prolapse}} can be differentiated from a full thickness external {{rectal prolapse}} (a complete rectal prolapse) by {{the orientation of}} the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run <b>circumferential.</b> In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially. The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} layer shields {{and the oil}} film act as thermal insulation, leading to a low temperature of the lubricating film (maximum ~ on a water-cooled Wankel engine. This gives a more constant surface temperature. The temperature around the spark plug {{is about the same}} as the temperature in the combustion chamber of a reciprocating engine. With <b>circumferential</b> or axial flow cooling, the temperature difference remains tolerable.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of aortic root dilatation ranges from 8.8 to 42% {{in patients with}} Turner syndrome. Even if not every aortic root dilatation necessarily goes on to an aortic dissection (<b>circumferential</b> or transverse tear of the intima), complications such as dissection, aortic rupture resulting in death may occur. The natural history of aortic root dilatation is still unknown, but it is linked to aortic dissection and rupture, which has a high mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|Vascular remodelling is {{a process}} which begins at day 21 of human embryogenesis, when an {{immature}} heart begins contracting, pushing fluid through the early vasculature. This first passage of fluid initiates a signal cascade based on physical cues including shear stress and <b>circumferential</b> stress, which {{is necessary for the}} remodelling of the vascular network, arterial-venous identity, angiogenesis, and the regulation of genes through mechanotransduction. This embryonic process is necessary for the future stability of the mature vascular network.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal {{prolapse}} (partial rectal mucosal prolapse) {{refers to}} prolapse of the loosening of the submucosal attachments to the muscularis propria of the distal rectummucosal {{layer of the}} rectal wall. Most sources define mucosal prolapse as an external, segmental prolapse which is easily confused with prolapsed (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids (piles). However, both internal mucosal prolapse (see below) and <b>circumferential</b> mucosal prolapse are described by some. Others do not consider mucosal prolapse a true form of rectal prolapse.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{invention}} of defecography, In 1968 Broden and Snellman used cinedefecography to show that rectal prolapse begins as a <b>circumferential</b> intussusception of the rectum, which slowly increases over time. The {{leading edge of the}} intussusceptum may be located at 6–8cm or at 15–18cm from the anal verge. This proved an older theory from the 18th century by John Hunter and Albrecht von Haller that this condition is essentially a full-thickness rectal intussusception, beginning about 3 inches above the dentate line and protruding externally.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the vascular network is self-organized at each point in the tissue due to the balance between compressive forces of tissue expansion and <b>circumferential</b> stretch of the vessel walls. Over time, this means that migrating lines become straight rather than curving; this is akin to imagining two moving boundaries pushing on each other. Straight vessels are usually parallel to isopressure lines because the boundaries have acted to equilibriate pressure gradients. In addition, vessel direction tends to follow {{the direction of the}} normal to the steepest stress gradient.|$|E
25|$|The fiber {{is used in}} woven {{rope and}} in cable, where the fibers are kept {{parallel}} within a polyethylene sleeve. The cables {{have been used in}} suspension bridges such as the bridge at Aberfeldy in Scotland. They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by <b>circumferential</b> application followed by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for optical fiber cable, as its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking. When used in this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name Parafil.|$|E
25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes <b>circumferential</b> fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the <b>circumferential</b> fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E
25|$|One {{aspect of}} the {{argument}} is that by having a single toll road system for the state that controls the major commuter routes into Chicago and the major <b>circumferential</b> route around the city, commuters and long-haul truckers who use the original system that was built in 1958 are subsidizing the subsequent routes, I-88 to Dixon and I-355 in DuPage County. As a result, instead of the original routes becoming freeway, the revenues from the original system subsidized less intensively used routes that could not be financed on a stand-alone basis.|$|E
25|$|The {{epidermis}} {{is either}} a syncytium or a single layer of cells, and is covered by a thick collagenous cuticle. The cuticle is often of complex structure, and may {{have two or three}} distinct layers. Underneath the epidermis lies a layer of longitudinal muscle cells. The relatively rigid cuticle works with the muscles to create a hydroskeleton as nematodes lack <b>circumferential</b> muscles. Projections run from the inner surface of muscle cells towards the nerve cords; this is a unique arrangement in the animal kingdom, in which nerve cells normally extend fibres into the muscles rather than vice versa.|$|E
25|$|A cricket ball is not {{a perfect}} sphere. The seam of the ball is the {{circular}} stitching which joins {{the two halves of}} the cricket ball. Hence, the seam joining the pieces of leather is <b>circumferential</b> and the stitching is noticeably raised. If the ball is bowled {{in such a way that}} the seam hits the pitch when it bounces, this irregularity can cause the ball to deviate sideways in its path. It may move in any direction, or just go straight. The batsman has to see how the ball moves after pitching to select his shot.|$|E
25|$|A {{tracheal}} tube may contain ridge-like <b>circumferential</b> rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops or helices. In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae {{may also be}} connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are {{able to control the}} flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, {{in the form of a}} gill, or function essentially as normal, via a plastron. Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are shed during moulting (ecdysis).|$|E
25|$|By 1964, Henrico County was {{planning}} a <b>circumferential</b> highway {{in the western}} part of the county, and county officials requested state aid for the new Parham Road <b>circumferential.</b> Construction of the new Parham Road began between 1965 and 1967 and was completed in 1968. The work consisted of new construction from just south of Quioccasin Road to the intersection of Three Chopt Road and existing Parham Road and from just west of US 250 to the intersection of US 1 and SR 73. Existing Parham Road was expanded from Three Chopt Road to US 250; in addition, Ridge Road was expanded from the present Ridge RoadParham Road intersection south of SR 6 to Quioccasin Road. Parham Road was extended south as a two-lane road from Ridge Road to River Road by 1971. On the opposite end of the highway, the highway was extended east from I-95 to US 301 and SR 2 and the I-95 interchange was expanded to a full cloverleaf in 1978. The ChippenhamParham Connector was proposed as early as 1972. Its course from Forest Hill Avenue south of the James River to Parham Road at Ridge Road was approved in 1984; the section from River Road to the southern end of the four-lane portion of Parham Road would be constructed by Henrico County. The cross-James portion of SR 150 and the four-lane connecting portion of Parham Road were completed in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Classical lissencephaly, {{also known}} as type I or {{generalized}} agyria-pachygyria, is a severe brain malformation of a smooth cerebral surface, abnormally thick (10-20mm) cortex with four layers, widespread neuronal heterotopia, enlarged ventricles, and agenesis or malformation of the corpus callosum. Classical lissencephaly can range from agyria to regional pachygyria and is usually present along with subcortical band heterotopia (known as ‘double cortex’ to describe the <b>circumferential</b> bands of heterotopic neurons located beneath the cortex). Subcortical band heterotopia is a malformation slightly different from lissencephaly that is now classified under the agyria-pachygyria-band spectrum because it consists of a gyral pattern consistent with broad convolutions and an increased cortical thickness.|$|E
25|$|The most {{restrictive}} {{definition of}} the Greater Boston area is the region administered by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC). The MAPC is a regional planning organization created by the Massachusetts legislature to oversee transportation infrastructure and economic development concerns in the Boston area. The MAPC includes 101 cities and towns that are grouped into eight subregions. These include most of the area within the region's outer <b>circumferential</b> highway, I-495. In 2013, {{the population of the}} MAPC district was 3.2 million, which was 48% of the total population of Massachusetts, in an area of , of which 39% is forested and an additional 11% is water, wetland, or other open space.|$|E
25|$|The Urban Ring is {{a project}} of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to develop new public {{transportation}} routes that would provide improved <b>circumferential</b> connections among many existing transit lines that project radially from downtown Boston, allowing easier travel between locations outside of downtown. The project corridor passes through various neighborhoods of Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Somerville, Cambridge, and Brookline. The capital cost for {{this version of the}} plan is estimated at $2.2 billion, with a projected daily ridership of 170,000. Fifty-three percent of the route is either in a bus-only lane, dedicated busway, or tunnel. The Urban Ring would have a higher collective ridership than the Orange Line, Blue Line, or the entire commuter rail system.|$|E
25|$|David Uckotter, {{who was the}} {{engineering}} director for the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government during the road's construction, also noted that Man o' War had to be designed and built around numerous subdivisions that were sprouting throughout south Lexington in that era. He indicated that this dictated a 120-foot right-of-way, which left no room for breakdown lanes. Uckotter also added {{that at the time}} Man o' War was proposed, plans were on the table for a southern beltway similar to New Circle Road outside Man o' War, hugging the border between Lexington and Jessamine County. These plans were dropped in the early 1980s, leaving Man o' War as Lexington's only <b>circumferential</b> road outside New Circle, which Uckotter contends has contributed to current problems with Man o' War.|$|E
25|$|Soviet cardiac surgeon, Vasilii Kolesov, {{performed}} {{the first successful}} internal mammary artery–coronary artery anastomosis in 1964. However, Goetz has been cited by others, including Kolesov, as the first successful human coronary artery bypass. Goetz's case has frequently been overlooked. Confusion has persisted for over 40 years {{and seems to be}} due to the absence of a full report and to misunderstanding about the type of anastomosis that was created. The anastomosis was intima-to-intima, with the vessels held together with <b>circumferential</b> ligatures over a specially designed metal ring. Kolesov did the first successful coronary bypass using a standard suture technique in 1964, and {{over the next five years}} he performed 33 sutured and mechanically stapled anastomoses in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), USSR.|$|E
25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and <b>circumferential</b> tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered <b>circumferential</b> stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E
25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the occluder approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the occluder and the valve housing causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve occluder as it contacts the valve housing. This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the <b>circumferential</b> lip of the occluder whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|E
