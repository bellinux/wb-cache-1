50|$|In 1962, {{engineers}} from Bell Labs {{developed the}} first D1 channel banks, which combined 24 digitized voice calls over a four-wire copper trunk between Bell central office analogue switches. A <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> sliced a 1.544 Mbit/s digital signal into 8,000 separate frames, each composed of 24 contiguous bytes. Each byte represented a single telephone call encoded into a {{constant bit rate}} signal of 64 kbit/s. Channel banks used the fixed position (temporal alignment) of one byte in the frame to identify the call it belonged to.|$|E

The advantage of A-Jacks over other hard armoring solutions is the comparatively large area available in the interstitial spaces for native vegetation to take root, ultimately helping to restore the stream bank to a more natural state while continuing to protect against erosion.|$|E

40|$|Regional {{contamination}} of southern Moravia (SE {{part of the}} Czech Republic) by heavy metals and magnetic particles during the 20 th century was quantified in fluvial sediments of the Morava River. The influence of local sources to the regional {{contamination of}} the river sediments and impact of sampling sites heterogeneity were studied in profiles with different sedimentology (facies) and lithology. For this purpose, hundreds of samples were obtained from regulated <b>channel</b> <b>banks</b> and naturally inundated floodplains and proxy elementary analyses {{have been carried out}} by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (ED XRF), further calibrated by ICP MS. Magnetic susceptibility as a proxy of industrial contamination was determined and the age model has been obtained by 210 Pb dating method. After establishing the lithological background from floodplain profiles, assessment of heavy metal contamination was done by using enrichment factors (EFs) of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr) and magnetic susceptibility. Floodplain sedimentary profiles were found to be realiable for assessment of contamination and reconstruction of large scale, i. e. a really averaged regional contamination, while regulated <b>channel</b> <b>banks</b> are suitable for obtaining of more or less qualitative information of influence of local point sources in the area because sediments from regulated river banks qualitatively reflect the actual local contamination of the river system. It allowed us to distinguish the influence of local sources of contamination by comparing with more spatially averaged contamination signal from more distal floodplain profiles. The study area is rather weakly contaminated (EF ∼ 1 - 2), while individual sediment strata from regulated <b>channel</b> <b>banks</b> contains several times larger concentrations of heavy metals...|$|R
