40|$|Various hydroxyl-propylmethylcellulose (HPMC) {{polymers}} {{were characterized}} according to size and compositional distributions (percentage of methoxyl and hydroxyl-propoxyl substitution) {{by means of}} comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) using reversed-phase (RP) liquid chromatography in the first dimension and aqueous size-exclusion chromatography (aq-SEC) in the second dimension. RP separation {{was carried out in}} gradient-elution mode applying 0. 05 % TFA in water and 1 -propanol, while 0. 05 % TFA in water was used as mobile phase in aqueous SEC. A two-position ten-port switching valve equipped with two storage loops was used to realize LC × LC. Detection of HPMC was accomplished by charged-aerosol detection (<b>CAD).</b> <b>Data</b> <b>processing</b> to visualize chromatograms was carried out using Matlab software. The significant influence of the LC × LC temperature on (the retention of) HPMC was studied using a column oven which allowed accurate temperature control. Due to the phenomenon of thermal gelation, which is a result of methyl and hydroxypropyl substitution of anhydroglucose units from the cellulose backbone, we were able to obtain additional, specific information on compositional characteristics of various HPMC samples. As the retention behaviour of gelated and non-gelated polymer proved to be different, the fraction of the polymer that is gelated in the chromatographic column could be monitored at different temperatures. Moreover, the temperature at which half of the polymer is gelated could be correlated with the cloud-point temperature. As a result, differences in inherent cloud points of modified cellulose {{can be used as a}} further distinguishing property in "temperature-responsive" LC × LC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is {{necessary}} to develop an integrated software system possessing <b>CAD</b> modeling, RP <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> and device driving functions in order to cater for the trend of miniaturization and boost the wide use of RP machine. Such an integrated prototype software system named Contemporary Integrated Rapid Prototyping System (CIRPS) is developed under the environment of Mechanical Desktop (MDT). First of all, the systematic framework of the software is described. Then the methods to internally represent 3 D model built in MDT and to extract the model data including geometrical and topological information are studied. Based on them, an adaptive direct slicing algorithm is constructed and realized by applying a grid-based intersection principle between the plane and parametric surface. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed one is more flexible and applicable. In addition, a novel 2 D layer file named CLA is proposed. Finally, all functional modules are developed employing VC++ and MDT API, thus implementing the seamless integration of 3 D modeling, model <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> and numerical control. The work {{of this study is}} significant to improving the part quality, simplifying the RP data preprocessing and calling for the market reorientation of RP devices...|$|R

40|$|Being able to {{efficiently}} compare as-built against as-planned 3 D {{states is}} critical for performing efficient building and infrastructure construction, maintenance, and management. Three-dimensional (3 D) laser scanners {{have the potential to}} be successfully applied to these tasks. Recent commercial products allow the comparison of 3 D scanned and 3 D <b>CAD</b> <b>data</b> based on <b>CAD</b> forms. Their current use is however limited due to the large amounts of manual <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> required for extracting useful information. By using 3 D Computer Aided Design (CAD) models as representations of 3 D specifications and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies, the authors present an approach for automating the comparison of 3 D sensed data and 3 D <b>CAD</b> <b>data.</b> This new approach does not perform this data comparison based on CAD forms but on point-clouds.

30|$|The 3 D {{modeling}} {{computer program}} “SketchUp” {{was used to}} create the virtual apparel stores. SketchUp is widely used for architectural and interior design in addition to mechanical and product design. Four models were developed in SketchUp to represent various kinds of store layouts and design themes that reflect typical fashion stores. Specifically, two store models were designed based on natural design themes (e.g., hardwood floors, wood walls) while the other two store models reflected modern design themes (e.g., metal wall panels). After the SketchUp models are created they were exported, converted to <b>CAD</b> <b>data,</b> and then converted again to VR <b>data.</b> Because <b>CAD</b> <b>data</b> are usually in a parametric form whereas VR data are {{in the form of}} tessellated polygons, a mesh of triangles (Purschke et al. 1998), <b>CAD</b> <b>data</b> need to be converted to polygons which define the surfaces of visual objects in VR. For example, if the surface of an object is curved in <b>CAD</b> <b>data,</b> arrangements of polygons that closely match the curved surface replace the surface in VR. Only this polygonal representation of a model allows for simultaneous rendering for VR (Beier 2000).|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} X-ray CT {{technology}} {{to inspect the}} inside parts of workpiece without destroying them. At present, there is few softwares capable of processing X-ray CT scanned data. Therefore, the function was developed to treat the data to evaluate geometric elements such as straight lines, circular arc and others, based on 3 -dimensional <b>CAD</b> <b>data</b> as the standard of inspection. After the coordinate system of scanned data is automatically related with the 3 -dimensional <b>CAD</b> <b>data,</b> the system evaluates geometric elements considering that a workpiece contour consists of a cluster of segments. Thus, the system cuts the contour of 3 -dimensional <b>CAD</b> <b>data</b> on the appointed cross-sectional planes and classifies them into geometric elements. To compare 3 -dimensional <b>CAD</b> <b>data</b> with the X-ray CT scanned data, the system calculates the straightness, angle deviation from the direction vector, length and its error of a straight line, and, roundness, deviation of center point, radius and its elTor. In addition, the system offers a visualization interface to display them so that the users utilize the evaluated result comfortably. As a result, the system is found effective to evaluate 2 -dimensional geometric elements...|$|R
