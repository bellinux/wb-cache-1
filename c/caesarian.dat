5|$|Cynesige perhaps {{came from}} Rutland, as {{he owned the}} manor of Tinwell there later in life. The Liber Eliensis claimed {{that he had been}} born by <b>Caesarian</b> section, but this is most likely a later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to have him declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant to survive a <b>caesarian</b> section was a miracle, and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E
5|$|If {{the infant}} is found {{alongside}} the adult, {{with the head}} oriented {{in the same direction}} as the adult, then the infant was delivered, whether naturally or by <b>caesarian</b> incision, around the time of death, and thereafter interred.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Clumbers {{often have}} {{difficulties}} conceiving and giving birth, and may require <b>caesarian</b> sections. Some dogs may suffer from sensitivity to anaesthesia. The most common severe health {{conditions in the}} Clumber Spaniel are entropion/ectropion eye conditions, spinal disc herniation and hip dysplasia. They have a median lifespan of around 10 years.|$|E
50|$|Sulla {{commanded}} {{the right wing}} of Caesar's army at the Battle of Pharsalus. In the battle, the <b>Caesarians</b> were victorious and the defeated Pompey fled to Egypt, where he was murdered.|$|R
50|$|Caesar {{gave the}} {{order to make the}} battle line as long as possible. He ordered that every second cohort to turn around, so the {{standards}} would be facing the rear. The legionaries charged and threw their pila, scattering the Pompeians. They pursued their enemy for a short distance, and began to march back to camp. However Marcus Petreius, and Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso appeared with 1,600 Numidian cavalry and a large number of infantry. The <b>Caesarians</b> were surrounded. They might have formed the testudo for protection. The <b>Caesarians</b> got ready for another breakout. They successfully broke out, but then both armies slowly retired to their camps.|$|R
5|$|Octavian came {{to terms}} with <b>Caesarians</b> Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 43 BC when the Second Triumvirate was formed. In 42 BC Mark Antony and Octavian fought the Battle of Philippi against Caesar's assassins Brutus and Cassius. Although Brutus {{defeated}} Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus did likewise soon afterwards.|$|R
5|$|Octavian also {{demanded that}} the decree should be {{rescinded}} which declared Antony a public enemy. When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions. He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on 19 August 43BC was elected consul with his relative Quintus Pedius as co-consul. Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another leading <b>Caesarian.</b>|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{meanwhile}} {{built up}} a private army in Italy by recruiting <b>Caesarian</b> veterans and, on 28 November, he won over two of Antony's legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain. In the face of Octavian's large and capable force, Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome and, to the relief of the Senate, he fled to Cisalpine Gaul, {{which was to be}} handed to him on 1 January.|$|E
5|$|Mark Antony was {{amassing}} political support, but Octavian {{still had}} opportunity to rival {{him as the}} leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. During the summer, he managed to win support from <b>Caesarian</b> sympathizers, however, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts {{to get rid of}} Antony.|$|E
5000|$|The series follows common {{misconceptions about}} the {{weakness}} of the <b>Caesarians</b> and their allies after Caesar's death. In fact, shortly after Caesar's death, his loyal legions secured Rome under the command of Lepidus, while the young Octavian was one of populares' important politicians in his own right; he was not on the run throughout Italy.|$|R
50|$|The {{assassination}} of Julius Caesar in 44 BC {{led to a}} conflict between {{the leaders of the}} plot murder him, Marcus Junius Brutus, and Gaius Cassius Longinus, and the <b>Caesarians</b> led by the Second Triumvirate which took charge of Rome. This led to the Liberatorâ€™s Civil War (43-42 BC). Before this civil war Brutus and Cassius fled to the east. They had been assigned the Roman provinces of Macedonia (Greece) and Syria respectively by Caesar. However, the <b>Caesarians</b> had the two provinces reassigned to Gaius Antonius (the brother of Mark Antony) and Publius Cornelius Dolabella respectively. They were <b>Caesarians.</b> Brutus and Cassius were given Creta et Cyrenaica instead. They were unhappy with being given this small province and prepared to invade Macedonia and Syria. However, the senate then voted to restore the two provinces to them. Brutus was also assigned Illyria. He arrived in Macedonia when Gaius Antonius had just arrived there to take up his propraetorship which had been assigned to him prior to the change made by the senate. His predecessor, Quintus Hortenius, joined Brutus. Vatinius marched on Dyrrachium and seized it before Brutus got there. However, the soldiers of his three legions (minus the lost cohorts), who disliked him, defected to Brutus, who then went on to engage Gaius Antonius who was in Apollonia (near Fier, Albania). He won over the troops of Antonius (his seven cohorts and a legion under his lieutenant, Lucius Piso) as well.|$|R
5|$|Octavian {{betrayed his}} party, {{and came to}} terms with <b>Caesarians</b> Antony and Lepidus and on 26 November 43 BC the Second Triumvirate was formed, this time in an {{official}} capacity. In 42 BC Triumvirs Mark Antony and Octavian fought the indecisive Battle of Philippi with Caesar's assassins Marcus Brutus and Cassius. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus also committed suicide shortly afterwards.|$|R
5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married his {{daughter}} to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering {{the eastern half of}} the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, {{but it was also a}} measure to please members of his <b>Caesarian</b> party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.|$|E
5|$|Sextus Pompeius {{was the son}} of First Triumvir Pompey {{and still}} a renegade general {{following}} Julius Caesar's victory over his father. He was established in Sicily and Sardinia as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39BC. Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius, {{who was a member of}} the republican party, ironically, not the <b>Caesarian</b> faction. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40BC when he married Scribonia, a daughter of Lucius Scribonius Libo who was a follower of Sextus Pompeius as well as his father-in-law. Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, Julia, who was born the same day that he divorced her to marry Livia Drusilla, little more than a year after their marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey showed}} that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas {{more than a quarter}} of Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{surveyed}} suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions typical in the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which again is more common in older dogs. Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring <b>caesarian</b> sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis. However, Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.|$|E
50|$|Book 4: The {{first half}} of this book is {{occupied}} with Caesar's victorious campaign in Spain against Afranius and Petreius. Switching scenes to Pompey, his forces intercept a raft carrying <b>Caesarians,</b> who prefer to kill each other rather than be taken prisoner. The book concludes with Curio launching an African campaign on Caesar's behalf, where he is defeated and slain by the African King Juba.|$|R

50|$|Book 7: The {{soldiers}} are pressing for battle, but Pompey is reluctant until Cicero convinces him to attack. The <b>Caesarians</b> are victorious, and Lucan laments {{the loss of}} liberty. Caesar is especially cruel as he mocks the dying Domitius and forbids cremation of the dead Pompeians. The scene is punctuated by a description of wild animals gnawing at the corpses, and a lament from Lucan for Thessalia, infelix - ill-fated Thessaly.|$|R
5|$|While in Egypt, Antony {{had been}} engaged in an affair with Cleopatra and had fathered three {{children}} with her. Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their <b>Caesarian</b> cause, while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them {{that it is the}} right thing to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a <b>caesarian</b> section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including <b>caesarian</b> section.|$|E
50|$|In the Casa Angela, a {{maternity}} {{home and}} centre for mother-and-child health care, {{women and their}} families receive medical care and guidance through pregnancy, birth and pre and ante-natal issues throughout {{the first year of}} the child. The Casa Angela is the first officially licensed birthing centre in Brazil. It aims to improve the poor level of obstetrics care for low-income families and resist the extremely high rate of <b>caesarians</b> in Brazil.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile in Rome, a {{formidable}} coalition was coming together {{in support of}} Decimus Brutus and in opposition to Antony, particularly since Cicero's return to the Senate in late 44 BCE. Cicero delivered a series of increasingly uncompromising speeches against Antony, called the Philippics. On 1 January 43 BCE, two moderate <b>Caesarians,</b> Aulus Hirtius and Gaius Vibius Pansa, took office as consuls, whereupon the republican faction took the initiative, declaring Antony a public enemy, legalizing the actions of Decimus Brutus and Caesar Octavian, and recruiting new legions.|$|R
50|$|During the Roman {{civil wars}} of the 40s, Valerius Orca resurfaces as one of Caesar's legates. Early in 49 BC, Orca was sent to occupy Sardinia. Caesar claims that the {{inhabitants}} of Caralis (modern Cagliari), the capital, were so roused by word of Orca's approach that on their own initiative (sua sponte) they threw out the Pompey-allied governor, who fled to Africa. The Greek historian Appian implies that part of Sardinia's strategic significance in the conflict was its importance as a center of grain production; Cassius Dio says little about the occupation of Sardinia by the <b>Caesarians,</b> noting merely that it was uncontested.|$|R
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a <b>caesarian</b> {{operation}} on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E
25|$|Lusk {{was also}} one of the first {{physicians}} to successfully perform a Caesarean section. In March 1887, Lusk performed the second <b>Caesarian</b> section in the United States where both the mother and child survived. By some time in 1888, he had already performed three fully successful <b>Caesarian</b> sections within the past year. Lusk was also a recognized authority on gynecology.|$|E
25|$|A normal dose {{of sodium}} thiopental (usually 4â€“6mg/kg) {{given to a}} {{pregnant}} woman for operative delivery (<b>caesarian</b> section) rapidly makes her unconscious, but the baby in her uterus remains conscious. However, larger or repeated doses can depress the baby.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Caesarians</b> Octavian (Caesar's principal, {{though not}} sole, heir), Mark Antony, and Marcus Lepidus under the Second Triumvirate had {{stepped in to}} fill the power vacuum caused by Julius Caesar's assassination. After the Triumvirate had {{defeated}} Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus at the Battle of Philippi (42 BC) and Lepidus was expelled from the Triumvirate (36 BC), Octavian and Antony were left as the two most powerful men in the Roman world. Octavian {{took control of the}} west, including Hispania, Gaul, Italia, and Africa. Antony received control of the east, including Graecia, Asia, Syria and Aegyptus.|$|R
50|$|After Verres, Sicily {{recovered}} rapidly, {{although not}} reimbursed for the robberies {{of the former}} praetor. Nor did Caesar's Civil War (49-45 BC) interrupt business as usual. Caesar's opponents had grasped the strategic importance of the island of Sicily {{as a base for}} attacking North Africa or for defending against an attack from Africa. However, after Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon and began the civil war he took control of the island; Asinius Pollio was sent as Caesar's emissary, to remove the governor of the island at the time, Cato the Younger. The <b>Caesarians</b> were therefore able to embark from Lilybaeum to attack the supporters of Pompey in North Africa.|$|R
40|$|The Bellum Hispaniense is for {{the most}} part {{considered}} in scholarship only with respect to textual and linguistic problems and in relation to its deficit in literary qualities. Through a close reading, the present paper analyses the representation of space in this third and last of the pseudo-Caesarian Bella and interprets it in the historiographical context of the Late Republic. It aims to demonstrate that the younger Gnaeus Pompeiusâ€™ military strategy in the area of Spain â€“ the occupation of locations on higher ground â€“ is semantically loaded as a â€˜barbarian strategyâ€™ and so stands all the more strongly in contrast to the virtus of the <b>Caesarians...</b>|$|R
25|$|Pre-eclampsia is also {{associated}} with increased frequency of <b>Caesarian</b> section, preterm delivery, and placental abruption. Furthermore, an elevation in blood pressure can occur in some individuals {{in the first week}} postpartum attributable to volume expansion and fluid mobilization. Fetal complications include fetal growth restriction and potential fetal or perinatal death.|$|E
25|$|Misoprostol is {{regularly}} {{used in some}} Canadian hospitals for labour induction for fetal deaths early in pregnancy, and for termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies. A low dose is used initially, then doubled for the remaining doses until delivery. In {{the case of a}} previous <b>Caesarian</b> section, however, lower doses are used.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{treatments}} beyond typical trauma care {{may be needed}} when the patient is pregnant. Because {{the weight of the}} uterus on the inferior vena cava may decrease blood return to the heart, it may be very beneficial to lay a women in late pregnancy on her left side. also recommended are Rho(D) immune globulin in those who are rh negative, corticosteroids in those who are 24 to 34 weeks and may need delivery or a <b>caesarian</b> section in the event of cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|When the Pompeians {{began their}} {{breakout}} attempt, heavy and brutal fighting ensued, with the escaping defenders suffering heavy casualties. Several Pompeians, {{many of them}} Lusitanians, actually managed to escape, but not Gnaeus Pompeius himself. Unable to walk due to his wounds and not transportable by horse or litter because of the local terrains' inaccessibility, he could not flee quick enough and together with several of his followers remained behind. With many Pompeians either gone or killed, the <b>Caesarians</b> then launched a renewed assault against the Pompeian position and overran the remaining defenders. Gnaeus Pompeius fled into a cave, but was discovered after some captives betrayed his hiding place, and, despite his wounds, fought to the death.|$|R
50|$|On 21 April 43 BCE, while Cicero {{pronounced}} {{his last}} invective against Antony, the Battle of Mutina was bitterly joined. That engagement decided {{the outcome of}} the Mutina campaign through the victory of the coalition between the republicans and Octavian's <b>Caesarians,</b> the death of the other consul Hirtius, and the definitive retreat of Mark Antony with the consequent lifting of the siege of Decimus Brutus. The Senatorial victory was, however, to prove ephemeral, for soon Caesar Octavian, alone in command since the two consuls' providential but suspicious demise, would break off his alliance with the senatorial Ciceronian faction in an abrupt realignment of forces that resulted {{in the formation of the}} Triumvirate with Mark Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus.|$|R
