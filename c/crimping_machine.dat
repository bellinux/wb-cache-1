50|$|Plastic {{spiral binding}} is a three-step process: punch, insert, crimp. First, a punch creates holes {{along the edge}} of the document. Second, a coil {{inserter}} spins the coils through the holes. Third, a pair of coil crimping pliers or a <b>crimping</b> <b>machine</b> is used to cut off the excess coil and crimp the end to prevent the coil from coming loose from the document. There are also more automated systems that will insert and cut and crimp the coil in one process and even some fully automated systems that will punch, insert, and crimp for the very high volume users. Light volume or personal users may choose to buy a single machine that does all of these features or may even choose to spin the coils onto their books by hand. Higher volume users will often choose to separate these three functions to help increase productivity.|$|E

At around 7 a.m, an explosion had been heard by the security guard, Sudhir Kumar, who along with his friend found smoke in the transformer room. The fire brigade and the Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) were informed and the fire was brought under control by 7.25 a.m. Inspection of the transformer by the Superintendent of the DVB and his team revealed that three of the low tension cable leads of the transformer had been partially burnt. At about 10.30 a.m., Inspectors from DVB along with Senior Fitter, conducted repairs on the transformer by replacing two aluminium sockets on the B-Phase of the low tension cable leads. The repairs, it appears, were carried out with the help of a die and hammer without the use of a <b>crimping</b> <b>machine.</b> DVB completed their repairs between 10:30 am and 11 am. The transformer was recharged for resumption of electric supply by 11.30 a.m. on 13 June 1997.|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} the crimped {{closures}} sealing {{is a serious problem}} for the quality {{control of the}} producers using such closures. The sealing of this closure is ensured by the pressure of a seal-ring between the container and the crimped closure. The sealing quality depends on the applied materials, crimped force on the <b>crimping</b> <b>machines</b> and other settings. However the closing force on the sealing can not be controlled directly, just in an indirect way by measuring the torque of the crimped closures. During the research we have specified the connection between the crimp force, the remaining closing force after the relaxation and the measurable torque, and we have also developed the right instrumentation for the quality control of crimped closure...|$|R

50|$|Termination of modular {{connector}} cables is very similar, {{regardless of}} the number of positions and contacts in the plug. To prevent damage to the plug (and the expensive crimp die-set), the crimp tool must be carefully matched to the plug being attached. For example, termination of a cable with an 8P8C plug involves using a hand crimper or <b>crimp</b> <b>machine</b> containing an 8P8C die-set or an A67T standard die-set. An 8P8C crimp die-set usually looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug. As the die compresses, these teeth force the plug contacts down into the conductors of the cable being terminated, permanently attaching the plug to the cable.|$|R

The clamp sleeve presses the crimping tong containing aluminium can to crimp {{the body with}} head. Due to the continuous action of the clamp sleeve to the crimping tong the inner surface of the clamp sleeve get corroded. The clamp sleeve is replaced when crimping appearance fails to meet compliance. In this Research an experimental work relating to improve the mechanical properties of locally available low carbon steel material by heat treatment process {{have been carried out}} to replace the spare parts of clamp sleeve which is collected from foreign countries. The mechanical properties have been studied on before and after heat treatment. After heat treatment, it is found that hardness, impact and compressive strength of heat treated specimen has been developed drastically as compared to that of before heat treatment. Finally, the properties of improved material has been determined and used to the machine functional area to check the performance of the clamp sleeve. After consecutive operation of the machine it can be concluded that the improved clamp sleeve meets the user requirement with compliance of smooth crimping quality and locally available low carbon steel material can be used for the preparation of clamp sleeve spare parts of <b>crimping</b> <b>machine</b> for pharmaceutical industry using the proper heat treatment process which might be helpful to save huge cost and time rather than collected from foreign countries...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aimed at developing a very comprehensive system of manufacturing wire splices for automobile wire harnesses. Ultrasonic welding is increasingly being used in various industrial applications. Lack of a scientific data-base of its properties when applied to wire splicing is {{a major reason for}} lack of proper usage by the wiring harness industry and its subsequent acceptance by the end user. This thesis presents various experiments conducted to develop tensile strengths and electrical resistances of various types of ultrasonically welded wire splices. Crimping technology was evaluated for its mechanical strengths and electrical properties by conducting various experiments {{to make it possible for}} the industry to compare it with other alternative splicing technologies. The results are then compared with ultrasonic welding. The next stage of this thesis discusses the economic feasibility of ultrasonic wire splicing. In order to find the number of ultrasonic welding machines required to meet a particular level of demand, which is a prerequisite for establishing the economic feasibility, a virtual model of the process and the manufacturing cell has been prepared and this model was used to study the dynamics of demand and the number of required machines. Simulation in manufacturing-problem-solving is being used very widely by researchers. Proper understanding and visualisation of the future of the factory and understanding and answering various questions related to the adoption of new technology, is another major reason why companies shy away from adopting ultrasonic welding systems. An advanced simulation tool namely QUEST was used to model the wire splice manufacturing cell of Alcatel and simulation studies were conducted to foresee how the production dynamics would be if ultrasonic welding machines were incorporated in place of <b>crimping</b> <b>machines</b> and various what if scenarios were developed and some vital production related questions were answered. Material handling is a major bottleneck in any wiring harness manufacturing environment. Some conceptual designs are presented on automating the task of feeding wires to ultrasonic welding machines and transferring the wire assemblies from welding stations to different work stations, currently being done manually. A wire palletising system was designed to improve the productivity. This thesis concludes that ultrasonic welding could be very effectively used for wire splicing and could be safely used in the manufacture of wiring harnesses for the automobile industry...|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} the Schleuniger Group {{as it is known}} today started in 1991 when Dr. Gerhard Jansen (Chairman BOD until 2009) and Martin Strehl (CEO until 2009) {{acquired}} Sutter Electronic AG located in Thun, Switzerland. At that time Sutter Electronic AG had 30 employees and generated a revenue of 5 million CHF with wire processing machines and other processing equipment. In 1993 the new owners acquired Schleuniger Productronic AG, which had been founded in Solothurn, Switzerland. This company also produced wire processing machines, but additionally had access to the international market. Both companies were then integrated into a group under the already internationally established name [...] "Schleuniger". In 1999, the Schleuniger Group took over their previously independent distributor [...] "L+H Kabeltechnik" [...] and secured direct access to Germany - its most important European market. Taking over the Swiss-based Kirsten AG in 2000 opened the crimping market for the Schleuniger Group and two years later Schleuniger entered the market for Plastic Optical Fiber (POF) and Flat Foil Cables (FFC / FPC) with the foundation of Schleuniger Flexon AG in 2002. Another 2 years later, Schleuniger took over the activities of the German [...] "Grote+Hartmann Engineering GmbH" [...] (GHWE) from the American Lear Corporation Inc., and developed fully automatic <b>crimping</b> <b>machines,</b> which are now produced by Schleuniger Automation GmbH in Radevormwald, Germany. Having been active in China through an independent representative for many years, Schleuniger opened a representative office in Shanghai in 2005, which was transformed into a trading company in 2007. In 2008, the Swiss Metall Zug Group took over the Schleuniger Group. The same year, Schleuniger took over PAWO Systems AG which became Schleuniger Solutions in 2009. In August 2009, Christoph Schüpbach succeeded Martin Strehl as CEO and Calvin Grieder succeeded Gerhard Jansen as Chairman in November 2009. A substantial investment was made in 2013 with the acquisition of the former Tianjin Haofeng Electrical Equipment Co., Ltd. headquartered in Tianjin, China. The new owners integrated the newly founded Schleuniger Haofeng (Tianjin) Machinery Co., Ltd. into the Schleuniger Group. Schleuniger Haofeng produces high-quality machinery for the wire processing industry. Prior to their acquisition, Tianjin Haofeng Electrical Equipment's 2012 posted sales were the equivalent of approx. 5 million Swiss Francs. Another acquisition was completed in Spring 2015 when the Cirris Solutions GmbH, headquartered in Jettingen/Germany became part of the Schleuniger Group. Due to its fully automated testing systems, Cirris Solutions is one of the global leaders in the field of applied testing technology and testing automation. Cirris Solutions GmbH has approximately 40 employees and generated translated sales of 7.2 million Swiss Francs in 2014 (currency exchange rate from Dec. 31, 2014).|$|R

The system is able to inspect cables with flat connectors differing in the type and number of wires.

The system is coupled to a connector <b>crimping</b> <b>machine</b> and once the model of a correct cable is learned, it can automatically inspect each cable assembled by the machine. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) the self-learning system; (ii) a robust segmentation algorithm for extracting wires from images even if they are strongly bent and partially overlapped; (iii) a color recognition algorithm able to cope with highlights and different finishing of the wire insulation.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{preparations}} for the experiment CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) planned at CERN in Geneva (Switzerland). The construction of the muon system, especially of the drift chambers in the barrel detector constructed with participation of the Aachen group, is explained. In {{the first part of}} the thesis the results from a Monte-Carlo-study for a decay channel interesting for the search for the Higgs boson at CMS is presented. In this channel the Higgs finally decays into four muons. The second part describes the running production of the drift chambers as well as results of tests developed and implemented for purposes of quality control. The LHC will accelerate protons to a center of mass energy of 14 TeV, aspiring to a luminosity of L = 10 ^ 34 cm^- 2 s^- 1, allowing for the production of a sufficient number of such processes as rare as the production of Higgs bosons, which were predicted, but not yet proven. The Higgs bosons, created mainly by gluon gluon fusion in proton proton collisions at the LHC, favor moving into the forward direction of the detector, because the center of mass system of the gluons moves into this direction. By means of a fully simulated detector study based on Monte-Carlo calculations of the channel H -> ZZ -> 4 µ the consequences for the final state muons are analyzed. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the angular dependent efficiencies of detecting the muons shows that both parts of the muon system, forward and barrel detectors, are of equally great importance. On the one hand, at least one of the four muons moves into the barrel region of the detector for 95 % of the events. On the other hand 84 % of the events show at least one muon in the endcaps (In case, the muons are equally distributed over the entire angular range one would expect 99 % of the events with at least one muon in the barrel detector and 81 % with at least one muon in the end caps.). Furthermore, the mass resolution within reach for the Higgs is discussed. Drift chambers are used to detect muons in the barrel region. In collaboration with three other institutes 250 drift chambers are constructed, where 70 of them are made and tested in Aachen. Each drift chamber is 2, 5 m wide, up to 4 m long and 0, 3 m high and consists of 12 layers being composed of single drift cells. A crossing muon creates electron-ion-pairs by ionization in the gas volume of a drift cell. Consequently, the electrons accelerated by high voltage drift towards the anode wire at the center of the cell. Due to an approximately constant drift velocity, it is possible to achieve a precise reconstruction of the muon track from the measurement of the drift time and the knowledge of the wire position. The complete process of producing the muon drift chambers is described in the fifth chapter, whereby a focal point lies on the <b>crimping</b> <b>machine</b> developed in Aachen and modified during this study. In order to detect the muons with certainty and sufficient accuracy, a necessary central detector parameter is the spatial resolution to be reached in the measurement of muon tracks. A spatial resolution of 100 µm of the muon drift chambers constitutes an adequate value. Consequently, with a preset number of measuring points on a track segment a spatial resolution of 250 µm arises for the single drift cell, thereby constituting a great challenge for the drift tube production. All single components of a drift cell have to be positioned and constructed with an accuracy of a few hundredth millimeters. The precision of the 70 drift chambers being produced in Aachen is to be guaranteed by inspection with comprehensive measurements. For the spatial resolution of a drift cell, the anode wire situated in the middle of the cell is the decisive component. Its exact spatial position in each single cell constitutes the foundation for ensuing accuracy in the measurement of muon tracks. By applying a tension of 3 N to the anode wires of a given length with almost maximal force at the edge of the elastic range, and by measuring the wire tension after the installation into the drift cells, it is possible to ensure a minimal sag of the wire. A new type of wire tension meter has been developed to the state of serial production in cooperation with the University of Purdue, whose special characteristic is a contact-less and simultaneous measurement of up to 64 wires in a process of about five minutes duration. Measurements and further developments concerning the functional ability and accuracy (0, 6 %) of the wire tension meter have been carried out within the scope of this thesis. Today, the device is used daily for purposes of quality control at all institutes involved in the drift chamber production with success. Every drift chamber produced in Aachen so far conforms to the demands for accuracy of the mechanical wire tension of ± 10 %. The position of the anode wire in the drift cell is primarily defined through the position of the wire ends. In order to determine the latter with an accuracy of a few hundredth of a millimeter, a special measuring system based upon computer-aided, optical measurements has been developed in Aachen. The further development of this system into a functioning instrument for the position measurement in the CMS reference system is part of this thesis. Thanks to a comprehensive calibration process for the entire system it was possible to reach a sufficient accuracy of about 50 µm for both axes of the system. This is sufficient to control the desired position accuracy of the wires of ± 100 µm. Within the measuring accuracy no deviation with respect to precise wire positions worth mentioning was found. Production mistakes could be found and consistently removed by means of the reached measuring accuracy in the daily wire position measurements thereby significantly improving the total mechanical positioning and gluing procedure. Thanks to the engagement of all persons concerned, the desired production speed of two muon chambers per month could be reached. Till the end of last year 36 chambers have really been glued, so today more than half of all muon chambers were already constructed and tested. Consequently, they are being constructed according to schedule. Due to the impressive achieved progress, the CMS-project is expected to become a successful experiment...|$|E
