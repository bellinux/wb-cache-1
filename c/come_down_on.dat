5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, {{but once he}} took office, he had to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{one side or the}} other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the set.|$|E
25|$|Bloomberg is {{a proponent}} of {{large-scale}} development. He has repeatedly come down in favor of projects such as the Atlantic Yards mega-development, the Hudson Yards redevelopment, and the Harlem rezoning proposal. On smaller-scale issues, Bloomberg usually takes the side of development as well. He favors the demolition of Admiral's Row {{in order to build}} a supermarket parking lot. However, Bloomberg has occasionally <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the side of preservation, most notably in vetoing landmark revocation for the Austin Nichols warehouse. This move was widely applauded by architectural historians. The City Council overruled the veto shortly thereafter, however.|$|E

25|$|One of {{a number}} of {{different}} grips is illustrated to the right. Essentially {{the only difference is that}} the middle and index fingers are split and <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> each side of the seam. This causes more drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, slowing down the delivery. Slower balls are also bowled by using the off break grip and finger action used by off spinners. A slower delivery may also be achieved – less commonly – by using a leg spin grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper aspect of the ball with only one finger or with the knuckles.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of his training, {{he made his}} return to the ring to engage in yet another contest at the 205-pound limit, this time against fellow shoot wrestler Ken Shamrock. Three minutes into the bout, Sakuraba struck through Shamrock's guard with a left hand. Shamrock staggered back and ultimately fell into the ropes, his head hanging out of the ring and his back turned to Sakuraba. Sakuraba rushed in to follow up but before any meaningful offense could be launched, the fight was halted by referee Yuji Shimada. Shamrock sprang to his feet immediately following the KO and protested vigorously. Opinions have been mixed regarding the KO's legitimacy; Ken's adopted brother and rival, Frank, has stated he believes the stoppage was justified, while others have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the opposing side.|$|E

25|$|Macleod was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for the Colonies in October 1959. He had {{never set foot}} in any of Britain’s colonies, but the Hola massacre had helped focus his thinking on the inevitable end of Empire. He told Peter Goldman of the Conservative Research Department that he intended to be the last Colonial Secretary, although he later wrote that he “telescoped events rather than creating new ones”. He saw Nigeria, British Somaliland, Tanganyika, Sierra Leone, Kuwait and British Cameroon become independent. He made a tour of Sub-Saharan Africa in 1960. He would often find himself in conflict with the more conservative Duncan Sandys, whom Macmillan had appointed Commonwealth Secretary as a counterweight to Macleod. Although Macmillan sympathised with Macleod’s aspirations, he was sometimes disturbed at the speed with which he progressed matters, and did not always <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his side in political disputes.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{captaincy}} of Peter Eckersley, Lancashire {{finished second}} in the championship in 1929 and reclaimed the title in 1930, with ten victories and no defeats that season. After four titles in five seasons, the early 1930s saw a number of retirements including McDonald and Dick Tyldesley in 1931 and Ernest Tyldesley in 1935: no Lancashire batsman has matched Tyldesley’s 100centuries in first-class cricket. Lancashire won the championship outright for the last time in 1934, the same year that Len Hopwood performed the double of 1,000runs and 100wickets (a feat he repeated in 1935) and Cyril Washbrook began to work his way into the team. The captain, Peter Eckersley, retired in 1935 to become an MP. The later half of the 1930s was a period of rebuilding up until the war, with the opening partnership of Cyril Washbrook and Eddie Paynter the highlight. Paynter scored 322 in five hours for Lancashire against Sussex in 1937 having <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the sleeper train from the victorious Old Trafford Test against New Zealand. He put on 268 in 155 minutes with Cyril Washbrook and celebrated his innings that evening at Brighton's Ice Palace.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{planned a}} huge {{wheeling}} movement that would ultimately <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Confederates' exposed left flank. Wilson's Cavalry Corps moved west on Charlotte Pike once {{an early morning}} fog dissipated, driving off the Confederate cavalry patrolling the area between the Confederate left and the Cumberland River. Smith's XVI Corps detachment followed, turning south after {{a mile or so}} towards the Confederate flank. The cavalrymen formed on Smith's right flank. Schofield's XXIII followed in reserve, and as the assault moved south a gap opened between Smith and Wilson which Schofield was directed to fill. At about 2:30 pm the Federals attacked the five redoubts guarding the Confederate left. Four brigades, two of cavalry and two of infantry, overran Redoubt No. 4 and then Redoubt No. 5, notwithstanding the spirited resistance of the defenders of Redoubt No. 4. Another of Smith's brigades captured Redoubt No. 3; however, its commander, Col. Sylvester G. Hill, was killed by Confederate artillery firing from Redoubt No. 2. He was the highest ranking Federal officer killed in the battle. Smith's troops proceeded to Redoubt No. 2, which was quickly captured.|$|E

500|$|A major {{point of}} {{criticism}} the film faced was regarding {{the possibility of}} Army attacking students in a radio station. When Rakeysh was questioned about the same in a scriptwriter's conference conducted by the Film Writers Association in the year 2008, he said the following, [...] "So, in 2005, in Allahabad, a bunch of 4 students took the TV station there, and they were shot dead. Everything I did, {{it was kind of}} was kind of borrowed, as I said right here. Obviously, what I am also learning is the way I tell a story is not real; you can term it as a-real. For maximum impact, for the message to go through, I felt—since the story was against the establishment—let the establishment do it. After all, the establishment did hang Bhagat Singh. After all, the establishment did <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the innocent, innocent students in Mandal Commission. After all the establishment did <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Tiananmen Square. After all the establishment did come down when the whole concept of Flower Power emerged in America. So it's all there. It's borrowed, maybe not as realistically, but it is definitely there in the society. During emergency, there are horror stories. If {{we have to go back}} to Kriplani and his movement in Bihar, the stories are absolutely horrific." ...|$|E
500|$|The thirteenth {{season premiere}} {{received}} generally positive reviews.

Trey and Matt are off to a great 13th-season start." [...] James Poniewozik of Time said [...] "The Ring" [...] was {{better than any of}} the twelfth season episodes. Poniewozik said the episode, [...] "demonstrated that the cartoon is best when it focuses on the four kids and when it is driven by a white-hot moral fury". Travis Fickett of IGN also particularly applauded the Disney satire, which he said, [...] "elevates this beyond shock humor and into sharp satire." [...] IGN gave the episode an 8.4 score out of 10.|$|E

500|$|Bechtel Jacobs was {{contracted}} to dismantle and demolish the K-25 facility in September 2008. The contract, valued at $1.48 billion, was made retrospective to October 2007, {{and ended in}} August 2011. Since then demolition work {{has been carried out}} by DOE's current environmental management contractor, URS | CH2M Hill Oak Ridge (UCOR). Demolition of the K-25 facility was expected to be completed by July 2014. By 23 January 2013, demolition of the north and west wings was complete, with {{only a small portion of}} the east wing remaining (6 units out of 24 on the east wing). The final section of the east wing was brought down on 19 December 2013. The last debris was removed in 2014. Demolition of K-27, the last of the five gaseous diffusion facilities at Oak Ridge, commenced in February 2016. Dignitaries including U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander and U.S. Congressman Chuck Fleischmann joined 1,500 workers to watch its final wall <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> 30 August 2016. Workers immediately commenced demolishing the last remaining structure on the site, the K-27 and K-29 power plant (K-731). Its demolition was completed on 28 February 2017.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the Vietnam War, Romney {{called for}} the {{withdrawal}} of all American troops {{by the end of}} 1971, and characterized the war as [...] "disastrous". [...] She was troubled by the ongoing Cambodian Incursion and said that if elected she would vote to cut off its funds if Nixon did not abide by his pledge to withdraw from there {{by the end of the}} month. [...] On other issues, she sometimes took overly broad stances that appeared to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> multiple sides. The conservative wing of the party, which had never trusted her husband, had the same reaction to her. [...] The largely male press corps tended to deal with her in a paternalistic way, and she was often identified as [...] "Mrs. George Romney" [...] in stories and photo captions. [...] Initially heavily favored over Huber, her campaign failed to gain momentum and polls showed a close race; in response, she shifted her ads to focus more on her stands on issues. [...] In the August 4, 1970, primary, Lenore Romney won a narrow victory, with 52percent of the vote compared to Huber's 48percent.|$|E
500|$|The Cleveland premiere on {{the evening}} of April 20, 1953 saw a {{distinguished}} crowd turn out. When the stage backdrop failed to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> time, Hammerstein was heard to mutter, [...] "Damn and damn and damn! This is a new way: they saved it for the performance!" [...] Nevertheless, the crowd gave the show a rousing welcome. The Cleveland critics thought well of the show, but were concerned about the weak story. After the Cleveland reactions and problems, according to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, [...] "what had seemed to be a show needing minor adjustments became a musical in serious trouble". Bigley remembered that she had just come from a hit and [...] "there just wasn't the same energy". Hammerstein had intended to omit the overture, with the audience to watch, after the curtain rose, a blank stage on which the play-within-the-play performers and crew drifted in and began their preparations. Expecting the orchestra to begin the evening, the audience talked throughout the initial scenes before being quieted by the internal show's overture; in response, the duo abandoned Hammerstein's concept and opened with an overture.|$|E
