40|$|Biogenic amines (BAs) are {{molecules}} {{which can}} be present in foods and, due to their toxicity, can cause adverse effects on the consumers. BAs are generally produced by microbial decarboxylation of amino acids in food products. The most significant BAs occurring in foods are histamine, tyramine, putrescine, cadaverine, tryptamine, 2 -phenylethylamine, spermine, spermidine and agmatine. The importance of preventing the excessive accumulation of BAs in food is related to their impact on human health and food quality. Quality criteria {{in connection with the}} presence of BAs in food and food products are necessary from a toxicological point of view. This is particularly important in fermented foods in which the massive microbial proliferation required for obtaining specific products is often relater with BA accumulation. In this review, up-to-date information and recent discoveries about technological factors affecting biogenic amine content in foods are reviewed. Specifically, BA forming-microorganism and decarboxylation activity, genetic and metabolic organization of decarboxylases, risk associated to BAs (histamine, tyramine toxicity and other BAs), environmental factors influencing BA formation (temperature, salt concentration, pH).

The bacterial species L. buchneri is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach. As {{the identity of the}} strain has been clearly established and as no antibiotic resistance was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is considered safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. Evidence of a lack of irritancy was provided for one formulation of the additive. It is unlikely that given the nature of the alternative food grade excipients, different results would be obtained for other formulations containing this strain of L. buchneri.

The fraction of slag in a large majority of the elements has the same size of 1 mm, and a larger portion of the slag, the size of which is from 2 to 6 mm. Definitely the best way is to remove the copper by means of the component B (with NaCl) and D (with KF 2).

40|$|Potassium sorbate is {{intended}} {{to be used as a}} <b>technological</b> <b>additive</b> to improve the ensiling process in the range of 90 to 300  mg/kg fresh material. The application of potassium sorbate in the preparation of silage up to the maximum proposed dose of 300  mg/kg forage is safe for the target animals. The additive, when used in silage, is not expected to increase substantially consumer exposure to potassium sorbate. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that potassium sorbate, when used as a silage additive, is safe for consumers of food products from animals fed treated silage. Potassium sorbate is a skin and eye irritant and a potential irritant to the respiratory tract. Potassium sorbate is not regarded as a skin sensitiser. The dusting potential of the preparation tested indicates that exposure of users via inhalation is possible. In view of the irritancy of potassium sorbate and the absence of information on its inhalation toxicity, exposure to such dust is considered hazardous. There are no safety concerns for the environment resulting from the use of potassium sorbate as a silage additive. Seven laboratory-scale ensiling studies were reported, each lasting at least 90 days and using forages of different origins. Once silos were opened, aerobic stability was determined. Potassium sorbate has the potential to improve aerobic stability of silage with dry matter content between 21 and 38 % when used at the minimum concentration of 90  mg/kg fresh material...|$|R
40|$|A {{strain of}} Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is {{intended}} to be added to forages to promote the ensiling process (<b>technological</b> <b>additive,</b> functional group: silage additive). The identity of the strain and its susceptibility to relevant antibiotics has been established. However, the strain produces cyclic lipopeptides which possess potent surfactant activity, known to be involved in food intoxication. Although the strain is intended for use only in the production of silage, as a spore former it will survive the ensiling process and be ingested by target animals. The spores will also survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract of animals and be a potential source of contamination of food of animal origin and of the environment. The greatest risk would be to those handling the product on farm following oral, dermal and respiratory exposure. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that use of the strain in the production of silage presents a hazard to consumers, users and the environment, and potentially also to the target animals. A total of three laboratory experiments with laboratory-scale silos, each lasting at least 90 days, were carried out using samples of forage of differing dry matter and water-soluble carbohydrate content. In each case, replicate silos containing treated forage were compared with identical silos containing the same but untreated forage.

However, if the use of plant extracts as <b>technological</b> <b>additives</b> is intended, their stability should be evaluated. This paper presents research on the stability of a 50 % ethanolic extract of chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) from the Republic of Moldova. The extract was subjected to various thermal regimes, i. e. - 2 o C for 12 hours; 4 o C for 12 hours; 40 o C for 15 minutes, 60 o C for 15 minutes, 80 o C for 15 minutes and 100 o C for 2 minutes, after which the antioxidant activity and the colour parameters (CIELab) were evaluated. Three sets of extracts were also stored for 2 weeks at - 2 o C; 4 o C; and 25 - 30 o C and afterwards the parameters mentioned above were measured once again. Furthermore, total content of polyphenols was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The antioxidant activity was stable at temperatures under 0 o C and temperatures as high as 100 o C, as well as during storage at - 2 o C, 4 o C and 25 - 30 o C. High temperatures however decreased the value of luminosity, and increased the redness, the yellowness and the chroma value which reached a maximum value of 55. 66 after the extract was subjected to 100 o C for 2 minutes. Storage at room temperature significantly affected the luminosity of the extract by increasing its value from 42. 36 to 50. 22.

It is not expected {{that the use of}} E. faecium at the dose proposed would substantially increase the exposure to this species of animals given silage as part of their rations Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that use of this strain in the preparation of silage is safe for the target animals. Since the strain does not belong to the hospital-associated clade and does not express resistance to the antibiotics tested, use of this strain in animal nutrition is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. The material safety data sheet proposed indicates that preparations containing the strain may cause irritation upon contact with skin and eyes. The dustiness of the preparation tested indicated a potential for users to be exposed via inhalation. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent, the additive should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. The use of the strain under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. Studies with laboratory-scale silos are described made using three samples of mixed forage of differing water-soluble carbohydrate content and representing material easy, moderately difficult and difficult to ensile. In each case, replicate silos containing treated forage were compared to identical silos containing the same but untreated forage.

40|$|Since {{technology}} education is, compared to {{subjects such as}} mathematics and science, still a fairly new subject both nationally and internationally, {{it does not have}} an established subject philosophy. In the absence of an established subject philosophy for {{technology education}}, one can draw on other disciplines in the field, such as engineering and design practice, for insights into technological knowledge. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the usefulness of an epistemological conceptual framework chiefly derived from engineering, to be able to describe the nature of technological knowledge, in an attempt to contribute towards the understanding of this relatively new learning area.

40|$|In many product <b>categories,</b> <b>technological</b> {{evolution}} {{results in}} the emergence of a single product design that achieves market dominance. In this article, the authors examine two questions: Will a dominant design emerge in a new product category? and If it does, how long will it be before a dominant design emerges? Thus, the authors simultaneously model the probability of emergence of a dominant design and the time of that emergence, conditional on its emergence. The model incorporates the effects of several product-market characteristics on the probability and time of dominant design emergence, including appropriability of the rents associated with the product, network effects, size of the product’s value net, the standards-setting process, radicalness of innovation, and research-and-development intensity. The authors use data for 63 office products and consumer durables to estimate a split-population hazard model for the probability and time of emergence of the dominant design. They find that a dominant design is more likely to emerge with weak appropriability, weak network effects, low product radicalness, and high research-and-development intensity. Dominant designs that emerge are likely to emerge sooner in product categories in which there is weak appropriability, there are a large number of firms in the value net, the standards are set by a de facto process, and there is low product radicalness The proposed model can be used to predict both the probability and the time of the emergence of a dominant design in a new product category.
