40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of the {{localization}} of in-door mobile robot, a method consists in extracting line segments from two stereoscopic images and in pairing line segments from the first image with those from the second image. With pairs of line segments, {{it is possible to}} measure distances between robot and objects of the environment. The pairing phase requires parameters characterizing the line segments which are discriminating, otherwise the line segments can be badly paired. This paper proposes a method of pairing based on two parameters using information color. More precisely, the two parameters use levels from a <b>color</b> <b>axis</b> which is given according to the color contents of the pair of images. The first parameter is a set of homogeneous colors which are in the areas close to a line segment. These colors are obtained from neighboring gray level dependence matrices but <b>color</b> <b>axis</b> levels replace gray levels. The second parameter is a distance between pixels composing the areas close to a line segment. This distance is the earth mover's distance. Results show a good success rate of the two parameters. The homogeneity colors are also more discriminating than the EMD. These results are extended to experimentation on more two hundred pair of images...|$|E

We monitored eye movements while subjects searched for a color target on familiar or unfamiliar color backgrounds, {{in order to test}} for these performance changes and to explore whether they reflect changes in salience from adaptation vs. changes in search strategies or perceptual learning. The target was an ellipse of variable color presented at a random location on a dense background of ellipses. In one condition, the colors of the background varied along either the LvsM or SvsLM cardinal axes. Observers adapted by viewing a rapid succession of backgrounds drawn from one <b>color</b> <b>axis,</b> and then searched for a target on a background from the same or different <b>color</b> <b>axis.</b> Searches were monitored with a Cambridge Research Systems Video Eyetracker. Targets were located more quickly on the background axis that observers were pre-exposed to, confirming that this exposure can improve search efficiency for stimuli that differ from the background. However, eye movement patterns (e. g. fixation durations and saccade magnitudes) did not clearly differ across the two backgrounds, suggesting that how the novel and familiar backgrounds were sampled remained similar. In a second condition, we compared search on a nonselective color background drawn from a circle of hues at fixed contrast. Prior exposure to this background did not facilitate search compared to an achromatic adapting field, suggesting that subjects were not simply learning the specific colors defining the background distributions. Instead, results for both conditions are consistent with a selective adaptation effect that enhances the salience of novel stimuli by partially discounting the background...|$|E

40|$|Histogram warping {{is a novel}} {{histogram}} specification {{technique for}} use in color image processing. As a general purpose tool for color correction, our technique constructs a global color mapping function in order to transform the colors of a source image to match a target color distribution to any desired degree of accuracy. To {{reduce the risk of}} color distortion, the transformation takes place in an image dependent color space, featuring perceptually uniform color axes with statistically independent chromatic components. Eliminating the coherence between the color axes enables the transformation to operate independently on each <b>color</b> <b>axis.</b> Deforming the source color distribution to reproduce the dominant color features of the target distribution, the histogram warping process is controlled by designating the color shifts and contrast adjustments for a set of key colors. Assisted by mode detection, matching quantiles establish the correspondence between the color distributions. Interpolation by monotonic splines serves to extend the mapping over the entire dynamic range without introducing artificial discontinuities into the resulting color density.

Moreover, because different causes of variation in spectral signals, such as pigmentation, gloss, and illumination, have differing behavioral significance, it may be beneficial to have adaptable generalization. We report on generalization by poultry chicks following differential training to rewarded (T+) and unrewarded (T−) colors, in particular on the phenomenon of peak shift, which leads to subjects preferring stimuli displaced away from T−. The first three experiments test effects of learning either a fine or a coarse discrimination. In experiments 1 and 2, peak shift occurs, but contrary to some predictions, the shift is smaller after the animal learned a fine discrimination than after it learned a coarse discrimination. Experiment 3 finds a similar effect for generalization on a <b>color</b> <b>axis</b> orthogonal to that separating T+ from T−. Experiment 4 shows that generalization is rapidly modified by experience. These results imply that the scale of a “perceptual ruler” is set by experience.

The smaller scale could mark the transition between wet and dry mergers, {{or it could be}} related to the interplay between SN and AGN feedback, although quantitative measures of this transition may be affected by morphological contamination. At the more massive scale, mean axis ratios and color gradients are maximal, and above it, the colors are redder, the sizes larger and the velocity dispersions smaller than expected based on the scaling at lower M*. In contrast, the color-sigma relation, and indeed, most scaling relations with sigma, are not curved: they are well-described by a single power law, or in some cases, are almost completely flat. When major dry mergers change masses, sizes, axis ratios and color gradients, they are expected to change the colors or velocity dispersions much less. Therefore, the fact that scaling relations at sigma > 150 km/s show no features, whereas the size-M*, b/a-M*, color-M* and color gradient-M* relations do, suggests that M* = 2 x 10 ^ 11 Msun is the scale above which major dry mergers dominate the assembly histories of early-type galaxies.

This instantaneous process explained more than 50 % of total adaptation for color appearance and could be shown to act in a multiplicative manner. We conclude that this instantaneous adaptation mechanism for color appearance is situated at a later processing stage, after mechanisms common to appearance and discrimination, and is based on multiplicative spatial interactions rather than on local, temporal adaptational processes.

In experiment 1, observers were asked to identify the healthier looking of pairs of photographs of the same subject taken pre- and post-supplementation (or pre- and post-placebo), choosing the pre-supplementation (or pre-placebo) images. When confounding due to facial expression was eliminated in experiment 2, observers showed no preference for unmodified pre-supplementation photograph or the same image with skin color manipulated to simulate a level of smoothie-induced color change associated with 4 weeks of supplementation. In experiment 3, observers manipulated the skin color of face photographs along the smoothie-induced <b>color</b> change <b>axis</b> to optimize healthy appearance.

This suggests that there is an optimal carotenoid color for healthy appearance, and that this optimal level may be constrained by preferences for averageness, by the association between very yellow skin and ill health, or by negative health impacts of very high doses of carotenoids...|$|R

Methods Binocular and monocular chromaticity discrimination thresholds were estimated for the protan, deutan, and tritan color confusion axes in 43 SCP children aged 6 – 15 years who were classified as tetraplegic (n[*]=[*] 12), diplegic (n[*]=[*] 16), and hemiplegic (n[*]=[*] 15) without ophthalmological complaints. Motor impairment was rated according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) in five levels of severity. Results Analysis of variance showed significantly reduced discrimination in tetraplegic children (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) compared with the diplegic, hemiplegic, and control groups. We also found a positive correlation between chromaticity discrimination thresholds and GMFCS ratings in all of the groups. Discussion Chromaticity discrimination thresholds measured psychophysically were reduced for all three <b>color</b> confusion <b>axis</b> in tetraplegic children compared with normal children. Diplegic and hemiplegic children had similar results as normal children. The finding of a correlation between quantified motor impairment and color discrimination losses in SCP patients is a new observation that might help elucidate the causes of color perception loss in these patients. Visual information is essential for the rehabilitation of CP children. Knowledge of the degree of correlation between vision and motor impairment is valuable when planning a rehabilitation program.

40|$|In {{congenital}} color blindness the red-green {{discrimination is}} impaired {{resulting in an}} increased confusion between those colors with yellow. Our post-receptoral physiological mechanisms are organized in two pathways for color perception, a red-green (protanopic and deuteranopic) and a blue-yellow (tritanopic). We argue that the discrimination losses in the yellow area in congenital color vision deficiency subjects could generate a subtle loss of discriminability in the tritanopic channel considering discrepancies with yellow perception. We measured color discrimination thresholds for blue and yellow of tritanopic channel in congenital color deficiency subjects. Chromaticity thresholds were measured around a white background (0. 1977 u’, 0. 4689 v’ in the CIE 1976) consisting of a blue-white and white-yellow thresholds in a tritanopic color confusion line of 21 congenital colorblindness subjects (mean age = 27. 7; SD= 5. 6 years; 14 deuteranomalous and 7 protanomalous) and of 82 (mean age = 25. 1; SD= 3. 7 years) normal color vision subjects. Significant increase in the whole tritanopic axis was found for both deuteranomalous and protanomalous subjects compared to controls for the blue-white (F 2, 100 = 18. 80; p< 0. 0001) and white-yellow (F 2, 100 = 22. 10; p< 0. 0001) thresholds. A Principal Component Analysis found a weighting toward to the yellow thresholds induced by deuteranomalous subjects. In conclusion, the discrimination in the tritanopic <b>color</b> confusion <b>axis</b> is significantly reduced in congenital color vision deficiency compared to normal subjects. Since yellow discrimination was impaired {{the balance of the}} blue-yellow channels is impaired justifying the increased thresholds found for blue-white discrimination.

40|$|The {{sizes of}} galaxies {{are known to}} be closely related with their masses, luminosities, redshifts and morphologies. However, when we fix these {{quantities}} and morphology, we still find large dispersions in the galaxy size distribution. We investigate the origin of these dispersions for red early-type galaxies, using two SDSS-based catalogs. We find that the sizes of faint galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) - 19. 5, where M_r is the r-band absolute magnitude, k-corrected to z = 0. 1) are affected more significantly by luminosity, while the sizes of bright galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) > 11. 4 or M_r < - 21. 4) are by dynamical mass. At fixed mass and luminosity, the sizes of low-mass galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10. 45 and M_r ~ - 19. 8) are relatively less sensitive to their colors, <b>color</b> gradients and <b>axis</b> ratios. On the other hand, the sizes of intermediate-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10. 85 and M_r ~ - 20. 4) and high-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 11. 25 and M_r ~ - 21. 0) galaxies significantly depend on those parameters, in the sense that larger red early-type galaxies have bluer colors, more negative color gradients (bluer outskirts) and smaller axis ratios. These results indicate that the sizes of intermediate- and high-mass red early-type galaxies are significantly affected by their recent minor mergers or rotations, whereas the sizes of low-mass red early-type galaxies are affected by some other mechanisms. Major dry mergers also seem to have influenced on the size growth of high-mass red early-type galaxies.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed a vascular lesion in the suprazygomatic masticator space overlying the temporalis muscle, extending inferiorly in a patchy fashion into the left cheek. Additional involvement of the left orbit, both intra- and extraconally, was noted, most pronounced superiorly but also surrounding the anterior aspect of the optic nerve in the intraconal space. Moderate hypoplasia of the left cerebellar hemisphere was seen, as well as moder-ate hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head showed prominent left internal maxillary artery branches supplying the vascular lesion, as well as a persistent left stapedial artery giving rise to the left middle meningeal artery. Formal ophthalmologic examination showed no ad-ditional ocular anomalies, and echocardiogram and liver ultrasound studies were normal...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} visible {{multi-band}} photometry of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) observed by the Subaru Telescope {{in the framework}} of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) from March in 2014 to September in 2016. We measured the five broad-band (g, r, i, z, and Y) colors over the wavelength range from 0. 4 um to 1. 0 um for 30 known TNOs using the HSC-SSP survey data covering ~ 500 deg 2 of sky within +/- 30 deg of ecliptic latitude. This dataset allows us to characterize the dynamical classes based on visible reflectance spectra as well as {{to examine the relationship between}} colors and the other parameters such as orbital elements. Our results show that the hot classical and scattered populations share similar color distributions, while the cold classical population has a reflective decrease toward shorter wavelength below the i band. Based on the obtained color properties, we found that the TNO sample examined in the present work can be separated into two groups by inclination (I), the low-I population consisting of cold classical objects and high-I population consisting of hot classical and scattered objects. The whole sample exhibits an anti-correlation between colors and inclination, but no significant correlation between <b>colors</b> and semi-major <b>axis,</b> perihelion distance, eccentricity, or absolute magnitude. The color-inclination correlation does not seem to be continuous over the entire inclination range. Rather, it is seen only in the high-I population. We found that the low- and high-I populations are distinguishable in the g-i vs. eccentricity plot, but four high-I objects show g-i colors similar to those of the low-I population. If we exclude these four objects, the high-I objects show a positive correlation between g-i and eccentricity and a negative correlation between g-i and inclination with high significance levels.
