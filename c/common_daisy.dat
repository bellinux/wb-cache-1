60|$|There are {{two modes}} of giving {{to the name}} of a Kind this sort of significance. The best, but which {{unfortunately}} is seldom practicable, is when the word can be made to indicate, by its formation, the very properties which it is designed to connote. The name of a Kind does not, of course, connote all the properties of the Kind, since these are inexhaustible, but such of them as are sufficient to distinguish it; such as are sure marks of all the rest. Now, it is very rarely that one property, or even any two or three properties, can answer this purpose. To distinguish the <b>common</b> <b>daisy</b> from all other species of plants would require the specification of many characters. And a name can not, without being too cumbrous for use, give indication, by its etymology or mode of construction, of more than {{a very small number of}} these. The possibility, therefore, of an ideally perfect Nomenclature, is probably confined to the one case in which we are happily in possession of something approaching to it—the Nomenclature of elementary Chemistry. The substances, whether simple or compound, with which chemistry is conversant, are Kinds, and, as such, the properties which distinguish each of them from the rest are innumerable; but in the case of compound substances (the simple ones are not numerous enough to require a systematic nomenclature), there is one property, the chemical composition, which is of itself sufficient to distinguish the Kind; and is (with certain reservations not yet thoroughly understood) a sure mark of all the other properties of the compound. All that was needful, therefore, was to make the name of every compound express, on the first hearing, its chemical composition; that is, to form the name of the compound, in some uniform manner, from the names of the simple substances which enter into it as elements. This was done, most skillfully and successfully, by the French chemists, though their nomenclature has become inadequate to the convenient expression of the very complicated compounds now known to chemists. The only thing left unexpressed by them was the exact proportion in which the elements were combined; and even this, since the establishment of the atomic theory, it has been found possible to express by a simple adaptation of their phraseology.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine where the river got its name. In Scottish, gowan the name for the <b>common</b> <b>daisy</b> or occasionally the buttercup. It is derived from the original form gollan which is the marsh marigold, the name was made famous by Robert Burns in a poem originally entitled [...] "The Gowan" [...] which is now known as [...] "To a Mountain Daisy". The Lakeland poet William Wordsworth also uses the word gowan to refer to a common wayside flower indicating that the name was used in the area and therefore {{it is possible that the}} river got its name from the fact that it flows through many flower meadows on the valley floor. In Gaelic Gowen/Gowan can also mean [...] "blacksmith". The name may therefore otherwise have come from the Scots Gaelic or from Irish missionaries who are known to have travelled in Cumbria during the Anglo-Saxon period and have given many words to the local dialect.|$|E
50|$|T. cinerariifolium {{is called}} the Dalmatian chrysanthemum, {{denoting}} its origin in that region of the Balkans (Dalmatia). It looks more like the <b>common</b> <b>daisy</b> than other pyrethrums do. Its flowers, typically white with yellow centers, grow from numerous fairly rigid stems. Plants have blue-green leaves and grow to 45 to 100 cm in height. The plant is economically important as a natural source of insecticide. The flowers are pulverized and the active components, called pyrethrins, contained in the seed cases, are extracted and sold {{in the form of}} an oleoresin. This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects, and inhibit female mosquitoes from biting. When present in amounts less than those fatal to insects, they still appear to have an insect repellent effect. They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammals and birds than many synthetic insecticides and are not persistent, being biodegradable and also decompose easily on exposure to light. They are considered to be amongst the safest insecticides for use around food. Kenya produced 90% (over 6,000 tonnes) of the world's pyrethrum in 1998, called py for short. Production in Tanzania and Ecuador is also significant. Currently the world's major producer is Tasmania, Australia.|$|E
40|$|Variations {{in total}} {{phenolic}} and flavonoid contents {{as well as}} antioxidant activity of Bellis perennis (<b>common</b> <b>daisy)</b> flowers were investigated. The flowers were collected monthly (from March to October, i. e., during the usual flowering season of the plant) at three localities in three different years. Total flavonoids were determined spectrophotometrically by two methods: by formation of a complex with aluminium chloride after acidic hydrolysis of flower extracts (method 1) and by reaction with boric and oxalic acids in extracts without their modification (method 2). Total phenolics were determined spectrophotometrically using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The antioxidant activity was determined spectrophotometrically by a 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. The contents of flavonoids varied from 0. 31 to 0. 44 mg quercetin equivalent/ 100 mg dry weight (method 1) and from 1. 37 to 2. 20 mg pigenin- 7 -glucoside equivalent/ 100 mg dry weight (method 2). Total phenolics ranged from 2. 81 to 3. 57 mg gallic acid equivalent/ 100 mg dry weight. The antioxidant activity expressed as IC 50 values varied from 66. 03 to 89. 27 µg/mL; it is about 50, 30, 20, and 10 times lower as compared with quercetin, ascorbic acid, Trolox®, and butylhydroxytoluene, respectively, and about five times higher in comparison with apigenin- 7 -glucoside. There is a significant correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenolics. No correlation between total flavonoid contents and antioxidant activity was observed. Contents of phenolics and flavonoids as well as antioxidant activity of daisy flowers vary to a relatively small extent during the year and are not dependant {{on the time of}} collection. Thus, the flowers possess comparable quality as to these characteristics over the whole flowering season of Bellis perennis. Effects of environmental factors on the amounts of secondary metabolites in plants are also discussed...|$|E
