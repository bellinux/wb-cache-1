50|$|<b>Cant</b> {{gradient}} <b>is</b> {{the amount}} by which <b>cant</b> <b>is</b> increased or decreased {{in a given}} length of track. The change in <b>cant</b> <b>is</b> {{required in order to}} connect a tangent track (no cant) to a curved track (with cant) through a transition curve. The rate of change of <b>cant</b> <b>is</b> used to determine the suitable cant gradient for a given design speed. Track twist may also be used to describe cant gradient which may be expressed in percentage of cant change per length unit. However, in the UK, the term track twist is normally used in the context of cant gradient with higher values which are considered to be faults.|$|R

50|$|In practice, {{trains are}} not running on {{equilibrium}} cants at curves. The situation is called unbalance, {{which can be}} {{in one of the}} two following ways. For a given speed, if the actual <b>cant</b> <b>is</b> less than the equilibrium cant, the amount of <b>cant</b> difference <b>is</b> called <b>cant</b> deficiency. In the other word, it is the amount of missing cant to achieve the balance. On the contrary, for a given speed, if the actual <b>cant</b> <b>is</b> higher than the equilibrium cant, the amount of over cant from the balance <b>is</b> called <b>cant</b> excess.|$|R

40|$|<b>Canting</b> <b>is</b> a novel {{containing}} {{with the}} relation between worker and employer in a company. The relation between worker and employer in <b>Canting</b> <b>is</b> not like {{the relation between}} worker and employer but the relation of family. The fact that the author of Canting wrote that employer in <b>Canting</b> <b>is</b> capitalist make the writer wants to know capitalism deeper {{especially in terms of}} the relation between worker and employer. Besides using Karl Marx’s capitalism theory, the writer uses sociological approach because the relation between worker and employer is the social relation between the social classes in society. After the writer did research, the writer found differences between the relation of worker and employer in Canting with worker and employer’s relation according to Karl Marx’s capitalism. Based on the differences appears between Canting with Karl Marx’s capitalism, that the relation between worker and employer in <b>Canting</b> <b>is</b> affected by several things including Javanese culture. Therefore, the writer proves that not all the relations between worker and employer are in accordance with capitalism...|$|R
