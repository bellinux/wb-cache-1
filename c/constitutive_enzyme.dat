5000|$|An {{adaptive}} enzyme or inducible enzyme is an enzyme that is expressed only under {{conditions in which}} it is clear of adaptive value, as opposed to a <b>constitutive</b> <b>enzyme</b> which is produced all the time.The Inducible enzyme is used for the breaking-down of things in the cell. It is also a part of the Operon Model, which illustrates a way for genes to turn [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off".The Inducer causes the gene to turn on (controlled by the amount of reactant which turns the gene on). Then there's the repressor protein that turns genes off. The inducer can remove this repressor, turning genes back on. The operator is a section of DNA where the repressor binds to shut off certain genes; the promoter is the section of DNA where the RNA polymerase binds. Lastly, the regulatory gene is the gene for the repressor protein.An example of inducible enzyme is COX-2 which is synthesized in macrophages to produce Prostaglandin E2 while the <b>constitutive</b> <b>enzyme</b> COX-1 (another isozyme in COX family) is always produced in variety of organs in body (like stomach).|$|E

40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{concentration}} of ammonia from rising to toxic levels as moisture is lost during the ripening period, the seeds of Juglans regia reduce their ammonia content by synthesizing organic compounds such as tryptophan (Trp) and serotonin (5 -HT). The biosynthetic pathway of 5 -HT was investigated using Tritium-Trp and C(14 isotope) -TNH 2 as tracers, and reversed-phase HPLC for separation of the indoles involved in 5 -HT and IAA metabolism. The first step is the decarboxylation of Trp to TNH 2. This step is rate limiting and is catalyzed by the adaptive tryptophan decarboxylase enzyme (E. C. 4. 1. 1. 27). This enzyme is the key control element of 5 -HT biosynthesis. The decarboxylase activity is not induced by {{a high level of}} ammonia and Trp, but by the cessation of metabolite transfer following abscission of the seeds. Subsequently TNH 2 is transformed to 5 -HT by a <b>constitutive</b> <b>enzyme</b> tryptamine- 5 -hydroxylase.

Extracellular matrices of cultures and also intracellular extracts were applied for detoxification.

In addition to growing with cyclohexaneacetate, the organism also grew with cyclohexanebutyrate at concentrations not above 0. 05 %, and {{with a variety of}} alicyclic ketones and alcohols. Oxidation of cyclohexaneacetate proceeded through formation of the coenzyme A (CoA) ester followed by initiation of a beta-oxidation cycle. beta-Oxidation was blocked before the second dehydrogenation step due to the formation of a tertiary alcohol, and the side chain was eliminated as acetyl-CoA by the action of (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetyl-CoA lyase. The cyclohexanone thus formed was degraded by a well-described route that involves ring-oxygen insertion by a biological Baeyer-Villiger oxygenase. All enzymes of the proposed metabolic sequence were demonstrated in cell-free extracts. Arthrobacter sp. strain CA 1 synthesized <b>constitutive</b> beta-oxidative <b>enzymes,</b> but further induction of enzymes active toward cyclohexaneacetate and its metabolites could occur during growth with the alicyclic acid. Other enzymes of the sequence, (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetyl-CoA lyase and enzymes of cyclohexanone oxidation, were present at negligible levels in succinate-grown cells but induced by growth with cyclohexaneacetate. The oxidation of cyclohexanebutyrate was integrated into the pathway for cyclohexaneacetate oxidation by a single beta-oxidation cycle. Oxidation of the compound could be divided into two phases. Initial oxidation to (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetate could be catalyzed by <b>constitutive</b> <b>enzymes,</b> whereas the further degradation of (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetate was dependent on induced enzyme synthesis which could be inhibited by chloramphenicol with the consequent accumulation of cyclohexaneacetate and (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetate...|$|R

Inhibition of nNOS is mediated by a signaling driven by ARA, either extensively released at high [Ca 2 +]i or supplemented to the cultures at nanomolar levels. Proinflammatory factors, as bacterial lipopolysaccharide/interferon-γ, cause rapid ARA-dependent nNOS inhibition, critical for the delayed expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) -dependent genes as inducible NOS. We therefore propose that {{the onset of the}} neuroinflammatory response is strictly regulated by the relative amounts of NO and ARA produced by their <b>constitutive</b> <b>enzymes.</b> In particular, the inflammatory product ARA initiates the inflammatory response via inhibition of nNOS, thereby allowing NF-κB activation.
