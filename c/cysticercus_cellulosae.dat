5000|$|Cysticercus was {{discovered}} in the late 17th century CE as a parasitic bladder. It {{was believed to be}} a different organism from the adult tapeworm (Taenia solium), but still closely related to tapeworms for their similarly-looking scolex. Hence, it was given a proper scientific name Taenia cellulosae in 1800 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin. At the same time another German Johann Zeder had created a new genus Cysticercosis for a dog tapeworm. This genus was accepted for all bladder worms of Taenia. It became a tradition to refer to the larva of Taenia solium as <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae,</b> that of beef tapeworm (T. sanginata) as Cysticercus bovis, that of sheep tapeworm (T. ovis) as Cysticercus ovis, that of ruminant tapeworm (T. krabbei) as Cysticercus tarandi, and that of the dog tapeworm (T. crassiceps) as Cysticercus longicollis. Even though, this system of naming is now scientifically unacceptable, it is still widely used, particularly for description of the infections by the different species.|$|E

50|$|Cattle {{acquire the}} embryonated eggs, the oncospheres, when they eat {{contaminated}} food. Oncospheres enter the duodenum, the anterior {{portion of the}} small intestine, and hatch there {{under the influence of}} gastric juices. The embryonic membranes are removed, liberating free hexacanth ("six-hooked") larvae. With their hooks, they attach to the intestinal wall and penetrate the intestinal mucosa into the blood vessels. The larvae can move to all parts of the body by the general circulatory system, and finally settle in skeletal muscles within 70 days. Inside the tissue, they cast off their hooks and instead develop a protective cuticular shell, called the cyst. Thus, they become fluid-filled cysticerci. Cysterci can also form in lungs and liver. The inner membrane of the cysticercus soon develops numerous protoscolices (small scolices) that are invertedly attached to the inner surface. The cysticercus of T. saginata is specifically named cysticercus bovis to differentiate from that of T. solium, <b>cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae.</b>|$|E
50|$|Given {{the fact}} that pigs {{are part of a}} life cycle, {{vaccination}} of pigs is another feasible intervention to eliminate cysticercosis. Research studies have been focusing on vaccine against cestode parasites, since many immune cell types are found to be capable of destroying cysticercus. Many vaccine candidates are extracted from antigens of different cestodes such as Taenia solium, T. crassiceps, T. saginata, T. ovis and target oncospheres and/or cysticerci. In 1983, Molinari et al. reported the first vaccine candidate against porcine cysticercosis using antigen from <b>cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae</b> drawn out from naturally infected. Recently, vaccines extracted from genetically engineered 45W-4B antigens have been successfully tested to pigs in an experimental condition. This type of vaccine can protect against cysticercosis in both Chinese and Mexican type of T. solium. However, it has not been tested in endemic field conditions, which is important because the realistic condition in the field differ greatly from experimental condition, and this can result in a great difference in the chances of infection and immune reaction.|$|E

Eighty-five specimens of CSF were obtained from 43 cases with NCC (26 with the active form and 17 with the inactive form) and from 42 patients with other neurological diseases. The inactive form of NCC presented a profile in CSF similar to the group without NCC. The active form of NCC presented elevation of specific immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgE, and IgA) in decreasing order, with the highest values being detected among the cases with intraventricular cysts, or with inflammation signs in CSF or in those with multiple clinical manifestations. The highest sensitivity and specificity were obtained with ELISA-IgG (88. 5 % and 93. 2 %, respectively). This study confirmed the importance of ELISA in the immunologic diagnosis of NCC.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine optimum conditions of ELISA for the immunodiagnosis of <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae</b> infection in humans and in pigs using four antigens extracted from C. cellulosae (Cyst fluid antigen, Ccf.

Ag was most useful for the immunodiagnosis of C. cellulosae infection in pigs. Optimum conditions in the ELISA were at the concentration of 15 μg/ml of Ccf. Ag, 10, 000 times diluted peroxidase-labelled anti-porcine IgG and at 100 dilution of test sera. More stable results were obtained by blocking the epitope of porcine IgG in Ccf. Ag with rabbit anti-porcine IgG antiserum. 2. In the case of cerebral cysticercosis cellulosae hominis, Ccf. Ag was most sensitive and specific for the serodiagnosis. The optimum conditions, when this antigen was used, were same as used for the infection in pigs. Under these test-conditions by ELISA, significant differences were obtained among cysticercosis and other parasite infections (taeniasis saginata, diphyllobothriasis latum, sparganosis mansoni, diplogonoporiasis grandis, fascioliasis, clonorchiasis, paragonimiasis, strongyloidiasis and ascariasis). 3.

A very stable preparation was thus obtained, the antigen being covalently bound by cross-linking with free N-methylol groups on the resin. Since robust, no special care was necessary for handling the solid-phase. The test could be performed at room-temperature. From 30 CSF samples assayed, 14 were positive, {{from a group of}} 15 cases of neurocysticercosis, with titers from 1 to 128; 15 other samples, from normals or other neurological diseases, were all negative. Test characteristics seem to indicate it as adequate for epidemiological surveys. A more detailed study on sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and the use in serum samples is being conducted...|$|E
40|$|A dot-ELISA was {{developed}} {{for the detection of}} antibodies in CSF in the immunologic diagnosis of human neurocysticercosis, using antigen extracts of the membrane and scolex of <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae</b> (M+S-Cc) and, alternately, membrane (M) and vesicular fluid (VF) of Cysticercus longicollis (Cl) covalently bound to a new solid phase consisting of polyester fabric treated with N-methylol-acrylamide resin (dot-RT). The test was performed at room temperature, with reduced incubation times and with no need for special care in the manipulation of the support. The sensitivity rates obtained were 95. 1 % for antigen Cc and 97. 6 % for antigen Cl. Specificity was 90. 6 % when Cc was used, and 96. 9 % and 100 % when M-Cl and VF-Cl were used, respectively. No significant differences in titer were observed between tests carried out with homologous and heterologous antigens. The low cost and easy execution of the dot-RT test using antigen extracts of Cysticercus longicollis indicate the test for use in the immunodiagnosis of human neurocysticercosis...|$|E
40|$|A passive {{haemagglutination}} test (PHA) for human neurocysticercosis was standardized and evaluated {{for the detection of}} specific antibodies to <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae</b> in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For the assay, formaldehyde-treated group O Rh-human red cells coated with the cysticerci crude total saline extract (TS) antigen were employed. A total of 115 CSF samples from patients with neurocysticercosis was analysed, of these 94 presented reactivity, corresponding to 81. 7 % sensitivity, in which confidence limit of 95 % probability (CL 95 %) ranged from 74. 5 % to 88. 9 %. Eighty-nine CSF samples derived from individuals of control group presented as nonreactive in 94. 4 % (CL 95 % from 89. 6 % to 99. 2 %). The positive and negative predictive values were 1. 4 % and 99. 9 %, respectively, considering the mean rate of that this assay provide a rapid, highly reproducible, and moderately sensitive mean of detecting specific antibodies in CSF samples...|$|E
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{were generated}} from mice immunized with scolex protein antigen of <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae.</b> Three monoclonal antibodies specific for cysticercal antigens, {{which did not}} show any cross-reactivity with Taenia solium or Taenia saginata antigens, were selected. Each monoclonal antibody coupled to Sepharose could purify one antigen, which appeared as a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When antigens purified by monoclonal antibodies were used to detect antibody in serum samples taken from patients with cysticercosis, taeniasis, and other parasitic infections in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, cross-reactivity was observed until a serum dilution of 1 : 128 was reached. Since serum samples from unexposed subjects showed positive reactions until a dilution of 1 : 64 was reached, we chose a discriminative dilution (1 : 128) above which no cross-reaction was observed. The percent positive serum samples from cysticercosis patients was 100 % by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay {{with any of the}} antigens purified by monoclonal antibodies...|$|E
40|$|Annexin B 2 (AnxB 2) {{is a novel}} {{member of}} the annexin family of Ca 2 +- and phospholipid-binding {{proteins}} from <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae.</b> To obtain highly pure AnxB 2 with an easy and inexpensive purification approach, its cDNA was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pJLA 503 and the translation initiation codon was immediately {{under the control of}} the inducible bacteriophage λ promoters PR and PL. After induction by shifting temperature, large amounts of non-fusion protein were produced in Escherichia coli in a soluble form. Then a novel purification method based on Ca 2 +-dependent phosphatidylserine (PS) -binding activity was established, whereby the purity of AnxB 2 was increased to 98. 7 %. Western blot analysis showed that recombinant AnxB 2 was specifically recognized by serum of pigs infected with cysticercosis. In vitro test showed that, the recombinant AnxB 2 had anticoagulant activity and platelet binding activity. The expression, purification, and initial characterization of AnxB 2 set an important stage for further characterization of the protein...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze different immunoglobulins classes (IgG, IgM, IgE and IgA) against <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae</b> in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), correlating them to clinical and tomographic profiles in patients with neurocysticercosis (NCC). Eighty-five specimens of CSF were obtained from 43 cases with NCC (26 with the active form and 17 with the inactive form) and from 42 patients with other neurological diseases. The inactive form of NCC presented a profile in CSF similar to the group without NCC. The active form of NCC presented elevation of specific immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgE, and IgA) in decreasing order, with the highest values being detected among the cases with intraventricular cysts, or with inflammation signs in CSF or in those with multiple clinical manifestations. The highest sensitivity and specificity were obtained with ELISA-IgG (88. 5 % and 93. 2 %, respectively). This study confirmed the importance of ELISA in the immunologic diagnosis of NCC...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of two different}} standardized reagent procedures for the passive haemagglutination test (PHA) in the detection of specific antibody to <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>cellulosae</b> in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was carried out. The formaldehyde-treated group O Rh-human red blood cells (HuRBC) and glutaraldehyde-treated sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were the supplies for the reagents preparation and, in the tests, they were designated as PHA- 1 and PHA- 2, respectively. For both reagents the cells were coated with the cysticerci total saline extract (TS) antigen. PHA- 1 and PHA- 2 were assessed {{in a total of}} 204 CSF from patients with neurocysticercosis, from non-related infections and from healthy individuals. The positivity and specificity indices obtained were respectively 81. 7 % and 94. 4 % for PHA- 1 and for PHA- 2, 88. 7 % and 96. 6 %. Since no significant differences were observed between the results provided by two reagents, at level of significance of 0. 05, either processes of cell sensitization can alternatively be used according to the own laboratory convenience...|$|E
