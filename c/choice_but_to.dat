The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers had no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> relocate to a new area.

In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles.
