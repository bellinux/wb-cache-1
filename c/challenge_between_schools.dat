40|$|The authors {{attempt to}} tell the story of Brown and Parents Involved on edu-cational {{inequality}} and connect these topics to economic competition glob-ally. Brown came about in the 1950 s in a much different environment: America was less diverse racially and ethnically, and economic competition on a global scale was less than in today’s economy. Today, America’s future is closely tied to the large pool of minority children enrolled in its public schools. The authors explore the return of more public schools to the neigh-borhood concept and how these schools may produce high-quality graduates. Finally, they examine how legal challenges may shift to school inequality within school districts away from <b>challenges</b> to inequality <b>between</b> <b>school</b> districts in the past...|$|R
40|$|Internationally, {{vocational}} {{education and training}} (VET) is challenged by increasing skills shortages in certain industries and rapidly changing skill requirements. Rigid and centralised state bureaucracies have proven inadequate to adapt to these <b>challenges.</b> Increasingly, partnerships <b>between</b> <b>schools</b> and industry have been established as a potential strategy to address local labour market demand and to provide school to work transition programs. Drawing on experiences in Australia, this paper reports on {{a case study of}} government-let partnerships <b>between</b> <b>schools</b> and industry. The Queensland Gateway schools initiative currently involves over 120 schools. The study aimed to understand how partnerships were constructed in this initiative. Selected partnerships were analysed in terms of the following principles of public-private partnerships – efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, and beneficiaries. Although there are some benefits of partnership activities reported by both school and industry stakeholders, little evidence was found that the above underlying principles had been addressed to a significant extent in the Gateway school initiative. Further, these partnerships are often tenuously facilitated by individuals who have limited infrastructure or strategic support. Implications are that project stakeholders have not sufficiently accommodated theoretical perspectives on implementation and management of partnerships. Similar initiatives may be improved if stakeholders are cognisant of the underlying principles supporting successful public-private partnerships...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. This {{research}} study {{is based on}} the cluster system model for effective management of schools in Namibia. with special reference to Erongo Education Region. The cluster system introduces a new perspective on the way the schools arc managed. It radically differs from the historically isolated school, employing individualistic approaches and management practices characterised by strong hierarchical structures and top down decision-making. The cluster system advocates shared decision-making, teamwork, collaboration. integration and networking. In other words clustering provides a superb climate for teachers, principals, parents and learners to interface with one another within a legitimate framework. Clustering is an effective management model that has also been implemented in developed countries such as England, the Netherlands and the United States of America. The {{research study}} involved 60 principals as respondents to a questionnaire on the cluster system, its problems and prospects. The major findings indicate that clustering enhances the quality of education through sharing of resources, exchange of ideas among teachers, and closer cooperation <b>between</b> <b>schools.</b> The study identifies numerous challenges in the implementation of the cluster system. These <b>challenges</b> include disparity <b>between</b> <b>schools</b> in the rural and urban areas, lack of reliable transport, lack of facilities and teaching materials in most <b>schools,</b> large distances <b>between</b> <b>schools,</b> teacher isolation and increased workload among personnel. However, if the challenges and prospects of clustering are put on a simple scale, the latter would probably outweigh the former completely. This means that clustering holds encouraging prospects for the education system in Namibia in general and Erongo Education Region in particular. An important finding in this regard is {{that the majority of the}} principals in the Erongo Education Region agree that the cluster system has the potential to champion and transcend in effective management of all schools within cluster centres.

50|$|The team's arch-rival was the Akron Zips {{from the}} University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. The two teams both {{played in the}} Mid-American Conference East {{division}} and are separated by approximately 10 mi. The series began in 1916 with a 12-1 Akron win in Kent, but did not become a conference game until 1993 when Akron joined the Mid-American Conference. What was {{the final game of}} the series was played May 16, 2015, a 3-2 Kent State win in 10 innings at Lee R. Jackson Baseball Field in Akron that clinched the season series for Kent State and the all-sports Wagon Wheel <b>Challenge</b> <b>between</b> the two <b>schools.</b> The rivalry came to an unexpected end after the 2015 season when the University of Akron announced the baseball team would be eliminated because of budget concerns. Through the 2015 season, Kent State leads the series 109-55-1, and won eight of the final ten meetings. The Zips and Flashes played three times in the Mid-American Conference Baseball Tournament, including the championship game of the 2014 tournament, a 3-0 Kent State win and the only time the rivals met in the tournament final. The win gave Kent State a 2-1 edge in tournament games, winning a 1995 semifinal game 16-3, while Akron won a 1996 first round game 4-1.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the intergenerational {{tensions}} within the Somali refugee community in Camden, London. A series of focus groups and video diaries were undertaken in order to better understand the communication problems between parents and children in the Somali community. The study was a partnership between the Camden Education Welfare Service and the Somali Youth Development Resource Centre. The key aims of the research were: ♣ to identify interventions that can facilitate better communication between generations in order to improve school attendance from pupils within the Somali community ♣ to elicit the drivers and barriers of communication across the generations of Somali young women ♣ to explore ways of bridging communication barriers ♣ to explore how integrated working could help better reach hard-to-reach communities. The key findings of the project include the gender roles disparities between parents and young women as well as the language barriers, differing life expectations, conflicting values and educational aspirations. A complex picture of the <b>challenging</b> relationships <b>between</b> home, <b>school</b> and pupil emerged through the study, as well as examples {{of the ways in which}} integrated working could help engage marginalized communities in accessing services...|$|R
50|$|The Flashes arch-rivals are the Akron Zips {{from the}} University of Akron, located in Akron, Ohio, {{approximately}} 10 mi {{to the southwest}} of Kent. The two teams first played in 1975 when both programs were at the club level. Kent State records the first official meeting as May 1, 1976, a 3-2 Zips win in Youngstown, while Akron records have the first meeting as April 5, 1980, a 3-2 Zips win in Kent. As {{a result of the}} two different start years, through the 2016 season, Akron has the series at 67-44-1 in favor of the Flashes, while Kent State lists the series at 74-46-1 in favor of KSU, beginning in 1976. Akron joined the Mid-American Conference in 1993 and both teams were placed in the East Division in 1998. Akron's longest winning streak in the series came in the 1997 and 1998 seasons, when they won seven in a row, while Kent State recorded a 12-game winning streak that spanned from the 2006 season through the 2012 season. The teams have met four times in the MAC Tournament, with Kent State winning all four: 3-2 in 2008, 3-1 in 2009, 3-2 in 2015, and 13-6 in 2016.

40|$|O texto discute as relações entre juventude e escola, problematizando o lugar que a escola ocupa na socialização da juventude contemporânea, em especial dos jovens das camadas populares. Trabalha com a hipótese de que as tensões e os desafios existentes na relação atual da juventude com a escola são expressões de mutações profundas que vêm ocorrendo na sociedade ocidental, interferindo na produção social dos indivíduos, nos seus tempos e espaços, afetando diretamente as instituições e os processos de socialização das novas gerações. Nesse sentido, discute as características dos jovens que chegam às escolas públicas de ensino médio, evidenciando a existência de uma nova condição juvenil no Brasil contemporâneo. Localiza os problemas e desafios na relação dos jovens com a escola, constatando as transformações existentes na instituição escolar e as tensões e os constrangimentos na difícil tarefa de constituir-se como alunos, concluindo que a escola tornou-se menos desigual, mas {{continua}} sendo injusta. This text {{discusses the}} relationships <b>between</b> <b>schooling</b> and youth {{and the place}} of schools in the socialization of contemporary youth, especially in what regards young people from lower classes. It considers {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>challenges</b> and tensions <b>between</b> <b>schooling</b> and youth are the results of deep changes that have taken place in Western societies and have interfered both in the social production of individuals and in their times and spaces, affecting the institutions and the socialization process of the new generations. This paper thus discusses the characteristics of young students who study public high schools and provides evidence for the existence of a new youth condition in contemporary Brazil. it points out the challenges and concerns of schooling and youth, emphasizing the transformations within schooling institutions and the tensions and constraints in the difficult task of becoming students. The author finally concludes that schools have become less unequal but continue to be unfair...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} two main aspects: first, it reports {{the results of}} a survey of ninety nine {{governors}} working in Roman Catholic primary and secondary schools situated in four English Catholic dioceses, and publishes hitherto unknown information about them; and, second, it examines how, in seeking to maintain a distinctive educational ethos, these governors are responding both to the legislative changes of the last twenty years, and to changes in English social and cultural attitudes. It shows how these responses calibrate with the perceptions of those appointed by the Catholic bishops to oversee the conduct of the schools – the diocesan directors – six of whom were interviewed, together with an official with a national perspective. The study shows that, whilst there are powerful elements of continuity in the Catholic Church’s view of the nature and purpose of schools, a number of incongruities are now arising {{as a result of the}} enhanced powers given to governing bodies since 1980, and that the diocesan authorities are not as effective in providing support for their schools as are the local authorities (LAs). This trend appears to be having an adverse effect on what should be the schools’ distinctive nature, and could therefore be preparing the ground for <b>challenges</b> <b>between</b> dioceses and <b>schools.</b> One of the key areas involved is that of senior staff appointments, where the existing policy position appears unsustainable. Others concern the expectations some governors have of the need for teachers to practise high levels of sexual morality in their private lives, and the distinctive Catholic ethos which governors believe their schools manifest...|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} rivalry for the Golden Flashes is {{with the}} Akron Zips from the University of Akron, located in Akron, Ohio, approximately 10 mi southwest of Kent. The series dates back to February 19, 1916, when the two teams played in Kent {{in the basement of}} the old heating plant, won by Akron 37-16. Kent State recorded their first win in the series, a 23-21 win at Wills Gymnasium, in 1927. Through the 2016-17 season, the Flashes lead the series 75-73. Akron's longest winning streak in the series is a nine-game streak from 1942 to 1949, while Kent State's longest winning streak is five games, which has occurred three times. Kent State had a 19-game home winning streak against the Zips, which spanned from 1964 to 1998. Despite the length of the rivalry and close proximity of the campuses, the series has only been a conference meeting since 1992 when Akron joined the Mid-American Conference. Prior to 1992, the rivalry was played in the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) for two periods, the first from 1932, when Kent State joined the conference, until 1936, when Akron left the OAC. The second period of conference play began in 1944 after Akron returned to the OAC, and ended when Kent State left the conference in 1951 to join the MAC. When the MAC created East and West divisions in 1998, both teams were placed in the East division. Since 2011, the games count as part of the larger Wagon Wheel <b>Challenge</b> <b>between</b> the two <b>schools.</b>|$|R
30|$|Recall {{that only}} one {{classroom}} per school {{is included in the}} analysis sample. As a consequence, the variance in achievement <b>between</b> classroom within <b>schools</b> and the <b>between</b> <b>school</b> variance in achievement are confounded, so the proportion of variability <b>between</b> <b>schools</b> is larger than is observed when classroom-to-classroom differences are separated from <b>between</b> <b>school</b> differences. For example, when multiple classrooms per school are included in the analysis in the U.S., a three-level model indicates that approximately 40 % of the variability in mathematics performance lies between students within classrooms, 47 % <b>between</b> classrooms within <b>schools,</b> and 12 % <b>between</b> <b>schools.</b> In Singapore, the only other country with large numbers of schools with more than one classroom, approximately 23 % of the variability in mathematics performance lies between students within classrooms, 53 % <b>between</b> classrooms within <b>schools,</b> and 24 % <b>between</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|R

40|$|Goals: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{scientific}} production on the relationship <b>between</b> <b>school</b> and community in the perspective of Health Promotion. Method: Integrative review. The search was guided by question: How has the relationship <b>between</b> <b>school</b> and community occurred in Health Promotion? Results: Nine studies were selected in Portuguese, Spanish and English, published from April 2006 to April 2016. Most of the rescued studies showed that the type of relationship <b>between</b> <b>school</b> and community has based on actions that are not linked to the principles of Health Promotion, mostly focused on the individual, without considering collective issues, risk factors that cause illness, disconnected from the social context. Few studies present advances in Health Promotion with a critical-citizen perspective and experiences with the potential for the necessary establishment of the school and community relation. Conclusion: Although the relationship <b>between</b> <b>school</b> and community in the perspective of Health Promotion presents as elementary and not deepened, the successful experiences show good prospects of overcoming. It is necessary to move forward and bring the relationship <b>between</b> <b>school</b> and community in a synergetic movement in favor of Health Promotion.
