5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius torminosus contain {{a number of}} sterols, of which {{ergosterol}} (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds {{that contribute to the}} odor of the mushroom. Many of these are alcohols and <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is 1-octen-3-one, an odorant common in mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|The Saegusa–Ito {{oxidation}} is {{a chemical}} reaction used in organic chemistry. It {{was discovered in}} 1978 by Takeo Saegusa and Yoshihiko Ito as a method to introduce α-β unsaturation in <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds.</b> The reaction as originally reported involved formation of a silyl enol ether followed by treatment with palladium(II) acetate and benzoquinone to yield the corresponding enone. The original publication noted its utility for regeneration of unsaturation following 1,4-addition with nucleophiles such as organocuprates.|$|E
5|$|Dinitrogen {{is able to}} {{coordinate}} to metals in five different ways. The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M←N≡N (η1) and M←N≡N→M (μ, bis-η1), in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond, either as a bridging ligand to two metal cations (μ, bis-η2) or to just one (η2). The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond (μ3-N2). A few complexes feature multiple N2 ligands and some feature N2 bonded in multiple ways. Since N2 is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide (CO) and acetylene (C2H2), the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds,</b> although N2 is a weaker σ-donor and π-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that σ donation is a more important factor allowing {{the formation of the}} M–N bond than π back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N–N bond, and end-on (η1) donation is more readily accomplished than side-on (η2) donation.|$|E

50|$|Two viable {{reaction}} mechanisms {{exist for}} this reaction. In the first mechanism 2-amino substituted <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound</b> 1 and <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound</b> 2 react in a rate-limiting step to aldol adduct 3. This intermediate loses water in an elimination reaction to unsaturated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound</b> 4 and then loses water again in imine formation to quinoline 7. In the second mechanism {{the first step}} is Schiff base formation to 5 followed by Aldol reaction to 6 and elimination to 7.|$|R
25|$|When an acid {{catalyst}} is used, {{the initial}} {{step in the}} reaction mechanism involves acid-catalyzed tautomerization of the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound</b> to the enol. The acid also serves to activate the carbonyl group of another molecule by protonation, rendering it highly electrophilic. The enol is nucleophilic at the α-carbon, allowing it to attack the protonated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound,</b> leading to the aldol after deprotonation. This usually dehydrates to give the unsaturated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound.</b> The scheme shows a typical acid-catalyzed self-condensation of an aldehyde.|$|R

25|$|The aldol {{reaction}} may proceed via two {{fundamentally different}} mechanisms. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as aldehydes and ketones, {{can be converted}} to enols or enol ethers. These species, being nucleophilic at the α-carbon, can attack especially reactive protonated carbonyls such as protonated aldehydes. This is the 'enol mechanism'. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>compounds,</b> being carbon acids, can also be deprotonated to form enolates, which are much more nucleophilic than enols or enol ethers and can attack electrophiles directly. The usual electrophile is an aldehyde, since ketones are much less reactive. This is the 'enolate mechanism'.|$|E

50|$|Piano stool {{complexes}} of {{the type}} (η6-C6H6)M(CO)3 are typically synthesized by heating the appropriate metal <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound</b> with benzene. Alternately, the same compounds {{can be obtained by}} carbonylation of the bis(arene) sandwich compounds, such as (η6-C6H6)2M compound with the metal <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound.</b> This second approach may be more appropriate for arene ligands containing thermally fragile substituents.|$|R
25|$|In the aldol reaction, {{the metal}} enolates of ketones, esters, amides, and {{carboxylic}} acids {{will add to}} aldehydes to form β-hydroxycarbonyl compounds (aldols). Acid or base-catalyzed dehydration will then lead to α,β-unsaturated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds.</b> The combination of these two steps {{is known as the}} aldol condensation.|$|E
25|$|In the Favorskii {{reaction}} and in alkynylations in general, terminal alkynes add to <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> {{to give the}} hydroxyalkyne. Coupling of terminal alkynes to give dialkynes is effected in the Cadiot–Chodkiewicz coupling, Glaser coupling, and the Eglinton coupling reactions. Terminal alkynes can also be coupled to aryl or vinyl halides as in the Sonogashira coupling.|$|E
25|$|A pair of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> {{can also}} be reductively coupled {{together}} (with reduction) to generate an alkene. Symmetrical alkenes can be prepared from a single aldehyde or ketone coupling with itself, using titanium metal reduction (the McMurry reaction). If two different ketones are to be coupled, a more complex, indirect method such as the Barton–Kellogg reaction may be used.|$|E

50|$|Conjugate {{addition}} is the vinylogous {{counterpart of}} direct nucleophilic addition. A nucleophile reacts with a α,β-unsaturated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound</b> in the β position. The negative charge {{carried by the}} nucleophile is now delocalized in the alkoxide anion and the α carbon carbanion by resonance. Protonation leads through Keto-enol tautomerism to the saturated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound.</b> In vicinal difunctionalization the proton is replaced by another electrophile.|$|R

25|$|Oxidations using oxoammonium salts may {{be carried}} out either in the {{stoichiometric}} or catalytic mode under acidic or basic conditions. This section describes {{the most commonly used}} conditions for the stoichiometric and catalytic oxidation of alcohols to <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> with oxoammonium salts. Although a wide variety of alcohols may be oxidized using TEMPO, competitive oxidation of more electron-rich functionality sometimes takes place. In addition, the site selectivity of oxidation of polyols may differ depending on the conditions used.|$|E
25|$|One-electron oxidants, such as copper(II), operate via a {{more complex}} {{mechanism}} involving dioxygen as the terminal oxidant. Copper(II) oxidizes four equivalents of nitroxide to oxoammonium, two equivalents of which (blue) react with alcohols to form <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds.</b> The other two equivalents of oxoammonium (red) undergo comproportionation to re-form nitroxy radicals (pink). Finally, dioxygen re-oxidizes four equivalents of copper(I) back to copper(II). Overall, a single molecule of dioxygen mediates the oxidation of two equivalents of alcohol, {{with the formation of}} two equivalents of water.|$|E
25|$|Alkyl and alkenyl sulfones {{with good}} leaving {{groups in the}} β {{position}} undergo elimination under reductive conditions to afford alkenes or alkynes. The Julia olefination exploits this process for the synthesis of alkenes from alkyl sulfones and <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds.</b> Addition of an α-sulfonyl anion to a carbonyl compound, followed by quenching with an acyl or sulfonyl chloride, leads to a β-acyloxy or -sulfonyloxy sulfone, which undergoes elimination under reductive conditions. Sodium amalgam {{may be used to}} accomplish the elimination step; however, the combination of samarium(II) iodide and HMPA is milder than strongly basic sodium amalgam and leads to higher yields in reductive elimination processes.|$|E

25|$|A typical modern aldol {{addition}} reaction, shown above, {{might involve}} the nucleophilic {{addition of a}} ketone enolate to an aldehyde. Once formed, the aldol product can sometimes lose a molecule of water to form an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is called aldol condensation. A variety of nucleophiles may be employed in the aldol reaction, including the enols, enolates, and enol ethers of ketones, aldehydes, and many other <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds.</b> The electrophilic partner is usually an aldehyde or ketone (many variations, such as the Mannich reaction, exist). When the nucleophile and electrophile are different, the reaction is called a crossed aldol reaction; on the converse, when the nucleophile and electrophile are the same, the reaction is called an aldol dimerization.|$|E
25|$|Samarium iodide is {{effective}} for {{the reduction of}} {{a wide array of}} functional groups; however, other reducing agents are more useful in certain contexts. SmI2 causes reductive dimerization of allylic or benzylic halides, and chiral halides undergo non-stereospecific reduction. On the other hand, its functional group compatibility is greater than many reducing agents—halide reduction is possible in the presence of esters or alcohols. Reductive fragmentations with samarium iodide have the disadvantage that they are not stereospecific; however, stereoselectivity is higher in some cases when SmI2 is used in place of other reducing agents. Reduction of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids and derivatives to the corresponding saturated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> by SmI2 is a useful transformation mediated by few other reducing agents. The mild reaction conditions employed for samarium iodide reductions represent a significant advantage of the reaction over other single-electron reductions, including dissolving metal reduction and transition-metal induced methods.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{and oxygen}} {{together}} {{have a total}} of 10 electrons in the valence shell. Following the octet rule for both carbon and oxygen, the two atoms form a triple bond, with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds.</b> Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or dipolar bond. This causes a C←O polarization of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds with a reverse C→O polarization, since oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. In the free carbon monoxide, a net negative charge δ– remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small dipole moment of 0.122D.|$|E

A newer definition, proposed by Kohler, is the 1,4-addition of a doubly stabilized carbon nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound.</b> Some examples of nucleophiles include beta-ketoesters, malonates, and beta-cyanoesters. The resulting product contains a highly useful 1,5-dioxygenated pattern.|$|R
