25|$|Cable {{television}} provides {{television to}} consumers via radio frequency signals transmitted to televisions through fixed optical fibers or coaxial cables {{as opposed to}} the over-the-air method used in traditional television broadcasting. First known as <b>Community</b> <b>Antenna</b> <b>Television</b> or <b>CATV,</b> cable <b>television</b> was born in the mountains of Pennsylvania in 1948 by John Walson and Margaret Walson.|$|R
50|$|Walson, {{owner of}} a Mahanoy City General Electric {{appliance}} store, needed to solve problems receiving signals from Philadelphia television stations, which were blocked by the mountains surrounding the town. Walson erected an antenna on a utility pole on a local mountaintop that enabled him to demonstrate the televisions in his store with strong broadcasts coming from the three Philadelphia stations. He connected the antenna to his appliance store via a cable and modified signal boosters. He then connected several of his customers who were located along the cable path. This was the first <b>community</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>television</b> (<b>CATV)</b> system in the United States.|$|E

With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, viewing of terrestrial television broadcasts has been in decline; in 2013, {{it was estimated that}} about 7% of US households used an antenna.

40|$|The use of <b>Community</b> <b>Antenna</b> <b>Television</b> Network (<b>CATV)</b> {{cable systems}} {{are a very}} common way that {{subscribers}} use to access the internet and download data. The transmitters that send the signals to subscribers must conform to a very stringent specification known as DOCSIS. Using traditional high frequency design techniques to meet this specification often lead to a lengthy and difficult production process where several calibrations have to be made. In order to send a digitally modulated signal that conforms to the DOCSIS specification some sort of conversion between the discrete digital domain and the analog domain must occur. To accomplish this a Digital to Analog converter is used. In recent years, the clocking or sampling frequency {{that can be used}} for Digital to Analog converters (DACs) has been rapidly increasing. The clocking frequency is directly proportional to the bandwidth that can be transmitted. DAC's that have exceptionally high clocking frequencies can be referred to as Radio Frequency DAC's. The clocking frequency of these devices has now progressed to the point where direct digital synthesis can be used for a DOCSIS transmitter without any analog frequency conversion stages. Since Radio Frequency DAC's are real devices the output is not a perfect representation of the discrete signal that is sent to it. Unwanted distortion is added that can be measured at the analog output. Removal of this distortion or at least significantly reducing it could be the difference meeting or or not meeting the DOCSIS specification. This thesis will explore the usage of these devices in this application. The basic structure of DAC's as well as the distortion signals themselves will be investigated in order to develop a method where the distortion can be removed. Ideally this can be done in a way that is suitable to be integrated into a transmitter architecture and meet the specification. The frequency response of the major distortion products across the DOCSIS band is measured. Once this is done a way to match these frequency responses is needed so a cancellation signal can be created that removes the distortion. A method is developed that uses an iterative algorithm to find filter coefficients whose frequency response matches that of the distortion signals as closely as possible. Since these cancellation signals are added to the discrete signal to be transmitted before the interface with the Radio Frequency DAC the process is known as pre-distortion. The generated coefficients are used in digital filters as part of a pre-distortion design. Tests are performed with discrete signals that are close approximates to a DOCSIS signal that would be sent to a subscriber. Measured results show a decrease in the power of targeted distortion signals. The reduction of the distortion level is enough that the DOCSIS specification is met for all test signals...|$|R

We have developed a model of DOCSIS using the ‘ns ’ simulation package. In this tutorial paper we provide a detailed presentation of the DOCSIS protocol.

40|$|The {{concept of}} cable television, {{originally}} called <b>community</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>television</b> (<b>CATV),</b> {{began in the}} 1940 's. The information and services provided by cable operators have changed drastically since the early days. Cable service providers are no longer simply providing their customers with broadcast television but are providing a multi-purpose, two-way link to the digital world. Custom programming, telephone service, radio, and high-speed internet access {{are just a few}} of the services offered by cable service providers in the 21 st century. At the dawn of the internet the dominant mode of access was through telephone lines. Despite advances in dial-up modem technology, the telephone system was unable to keep pace with the demand for data throughput. In the late 1990 's an industry consortium known as Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. developed a standard protocol for providing high-speed internet access through the existing CATV infrastructure. This protocol is known as Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) and it helped to usher in the era of the information superhighway. CATV systems use different parts of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum for communication to and from the user. The downstream portion (data destined for the user) consumes the bulk of the spectrum and is located at relatively high frequencies. The upstream portion (data destined to the network from the user) of the spectrum is smaller and located at the low end of the spectrum. This lower frequency region of the RF spectrum is particularly prone to impairments such as micro-reflections, which can be viewed as a type of multipath interference. Upstream data transfer in the presence of these impairments is therefore problematic and requires complex signal correction algorithms to be employed in the receiver. The quality of a receiver is largely determined by how well it mitigates the signal impairments introduced by the channel. For this reason, engineers developing a receiver require a piece of equipment that can emulate the channel impairments in any permutation in order to test their receiver. The conventional test methodology uses a hardware RF channel emulator connected between the transmitter and the receiver under test. This method not only requires an expensive RF channel emulator, but a functioning analog front-end as well. Of these two problems, the expense of the hardware emulator is likely less important than the delay in development caused by waiting for a functional analog front-end. Receiver design is an iterative, time consuming process that requires the receiver's digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms be tested as early as possible to reduce the time-to-market. This thesis presents a digital implementation of a DOCSIS-compliant channel emulator whereby cable micro-reflections and thermal noise at the analog front-end of the receiver are modelled digitally at baseband. The channel emulator and the modulator are integrated into a single hardware structure to produce a compact circuit that, during receiver testing, resides inside the same field programmable gate array (FPGA) as the receiver. This approach removes the dependence on the analog front-end allowing it to be developed concurrently with the receiver's DSP circuits, thus reducing the time-to-market. The approach taken in this thesis produces a fully programmable channel emulator that can be loaded onto FPGAs as needed by engineers working independently on different receiver designs. The channel emulator uses 3 independent data streams to produce a 3 -channel signal, whereby a main channel with micro-reflections is flanked on either side by adjacent channels. Thermal noise normally generated by the receiver's analog front-end is emulated and injected into the signal. The resulting structure utilizes 43 dedicated multipliers and 401. 125 KB of RAM, and achieves a modulation error ratio (MER) of 55. 29 dB...|$|E
