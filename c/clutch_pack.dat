25|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine drives two clutch packs. The outer <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> drives gears 1, 3, 5 (and 7 when fitted), and reverse — the outer <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> has a larger diameter compared to the inner clutch, and can therefore handle greater torque loadings. The inner <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> drives gears 2, 4, and 6. Instead of a standard large dry single-plate clutch, each <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> for the six-speed DSG {{is a collection of}} four small wet interleaved clutch plates (similar to a motorcycle wet multi-plate clutch). Due to space constraints, the two clutch assemblies are concentric, and the shafts within the gearbox are hollow and also concentric. Because the alternate clutch pack's gear-sets can be pre-selected (predictive shifts enabled via the unloaded section of the gearbox), un-powered time while shifting is avoided because the transmission of torque is simply switched from one clutch-pack to the other. This means that the DSG takes only about 8milliseconds to upshift. In comparison, the sequential manual transmission (SMT) in the Ferrari F430 Scuderia takes 60milliseconds to shift, or 150milliseconds in the Ferrari Enzo. The quoted time for upshifts is the time the wheels are completely non-powered.|$|E

5000|$|There {{have been}} at least 6 {{revisions}} of <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> and transmission control modules since inception. Newer <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> and transmissions are more resistant to wear and fluid contamination, as the source of many shudder issues involved an improperly installed seal which was leaking transmission fluid onto the dry clutches. Ford also claims there are [...] "Changes to the clutch material for better performance across temperature ranges (new for 2016)." [...] Some consumer complaints are due to the normal operating characteristics of the transmission, because the DPS6 does not contain a torque converter fluid coupling and does not behave similarly to traditional torque converter transmissions, instead sharing some characteristics found in traditional manual transmissions.|$|R
50|$|The 9HP is only 0.24 inches (6mm) longer than, {{and weighs}} 16.5 lbs (7.5 kg) less than, the {{outgoing}} six-speed transmission. The compact packaging {{is achieved by}} using a number of innovative design features: a new compact hydraulic vane-type pump, two patented dog clutches, which replace bulkier conventional <b>clutch</b> <b>packs,</b> and a nested gear set.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2001 for the 2002 model year, the TL got a minor makeover, with a {{refreshed}} front fascia, redesigned taillights, a 6 CD in-dash changer {{as well as}} a {{few other}} features. A Type-S model was also added, adding 35hp (26kW) as well as [...] wheels, firmer seats and suspension. A statistically large percentage of these vehicles exhibited problems with the 3rd gear <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> in the automatic transmission necessitating replacement. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to [...] or 7.75 years for all 99 to 02 models and 03 partial per VIN. Acura dealers replace the transmissions under warranty. Transmissions replaced prior to March 2005 usually fail again. Transmissions replaced March 2005 and later include a redesigned 3rd gear <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> reported to fix the problem.|$|E
2500|$|The first variant, the 7DT-45, {{is used on}} its 2009 997 Carrera and Carrera S models.

[...] This is rated at , and uses a different ZF Sachs clutch—the ND2216.|$|E
2500|$|A notable feature {{available}} in this generation was the automatic {{four wheel drive}} option called Quadra-Drive, which employed the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer case. This two-speed chain-driven transfer case uses a gerotor, a <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> coupled to a hydraulic pump, to transfer torque between {{the front and rear}} axles. The transfer case contains three modes, 4-All Time, Neutral, and 4-Lo. In 4-All Time, 100% of torque is sent to the rear axle in normal conditions. If the rear axle starts spinning at a higher rate than the front axle, hydraulic pressure builds up in the gerotor and causes the <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> to progressively transfer torque to the front axle until both axles return to the same speed. Neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In 4-Lo, the front and rear axles are locked together through a 2.72 reduction gear ratio. The NV247 transfer case is mated to front and rear axles containing Jeep's Vari-Lok differentials. Vari-Lok differentials also use a gerotor to transfer torque between the wheels {{on either side of the}} axle. [...] The major advantage of Quadra-Drive was that the combined [...] transfer case and progressive locking differentials in each axle could automatically control traction between all four wheels. However, only the center differential could be permanently locked, and only in 4Lo. [...] The Quadra-Trac II system included the NV247 transfer case with the standard open front and rear differentials.|$|E
50|$|However, heat {{proved to}} be a {{persistent}} issue. Excessive heat buildup would burn out the new clutch material. To solve the problem, engineers studied the clutch's torque capacity. It was determined that excessive heat buildup was caused by inadequate clutch torque capacity. Engineers increased the system's capacity and equipped a fleet of test vehicles, which they took to the Anza-Borrego desert in southern California. They made a total of 11 trips, subjecting the prototypes to heat, mountain driving, and deep sand with the intelligent multi-disc clutches being called upon for almost continuous delivery of torque. At first, the environment quickly burned out the clutches. But as engineers gained knowledge, the clutches improved. Eventually, the engineers were able to improve the <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> enough that the test vehicles could be virtually destroyed from hard off road use, but the <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> would still look good.|$|R
50|$|A limited-slip {{differential}} {{is available}} for high-output applications. GM has sourced Quaife's automatic torque biasing (ATB) torque-sensing (Torsen-style) differential, which is an all-mechanical geared unit that uses no <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> or preloading to transfer torque from one axle to the other. The torque transfer occurs automatically and gradually when one wheel loses traction. This type of differential can severely reduce the effects of torque-steer.|$|R
2500|$|The first DSG {{transaxle}} {{that went}} into production for the Volkswagen Group mainstream marques had six forward speeds (and one reverse) and used wet/submerged multi-plate <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> (Volkswagen Group internal code: DQ250, parts code prefix: 02E). It has been paired to engines with up to [...] of torque. The two-wheel-drive version weighs [...] [...] It is manufactured at Volkswagen Group's Kassel plant, with a daily production output of 1,500 units.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the second}} year of production, the Acura TL was given {{slightly}} more features, including a 5-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. The added gear allowed for slightly better fuel economy and acceleration when compared to the previous 4-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. With this model, if the driver forgets the 1-2 shift the computer will take over when in sport mode and do the 1-2 up and down shifts, unlike the 4-speed 1999 model. In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission failed: as the third <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally. The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly downshift and make the car come to a screeching halt, even at freeway speeds. This problem was highlighted in the Los Angeles Times in September 2002. Consumer Reports took note and gave the TL and CL the black spot, the worst rating for transmission reliability. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to 7 yrs or [...] on U.S.A. models. A class-action lawsuit was settled to extend the transmission warranty for U.S.A. owners or entities to 7.75 years for all models made from 1998 to 2002 and some 2003 models by VIN; however, Canadian owners warranties were not extended. Transmissions replaced prior to March 2005 usually fail again.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2008, another world-first [...] seven-speed DSG {{transaxle}} (Volkswagen Group internal code: DQ200, parts code prefix: 0AM) became available. [...] It differs from the six-speed DSG, in that it uses two single-plate dry clutches (of similar diameter). This <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> was designed by LuK Clutch Systems, Gmbh. This seven-speed DSG is used in smaller front-wheel-drive cars with smaller-displacement engines with lower torque outputs, such as the latest Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Polo Mk5, and the new SEAT Ibiza. It has been paired to engines with up to [...] It has considerably less oil capacity than the six-speed DQ250; this new DQ200 uses just [...] of transmission fluid.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Honda {{introduced}} the CB750A to the United States, with the A suffix designating [...] "automatic," [...] for its automatic transmission. Although the 2-speed transmission includes a torque converter typical of an automatic transmission, the transmission {{does not automatically}} change gears for the rider. Each gear is selected by a foot-controlled hydraulic valve/selector (similar in operation to a manual transmission motorcycle). The foot selector controls the application of high pressure oil to a single <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> (one clutch for each gear), causing the selected clutch (and gear) to engage. The selected gear remains selected until changed by the rider, or the kickstand is lowered (which shifts the transmission to neutral).|$|E
2500|$|P {{position}} of the floor-mounted gear shift lever means that the transmission is set in park.

50|$|Both {{first and}} second {{generation}} Ford Expeditions (UN93 and U222) had optional Traction-Lok rear limited-slip differential (LSD). The <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> inside the LSD tend to be weak, will wear over time, gradually losing their ability to transfer torque, and LSD will function like an open-type differential. The front differential on four-wheel drive models are open-type differential. The AdvanceTrac electronic stability control for the 2003 model year. The 2006 was the last model year for the Traction-Lok limited-slip differential.|$|R

2500|$|For the 2001 model year, a {{redesigned}} coupe {{version of}} the TL was introduced, the 3.2CL. While it was mechanically identical to the TL, its sales never came close to that of its sibling model, and as a result, it was discontinued in May 2003. The 2001 added one feature that the 2000 did not have, a new redesigned cupholder insert. The automatic transmission {{in many of these}} cars were also defective. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to [...] or 7.75 years for all 99 to 02 and 03 partial per VIN.

2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|E

50|$|The torque {{converter}} measured 9.5 in {{in diameter and}} was mounted to the flywheel by a flexible drive plate. The transaxle was cooled through an oil-to-water heat exchanger in the collector tank on the radiator, and/or a standard oil-to-air heat exchanger. There were no bands or mechanical holding devices; ratios were supplied by five different <b>clutch</b> <b>packs.</b> This allowed the transmission to be lightweight and to use fewer moving parts than the three speed it replaced.|$|R
50|$|Honda {{has since}} {{announced}} an evolution of SH-AWD using hybrid electric technology. In a 2012 announcement, Sport Hybrid SH-AWD (Super Handling All Wheel Drive), replaces the engine powered mechanical drive shaft and <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> by two 27 hp electric motors, {{one on each}} wheel not driven by the gasoline engine. The first two announced applications of the Sport Hybrid SH-AWD {{will be on the}} rear wheels of the 2014 Acura RLX, and on the front wheels of the new Acura NSX Concept.|$|R
50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{are characterized}} by gear ratios that are selectable by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most automatic transmissions feature epicyclic (planetary) gearing controlled by brake bands and/or <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> to select gear ratio. Automatic transmissions that allow the driver to manually select the current gear are called manumatics. A manual-style transmission operated by computer is often called an automated transmission rather than an automatic, even though no {{distinction between the two}} terms need be made.|$|R

50|$|The {{idea for}} an {{electronically}} controlled four-wheel drive system emerged at BorgWarner in 1985. BorgWarner’s original design called for using both a software controlled electromagnetic multi-disc (also called multi-plate) <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> and a planetary or bevel geared center differential together. The first prototype system was crude, and its original <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> controller was a rheostat.|$|E
50|$|The ST300 had a three-element torque converter, a {{front and}} rear multiple-disc <b>clutch</b> <b>pack,</b> and a {{compound}} planetary gearset with a front band and a <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> for reverse and manual low gear. The unit was cooled with a small auxiliary oil cooler located beneath the engine radiator. It had a die cast aluminum case, and weighed 152 lb.|$|E
50|$|The 42LE was an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} 41TE modified for longitudinal engines. It debuted in 1993 on the LH cars. It is strengthened with a reworked final drive unit, barreled axle shafts, and upgraded <b>clutch</b> <b>packs.</b> The major modification to a N-S drivetrain while maintaining front wheel drive was accomplished by adding a differential to the transmission case, which was driven {{by means of a}} transfer chain from the output shaft of the low/reverse clutch assembly {{at the rear of the}} transmission case.|$|R
50|$|Chaika's on {{the other}} hand was solely {{available}} with the transmission, and in 1962 it received a slight upgrade in number of <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> and piston shapes. Never available for private ownership, the car was produced in small scale all the way until 1981. In 1963, GAZ introduced the world's first Q-car, the GAZ-23, by transplanting the large V8 engine and the powertrain of the Chaika into the unibody Volga. The transmission was adapted to the steering column shifter. This car was primarily used as a motorcade escort by the KGB's ninth directive (responsible for personal security).|$|R
50|$|However, as the {{development}} process continued, engineers at BorgWarner discovered that, with clever software programming, they could control the variable electromagnetic multi-disc clutch {{to a point where}} it would allow the front and rear drive shafts to turn at different rotational speeds on its own, without the aid of a planetary or bevel geared center differential. In Auto mode the new software algorithms allowed the multi-disc <b>clutch</b> <b>pack's</b> friction and <b>clutch</b> discs to slip as needed, simulating a planetary or bevel geared center differential, making a geared differential redundant. Thus, the geared differential was abandoned and therefore never included on the final production version of the four-wheel drive system.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees {{using the}} NV247 {{transfer}} case, in [...] "4-All Time" [...] mode torque {{is applied to}} only the rear wheels under normal driving conditions. A gerotor pump is connected between {{the front and rear}} output shafts and senses any speed difference between them. When the shafts are turning at different speeds (wheel slippage), the pump supplies oil under pressure to a wet <b>clutch</b> <b>pack.</b> The <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> applies progressive 0 to 100% locking between the front and rear output shafts. For example, if the rear axle starts rotating at a significantly higher rate than the front axle, the gerotor pump causes the <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> to progressively lock, transferring torque to the front axle until both axles are driven at the same speed. The apply pressure in the <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> bleeds off slowly, which progressively unlocks the <b>clutch</b> <b>pack</b> and biases torque output towards [...] "rear only" [...] unless the rear wheels are still slipping. There is no center differential, so on dry pavement the front and rear output shafts cannot be locked without causing driveline binding. The [...] "N" [...] or neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In [...] "4-Lo" [...] mode, the input shaft drives through a 2.72:1 reduction planetary gear set and the front and rear axles are locked together through the <b>clutch</b> <b>pack.</b> This same NV247 transfer case is the foundation for the Quadra-Drive system described below.|$|E

The engines are mated to a front-wheel-drive transaxle. There is no center differential. The transaxle is bolted to torque transfer unit that spins a center drive shaft that powers the rear differential unit. The rear differential is a T-shaped device. Power coming from the engine is transferred via a central hypoid gear that delivers power to each rear axle. Power to the each axle is modulated by identical planetary gear sets and electromagnetic <b>clutch</b> <b>packs</b> which can vary incoming power side to side.|$|R
50|$|The 01M and its {{predecessor}} 096 {{are very similar}} to the other transmissions engineered and manufactured by STA: AR4, AD4 and AD8, which were deployed on Renault vehicles in the 1980s and 1990s. It is an electronically controlled transmission with a lockup torque converter, using planetary gears, <b>clutch</b> <b>packs,</b> and a gear-driven final drive with an open-differential. There is no chain inside this transmission. It does not have provision for a dipstick. It was determined that a dipstick and fill might invite owners to introduce incorrect or inferior fluid.
