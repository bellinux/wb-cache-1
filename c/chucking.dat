25|$|Some doubts {{were raised}} about the {{legality}} of Clarke's bowling action {{while he was at}} Surrey. Several opposition sides made official complaints about Clarke's faster ball and umpire Dickie Bird closely studied tapes of Clarke's action for any irregularities but found none, nor was Clarke ever called for throwing.

25|$|The {{point of}} release is the {{position}} of the ball in relation to the body at the moment when the ball is released. It is crucial for the arm to be stiff, not bent, and the wrist rather looser, to ensure smooth release of the ball, and sufficient bounce off the pitch. Otherwise, the action will resemble <b>chucking.</b> The left shoulder ought to be somewhat towards the stumps, the arm beside the bowler falling away, having just before this stage been pointing directly at the stumps.|$|E

In 35 overs, the pair added 109 runs, as Sri Lanka worked their way towards a big lead. Sangakkara made it to stumps with an unbeaten 135 having hit a 200-ball century, while Omari Banks got two wickets – of Dilshan and Vaas. However, at stumps Sri Lanka were 340 for 7.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} by {{scientists}} commissioned by the ICC it was shown that Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar and Indian bowler R. P. Singh were seen to extend their elbow joints by a negative angle {{with respect to the}} upper arm. This phenomenon, also known as hyperextension, can give the illusion of throwing. In the report it was seen that R. P. Singh maintained this negative angle throughout his delivery stride, while Akhtar sometimes bowled a quicker delivery by flexing this hyperextension. These actions are not considered to be <b>chucking</b> as they are due to the distinctive architecture of their elbows, possibly a congenital condition. Since these cricketers have no control over this hyperextension, any degree of hyperextension (past zero) is not included in the 15 degree extension tolerance threshold.|$|E

25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, throwing, {{commonly}} referred to as <b>chucking,</b> is an illegal bowling action which occurs when a bowler straightens the bowling arm when delivering the ball. The laws of cricket specify that a bowler's arm must not extend during the bowling action. Only the rotation of the shoulder can be used to impart velocity to the ball. Throws are not allowed. If the umpire deems that the ball has been thrown, he will call a no ball which means the batsman cannot be given out from that delivery. Current regulations of the International Cricket Council (ICC) set the legal limit of 15 degrees of permissible straightening of the elbow joint for all bowlers in international cricket. This law applies between {{the point at which the}} bowling arm passes above shoulder height and the point at which the ball is released. The limit is to allow some natural flexing of the elbow joint which happens during the course of legal delivery.|$|E
25|$|The Prime Minister of Australia Robert Menzies was a keen cricket fan and {{the match}} between his {{personally}} chosen XI and the MCC was {{a highlight of}} the tour, followed by a banquet in which the Menzies would entertain the teams with a speech. His team consisted of Australian Test players such as Wally Grout, Alan Connolly and Bob Cowper, retired veterans Neil Harvey, Richie Benaud and Jim Burke, young talent like Keith Stackpole, the teenaged Paul Sheahan {{as well as the}} famous West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall, who was playing for Queensland. Benaud captained the team and fulfilled 90% of his duties by winning the toss and choosing to bat. Thanks to Burke (79), Sheahan (60), Benaud (45) and Stackpole (32 not out) the Prime Minister's XI hit 288/7 in 35 overs, with the wickets shared amongst the touring bowlers with Jeff Jones taking 2/21, David Larter 2/43 and Bob Barber 2/72. The declaration came halfway through the day and the MCC's winning 289/8 also took 35 overs, though they passed 200 for the loss of two wickets as Geoff Boycott made 95 before he was run out, Colin Cowdrey 52 and M.J.K. Smith 51 not out. Eight bowlers were used, but the best was Jim Burke who took 2/5 with his infamous <b>chucking</b> action, dismissing John Murray and Jones for ducks in the closing minutes of the match.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the tour, O'Neill {{garnered}} controversy {{by writing}} outspoken newspaper columns accusing opposition pace spearhead Charlie Griffith of <b>chucking.</b> He was one of several Australians who took exception to Griffith's bowling action, and he put his name to a series of feature articles in Sydney's Daily Mirror. These labelled Griffith as [...] "an obvious chucker", saying the hosts had been [...] "wrong to play" [...] him. O'Neill stated that [...] "If he is allowed to continue throwing, he could kill someone". O'Neill also expressed his desire to not have to face bowling that he deemed to be illegal. When the Daily Mirror syndicated the columns, London's Daily Mail ignored an embargo and printed the pieces while the Australians were on their homeward flight, putting O'Neill in breach of his tour contract, which forbade players from commenting in the media during tours.|$|E
