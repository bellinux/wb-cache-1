5000|$|There {{have been}} many deaths in Winchester Prison. Daryl Hargrave aged 22 hanged himself in Winchester Prison on 19th July, 2015, a day after another {{prisoner}} at the jail took his life. The inquest into Hargrave's death found adequate mental health care had not been provided, despite repeated warnings Hargrave was risk of self harm. Hargrave had repeatedly self-harmed and attempted suicide and suffered mental health problems from a young age. In the days before his death Hargrave was clearly psychotic and told staff he planned to harm himself according to lawyers. The day before his suicide, Hargrave cut himself and told a nurse he was 'ground down by voices telling him to kill himself.' The nurse asked {{for him to be}} moved to an observation cell and put on constant watch. The prison’s two observation cells were in use and Hargrave was instead put in a <b>corner</b> <b>cell</b> which one nurse described as the “worst place to put someone who was suicidal, as it was out of sight, out of mind”. Consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Dinesh Maganty, said Hargrave showed clear evidence of psychosis and a GP or psychiatrist should have seen him urgently. Maganty said Hargrave should have received medication to help with anxiety and agitation due to his psychosis and criticised failure to provide it. The Portsmouth and south-east assistant coroner Harrold, said due to the case she was “gravely concerned” over the risk of further deaths at the prison. A report is intended. The governor told the jury in 2015, just 41% of staff were sufficiently trained in suicide and self-harm prevention. This has now risen to 61% but progress was slow as because of 'resourcing issues' and the governor accepted this is not good enough. [...] A coroner found neglect contributed to Daryl Hargrave's death. A prison inspection found the prison was, [...] "insufficiently safe" [...] and anti-bullying measures were ineffective.|$|E

40|$|Corner {{detection}} {{plays an}} important role in object recognition and motion analysis. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical corner detection framework based on spectral clustering (SC). The framework consists of three stages: contour smoothing, <b>corner</b> <b>cell</b> extraction and corner localization. In the contour smoothing stage, wavelet decomposition is imposed on the raw contour to reduce noise. In the <b>corner</b> <b>cell</b> extraction stage, several atomic corner cells are obtained by SC. In the corner localization stage, the corner points of each <b>corner</b> <b>cell</b> are located by the corner locator based on the kernel-weighted cosine curvature measure. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Index Terms — corner detection, spectral clustering, mean shift 1...|$|E

Figure  5 shows the surface micrographs on the transverse surfaces of untreated and THM woods. It was clear that THM process reduced cell lumen volume, which could be easily observed from Fig.  5. Comparing Fig.  5 a–e, THM wood with higher CR caused a larger deformation to the pores.

30|$|In {{order to}} show the {{importance}} of the optimal control approach suggested in this paper, we take the example of a patch which has 12 neighboring cells.

As an example, we suppose that the patch we aim to control is P={C_ 33,C_ 34,C_ 43,C_ 44 }, and we present simulations when the epidemic is more important at the <b>corner</b> <b>cell</b> C_ 1010 and when the epidemic is more important in cell C_ 65 which is attached or directly connected to P.|$|E
30|$|As we {{can observe}} in Figure  17, {{on the left}} side, the number of {{susceptible}} people in C_pq∈ P has not changed significantly compared to the initial conditions. It loses now more people {{as seen in the}} cellular simulations on the right side. Even when we consider an infection which starts from the left lower <b>corner</b> <b>cell</b> C_ 1010 and the travel-blocking vicinity optimal control strategy is considered to be missed in only one cell C_ 33, the number of susceptible people in P∖ C_ 33 has decreased to smaller values which equal 20 individuals in each cell. Moreover, obviously, cell C_ 33 loses more susceptible people towards 10, which is due to the movements of infected people that were not restricted in V_ 33. As regards the cellular simulations in Figure  18, we can see in cellular simulations on the left side that when the travel-blocking vicinity optimal control approach was followed in all cells C_pq∈ P, the number of infected people has not increased and conserved the zero value, while in cellular simulations on the right side, the number of infected people has increased to 20 in each cell in P∖ C_ 33 and to 25 in C_ 33. Simultaneously, we can see in Figure  19 that the number of the removed people in cellular simulations on the left side has not increased since there was no real infection after applying the travel-blocking vicinity optimal control strategy in all cells C_pq∈ P. However, when we do not restrict movements of infected people coming from V_ 33, we can see that the number of removed people has increased to five and ten individuals in P∖ C_ 33 and C_ 33, respectively. All that means that if the infection started from the upper right <b>corner</b> <b>cell,</b> the situation would be more severe. Also, this comparison shows the importance and utility of the application of the travel-blocking vicinity optimal control strategy in all cells which belong to the vicinity set V_P since the infection which comes from only one cell could lead to undesirable results.|$|E

The homogenization formula of micro-stress and the solving approach of finite element method are given firstly. A criterion is presented to determine the damage and its pattern of each element, and then the stiffness degradation method based on Murakami's geometric damage theory is used to simulate the status of damage under tensile loading steps for three kinds of unit cells. It {{can be seen that}} the damage percentage and damage pattern of damaged unit cell are totally different for different kind of unit cells. More damaged elements are observed for face cell and <b>corner</b> <b>cell</b> than that for body cell. It is also observed that the damage firstly occurs at the area of face cell, which agrees well with experimental results. It is verified that considering the effects of face and corner cells are important for the damage and strength analysis of 3 D braided composites...|$|E
