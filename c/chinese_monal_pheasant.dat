40|$|Understanding the {{distribution}} {{and the extent of}} suitable habitats is crucial for wildlife conservation and management. Knowledge is limited regarding the natural habitats of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>monal</b> (Lophophorus lhuysii), which is a vulnerable Galliform species endemic to the high-montane areas of southwest China and a good candidate for being an umbrella species in the Qionglai Mountains. Using ecological niche modeling, we predicted current potential suitable habitats for the <b>Chinese</b> <b>monal</b> in the Qionglai Mountains with 64 presence points collected between 2005 and 2015. Suitable habitats of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>monal</b> were associated with about 31 mm precipitation of the driest quarter, about 15  °C of maximum temperature of the warmest month, and far from the nearest human residential locations (> 5, 000 m). The predicted suitable habitats of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>monal</b> covered an area of 2, 490 km 2, approximately 9. 48 % of the Qionglai Mountains, and was highly fragmented. 54. 78 % of the suitable habitats were under the protection of existing nature reserves and two conservation gaps were found. Based on these results, we provide four suggestions for the conservation management of the Chinese monal: (1) ad hoc surveys targeting potential suitable habitats to determine species occurrence, (2) more ecological studies regarding its dispersal capacity, (3) establishment of more corridors and green bridges across roads for facilitating species movement or dispersal, and (4) minimization of local disturbances...|$|R

40|$|Himalayan Monal and Koklass were {{observed}} from three selected sites (Batandar, Anakar and Janshai) in winter about 7900 ft and 7500 ft and in summer 12381 ft and 10108 ft {{from the sea}} level respectively. The altitudinal migration of Himalayan Monal and Koklass from lower to upper elevated zones {{was the result of}} human activities and livestock grazing in summer season while their downward migration was the result of heavy snowfall in their natural habitats. The first nidification record was also observed in kalam valley during the study sites where three nests were detected one of <b>Monal</b> <b>pheasant</b> and two of Koklass pheasant. The Koklass nests were present on the ground at batandar (8620 ft), and Janshai (9305 ft) while the only nest of Himalayan Monal was observed in Janshai (9447 ft). The nesting behavior of Koklass was professionally like other birds but on the ground while the Monal nest was just like a temporary scrapes on the ground. Concluding from the study work that nests of these pheasants are mostly affected from local residents in early summer and foraging mostly from livestock. Awareness and education to the local villagers will help in conservation of habitats. The strict action of wildlife staff against poachers and illegal hunters will also be helpful for the conservation of these pheasants...|$|R
