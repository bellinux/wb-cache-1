40|$|LLM (Labour Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is {{dedicated}} to achieving social justice throughout the world. It specifically recognises the right to collective bargaining {{as one of the}} main drivers of its ambitions. It desires to achieve social justice through various Conventions and Recommendations. South Africa as a member of ILO constitutionally recognises the right to engage in collective bargaining. The Labour Relations Act (LRA) advocates for the establishment of bargaining councils in various sectors in the country to effectively recognise this right. This study predominantly focuses on the efficiency of these <b>councils</b> as <b>tools</b> for collective bargaining. The study is intended to ultimately provide a lesson to Lesotho. Trade unions in Lesotho’s garment industry are adamant that bargaining councils are the solution to the country’s collective bargaining woes. Specific attention is paid to the history of collective bargaining in the two countries to firstly indicate the inter relation of the bargaining framework in the two countries and to trace the origins of the bargaining councils in South Africa’s set up. The role of these councils is examined, with prime attention placed on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} industry level bargaining. The Constitutions of the National Textile Bargaining Council and The National Bargaining Council for the Manufacturing Industry are examined to determine the roles these councils play in the collective bargaining framework of South Africa. Attention is also paid to the procedures required for the establishment of these councils. The challenges facing this form of bargaining are also outlined, with prime attention being given to the cases in South African courts that are a potential threat to the bargaining council system in South Africa. The study culminates in conclusions on the bargaining framework in South Africa and provides recommendations on ways to improve the collective bargaining framework in the country. This subsequently provides a platform for the lessons that Lesotho should learn from the framework in South Africa. The study ultimately concludes that bargaining <b>councils</b> are efficient <b>tools</b> for the promotion of collective bargaining. They, however, are not a desirable solution for the collective bargaining problems faced in Lesotho’s context. Master...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Oregon's {{watershed}} councils are local, non-regulatory, collaborative forums {{charged with}} the recovery of endangered salmon and improving water quality under The Oregon Plan for Salmon and Watersheds. Private forest landowners, given their prominence is owning riparian areas, are central to success of these efforts. Using a statewide survey of watershed councils and in-depth qualitative data collection in three study areas (Central Oregon, North Coast, and South Coast), {{a case study of}} landowner involvement is developed and explored. Using a manuscript format, three manuscripts form the basis of the thesis. Manuscript 1 describes the status of Oregon's watershed councils and postulates the concept of spatial participation. This term describes a spatially-explicit aspect of social capital in people and institutions with control over resources of interest (e. g., land, authority, water rights, etc.) are able to effect change on the landscape. Manuscript 2 applies the concepts of world view and human values to woodland owners' interactions with watershed councils. Landowners apply four salient values [...] stewardship ethic, perception of others, need for control, and action-orientation [...] in deciding their relationship to watershed councils. Through this lens, watershed councils are seen as one of many opportunities for landowner involvement. Manuscript 3 takes the results of the first two and suggests policy and education tools to further the work of watershed <b>councils.</b> These <b>tools</b> include programs that target landowners and watershed councils, stress the role of capacity building, and realize that councils compete for scarce time.

40|$|A {{large number}} of food policy councils (FPCs) exist in the United States, Canada, and Tribal Nations (N = 278), yet there are no tools {{designed}} to measure their members' perceptions of organizational capacity, social capital, and council effectiveness. Without such tools, {{it is challenging to}} determine best practices for FPCs and to measure change within and across councils over time. This study describes the development, testing, and findings from the Food Policy <b>Council</b> Self-Assessment <b>Tool</b> (FPC-SAT). The assessment measures council practices and council members' perceptions of the following concepts: leadership, breadth of active membership, council climate, formality of council structure, knowledge sharing, relationships, member empowerment, community context, synergy, and impacts on the food system. All 278 FPCs listed on the Food Policy Network's Online Directory were recruited to complete the FPC-SAT. Internal reliability (Cronbach's 3 ̆b 1) and inter-rater reliability (AD, rWG(J), ICC [intraclass correlations][1], ICC[2]) were calculated, and exploratory and a confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Responses from 354 FPC members from 94 councils were used to test the assessment. Cronbach's 3 ̆b 1 ranged from 0. 79 to 0. 93 for the scales. FPC members reported the lowest mean scores on the breadth of active membership scale (2. 49; standard deviation [SD], 0. 62), indicating room for improvement, and highest on the leadership scale (3. 45; SD, 0. 45).

Therefore we wish to disclose initially how and why this line of thinking {{can be applied to}} an analysis of corporations even though Foucault in his theoretical work only regarded individuals as subjects. We wish to interrogate how technologies of power contribute to the shaping of Danish corporations as social responsible corporate subjects. The study is based on four technologies of power; the law regarding reporting requirements on corporate social responsibility, The Social Responsibility <b>Council,</b> online based <b>tools,</b> and partnerships between NGOs and corporations. In regards to each of these technologies of power it is examined how these various technologies with different approaches seek to promote a certain approach to and understanding of corporate social responsibility and to shape Danish companies in accordance to this. It is concluded that the social responsible corporate subject in Denmark comply with a business-driven social responsibility approach which requires the company to act according to the expectations of the stakeholders and to contribute to the solutions of societal challenges which is related to the companies capabilities.

40|$|If we analyse cities {{according}} to their morphogenesis we will notice how the urban space has massively dilated, fragmented and scattered. This work is framed within the research line focused on the quantitative analysis of the new urban morphologies and their evolution. The methodology includes the scanning of the settlement fabric in built-up areas characterized by a different density level and the analysis of their possible morphologic evolution. Local density measurements {{have been used in}} order to trace the frames via kernel density tools. A set of metrics linked to landscape ecology has been used in order to describe the potential dynamics of increase in such areas. The work underlines how the combined use of such spatial analysis techniques implemented in GIS environment can give us an answer to the issue of quantitative measurement in the field of settlement increase. The methodology here proposed has been tested on the settlement fabric in the town of Eboli (province of Salerno). The starting geographic data have been taken from a vectorial map on a scale of 1 : 5000, referring to the time thresholds 1984 and 2007. The only available attribute related to buildings event is the covered surface. Referring to the first phase, density maps have been assembled and through the previously set algoritm, which is articulated in selection and further aggregation rules, we obtained the maps representative of the four frames in relation to the two time thresholds. The methodology proposed here and tested on the <b>council</b> area provides <b>tools</b> which can analyse any settlement fabric and can study their change dynamics. The procedure requires no more than vectorial buildings representation among starting data. This does not imply that it gives a full answer to the issue, but, at least, it provides an early objective one, also valid to outline further insights...|$|R
30|$|Additional {{challenges}} {{for the use of}} in silico methods are that toxicological studies, to a large extent, are done by the industrial sector, and thus are used for registration as proprietary data and are not typically published or publicly available. This is especially true for the high-quality, standardized test data produced according to international test guidelines under quality assurance schemes such as Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). There was a pivotal change in the sharing and availability of such data, when for the first time, the European REACH legislation mandated that dossier summaries be published, making data readily available on a new scale. While this, together with the enormous testing demands of REACH [27, 28], stimulates the development of in silico approaches, the actual availability via the website of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) is cumbersome and not machine readable. At the same time, REACH has made study data a commodity as owners have to be reimbursed by other registrants, which has lowered the willingness to freely share data. In addition, an approach that aggregates the use of data for in silico approaches, which does not require legitimate access to study dossiers, is lacking. However, making these data available for the OECD (Q)SAR Toolbox [29] and the European Chemical Industry <b>Council’s</b> (CEFIC) AMBIT <b>tool</b> [30] signals a step towards data interpretation by ECHA. In order to make these most valuable data more broadly available, the information was downloaded in its entirety, organized in a database and made machine readable by natural language processing [31]. This new database, paralleled by the creation and release of various other smaller databases with legacy data, which will be combined in the future, enables the analysis of the chemical landscape, the assessment of performance of traditional tests, and the development of new tools [32]. Early examples demonstrate such uses for oral acute toxicity [33], eye irritation [34] and skin sensitization [35].|$|R
40|$|Burgeoning coastal development, {{recreational}} use, and {{the future}} affects of climate change are placing increasing strain on regulators to manage risk associated with coastal hazards. Low-lying coastal communities in particular are vulnerable {{to a range of}} natural hazards including coastal erosion, storm surge inundation, tsunami and water safety that come with varying levels of risk to life and property. New Zealand's coastal hazard monitoring network is patchy and resources are limited. As a consequence there is considerable potential for coastal communities are going to need to take {{a more active role in}} monitoring their environment and building data bases and knowledge that can be used to better manage their coast. This paper describes simple methodologies based on the needs of various community groups and sound science principles that can be used to monitor beaches and the coastal environment. By employing these <b>tools</b> <b>councils,</b> technical experts and community groups will be able to make better-informed decisions for managing activities in the coastal environment. One of the keys to the successful uptake of a monitoring programme by a community group is its relevance to the group. The programme and the tools provided must fit the interests, needs, capability and resources of the group. This project develops tools for coastal monitoring and targets coastal community groups such as Coast Care, Coastal Hapu, Secondary Schools, and Surf Life Saving Clubs. The monitoring methodologies have been developed in consultation with Tainui ki Whaingaroa hapu, Raglan Area School, and the Waikato Beach Care and Coast Care Bay of Plenty. Successful methodologies for measuring changes on the coast are also those that are matched to the type of beach, use appropriate equipment, collect structured data, provide data to which analysis can be applied, incorporate local knowledge of the environment, and feed results back to the community and other interested parties such as councils and science organisations. This project provides the target groups with simple monitoring methodologies, field forms/checklists, and appropriate survey and measurement equipment (which have undergone field trials) to carry out coastal monitoring. A web-based facility has been developed to input, check and store data; and provide immediate feedback using graphs and images. It also provides background information on coastal processes relevant to monitoring programmes. In this manner, a scientifically robust data set is collected and stored within a secure and future proofed archive, providing valuable information to coastal groups for years to come. Although the primary objective of this research is to develop a means for coastal communities to monitor changes in their environment, there are additional benefits associated with engaging communities in the study of their environment. These benefits include increasing awareness of coastal hazards, capacity building, providing valuable educational resources, and improving the temporal and spatial data coverage of information for the New Zealand coastline...|$|R
40|$|This paper brings {{together}} literature from behavioral economics, sociology, psychology and communication studies to reveal how civic actors, institutions, and decision-making processes have been traditionally understood, and how emerging media tools and practices are forcing their reconsideration. IntroductionAs digital communication technologies have {{evolved over the}} past few decades, the convergence of network structure and accessibility with hardware and software advances has allowed individuals to interact in various, even contradictory, ways. They can explore, hide, reach out, evaluate, connect, negotiate, exchange, and coordinate to a greater degree than ever before. Furthermore, this has translated to an ever-increasing number of users interacting with information in unprecedented ways and, due to device portability, in totally new physical locations. Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare update each other simultaneously across application platforms with near-real time photos and impressions of places; mobile exercise applications allow users to track their own movements as well as view where others in their geographic vicinity went running; Yelp users can read selective reviews from social network friends and strangers in their community on a specific restaurant; and Facebook friends can see what their peers bought, listened to, and read - from anywhere they are able to access the Internet.  Most of these apps update across platforms enabling both maximum reach across a user’s social group as well as a highly selective direction of information to a subset of their social network. Just as the rapidly evolving landscape of connectivity and communications technology is transforming the individual’s experience of the social sphere, what it means to participate in civic life is also changing, both in how people do it and how it is measured. Civic engagement includes all the ways in which individuals attend to the concerns of public life, how one learns about and participates in all of the issues and contexts beyond one’s immediate private or intimate sphere. New technologies and corresponding social practices, from social media to mobile reporting, are providing different ways to record, share, and amplify that attentiveness. Media objects or tools that impact civic life can be understood within two broad types: those designed specifically with the purpose of community engagement in mind (for instance, a digital game for local planning or an app to give feedback to city <b>council)</b> or generic <b>tools</b> that are subsequently appropriated for engaging a community (such as Twitter or Facebook’s role in the Arab Spring or London riots). Moreover, these tools can mediate any number of relationships between or among citizens, local organizations, or government institutions. Digitally mediated civic engagement runs the gamut of phenomena from organizing physical protests using social media (e. g., Occupy), to using digital tools to hack institutions (e. g., Anonymous), to using city-produced mobile applications to access and coproduce government services, to using digital platforms for deliberating.   Rather than try to identify what civic media tools look like in the midst of such an array of possibilities (by focusing on in depth examples or case studies), going forward we will instead focus on how digital tools expand the context of civic life and motivations for engagement, and what participating in civic life looks like in a digital era. We present this literature review as a means of exploring the intersection of theories of human behavior with the motivations for and benefits of engaging in civic life. We bring together literature from behavioral economics, sociology, psychology and communication studies to reveal how civic actors, institutions, and decision-making processes have been traditionally understood, and how emerging media tools and practices are forcing their reconsideration...|$|R
40|$|Deconstruction, {{at the end}} of {{the useful}} life of a building, {{produces}} a considerable amount of materials which must be disposed of, or be recycled / reused. At present, in New Zealand, most timber construction and demolition (C&D) material, particularly treated timber, is simply waste and is placed in landfills. For both technical and economic reasons (and despite the increasing cost of landfills), this position is unlikely to change in the next 10 – 15 years unless legislation dictates otherwise. Careful deconstruction, as opposed to demolition, can provide some timber materials which can be immediately re-used (eg. doors and windows), or further processed into other components (eg. beams or walls) or recycled (‘cascaded’) into other timber or composite products (e. g. fibre-board). This reusing / recycling of materials is being driven slowly in NZ by legislation, the ‘greening’ of the construction industry and public pressure. However, the recovery of useful material can be expensive and uneconomic (as opposed to land-filling). In NZ, there are few facilities which are able to sort and separate timber materials from other waste, although the soon-to-be commissioned Burwood Resource Recovery Park in Christchurch will attempt to deal with significant quantities of demolition waste from the recent earthquakes. The success (or otherwise) of this operation should provide good information as to how future C&D waste will be managed in NZ. In NZ, there are only a few, small scale facilities which are able to burn waste wood for energy recovery (e. g. timber mills), and none are known to be able to handle large quantities of treated timber. Such facilities, with constantly improving technology, are being commissioned in Europe (often with Government subsidies) and this indicates that similar bio-energy (co) generation will be established in NZ in the future. However, at present, the NZ Government provides little assistance to the bio-energy industry and the emergence worldwide of shale-gas reserves is likely to push the economic viability of bio-energy further into the future. The behaviour of timber materials placed in landfills is complex and poorly understood. Degrading timber in landfills has the potential to generate methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which can escape to the atmosphere and cancel out the significant benefits of carbon sequestration during tree growth. Improving security of landfills and more effective and efficient collection and utilisation of methane from landfills in NZ will significantly reduce the potential for leakage of methane to the atmosphere, acting as an offset to the continuing use of underground fossil fuels. Life cycle assessment (LCA), an increasingly important methodology for quantifying the environmental impacts of building materials (particularly energy, and global warming potential (GWP)), will soon be incorporated into the NZ Green Building <b>Council</b> Greenstar rating <b>tools.</b> Such LCA studies must provide a level playing field for all building materials and consider the whole life cycle. Whilst the end-of-life treatment of timber by LCA may establish a present-day base scenario, any analysis must also present a realistic end-of-life scenario for the future deconstruction of any 6 new building, as any building built today will be deconstructed many years in the future, when very different technologies will be available to deal with construction waste. At present, LCA practitioners in NZ and Australia place much value on a single research document on the degradation of timber in landfills (Ximenes et al., 2008). This leads to an end-of-life base scenario for timber which many in the industry consider to be an overestimation of the potential negative effects of methane generation. In Europe, the base scenario for wood disposal is cascading timber products and then burning for energy recovery, which normally significantly reduces any negative effects of the end-of-life for timber. LCA studies in NZ should always provide a sensitivity analysis for the end-of-life of timber and strongly and confidently argue that alternative future scenarios are realistic disposal options for buildings deconstructed in the future. Data-sets for environmental impacts (such as GWP) of building materials in NZ are limited and based on few research studies. The compilation of comprehensive data-sets with country-specific information for all building materials is considered a priority, preferably accounting for end-of-life options. The NZ timber industry should continue to ‘champion’ the environmental credentials of timber, over and above those of the other major building materials (concrete and steel). End-of-life should not be considered the ‘Achilles heel’ of the timber story...|$|R
