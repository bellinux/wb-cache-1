5|$|Hassett <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 117/2 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hit two hook shots from Hollies for four. Hassett was on 10.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} {{team for the}} Second Test at Lord's and elected to bat first after winning the toss. Johnson <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 5/216 on the first afternoon and struggled to score, making only four of the 30 runs added during his stay at the crease before falling at 7/246, caught behind from the bowling of Bill Edrich. However, Australia's lower order wagged and they eventually took the score to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
5|$|Australia reached 3/135 when Miller and Arthur Morris {{departed}} {{in quick}} succession. With Sid Barnes retiring hurt {{because of a}} blow to the ribs, Tallon <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 5/139, effectively six wickets down and made 18 in half an hour before falling at 6/172. Australia managed to reach 221 and avoid the follow on.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Bradman rested himself {{during the}} match against Northamptonshire, which started {{the day after}} the Test, as Hassett led Australia to victory by an innings. He {{returned}} for the match against Yorkshire. Bradman <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 1/0 when Barnes fell for a duck and top-scored with 54 as Australia made 249. Bradman pulled many short balls and reached 50 in 76 minutes. After the hosts replied with 209, Bradman <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 1/17 and put on 154 for the second wicket with Brown, ending with 86 as the match petered into a draw. His innings ended when Hutton caught him in the leg trap. Not wanting to tire his bowlers before the Second Test that started the day after next, Bradman showed little intent to win the match. The batsmen batted unhurriedly and set Yorkshire 329 for victory with only 70 minutes of play remaining and the hosts ended at 4/85. Yardley expressed his displeasure by allowing his part-timers to bowl and then promoting tail-enders to the upper half of the batting order in the second innings. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Poulton <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 1/9 {{after the fall}} of Villani {{at the end of the}} first over. She counter-attacked with Nitschke, scoring 39 runs herself from only 25 balls, {{including}} two sixes. The pair put on 58 from only 37 balls before Poulton was caught from the first ball of the eighth over. Australia collapsed and lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused, before completing a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Poulton <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 1/33 and hit 15 from 13 balls, including three fours. Australia finished on 7/133 and won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the top of their quartet.|$|E

5|$|Laker to {{this point}} had taken 3/22 from 12.4 overs. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would {{throughout}} the day. Yardley set a defensive field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. Brown <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> No. 5, but he had played {{most of his career}} as an opening batsman. Yardley took Laker out of the attack and took the second new ball. Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes but the run rate remained low. Australia passed England's total before Yardley brought himself on to bowl, trapping Brown leg before wicket in his first over. Hassett <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 185/4 and Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss, ending at 293/4, a lead of 128. Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes, with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets.|$|E
5|$|Removal {{of mines}} and {{obstacles}} from the beach, {{a job that}} had to be performed quickly before the tide <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 10:30, was the assignment of 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions and the eight dozer tanks. The teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles. The dozer tanks pushed the wreckage out of the way to create clear lanes for further landings.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon {{on the third}} day. Australia batted {{strongly}} and on the fourth day, Johnson <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 6/445, with Australia already ahead by 580. He made nine before his partner Ray Lindwall was stumped, which prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460. This left England a victory target of 596, which would require a world record run chase.|$|E

5|$|A Super Over eventuated, and Laura Marsh bowled for England. Healy <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 1/3 after Leah Poulton fell on {{the fourth}} ball. She hit a two from the fifth ball, and was run out by Jenny Gunn while {{attempting}} to complete a second run on the sixth and final ball of Australia's Super Over, leaving them at 2/6. England also ended with 2/6 after a run out {{in an attempt to}} secure the winning run on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the matchJess Cameron scored the solitary six.|$|E
5|$|After the Headingley Test, Loxton <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> 5/344 {{and made}} an attacking 51 as Australia batted first and made 456 against Derbyshire. He then took 1/27 from 17.4 overs in the first innings. Australia {{enforced}} the follow on and Loxton took the first wicket before returning to take two tail-end wickets and end with 3/16 from 13.4 overs as Australia won by an innings. Loxton was the most economical of the Australian wicket-takers. After six consecutive matches, Loxton was rested for the rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, which did not reach the second innings. The hosts were bowled out for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 195455 season, along with Neil, Ray was called into an Australian XI for a Test trial against Len Hutton’s touring English team, the closest that two Harveys came to playing in a Test for Australia together. Ray did not make an impact in the match, scoring only seven in his solitary innings, and was not {{selected}} for Australian duty. He <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> No. 4 after the dismissal of his brother. Ray was selected for all six of Victoria’s matches and played in all of these matches alongside Neil, as the domestic season was shortened and there were no scheduling clashes between the Tests and the domestic matches. Mick also played in all of Queensland's matches, and three brothers met in their states’ only meeting for the season.|$|E
5|$|Australia scored slowly, as Yardley {{employed}} leg {{theory to}} slow the scoring. Brown <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> No. 5, but he had played {{most of his career}} as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24. Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293/4, a lead of 128. Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes, with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Hassett thus played as vice-captain of Bradman's first-choice team and took a catch as Australia dismissed the hosts for 233. However, when Australia batted, Bradman rearranged the order and Hassett <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> No. 7 with Australia’s score at 5/320 after losing 4/55 in a middle-order collapse. Hassett made 25 in 66 minutes with three fours as Australia declared at 8/462; the hosts were bowled out for 212 to complete an Australian victory by an innings and 17 runs. Hassett was rested for next match against Leicestershire, which resulted in another innings win for the tourists.|$|E
