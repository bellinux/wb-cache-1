In 2011, the <b>Chief</b> <b>Deputy</b> of the Saline County Sheriffs Department was sentenced to prison for sexually abusing a high school student who was working as an intern.

5|$|George Stratton {{was born}} on September 26, 1865 to James Thompson Stratton, {{originally}} from Ossining, New York, and Cornelia A. Smith. His parents had met and married in New York in 1854, and settled back in Clinton, now East Oakland, California. James Stratton had been to California once before during the gold rush of 1850, sailing around North America and crossing by land the Panama stretch, but finding little gold. The senior Stratton traced his ancestry to the early settlers of the British settlements of America, and Cornelia Smith had Dutch and English forebears. James Stratton would live {{the rest of his}} life in California, pursuing a civil engineering career as County Surveyor for Alameda County in 1858–59 and later as the U.S. Surveyor-General of the state, and finally as <b>Chief</b> <b>Deputy</b> State Surveyor. An expert on the big Mexican land grants, he split up several of the Spanish deeds. One of his sons, Frederick, went to the University of California, today's Berkeley, and became a lawyer, state senator, and Collector of the Port of San Francisco, before killing himself on November 30, 1915. Another, Robert Thomas, became a doctor in Oakland and died after a long illness on May 6, 1924. The couple also had a daughter, Jeanne, the later Mrs. Walter Good.

5|$|Nonant was a great-nephew of John, Bishop of Lisieux, who {{had been}} the <b>chief</b> <b>deputy</b> in Normandy of King Henry I of England, and he was also a nephew of Arnulf of Lisieux, another bishop of Lisieux. Nonant had a brother Sylvester, who was {{treasurer}} of Lisieux. Hugh Nonant was a canon in his uncle Arnulf's cathedral chapter before serving as an archdeacon of the diocese of Lisieux from 1167 until 1184. Nonant served in the household of Thomas Becket while Becket was Archbishop of Canterbury, and went into exile with Becket, although he left Becket's service while the archbishop was in exile. While in Becket's service, Nonant may have authored a letter dated to 1165 that is attributed to Becket. Nonant had been reconciled to King Henry II of England by 1170. Along with Richard Barre, Nonant was named in January 1184 as a papal judge-delegate in a case between two Norman monasteries. In 1184, Nonant was sent by the king to the papal curia to petition Pope Lucius III on behalf of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Henry II's son-in-law. Nonant's success on this mission probably was the reason he was elevated to the episcopate in 1185.|$|E
