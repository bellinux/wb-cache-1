25|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are destined}} for {{other parts of}} the cell than the cytosol and a wide range of signalling sequences or (signal peptides) are used to direct proteins to where they are supposed to be. In prokaryotes this is normally a simple process due to limited <b>compartmentalisation</b> of the cell. However, in eukaryotes there is a great variety of different targeting processes to ensure the protein arrives at the correct organelle.|$|E
25|$|Provenzano's new {{guidelines}} were patience, <b>compartmentalisation,</b> coexistence with state institutions, and systematic infiltration of public finance. The diplomatic Provenzano tried {{to stem the}} flow of pentiti by not targeting their families, only using violence in case of absolute necessity. Provenzano reportedly re-established the old Mafia rules that had been abolished by Totò Riina under his very eyes when, together with Riina and Leoluca Bagarella, he was ruling the Corleonesi faction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Compartmentalisation</b> of {{the shore}} occurs {{where there are}} major {{obstacles}} or objects, especially headlands on deeply embayed coasts. The beaches that are the most enclosed {{are commonly known as}} pocket beaches. On these type of beaches the volume of sand remains constant and are closed compartments. Littoral cells can be defined as sediment within a coast that is circulated e.g. rip currents. Littoral cells usually develop on coast which are not impeded by headlands and where longshore currents are allowed to develop.|$|E
25|$|When {{functional}} proteins {{have been}} isolated, {{it is necessary}} that their genes are too, therefore a genotype-phenotype link is required. This can be covalent, such as mRNA display where the mRNA gene is linked to the protein at the end of translation by puromycin. Alternatively the protein and its gene can be co-localised by <b>compartmentalisation</b> in living cells or emulsion droplets. The gene sequences isolated are then amplified by PCR or by transformed host bacteria. Either the single best sequence, or a pool of sequences can be used as the template for the next round of mutagenesis. The repeated cycles of Diversification-Selection-Amplification generate protein variants adapted to the applied selection pressures.|$|E
25|$|Like most early tanks, the Schneider {{was built}} like a simple {{armoured}} box, without <b>compartmentalisation</b> of the inner space. It lacked a turret, with the main armament, a short 75mm cannon, in a sponson on the right side. By later standards it would therefore have been an assault gun instead of a tank. The vehicle was considered a very imperfect design, because of a poor layout, insufficient fire-power, a cramped interior and inferior mobility due to an overhanging nose section, which had been designed to crush through the belts of barbed wire but in practice caused the tank to get stuck. Improved designs were almost immediately initiated but the production of these, the Schneider CA 2, CA 3 and CA 4, was eventually cancelled.|$|E
500|$|By then, the {{positions}} of the two countries had reversed from what they were in 1941. The Americans had become suspicious that the British were seeking commercial advantages after the war, and Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who took over command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942, wanted to tighten security with a policy of strict <b>compartmentalisation</b> similar to the one that the British had imposed on radar. American officials decided that the United States no longer needed outside help. The Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, felt that since the United States was doing [...] "ninety percent of the work" [...] on the bomb, it would be [...] "better for us to go along for the present without sharing anything more than we could help". In December 1942, Roosevelt agreed to restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war, even if doing so slowed down the American project. In retaliation, the British stopped sending information and scientists to America, and the Americans then stopped all information sharing.|$|E
500|$|Particular {{veins of}} the DVS and the SVS are looked at. The great saphenous vein (GSV), {{and the small}} saphenous vein (SSV) are {{superficial}} veins which drain into respectively, the common femoral vein and the popliteal vein. These veins are deep veins. Perforator veins drain superficial veins into the deep veins. Three anatomic compartments are described (as networks), (N1) containing the deep veins, (N2) containing the perforator veins, and (N3) [...] containing the superficial veins, known as the saphenous compartment,. This <b>compartmentalisation</b> {{makes it easier for}} the examiner to systematize and map. The GSV can be located in the saphenous compartment where together with the Giacomini vein and the accessory saphenous vein (ASV) [...] an image resembling an eye, known as the 'eye sign' can be seen. The ASV which is often responsible for varicose veins, can be located at the 'alignment sign', where it is seen to align with the femoral vessels. Together with the GSV and the CFV these three veins create an image called the 'Mickey Mouse' sign. The examination report will include details of the deep and the superficial vein systems, and their mapping. The mapping is drawn on paper and then drawn on the patient before surgery.|$|E

50|$|The Featherston House is {{designed}} {{like an artist}} studio, and combines inspiration from a warehouse and loft. The house is famed {{for the design of}} its interior. Its interior comprises an indoor garden, combined with the suspension of four ‘floating’ platforms above the garden.

50|$|Initially, it {{was thought}} that mesosomes might play a role in several {{cellular}} processes, such as cell wall formation during cell division, chromosome replication, or as a site for oxidative phosphorylation. The mesosome was thought to increase the surface area of the cell, aiding the cell in cellular respiration. This is analogous to cristae in the mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells, which are finger-like protrusions and help eukaryotic cells undergo cellular respiration. Mesosomes were also hypothesized to aid in photosynthesis, cell division, DNA replication, and cell <b>compartmentalisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fire {{protection}} {{is the study}} and practice of mitigating the unwanted effects of potentially destructive fires.

In structures, be they land-based, offshore or even ships, the owners and operators are responsible to maintain their facilities in accordance with a design-basis that is rooted in laws, including the local building code and fire code, which are enforced by the Authority Having Jurisdiction.|$|E

With the widespread installation of fire sprinklers in the past 50 years, the reliance on PFP as the only approach was reduced.Lobby groups are typically divided into two camps favouring active or passive fire protection. Each camp tries to garner more business for itself through its influence in establishing or changing local and national building and fire codes.|$|E
