5|$|Fizeau's {{experiment}} is hence supporting {{evidence for the}} <b>collinear</b> case of Einstein's velocity addition formula.|$|E
5|$|The deltoid {{curve is}} {{another type of}} {{curvilinear}} triangle, but {{one in which the}} curves replacing each side of an equilateral triangle are concave rather than convex. It is not composed of circular arcs, but may be formed by rolling one circle within another of three times the radius. Other planar shapes with three curved sides include the arbelos, which is formed from three semicircles with <b>collinear</b> endpoints, and the Bézier triangle.|$|E
5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously <b>collinear,</b> meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
5|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large semi-major axis orbits at random orientations and initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into <b>collinear</b> groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. These surviving objects were in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned {{with respect to the}} massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The objects were also found to be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The perihelia of these objects were also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical of typical trans-Neptunian objects after several hundred million years. Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|For n ≥ 3, PGL(n, K) {{does not}} act 3-transitively, because it must send 3 <b>collinear</b> points to 3 other <b>collinear</b> points, not an {{arbitrary}} set. For n = 2 {{the space is}} the projective line, so all points are <b>collinear</b> and this is no restriction.|$|E
25|$|Two {{distinct}} points always {{determine a}} (straight) line. Three distinct points are either <b>collinear</b> or determine a unique plane. Four distinct points {{can either be}} <b>collinear,</b> coplanar or determine the entire space.|$|E
25|$|Three {{points are}} said to be <b>collinear</b> if they lie on the same line. Three points usually {{determine}} a plane, {{but in the case of}} three <b>collinear</b> points this does not happen.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumcircle}} {{of three}} <b>collinear</b> points {{is the line}} on which the three points lie, {{often referred to as}} a circle of infinite radius. Nearly <b>collinear</b> points often lead to numerical instability in computation of the circumcircle.|$|E
25|$|PGL sends <b>collinear</b> {{points to}} <b>collinear</b> points (it {{preserves}} projective lines), {{but it is}} not the full collineation group, which is instead either PΓL (for n > 2) or the full symmetric group for n = 2 (the projective line).|$|E
25|$|A general conic {{is defined}} by five points: given five points in general position, there is a unique conic passing through them. If three of these points lie on a line, then the conic is reducible, and {{may or may not}} be unique. If no four points are <b>collinear,</b> then five points define a unique conic (degenerate if three points are <b>collinear,</b> but the other two points {{determine}} the unique other line). If four points are <b>collinear,</b> however, then there is not a unique conic passing through them – one line passing through the four points, and the remaining line passes through the other point, but the angle is undefined, leaving 1 parameter free. If all five points are <b>collinear,</b> then the remaining line is free, which leaves 2 parameters free.|$|E
25|$|The three {{diagonal}} {{points of}} a complete quadrangle are never <b>collinear.</b>|$|E
25|$|There exist four points, no {{three of}} which are <b>collinear.</b>|$|E
25|$|A right {{degenerate}} triangle has <b>collinear</b> vertices, two {{of which}} are coincident.|$|E
25|$|The {{curve is}} a {{straight}} line {{if and only if}} all the control points are <b>collinear.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a triangle, three {{intersection}} points, each of {{an external}} angle bisector {{with the opposite}} extended side, are <b>collinear.</b>|$|E
25|$|The points a, b and c are <b>collinear</b> if {{and only}} if d(x,a) = d(c,a) and d(x,b) = d(c,b) implies x=c.|$|E
25|$|The three <b>collinear</b> Lagrange points (L1, L2, L3) were {{discovered}} by Leonhard Euler {{a few years}} before Lagrange discovered the remaining two.|$|E
25|$|If the six {{vertices}} of a hexagon lie alternately on two lines, {{the three}} points of intersection of pairs of opposite sides are <b>collinear.</b>|$|E
25|$|While the Sylvester–Gallai theorem {{states that}} an {{arrangement}} of points, not all <b>collinear,</b> must determine an ordinary line, it does not say how many must be determined.|$|E
25|$|In {{any given}} triangle, the {{circumcenter}} is always <b>collinear</b> with the centroid and orthocenter. The line that passes {{through all of}} them {{is known as the}} Euler line.|$|E
25|$|In a triangle, three {{intersection}} points, two of {{them between}} an interior angle bisector and the opposite side, and the third between the other exterior angle bisector and the opposite side extended, are <b>collinear.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are 42 ways of {{selecting}} a quadrangle of four cyclically ordered points no {{three of which}} are <b>collinear,</b> and four symmetries that fix any such ordered quadrangle. For each not-oriented quadrangle there are two cyclic orders.|$|E
25|$|As Paul Erdős observed, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem {{immediately}} {{implies that}} any set of n points {{that are not}} <b>collinear</b> determines at least n different lines. As a base case, the result is clearly true for n=3. For any larger value of n, {{the result can be}} reduced from n points to n1 points, by deleting an ordinary line and one of the two points on it. Thus, it follows by mathematical induction. The example of a near-pencil (a set of n1 <b>collinear</b> points together with one additional point that is not on the same line as the other points) shows that this bound is tight.|$|E
25|$|In a {{tangential}} quadrilateral ABCD with incenter I {{and where the}} diagonals intersect at P, let HX, HY, HZ, HW be the orthocenters of triangles AIB, BIC, CID, DIA. Then the points P, HX, HY, HZ, HW are <b>collinear.</b>|$|E
25|$|If the {{extensions}} of opposite sides in a tangential quadrilateral intersect at J and K, and the {{extensions of}} opposite sides in its contact quadrilateral intersect at L and M, then the four points J, L, K and M are <b>collinear.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are 7 ways of {{selecting}} a quadrangle of four (unordered) points no {{three of which}} are <b>collinear,</b> and 24 symmetries that fix any such quadrangle. These four points form the complement of a line, which is the diagonal line of the quadrangle.|$|E
25|$|In 1767 Euler found <b>collinear</b> motions, {{in which}} three bodies of any masses move proportionately along a fixed {{straight}} line. The circular restricted three-body {{problem is the}} special case in which two of the bodies are in circular orbits (approximated by the Sun–Earth–Moon system and many others).|$|E
25|$|Specifically, for n = 2 (a {{projective}} line), {{all points}} are <b>collinear,</b> so the collineation group {{is exactly the}} symmetric group of the points of the projective line, and except for F2 and F3 (where PGL is the full symmetric group), PGL is a proper subgroup of the full symmetric group on these points.|$|E
25|$|A related {{group is}} the collineation group, which is defined axiomatically. A collineation is an {{invertible}} (or more generally one-to-one) map which sends <b>collinear</b> points to <b>collinear</b> points. One can define a projective space axiomatically {{in terms of an}} incidence structure (a set of points P, lines L, and an incidence relation I specifying which points lie on which lines) satisfying certain axioms – an automorphism of a projective space thus defined then being an automorphism f of the set of points and an automorphism g of the set of lines, preserving the incidence relation, which is exactly a collineation of a space to itself. Projective linear transforms are collineations (planes in a vector space correspond to lines in the associated projective space, and linear transforms map planes to planes, so projective linear transforms map lines to lines), but in general not all collineations are projective linear transforms – PGL is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group.|$|E
25|$|These {{equations}} {{apply to}} a particle moving linearly, in three dimensions {{in a straight line}} with constant acceleration. Since the position, velocity, and acceleration are <b>collinear</b> (parallel, and lie on the same line) – only the magnitudes of these vectors are necessary, and because the motion is along a straight line, the problem effectively reduces from three dimensions to one.|$|E
25|$|If M1 and M2 are the {{midpoints}} of the diagonals AC and BD respectively in a {{tangential quadrilateral}} ABCD with incenter I, {{and if the}} pairs of opposite sides meet at J and K with M3 being the midpoint of JK, then the points M3, M1, I, and M2 are <b>collinear.</b> The line containing them is the Newton line of the quadrilateral.|$|E
25|$|Suppose that {{a finite}} set S of points {{is not all}} <b>collinear.</b> Define a {{connecting}} line to be a line that contains at least two points in the collection. By finiteness, there must exist a point P and a connecting line ℓ that are a positive distance apart but are closer than all other point-line pairs. We'll prove that ℓ is ordinary, by contradiction.|$|E
25|$|Elliptic curves {{carry the}} {{structure}} of an abelian group with the distinguished point as {{the identity of the}} group law. In a plane cubic model three points sum to zero in the group if and only if they are <b>collinear.</b> For an elliptic curve defined over the complex numbers the group is isomorphic to the additive group of the complex plane modulo the period lattice of the corresponding elliptic functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{restricted}} problem (both circular and elliptical) was {{worked on}} extensively by many famous mathematicians and physicists, most notably by Poincaré {{at the end}} of the 19th century. Poincaré's work on the restricted three-body problem was the foundation of deterministic chaos theory. In the restricted problem, there exist five equilibrium points. Three are <b>collinear</b> with the masses (in the rotating frame) and are unstable. The remaining two are located on the third vertex of both equilateral triangles of which the two bodies are the first and second vertices.|$|E
25|$|The {{triangle}} inequality {{states that the}} sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be {{greater than or equal to}} the length of the third side. That sum can equal the length of the third side only in the case of a degenerate triangle, one with <b>collinear</b> vertices. It is not possible for that sum to be less than the length of the third side. A triangle with three given positive side lengths exists if and only if those side lengths satisfy the {{triangle inequality}}.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to give a geometric description of some inversive planes, indeed, of all known inversive planes. An ovoid in PG(3,q) {{is a set of}} q2+1 points, no three <b>collinear.</b> It can be shown that every plane (which is a hyperplane since the geometric dimension is 3) of PG(3,q) meets an ovoid O in either 1 or q+1 points. The plane sections of size q+1 of O are the blocks of an inversive plane of orderq. Any inversive plane arising this way is called egglike. All known inversive planes are egglike.|$|E
