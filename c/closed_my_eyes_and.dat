500|$|Thunderball was {{the third}} James Bond score {{composed}} by John Barry, after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. The original title song was entitled [...] "Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics. Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's final note. Jones said of it, [...] "I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> I held the note for so long when I opened my eyes the room was spinning." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E

60|$|Days passed. When {{one morning}} I found the arbor vacant. Gone! A dream. I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> would have dreamed her back. In vain. Starting, I called upon her name; but none replied. Fleeing from the islet, I gained the {{neighboring}} shore, and searched among the woods; and my comrades meeting, besought their aid. But idle all. No glimpse of aught, save trees and flowers. Then Media was sought out; the event made known; and quickly, bands were summoned to range the isle.|$|E

60|$|Her {{perfectly}} {{black dress}} threw the ghastly hue of her strained, wild face into startling prominence, and her slender arms were stretched passionately upwards {{in a gesture}} full of intense dramatic pathos. Her eyes were fixed upon a small ebony crucifix which hung against the wall, and the words were bursting from her white, trembling lips, but whether of prayer or confession, I could not, or, rather, would not, hear, for I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{the sound of her}} voice reached me only in an indistinct moan. It was a sight which has lived in my memory and will never fade.|$|E
60|$|And I {{awoke to}} the old pain of the jacket in solitary. About me were the {{customary}} four: Warden Atherton, Captain Jamie, Doctor Jackson, and Al Hutchins. I cracked my face with my willed smile, and struggled not to lose control under the exquisite torment of returning circulation. I drank the water they held to me, waved aside the proffered bread, and refused to speak. I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> strove to win back to the chain- locked wagon-circle at Nephi. But so long as my visitors stood about me and talked I could not escape.|$|E

60|$|My {{method of}} {{mechanical}} hypnosis was {{the soul of}} simplicity. Sitting with folded legs on my straw-mattress, I gazed fixedly at a fragment of bright straw which I had attached {{to the wall of}} my cell near the door where the most light was. I gazed at the bright point, with my eyes close to it, and tilted upward till they strained to see. At the same time I relaxed all the will of me and gave myself to the swaying dizziness that always eventually came to me. And when I felt myself sway out of balance backward, I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> permitted myself to fall supine and unconscious on the mattress.|$|E
60|$|At first I {{thought that}} I {{was dead and}} lying in a tomb. Then by degrees I saw that I was in no tomb but in a darkened room that was {{familiar}} to me, my own room in Seti's palace at Tanis. It must be so, for there, near to the bed on which I lay, was my own chest filled with the manuscripts that I had brought from Memphis. I tried to lift my left hand, but could not, and looking down saw that the arm was bandaged like {{to that of a}} mummy, which made me think again that I must be dead, if the dead could suffer so much pain. I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> thought or slept a while.|$|E
60|$|He {{began to}} rave. Then I half swooned, and when sight and hearing fully {{returned}} I {{was lying in}} the cave on my blankets. A great lassitude weighted me down. The terrible thrashing about in the icy water had quenched my spirit. For a while I was too played out to move, and lay there in my wet clothes. Finally I asked leave to take them off. Bud, who had {{come back in the}} meantime, helped me, or I should never have got out of them. Herky brought up my coat, which, fortunately, I had taken off before the ducking. I did not have the heart to speak to Dick or look at him, so I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> fell asleep.|$|E

60|$|If {{that was}} not the old Sally Langdon I did not know who it was. Miss Sampson tried to appear offended, and Steele tried to look insulted, but they both failed. They could not have looked {{anything}} but happy. Youth and love were too strong for this couple, whom circumstances might well have made grave and thoughtful. They were magnet and steel, powder and spark. Any moment, right before my eyes, I expected them to rush right into each other's arms. And when they refrained, merely substituting clasped hands for a dearer embrace, I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> remembered them, as they would live in my memory forever, standing crushed together on the ridge that day, white lips to white lips, embodying all that was beautiful, passionate and tragic.|$|E
60|$|Monsieur, I {{assure you}} that at that moment my heart {{absolutely}} stood still. The tempter stood at my elbow and whispered, and I deliberately smothered the call of my conscience. I did what Joseph's brethren did, what brought Judas Iscariot to hopeless remorse. There was {{no doubt that the}} hue and cry was after the two elegantly dressed gentlemen whom I had seen enter the dilapidated house in the Rue Blanche. For a second or two I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> deliberately conjured up the vision of Mme. la Marquise fainting for lack of food, and of M. le Vicomte dying for want of sustenance; then I worked my way {{to the door of the}} shop and accosted the burly proprietor with as much boldness as I could muster.|$|E

Then I heard a snort of sudden awakening and alarm, and a cry, and I looked out. The Indian was hacking at Borg with a knife, and Borg was warding off with his arms and trying to grapple him. When they did grapple, Bella crept up from behind and threw her arm in a strangle-hold about her husband's neck. She put her knee into the small of his back, and bent him backward and, with the Indian helping, threw him to the floor." ...|$|E
