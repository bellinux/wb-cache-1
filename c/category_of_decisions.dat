50|$|It {{is clear}} that the {{businesses}} have the most influence in this chain effect. If a business fails, jobs are lost, citizens are unhappy, and the government party loses trust and their chance of reelection. One example of this was President Bush’s plummeting popularity and resulting defeat by Bill Clinton. Therefore, it would make sense for government officials to reach out to these executives and provide valuable resources to benefit both parties. Power is shifted from government officials to business executives, because these executives have the ability to influence government officials to meet their demands. As a result, a large <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> is turned over to businessmen, and taken off the agenda of government.

The purposes of this correlational, cross-sectional study were (a) to test the psychometric properties <b>of</b> the <b>Categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>Decision</b> Making Scale; and (b) to describe the perceptions of the mother/daughter dyad and the match of perceptions with a specified theoretical perspective. The major variables in the model included general and specific expectations, dyadic intimacy, partner's <b>decision</b> strategies, and <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> decision-making. The convenience sample consisted of 12 dyads, older mothers and caregiving daughters, in the community who received questionnaires by mail. A model of Perceptual Congruence of the Mother/Daughter of the Dyad was developed to examine the factors "WE" (agreement of the dyad members) and "I" (disagreement of the dyad members). Two methods of analysis were used to analyze the data, Multitrait-Multimethod (MTMM) and Factor Analytic Structural Equation Modeling (FASEM). Key findings indicated that the <b>Categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>Decision</b> Making scale demonstrated sufficient validity and reliability for describing the <b>decision</b> making <b>of</b> daughters and mothers for this small sample. The MTMM analysis demonstrated congruence, indicating agreement on the "WE" factor with dyadic intimacy, mothers' involvement in decision making, and confidence in mothers' decision making abilities. The FASEM models demonstrated "WE" agreement on the variables of dyadic intimacy and positive <b>decision</b> strategies. Comparison <b>of</b> both methods of analysis, MTMM and FASEM indicated mothers and daughters agreed only on dyadic intimacy. In this study, daughters perceived the mothers used more negative decision making strategies than the mothers perceived the daughters to use while making decisions. The daughters believed negative decision making strategies were caused by higher specific parental expectations and resulted in diminished intimacy between mother and daughter. In summary, there was agreement within the dyad on dyadic intimacy, but congruence was not found on expectations, <b>decision</b> strategies, or <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> decision-making.

40|$|Three main {{claims are}} made in this paper. First, {{it is argued that}} Onora O'Neill has {{uncovered}} a serious problem in the way medical ethicists have thought about both respect for autonomy and informed consent. Medical ethicists have tended to think that autonomous choices are intrinsically worthy of respect, and that informed consent procedures are the best way to respect the autonomous choices of individuals. However, O'Neill convincingly argues that we should abandon both these thoughts. Second, it is argued that O'Neill's proposed solution to this problem is inadequate. O'Neill's approach requires that a more modest view of the purpose of informed consent procedures be adopted. In her view, the purpose of informed consent procedures is simply to avoid deception and coercion, and the ethical justification for informed consent derives from a different ethical principle, which she calls principled autonomy. It is argued that contrary to what O'Neill claims, the wrongness of coercion cannot be derived from principled autonomy, and so its credentials as a justification for informed consent procedures is weak. Third, it is argued that we do better to rethink autonomy and informed consent in terms of respecting persons as ends in themselves, and a characteristically liberal commitment to allowing individuals to make certain <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> for themselves...|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of timber in the United States {{depends largely on}} forest management and investment <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> nonindustrial private forest landowners since they hold the largest share of forest land in the nation. Since NIPF landowners are so diverse, {{there is a need}} to better understand the determinants <b>of</b> their <b>decisions</b> so that policies could be in place to motivate them. A survey was carried out in 2005 to the nonindustrial private forest landowners of West Virginia to examine the factors affecting their forest management decisions. The study looked at four <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> related to forest management: timber harvest, silvicultural activities (i. e., tree planting, herbicide application, fertilization, thinning, grapevine control, and timber stand improvement), property management activities (i. e., road construction, road maintenance, surveying/boundary maintenance, and access control), and wildlife habitat management and recreation improvement activities. Four models were developed to examine factors affecting each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> forest management activity. The results showed that landowner, ownership, and management characteristics of NIPF landowners are associated with their forest management decisions. Specifically, age, education, profession, income, ownership size, period of forestland acquisition, distance of the forestland to the place of residence, whether the forestland was purchased or acquired through inheritance or as a gift, primary objective of forestland ownership, and presence of a written forest management plan were found to be significant determinants for at least one <b>of</b> the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> forest management activities.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I study the nature <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making under {{uncertainty}} {{in the case of}} natural catastrophes and reinsurance underwriting at Lloyd's of London. I begin by describing the broad context of natural catastrophes and society, which forms the basis for a market in catastrophe reinsurance. I then proceed to a review of literatures in risk, uncertainty, philosophy, and probability as a prelude to an analysis <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making under catastrophic risk. According to the early 20 th century philosopher-economist Frank Knight, risk specified those cases in which a frequency probability could be assigned, while situations of uncertainty do not allow a frequency probability since they are unique instances. In the thesis, I make the additional argument that risk and uncertainty are not solely <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> probability, but rather <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> probability and causality. The second main strand of the thesis refers to J. M. Keynes' work on probability which while related to frequency probability, is different in its emphasis on judgment and the assessment of information. I propose a causal framework to Keynes' weight of argument approach in terms of J. L. Mackie's causal field. With these two main ideas on probability and the addition of the causal field, the thesis presents the theoretical basis of its model <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making. The last component of the model is developed through a review and critique of the economic literature on decision making under uncertainty. As the literature is founded upon frequency probability definitions of risk, the thesis argues through its theoretical investigations that this approach neglects the causal element <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making, and that uncertainty requires a broader conceptualization than simply lack of probability. This final component, decision making routines, combines both individual and organizational elements. The empirical investigation of catastrophe risk underwriting at Lloyd's is organized into <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making within a situated market context. I investigate the dominant categories and find that capital capacity and relationships drive reinsurance praxis. As an integration of its theoretical and empirical components, the thesis applies its risk decision making model. This model has implications for economic geography studies of the firm, in that it provides an epistemic and organizational basis for the formalization of tacit knowledge. The model also holds consequences for economic decision making theory, in that it integrates causal assessment in the purely probability based economic paradigm. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overarching}} conceptual decision model that delineates the major issues and decisions associated with carbon regulations that will allow executives to better understand the potential regulatory schemes and implications that may be imposed in the near future. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use the extant literature as the foundation to develop a conceptual model <b>of</b> the <b>decisions</b> pertaining to climate change regulation that face business executives today. Findings – This paper suggests four major <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> issues that must be addressed in any climate change regulatory scheme. These include: “scope” – will carbon emission management systems be global or regional; “who pays” – will the consumer or will the supply chain be responsible for the cost of their emissions; “market or compliance-based mechanisms” – will the CO 2 emissions system be market-based or a compliance-based regulatory system; and “criteria” – how can credence of the remedy be established – what is necessary for a business initiative to qualify for as a creditable carbon offset? Research limitations/implications – This paper offers a framework that categories the fundamental decisions that must be made in any climate change regulation. This framework may be useful in advancing research into any <b>of</b> the four <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> and their implications on commerce and the environment. This paper is designed to be managerially useful and in that way does limit its ability to specifically advance many dimensions of research. Practical implications – The paper offers executives for a simple model <b>of</b> the <b>decisions</b> that must be made to craft an effective climate change regulatory scheme. In addition, it suggests how these decisions may create exploitable economic opportunities for innovative and proactive firms. Originality/value – This paper adds value to the debate by clarifying the decisions that must be addressed in any climate change regulation scheme. <br /...|$|R

While TOPSIS has been developed towards the use of Type- 2 Fuzzy Sets (T 2 FS), to date, the additional information provided by T 2 FSs in TOPSIS has been largely ignored since the final output, the Closeness Coefficient (CC), has remained a crisp value. In this paper, we develop an alternative approach to T 2 fuzzy TOPSIS, where the final CC values adopt an interval-valued form.

Specifically, we highlight the complex behaviour in terms of the relationship of the uncertainty levels and the outputs, including non-symmetric and non-linear growth in the CC intervals in response to linearly growing levels of uncertainty. As the first TOPSIS approach which provides an interval-valued output to capture output uncertainty, the proposed method is designed to reduce the loss of information and to maximize the benefit of using T 2 FSs.
