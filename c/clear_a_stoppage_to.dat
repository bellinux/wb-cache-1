50|$|On several {{occasions}} when Ali was inside and Young had {{his back to}} the ropes, Young would intentionally put his head or upper body out of the ring to compel the referee to separate the fighters. To some, Young's was a brilliant strategy of neutralizing his opponent's strengths and forcing the bout to be fought on his own terms, exposing Ali's inability to fight a counterpuncher. To others, it seemed cowardly as he forced <b>a</b> <b>stoppage</b> <b>to</b> the fight every time Ali held the advantage.|$|R

40|$|This thesis absorbs and {{reflects}} on Choiseul Island responses and caution towards {{the making of}} anthropological knowledge. Initial interests that can easily become familiar to anthropology as research topics such as village life, local cosmology and local alternatives to cosmologies of climate and ecology, make way here for another activity of working through Choiseul responses to anthropology. In taking seriously the precautions and the considerations {{of people in this}} Solomon Islands locality, anthropology is invited <b>to</b> put <b>a</b> <b>stoppage</b> <b>to</b> practices that it would consider ordinary and part of anthropological knowledge making. This impasse for the discipline is outlined and explored in various chapters, in which usual styles of ethnography and topic-making take formation in respect of a Choiseul world that does not fit easily into encapsulation by anthropology. Effects for the discipline of anthropology are given consideration, within a wider view of imagining how an alternative anthropology in the vernacular can also entail an obviation of anthropology itself in favour of new forms of cultural sensitivity...|$|R
