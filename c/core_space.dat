40|$|We present {{old and new}} {{characterizations}} of <b>core</b> <b>spaces,</b> alias worldwide web spaces, originally defined by the existence of supercompact neighborhood bases. The patch <b>spaces</b> of <b>core</b> <b>spaces,</b> obtained by joining the original topology with a second topology having the dual specialization order, are the so-called sector spaces, which have good convexity and separation properties and determine the original space. The category of <b>core</b> <b>spaces</b> is shown to be concretely isomorphic to the category of fan spaces; these are certain quasi-ordered spaces having neighborhood bases of so-called fans, obtained by deleting {{a finite number of}} principal filters from a principal filter. This approach has useful consequences for domain theory. In fact, endowed with the Scott topology, the continuous domains are nothing but the sober <b>core</b> <b>spaces,</b> and endowed with the Lawson topology, they are the corresponding fan spaces. We generalize the characterization of continuous lattices as meet-continuous lattices with T$_ 2 $ Lawson topology and extend the Fundamental Theorem of Compact Semilattices to non-complete structures. Finally, we investigate cardinal invariants like density and weight of the involved objects. Comment: 30 pages, 1 figure, 10 diagrams, conference on domain theor...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the Lawson {{compactness}} of function spaces for L-domains. A basic notion of property RW for <b>core</b> compact <b>spaces</b> is introduced, which is proved to have a close relation to the Lawson compactness of function spaces for continuous L-domains as following: (1) Every Lawson compact continuous dcpo has property RW (via the Scott topology) and for each continuous L-domain, Lawson compactness is equivalent to property RW;(2) Let P be a continuous dcpo with a least element. Then [X→P] is compact continuous for every <b>core</b> compact <b>space</b> X with property RW iff P is compact continuous L-domain;(3) Let X be a <b>core</b> compact <b>space.</b> Then [X→P] is compact for every compact continuous L-domain P iff X has property RW...|$|R

50|$|Architecturally, this is important, as {{double-deck}} elevators occupy less building <b>core</b> <b>space</b> {{than traditional}} single-deck elevators {{do for the}} same level of traffic. In skyscrapers, this allows for much more efficient use of space, as the floor area required by elevators tends to be quite significant. The other main technique is shared-shaft elevators, where multiple elevators use different sections of the same shaft to serve different floors, with skylobbies separating the sections.|$|E

50|$|The gallery {{was created}} to provide a {{permanent}} building as the <b>core</b> <b>space</b> for the second Yorkshire Fine Art and Industrial Exhibition of 1879, the first in 1866 occupied a temporary chalet in the grounds of Bootham Asylum. Following the 1879 exhibition the renamed Yorkshire Fine Art and Industrial Institution aimed to create a permanent art exhibition. It was given a major boost by the bequest of York collector John Burton (1799-1882) {{of more than one}} hundred 19th-century paintings, supplemented by gifts and in the early years two major temporary loan collections. In 1888 the north galleries were leased to York School of Art, which moved there in 1890 from Minster Yard.|$|E

The <b>core</b> <b>spacing</b> in the vertical direction was precisely {{controlled by the}} spin-coating of epoxy resin cladding with accurate viscosity control, while that in the lateral direction was determined precisely by using a photomask. The simultaneous coupling from the fan-out device to a seven-core MCF was successfully demonstrated. Next, we measured the offset loss characteristics of the cores of the LPW and calculated the spot size of the respective cores. The theoretical coupling losses evaluated from the spot size and the offset were as low as 0. 2 - 7. 5 dB...|$|R
40|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of function spaces is useful for identifying large cartesian closed categories of topological spaces and domains. We consider {{the question of what}} classes A of spaces should be paired with classes B of domains so that all function spaces [A B] are #-compact domains. We observe that in general the class B forms what we call a domain variety, a class of domains closed under products, continuous retracts, and Scott-closed subsets. Specific sample solutions are that <b>core</b> compact <b>spaces</b> are paired with bounded complete domains and a special class of locally connected <b>core</b> compact <b>spaces</b> called RW-spaces is paired with the class of #-compact pointed L-domains...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{vehicles}} now use {{the compact}} alternator layout. This is electrically and magnetically similar, but has improved air cooling. Better cooling permits more power from a smaller machine. The casing has distinctive radial vent slots {{at each end}} and now encloses the fan. Two fans are used, one at each end, and the airflow is semi-radial, entering axially and leaving radially outwards. The stator windings now consist of a dense central band where the iron core and copper windings are tightly packed, and end bands where the windings are more exposed for better heat transfer. The closer <b>core</b> <b>spacing</b> from the rotor improves magnetic efficiency. The smaller, enclosed fans produce less noise, particularly at higher machine speeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} {{designed}} for 1,000 students, with <b>core</b> <b>space</b> for 1,400. Among the 28 classrooms, special labs and technology spaces were planned for hands-on learning in computer engineering, chemistry, biology, biotechnology research, physics, and physical science. An open cafeteria space features ample natural lighting and high ceilings with exposed structural components. The exposed structure is continued throughout the main gymnasium, the auxiliary gym, and the school’s central circulation spine. The state-of-the-art auditorium, with seating for 800, features a movable wall to accommodate different uses. In addition to the typical functions of a school media center, the space has computer and classroom areas equipped with electronic whiteboards and network access, and multimedia workstation available for student use.|$|E
50|$|The Hearts of Space {{radio show}} {{has spawned a}} number of related projects, {{including}} the Hearts of Space Archive, a commercial ambient-music streaming service started in 2001, and a record label started in 1984, Hearts of Space Records (including 5 divisions, sub-labels or label imprints: Hearts of Space Records, for the <b>core</b> <b>space</b> music; Hearts O' Space, for Irish/Celtic albums; World Class, for world-music albums; Fathom, for sounding the deep, dark ambient albums by artists such as Robert Rich and Steve Roach; and RGB, for soundtrack and pop-oriented electronic albums). The record label released nearly 150 albums {{over the course of}} its existence; it also licensed and released European albums in the U.S. During the 1980s Hill also produced albums for other labels, such as those of Eckart Rahn (Celestial Harmonies, Fortuna Records, Kuckuck Schallplatten). In 2001, the label (and catalogue) was sold to Valley Entertainment. Stephen Hill, though no longer associated with the label's business side, continues to work on A&R and to produce new compilation recordings for the label.|$|E
5000|$|The Russian Space Agency {{is one of}} the {{partners}} in the International Space Station (ISS) program; it contributed the <b>core</b> <b>space</b> modules Zarya and Zvezda, which were both launched by Proton rockets and later were joined by NASA's Unity Module. The Rassvet module was launched aboard [...] and will be primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft. The Nauka module is the last component of the ISS, due to be launched in mid 2018. Roscosmos is furthermore responsible for expedition crew launches by Soyuz-TMA spacecraft and resupplies the space station with Progress space transporters. After the initial ISS contract with NASA expired, RKA and NASA, with the approval of the US government, entered into a space contract running until 2011, according to which Roscosmos will sell NASA spots on Soyuz spacecraft for approximately $21 million per person each way (thus $42 million to and back from the ISS per person) as well as provide Progress transport flights ($50 million per Progress as outlined in the Exploration Systems Architecture Study study [...] ). RKA has announced that according to this arrangement, manned Soyuz flights will be doubled to 4 per year and Progress flights also doubled to 8 per year beginning in 2008.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a growth {{technique}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) whose <b>core</b> and interlayer <b>spaces</b> were filled with Ni fine particles using discharge pyrolysis at gas/solid interface with optical-parametric-oscillation (OPO) laser beam assist. Transmission electron microscope observation reveals that CNTs were grown at around a cathode spot and, in most cases, Ni fine particles had 3 – 4 nm diameters. With decreasing the wavelength of OPO laser, G/D ratios obtained from Raman spectrum analysis increased gradually and, in fact, the structures of CNTs were improved from amorphous-like structures to the long and straight CNTs. For longer wavelengths (593 nm, 650 nm) of OPO laser, diameters of CNTs became thicker (typically 10 ~ 100 nm) and therefore, Ni nanowires were formed in the <b>core</b> <b>spaces</b> of CNTs. However, for shorter wavelength (456 nm, 507 nm), diameters of CNTs were significantly reduced and Ni fine particles were embedded in between CNT layers. It {{was found that the}} structures of CNTs strongly depend on both the magnitude of discharge current and the wavelength of OPO laser beam during the CNT growth...|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} of Hindu temples is also symbolic. The whole structure fuses the {{daily life and}} it surroundings with the divine concepts, through a structure that is open yet raised on a terrace, transitioning from the secular towards the sacred, inviting the visitor inwards towards the Brahma pada and temple’s central core, as well as lifting him upwards into a symbolic space marked by its spire (shikhara, vimana). The ancient temples had grand intricately carved entrances but no doors, and lacked a boundary wall. In most cultures, suggests Edmund Leach, a boundary and gateway separates the secular and the sacred, and this gateway door is grand. In Hindu tradition, this is discarded {{in favor of an}} open and diffusive architecture, where the secular world was not separated from the sacred, but transitioned and flowed into the sacred. The Hindu temple has structural walls, which were patterned usually within the 64 grid, or other geometric layouts. Yet the layout was open on all sides, except for the <b>core</b> <b>space</b> which had just one opening for darsana. The temple space is laid out in a series of courts (mandappas). The outermost regions may incorporate the negative and suffering side of life with symbolism of evil, asuras and rakshashas (demons); but in small temples this layer is dispensed with. When present, this outer region diffuse into the next inner layer that bridges as human space, followed by another inner Devika padas space and symbolic arts incorporating the positive and joyful side of life about the good and the gods. This divine space then concentrically diffuses inwards and lifts the guest to the core of the temple, where resides the main idol as well as the space for the Purusa and ideas held to be most sacred principles in Hindu tradition. The symbolism in the arts and temples of Hinduism, suggests Edmund Leach, is similar to those in Christianity and other major religions of the world.|$|E

40|$|The Information Science Experiment System (ISES) {{represents}} {{a new approach}} in applying advanced systems technology and techniques to on-board information extraction in the space environment. Basically, what is proposed is a 'black box' attached to the spacecraft data bus or local area network. To the spacecraft the 'black box' appears to be just another payload requiring power, heat rejection, interfaces, adding weight, and requiring time on the data management and communication system. In reality, the 'black box' is a programmable computational resource which eavesdrops on the data network, taking and producing selectable, real-time science data back on the network. This paper will present {{a brief overview of}} the ISES Concept and will discuss issues related to applying the ISES to the polar platform and Space Station Freedom. Critical to the operation of ISES is the viability of a payload-like interface to the spacecraft data bus or local area network. Study results that address this question will be reviewed vis-a-vis the solar platform and the <b>core</b> <b>space</b> station. Also, initial results of processing science and other requirements for onboard, real-time information extraction will be presented with particular emphasis on the polar platform. Opportunities for a broader range of applications on the <b>core</b> <b>space</b> station will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{response}} of the square honeycomb sandwich plates subjected to blast loading was simulated and analyzed by using the finite element software ABAQUS. With the given mass per unit area, <b>core</b> sheet <b>spacing</b> and height, the optimal relative density of the core was obtained under blast loading of three levels. With this optimal relative density, the sandwich plates have the best shock resistance ability and {{the top and bottom}} face sheets have the smallest deflection subjected to impulsive load. The sandwich plates were compared with the solid plates having the same mass per unit area. The results show that the sandwich plates have higher strength and energy absorption capability.
