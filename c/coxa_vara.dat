25|$|The {{angle of}} {{inclination}} formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> leads genu valgum. Additionally, a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle, the torsion angle, which {{makes it possible for}} flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head. Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility.|$|E
25|$|An {{osteotomy}} is {{a surgical}} operation whereby a bone is cut to shorten or lengthen it or {{to change its}} alignment.

50|$|This {{condition}} was first described in 1986. {{and is a}} syndrome of camptodactyly, arthropathy, <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> and pericarditis. It may also include congenital cataracts. The cause of this syndrome was discovered in 1999.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coxa</b> <b>vara</b> is a {{deformity}} of the hip, {{whereby the}} angle between {{the head and}} the shaft of the femur is reduced to less than 120 degrees. This results in the leg being shortened, {{and the development of}} a limp. It is commonly caused by injury, such as a fracture. It can also occur when the bone tissue in the neck of the femur is softer than normal, causing it to bend under the weight of the body. This may either be congenital or the result of a bone disorder. The most common cause of <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> is either congenital or developmental. Other common causes include metabolic bone diseases (e.g. Paget's disease of bone), post-Perthes deformity, osteomyelitis, and post traumatic (due to improper healing of a fracture between the greater and lesser trochanter). Shepherd's Crook deformity is a severe form of <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> where the proximal femur is severely deformed with a reduction in the neck shaft angle beyond 90 degrees. It is most commonly a sequela of osteogenesis imperfecta, Pagets disease, osteomyelitis, tumour and tumour-like conditions (e.g. fibrous dysplasia).|$|E

Gelastic cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone when the affected patient laughs, is also seen.|$|E
50|$|Children {{with this}} {{syndrome}} often present with a joint effusion that is cool and resistant to anti-inflammatory therapy. The arthropathy principally involves large joints such as elbows, hips, knees, and ankles.

If there is brachial plexus irritation with pain and numbness, excision of the clavicular fragments can be performed to decompress it. In case of open fontanelle, appropriate headgear may be advised by the orthopedist for protection from injury.|$|E
50|$|In early {{skeletal}} development, {{a common}} physis serves the greater trochanter {{and the capital}} femoral epiphysis. This physis divides as growth continues in a balance that favors the capital epiphysis and creates a normal neck shaft angle (angle between the femoral shaft and the neck). The corresponding angle at maturity is 135 ± 7 degrees. Another angle used for the measurement of <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> is the cervicofemoral angle which is approximately 35 degrees at infancy and increases to 45 degrees after maturity.|$|E
50|$|People {{with this}} {{condition}} are short-statured from birth, {{with a very}} short trunk and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. Curvature of the spine (scoliosis and lumbar lordosis) may be severe and can cause problems with breathing. Changes in the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may also {{increase the risk of}} spinal cord damage. Other skeletal signs include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), severe protrusion of the breastbone (pectus carinatum), a hip joint deformity in which the upper leg bones turn inward (<b>coxa</b> <b>vara),</b> and a foot deformity known as clubfoot.|$|E
50|$|Slipped capital femoral {{epiphysis}} (SCFE or skiffy, slipped upper femoral epiphysis, SUFE or souffy, <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> adolescentium) is {{a medical}} term referring to a fracture through the growth plate (physis), which results in slippage of the overlying end of the femur (epiphysis). Normally, {{the head of the}} femur, called the capital, should sit squarely on the femoral neck. Abnormal movement along the growth plate results in the slip. The femoral epiphysis remains in the acetabulum (hip socket), while the metaphysis (end of the femur) move in an anterior direction with external rotation.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{the large}} joints {{of the lower}} limb are aligned in a {{straight}} line, which represents the mechanical longitudinal axis of the leg, the Mikulicz line. This line stretches from the hip joint (or more precisely {{the head of the}} femur), through the knee joint (the intercondylar eminence of the tibia), and down {{to the center of the}} ankle (the ankle mortise, the fork-like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli). In the tibial shaft, the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide, but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6°, resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174° in a leg with normal axial alignment. A leg is considered straight when, with the feet brought together, both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching. Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis (intermalleolar distance exceeds 3 cm), and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis (intercondylar distance exceeds 5 cm). These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.The angle of inclination formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> leads genu valgum.

5000|$|His {{mobility}} and physical stamina were poor and deteriorated throughout his life. He suffered especially from deformed hip joints (due either to hip dysplasia or <b>coxa</b> <b>vara,</b> with secondary osteoarthritis). However, he scampishly disguised his limitations by telling tall tales that a gullible press eagerly reported as the truth. Various accounts {{describe him as}} an aviator, skydiver, judo master, football player, and concert pianist, despite clear evidence on film of a severe, waddling limp, permanently flexed limbs, and gnarled fingers. In published interviews, he did hint at his childhood limitations both in football—"I was a great passer"—and in baseball: [...] "I wasn't a very fast runner. I had to depend on sliding." [...] Working in New York, Dunn reportedly accrued masses of parking tickets, since disabled drivers had no special privileges. He also received human transport from friend and stuntman Dean Selmier, who often carried Dunn on his shoulders {{through the streets of}} Manhattan.|$|E
50|$|The head of femur, which articulates {{with the}} {{acetabulum}} of the pelvic bone, composes two-thirds of a sphere. It {{has a small}} groove or fovea, connected through the round ligament {{to the sides of}} the acetabular notch. The head of the femur is connected to the shaft through the neck or collum. The neck is 4-5 cm. long and the diameter is smallest front to back and compressed at its middle. The collum forms an angle with the shaft in about 130 degrees. This angle is highly variant. In the infant it is about 150 degrees and in old age reduced to 120 degrees in average. An abnormal increase in the angle is known as coxa valga and an abnormal reduction is called <b>coxa</b> <b>vara.</b> Both the head and neck of the femur is vastly embedded in the hip musculature and can not be directly palpated. In skinny people with the thigh laterally rotated the head of the femur can be felt deep as a resistance profound (deep) for the femoral artery.|$|E
50|$|People with spondyloepiphyseal {{dysplasia}} are short-statured from birth, {{with a very}} short trunk and neck and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. This type of dwarfism {{is characterized by a}} normal spinal column length relative to the femur bone. Adult height ranges from 0.9 meters (35 inches) to just over 1.4 meters (55 inches). Curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis and lordosis) progresses during childhood and can cause problems with breathing. Changes in the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may also increase the risk of spinal cord damage. Other skeletal signs include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), a hip joint deformity in which the upper leg bones turn inward (<b>coxa</b> <b>vara),</b> and an inward- and downward-turning foot (called clubfoot). Decreased joint mobility and arthritis often develop early in life. Medical texts often state a mild and variable change to facial features, including cheekbones close to the nose appearing flattened, although this appears to be unfounded. Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth, which is called a cleft palate. Severe nearsightedness (high myopia) is sometimes present, as are other eye problems that can affect vision such as detached retinas. About one-quarter of people with this condition have mild to moderate hearing loss.|$|E
30|$|<b>Coxa</b> <b>vara</b> is a {{radiological}} term {{describing a}} decrease in the neck–shaft angle to 120 ° or less. <b>Coxa</b> <b>vara</b> is associated with pathomechanical changes that can manifest clinically.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to define the {{acetabular}} changes associated with <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> and determine how these acetabuli differ from those of a normal hip. Charts and radiographs of 33 patients with <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> with a mean age of 6  years (range, 2 – 15  years) were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnosis was developmental <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> in 21 patients and congenital femoral deficiency in 12. Radiographic measurements, including acetabular index, sourcil slope, center edge angle, migration index, and medial joint space, were compared with those of 29 hips in the control group. The inclination of the acetabulum or acetabular slope (as measured by the acetabular index and sourcil slope) was significantly increased in the hips with <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> as compared with those in the control group. Both parameters have a statistically significant inverse correlation with the degree of varus, ie, the greater the varus of the proximal femur, the greater the upsloping of the acetabulum. Joint subluxation, as measured by the center edge angle, migration index, and medial joint space, showed little difference from that of control subjects...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coxa</b> <b>vara</b> worsens as it evolves, and {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by other femoral deformities, such as hypometria, axial knee deviations, and rotational deformity. Traditional surgical techniques, especially intracapsular femoral neck osteotomy, are difficult to execute and often cause joint stiffness while not sufficiently correcting the <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> or the other deformities, in particular hypometria. For these reasons this study used the external circular fixator to simultaneously correct these deformities. The results are presented after discussion of technical detail...|$|E
