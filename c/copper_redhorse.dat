50|$|The <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> (Moxostoma hubbsi) is a North American {{species of}} {{freshwater}} fish in the Catostomidae family.It is found only in Canada.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> occurs {{primarily}} in medium-sized rivers where water temperatures exceed 20°C in summer. Spawning occurs in riffle {{areas where the}} current is moderate to slow and the depth ranges between 0.75 and 2 m, over fine to coarse gravel and cobble substrate. Like its congeners, young-of-the-year <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> spend their first growing season in shallow shoreline areas no more than 1.5 m deep, characterized by gentle slopes, vegetation, a very slow current and fine substrate (mix of clay-silt and sand).|$|E
50|$|During {{the last}} decade, several {{methods have been}} {{implemented}} to protect endangered species. These projects include 2001, the fish ladder Vianney-Legendre which was built to help fish to pass the dam canal Saint-Ours. Named to honor the memory of Vianney-Legendre, renowned ichthyologist, the structure of an innovative nature {{has been designed to}} accommodate different species of fish, especially those threatened. This scale can even be used to raise awareness of the endangered species recovery. In 2002, the wildlife refuge Pierre-Étienne-Fortin (naturalist who first described the <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse)</b> was created to protect a breeding <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse.</b> Access to the refuge is prohibited during the breeding season which runs from late June to late July. Finally, every summer since 2006, as part of a patrol project established by the Committee for consultation and development of the basin of the River (COVABAR) sensitizing agents plying the river in order to inform boaters the precarious situation of the <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> and remind them regulations and measures in place to protect her.|$|E
50|$|The Richelieu River {{is home to}} {{more than}} fifty species of fish. Many of them are {{considered}} threatened or endangered as <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse,</b> river redhorse and sturgeon. One of the last spawning of <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> (Moxostoma hubbsi), a species endemic in Quebec is also found in the river. Other species, such as goby, are exogenous. In fact, they come from an external medium and were accidentally introduced into the ecosystem, often water discharge ballast vessels that ply the St. Lawrence River. Considered harmful or invasive, they colonize the water, funds and compete with native species (local) and a threat to the integrity of the ecosystem river.|$|E
50|$|To date, {{there are}} only two known {{spawning}} grounds (Chambly archipelago and the channel downstream from the Saint-Ours dam) and a nursery area (Saint-Marc-sur-Richelieu) has been identified in the Richelieu River. Very recently, the presence of <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> has again been reported in the Lavaltrie-Contrecoeur sector of the St. Lawrence River. The reasons for its presence in this stretch of the river in the spring and early summer (pre-spawning congregation, spawning or migration route) and fall (wintering grounds) could not be determined. High quality <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> habitat is in decline. Its apparent extirpation from the Yamaska and Noire rivers is closely linked to environmental degradation.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{biological}} {{characteristics of the}} <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse,</b> such as its longevity, late age of sexual maturity, late spawning activities and specialized diet, make it unique among its congeners. However, they also contribute, in some respects, to making it more vulnerable. Since the waters inhabited by the <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> {{are located in the}} most densely populated areas of Quebec, anthropogenic factors come into play. The nature of those factors cannot, however, be determined with certainty and act in combination. The degradation and fragmentation of its habitat and its low spawning success are believed to be key reasons for its decline. Contamination, siltation, eutrophication, introductions of non-native species, dam construction (which impedes the free passage of fish) and the disturbance of spawners on spawning sites all constitute possible factors in the species' decline.|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} of the <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> {{is not limited to}} scientific and ecological considerations. It extends to social values, sustainable development and biodiversity conservation. In some respects, the species is an indicator of the impact of human activity on the ecosystems of southern Quebec. Public interest in the species is not only strong but continues to grow.|$|E
50|$|The Richelieu, {{which is}} {{home to more than}} 50 species of fish, offers {{excellent}} sport fishing opportunities. Important sport species include northern pike, longnose gar, bowfin, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, carp, and black crappie. But the Richelieu also hosts several threatened or endangered species, such as the <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse,</b> river redhorse, and lake sturgeon, so fishing seasons and capture limits are regulated.|$|E
5000|$|... five genera and twenty-two {{species of}} fish, {{including}} Allodontichthys hubbsi, Astyanax hubbsi (Mexican cave fish), Colpichthys hubbsi, Coregonus hubbsi (Ives Lake cisco), Cottus hubbsi, Gambusia hubbsi, Gobiomorphus hubbsi (bluegill bully), Gymnothorax hubbsi, Lampanyctus hubbsi, Lampetra hubbsi (Kern brook lamprey), Leucichthys hubbsi, Malacoctenus hubbsi (Redside blenny), Merluccius-hubbsi (Argentine hake), Moxostoma hubbsi (<b>copper</b> <b>redhorse),</b> Notropis hubbsi, Novumbra hubbsi (olympic mudminnow), Oryzias hubbsi, Pteronotropis hubbsi (bluehead shiner), Rosenblattichthys hubbsi (Hubbs' pearleye), Strongylura hubbsi ...|$|E
50|$|Its {{extremely}} small range, which {{is restricted to}} a few rivers in the lowlands of southwestern Quebec, has contracted significantly {{in the past few}} decades. Confirmed populations currently exist in the St. Lawrence and Richelieu rivers. Rivière des Mille Îles likely supports a remnant population. The <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> is one of seven species of the genus Moxostoma (family Catostomidae) occurring in Canada. Its discovery has been attributed to Vianney Legendre in 1942, but it appears to have been first described by Pierre Fortin in 1866 as an already known species of the genus Moxostoma.|$|E
50|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{provide evidence}} that the species was more abundant at various times in the past. Since the mid-1980s, its abundance relative to the other species in the genus has declined significantly. The {{population is aging and}} recruitment is extremely low. Compared to its congeners, the relative abundance of young-of-the-year <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> in the Richelieu River, the only river in which spawning is confirmed, is 0.35% or less. The upward shift in size distribution values in the past 30 to 40 years is significant. There have been virtually no catches of juveniles aged 2+ years in the last 30 years. The total number of mature individuals appears to be several thousand at the most.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{invasive}} species and increasing human presence {{are not only}} responsible for the fragility of some populations. According to {{a report from the}} Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP) conducted in 1998, the presence of pollutants and toxic agents in the waters of the river is also a [...] "stressful" [...] for fish. In several places in the river, a disturbing proportion of fish (over 13%) had abnormalities, which would signal a [...] "precarious state of health" [...] of the community ichthyological. However, the significant presence of fish-eating fish and some vulnerable species such as banded killifish, brought MDDEP to maintain the integrity index fish [...] "average" [...] (except in the Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, where he was considered [...] "low"). Chub black chin, stonecat and lamprey East are also part of sentinel species in the watershed of the Richelieu River, like <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse,</b> whose presence is an indication of the quality of water and aquatic. The data presented in the 1998 report are still used as a reference in 2011.|$|E
40|$|Ontogeny can {{be studied}} either in terms of size and shape changes (i. e., {{traditional}} view of heterochrony) or developmental sequences. However, only {{a few studies have}} focused on the caudal skeleton of catostomid species and its developmental sequence value in systematics especially among closely related taxa. The early ontogenetic development of the caudal skeleton of the endangered catostomid <b>copper</b> <b>redhorse</b> (Moxostoma hubbsi, Ostariophysii, Moxostomatini) endemic to south eastern Canada and two closely related sympatric species, M. anisurum and M. macrolepidotum, was studied with cleared and double stained specimens. This study provides the first morphological description of the caudal skeleton of M. hubbsi as well as its developmental sequences (i. e., chondrification and ossification sequences). Congruence between chondrification and ossification sequences is tested intraspecifically and interspecifically for the three Moxostoma species. Intraspecific comparisons exhibit a weak congruence between both sequences for each Moxostoma species. There is a strong interspecific congruence among chondrification sequences and among ossification sequences. Phylogenetic and functional constraints might be responsible for the canalization of the chondrification and ossification sequences. Because of the weak intraspecifi...|$|E
