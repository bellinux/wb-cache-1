50|$|Scagliola is a {{composite}} substance made from selenite, glue and natural pigments, imitating marble and other hard stones.

40|$|We {{present a}} new BSSRDF {{representation}} for editing measured anisotropic heterogeneous translucent materials, such as <b>veined</b> <b>marble,</b> jade, artificial stones with lighting-blocking discontinuities. Our work {{is inspired by}} the SubEdit representation introduced in [1]. Our main contribution {{is to improve the}} accuracy of the approximation while keeping it compact and efficient for editing. We decompose the local scattering profile into an isotropic term and an anisotropic term. The isotropic term encodes the scattering range and albedo property, and the anisotropic term encodes the spatial-variant subsurface scattering shape profile. We propose a compact model for the scattering profile based on non-negative matrix factorization, which allows user-guided editing. Experimental results have shown that our model can capture more spatial-anisotropic features than the previous work with similar compression rate.

She looked such an exquisite picture of proud and self-reliant womanhood, as she stood there, tall and erect, the stiff folds of her white satin gown surrounding her like a frame of ivory round a dainty miniature. Tears of enthusiasm were in her eyes, her lips were parted with a smile of encouragement, her graceful head, thrown slightly back and crowned with the burnished gold of her hair, stood out in perfect relief against the soft-toned gold and <b>veined</b> <b>marble</b> of the walls.|$|R

6000|$|... § XXXIX. The {{school of}} {{architecture}} which we have just been examining is, {{as we have seen}} above, redeemed from severe condemnation by its careful and noble use of inlaid marbles as a means of color. From that time forward, this art has been unknown, or despised; the frescoes of the swift and daring Venetian painters long contended with the inlaid marbles, outvying them with color, indeed more glorious than theirs, but fugitive as the hues of woods in autumn; and, at last, as the art itself of painting in this mighty manner failed from among men,[7] the modern decorative system established itself, which united the meaninglessness of the <b>veined</b> <b>marble</b> with the evanescence of the fresco, and completed the harmony by falsehood.|$|R
50|$|The work of {{building}} the resplendent Mezquita employed thousands of artisans and labourers, and such a vast undertaking {{led to the development}} of all the resources of the district. Hard stone and beautifully <b>veined</b> <b>marble</b> were quarried from the Sierra Morena and the surrounding regions of the city. Metals of various kinds were dug up from the soil, and factories sprang up in Córdoba amid the stir and bustle of an awakened industrial energy. A famous Syrian architect made the plans for the Mosque. Leaving his own house on the edge of Córdoba, the Emir came to reside in the city, so that he might personally superintend the operations and offer proposals for the improvement of the designs. Abd al-Rahman moved about among the workers, directing them for several hours of every day.|$|R
