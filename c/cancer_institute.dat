5|$|RTI {{scientists}} Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani synthesized anti-cancer treatments camptothecin in 1966, {{from the}} bark of the Camptotheca tree, and Taxol in 1971, from a Pacific yew tree. These two drugs account for $3 {{billion a year in}} sales by pharmaceutical companies. In 1986, RTI was awarded a $4 million contract with the National <b>Cancer</b> <b>Institute</b> to conduct an eight-year clinical trial on the effects of an anti-smoking campaign.

Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.|$|E
