We find that the long-range quantum and classical corrections to the spin-independent piece and the spin–orbit <b>coupling</b> <b>piece</b> of the scattering amplitude and the scattering potential are universal for different spin configurations, which leads us to propose this universality to be true for arbitrary spins. Furthermore, we give the leading corrections to the spin–spin coupling, and a comparison with scattering in QED is made...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We have {{recently}} installed removable shielding on a CTI HR C {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) scanner, and have evaluated {{its effect on the}} noise-effective count (NEC) rate during typical brain studies. This removable shielding system, known as the “NeuroShield, ” consists of a U-shaped lead plate attached to the removable headrest with a plastic <b>coupling</b> <b>piece.</b> The NEC was calculated from information obtained in the “head curves ” collected during three different types of study: 1) from subjects undergoing 60 -min 250 -MBq II C-Raclopride studies in different bed positions with the NeuroShield in place; 2) from subjects undergoing bolus IS O-water activation studies, with injected activities ranging from 170 to 750 MBq.; and 3) from subjects undergoing glucose utilization studies first without, then with the NeuroShield in place. During the Raclopride studies, the NeuroShield was slightly more effective when placed forward of the field of view (FOV). NEC improvements of up to 24 % in the early frames were obtained with the NeuroShield in place. The NEC values during bolus water studies improved by up to 45 % with additional shielding. The percentage of random counts diminished during the fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) studies from 17 % to 12 %/ 100 MBq of injected activity and the NEC value improved by 5 % for a 100 -MBq dose.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{shielding}} against out-of-field scattered radiation is not very effective on whole body PET scanners operated with their slice-defining septa retracted. Additional shielding can be employed during neurological studies since the diameter of the head is much less than the field of view required for imaging the human torso. We have designed, built and tested (on the CTI HR+ PET scanner) a new lead-plate shielding system which mounts on the scanner's removable head-rest. We call this device the "NeuroShield". The outer diameter of the 9 mm thick lead plate is 550 mm which has a "U" shaped hole 220 mm in diameter. It is positioned just above the subject's shoulders. A moulded plastic <b>coupling</b> <b>piece,</b> produced by stereolithography, was designed to accommodate the complex shape of the headrest under the subject's neck, and provide a flat surface for mounting the lead plate. Our testing on human subjects involved comparing the prompt and random count rates and dead time during bolus-water activation studies. Scans on different subjects, (matched for age and sex) with no additional shielding, with the CTI Neurological Insert, and with the NeuroShield were compared. The random counts were reduced by a factor of 1. 56 when using the permanent CTI Neurological Insert, and 1. 44 using the NeuroShield. The NeuroShield is easily removed to allow whole body scanning. It can remain in place as the couch extends through the scanning tunnel in the gantry. Its main application will be at PET centres doing a mixture of whole body and neurological studies, where the CTI Neurological Insert cannot be installed permanently...|$|E

In this paper, we show how the notion of factoring can be extended as well to preference components of the stochastic model. We examine updateable-state utility, a flexible class of expected utility models that permit stochastic trees to be rolled back much {{in the manner of}} decision trees. We show that preference summaries for updateable-state utility can be factored out of the stochastic tree. In addition, we examine utility decompositions which can arise when factors in a stochastic tree are treated as attributes in a multiattribute utility function. expected utility, medical decision making, stochastic trees, multiattribute utility, time preference, quality-adjusted lifetime...|$|R

40|$|Transaction {{processing}} {{is a key}} constituent of the IT workload {{of commercial}} enterprises (e. g., banks, insurance companies). Even today, in many large enterprises, transaction processing is done by legacy "batch" applications, which run offline and process accumulated transactions. Developers acknowledge the presence of multiple loosely <b>coupled</b> <b>pieces</b> of functionality within individual applications. Identifying such pieces of functionality (which we call "services") is desirable for the maintenance and evolution of these legacy applications. This is a hard problem, which enterprises grapple with, and one without satisfactory automated solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel static-analysis-based {{solution to the problem}} of identifying services within transaction-processing programs. We provide a formal characterization of services in terms of control-flow and data-flow properties, which is well-suited to the idioms commonly exhibited by business applications. Our technique combines program slicing with the detection of conditional code regions to identify services in accordance with our characterization. A preliminary evaluation, based on a manual analysis of three real business programs, indicates that our approach can be effective in identifying useful services from batch applications...|$|R
