A two-page <b>color</b> <b>picture</b> of the thin pillar coupe and pictures of the again standard bench seat interior were included along with equipment descriptions. Tom McCahill tested the car and recorded a 0–60 time of 9.5 seconds and a top speed of 110mph.

Vinyl tops, as with previous years, were standard fare with the California's distinctive GS logo on the sail panel.|$|E

40|$|In {{learning}} English, it {{is necessary}} to possess a large number of words in order to construct proper sentences, and vocabulary {{has been one of the}} most important components to master. Introducing vocabulary would be better done in the childhood since in the early beginning; it is possible and easy for kids to absorb fresh material given by the teacher. In teaching vocabulary to young learners, there are various techniques which can be used. Two of them are <b>colored</b> <b>pictures</b> and storytelling techniques. Teaching vocabulary using storytelling can make learning experiences more concentrated realistic or dynamic to children. Besides, using <b>colored</b> <b>pictures</b> technique can ease the children to remember words by recognizing details, shapes, sizes, and colors. Therefore, this study is conducted in order to know the effectiveness of <b>colored</b> <b>pictures</b> and storytelling techniques in teaching vocabulary to the third graders of elementary schools students. The writer conducted a quasi-experimental study with pretest- posttest design. The writer used two classes of the third graders of private Elementary School in Surabaya as the subject of the study. In order to know the effects of those two techniques on the students’ vocabulary achievement, the writer administered vocabulary test in a form of multiple- choice test with 30 items to the students. It was used for the pretest and posttest for experimental and control groups. Both groups were also given different treatment which was conducted in three times. <b>Colored</b> <b>pictures</b> was conducted in experimental group while storytelling in control group. The data was collected from the pretest and posttest. The writer subtracted the posttest with the pretest score in order to get gain score of both groups. Then the writer analyzed the gain score using t-test. The result showed that there was no significant difference on students’ vocabulary achievement between students who are taught by using <b>colored</b> <b>pictures</b> technique and those who are taught using storytelling technique. It is then concluded that the <b>colored</b> <b>pictures</b> was as effective as the storytelling technique in term of improving vocabulary achievement to the third grade of elementary school students...|$|R
