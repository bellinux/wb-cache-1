40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{measured}} coke reactivity index (CRI) and coke strength after reaction (CSR) {{determined in}} experiments based on coke formed in pilot-scale coke ovens {{are the two}} main parameters that are employed to evaluate coke for its potential utilization in the blast furnace. Thermoplasticity, such as swelling, permeability and fluidity, chemical reactions, such as the evolution of gases and tars, and thermal changes, such as heat of devolatilisation and thermal conductivity, on coal heating are known to dominate the transformation of coal to coke in the coke oven, and determine the CRI and CSR of coke. Coal properties, such as vitrinite and inertinite components, and coking conditions, such as heating rate and particle size, have also been found to influence the physical, chemical and thermal properties during coking. Many studies have previously investigated the swelling of different coals and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates {{as well as the}} influence of heating rate and particle size on swelling during coking. The literature has highlighted the correlations between swelling, mass loss and the properties of the released tars and gases for a range of coals and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates using a number of techniques. However, the correlations between swelling and the dynamic evolution of total volatiles (gases and tars), and the physical and chemical properties of the evolved tars, are made from data collected from independent experiments and therefore the interpretations are not very clear. Previous work compared heat of devolatilisation between thermal coals and coking coals. For coking coals only, the differences in heat of devolatilisation and thermal conductivities between high fluidity and low fluidity coking coals also were studied. However, reasons for the differences in the thermal properties of different coals are still unclear. In particular, the effects of <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> components on heat of coal devolatilisation and thermal conductivity are still unknown. The potential associations of swelling and thermal changes with the properties of tars for coals and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates are scarcely studied. The main objectives of this study are therefore to identify the sequence of physical, chemical and thermal changes of heating coal and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates to provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms in the transformation of coal to coke. This work in particular is focused on (a) separation of <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates without using chemicals; (b) simultaneous measurements of swelling and thermal changes of heating coal and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates from a single experimental run; (c) characterising the dynamic evolution of gases and tars for difference <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates; (d) revealing the mechanisms in the transformation of coal to coke thereby correlating the physical, chemical and thermal changes of coal and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates. To achieve the objectives, three novel techniques were employed. A water based device called the Reflux Classifier was employed to separate <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates on the basis of varying settling rates of different density particles. The existing Computer Aided Thermal Analysis (CATA) technique was modified to simultaneously estimate swelling and shrinkage, permeability, apparent volumetric specific heat and thermal conductivity of heating coal and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates. Swelling and shrinkage of the heating coal and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates were measured by the contraction and expansion of a compressible spring. The permeability of heating coal pellet was estimated based on Darcy’s law by the measurements of swelling of coal sample bed and the pressure drop of gas flowing through the coal sample bed. The pressure drop of gas flowing through the coal sample bed was measured using a pressure sensor. Endothermic and exothermic behaviour of heating samples was evaluated based on the estimated apparent volumetric specific heat. The apparent volumetric specific heat and thermal conductivity were estimated by the measurements of the control, surface and centre temperatures of the heating sample. A new technique, Dynamic Elemental Thermal Analysis (DETA), was used to measure the evolution of total volatiles, gases and tars from different <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> components. The released tars of maceral concentrates during devolatilisation were condensed using a tar condenser, while the residual tars in char were extracted using solvents of acetone and toluene. The physical properties, such as boiling point, and chemical properties, such as elemental compositions, for condensable and extracted tars also were evaluated using the DETA technique...|$|E

Coal macerals were produced with the vitrinite content varying from 91. 2 % to 26. 1 % for the 106 – 212 μm particle size fraction and 96. 0 % to 38. 2 % for the 212 – 500 μm particle size fraction. Thermo-swelling of <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates were evaluated by the Computer Aided Thermal Analysis (CATA) technique with extended volumetric measurements. This novel CATA technique allows the apparent specific heat, thermal conductivity, and transient volumetric swelling of the coal sample to be measured simultaneously, {{as a function of}} temperature. The experimental results indicated that the maximum swelling (∼ 510 °C) and high-temperature contraction (600 – 1000 °C), as well as exothermic heat during primary devolatilization and thermal conductivity at maximum swelling all increased with vitrinite content, with the data inferring a linear relationship, and was independent of particle size, when <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> concentrates contain more than 63 % vitrinite.

40|$|Petrographic {{investigations}} of tropical peat deposits from the Tasek Bera Basin, Malaysia, show that petrographic methods can contribute valuable information about paleoecological settings of mire deposits. Comparing modern peat-forming environments and the pre-maceral composition of peat samples allows {{the reconstruction of}} paleoecological conditions, such as floral composition, fires, microbial activity, etc., and gives insight into paleodepositional environments. In the past, maceral ratios of coals {{have been used to}} interpret paleodepositional settings of coal deposits. Such a procedure assumes that coal texture and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> composition are dictated solely by the depositional environment, and thus different depositional environments should be clearly discriminated based on maceral ratios. In the modern peat deposits of Tasek Bera, divergent petrographic results occur in similar depositional environments, hence, poor correlation occurs between the petrography, the degree of decomposition, and the depositional environment. Furthermore, from the time of peat deposition, peat is subject to considerable alteration. During subsequent diagenesis, preservation of structured and strongly altered material, such as inertinite, gelified material or funginite, is favoured and results in biased <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> compositions.

The apparent specific heat was determined during heating using an inverse calorimetric method (computer aided thermal analysis, CATA) and combined with pressure and displacement measurements to correlate endothermic and exothermic behaviour with measurement of swelling. The second technique used a post-oxidation stage to combust the tars and gases into products which were analysed.

40|$|Most {{of the new}} {{processes}} {{involving the}} utilisation of coal are based on hydroliquefaction, {{and in order to}} assess the suitability of the various coals for this purpose and to characterise coals in general, it is desirable to have a detailed and accurate knowledge of their chemical constitution and reactivity. Also, in the consumption of coals as chemical feed stocks, as in hydroliquefaction, it is advantageous to classify the coals in terms of chemical parameters as opposed to, or in addition to, carbonisation parameters. In view of this it is important to realise the functional groups on the coal hydrocarbon skeleton. In this research it was attempted to characterise coals of various rank (and subsequently their macerals) via methods involving both microwave-driven and bench top derivatisation of the hydroxyl functionalities present in coal. These hydroxyl groups are predominantly in the form of hindered phenolic groups, with other alcoholic groupings being less important, in the coals studied here. Four different techniques were employed, three of which - stannylation, silylation and methylation - were based on in situ analysis. The fourth technique - acetylation - involved derivatisation followed by analysis of a leaving group. The four different techniques were critically compared and it is concluded that silylation is the most promising technique for the evaluation of the hydroxyl content of middle rank <b>coals</b> and <b>coal</b> <b>macerals.</b> Derivatisation via stannylation using TBTO was impeded due to the large steric demand of the reagent and acetylation did not successfully derivatise the more hindered phenolic groups.

Experiments of devolatilization were performed in inert gas (N 2) at atmospheric pressure and in batch-type hot-wire screen reactor. The mass-loss values of both coals at selected final reaction temperatures (300 - 900 °C) and retention times (3 - 28 s) were obtained. Anthony and Howard's kinetic model was applied over two temperature ranges (300 - 500 and 700 - 900 °C).

Measurements of swelling and bed permeability were made, with continuous quantitative elemental analysis of gases and tars as they evolved. Data for two coal concentrates of high and moderate vitrinite indicate that the same reactions and events are occurring for the two samples, but to a greater extent for the high vitrinite sample. The research has noted the significance of evolved tars in the early events, being the lowest temperature event identified, with rapid tar evolution prior to the onset of swelling associated with permeability change. Further tar release and gas evolution is associated with a rapid swelling event, this event being substantially greater for the high vitrinite sample. The data has also quantified contraction at higher temperatures following swelling which is associated with the release of hydrogen containing gases. Evolved tars from the high vitrinite sample showed elevated H/C ratio indicating that vitrinite tars appear to be more aliphatic than those evolved from inertinite.

Ash particle formation mechanisms are particularly sensitive to changes in pressure as they are related to the structure of coal char particles at early stages of combustion. ^ To assess the importance of pressure on ash particle formation, pyrolyzed chars and ash particles from pressurized pulverized combustion of two bituminous and one subbituminous U. S. coals at operating pressures up to 30 atm were studied. Pressure changes the distribution of char particle types, changing the spatial distribution of the minerals during the combustion process and therefore affecting particle formation mechanisms. Chars were examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and classified into two different types (cenospheric and solid) depending on porosity and wall thickness. A correlation for estimating the amount of these cenospheric char particles was then proposed for bituminous coals based on the operating conditions and <b>coal</b> <b>maceral</b> analysis. ^ The ash particle size distribution of the coals combusted at different operating pressures was measured using Computer Controlled Scanning Electron Microscopy (CCSEM). The results of the char characterization and ash particle size distribution measurements were then incorporated into an ash particle formation algorithm that was proposed and implemented. The model predicts ash particle size and composition distributions at elevated pressures under conditions of complete char burnout. Ash predictions were calculated by first developing char structure distribution functions based on coal characteristics. To obtain an ash particle size distribution, carbon is then allowed to react away while following coalescence, fragmentation and other transformation processes as combustion proceeds. Particle size distributions calculated with this model showed qualitative agreement with the trends identified in the experimental portion of this research. ...|$|E
40|$|Attenuated total {{reflectance}} micro-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometry {{has been}} successfully used to characterise <b>coal</b> <b>macerals,</b> in particular telocollinite, and to investigate changes in the aromatic and aliphatic functional groups in the telocollinite, over a wide rank range (Rvmax from 0. 39 to 3. 52 %) in coals from the Bowen Basin, Queensland, Australia. The results show that ATR-FTIR is very sensitive to the increasing aromaticity (the fraction of carbon atoms involved in aromatic units) of the telocollinites, and thus is a very useful tool to study the evolution of aromatic and aliphatic functional groups with maturation of telocollinite, and also to differentiate and characterise the various <b>macerals</b> in <b>coal</b> samples. In comparison with other micro-FTIR techniques, ATR-FTIR has many advantages: (1) no difficult and time-consuming procedures are required to obtain “pure ” maceral separations, or for preparation of thin coal slices; (2) the ATR-FTIR spectra have better signal-to-noise ratio and increased sensitivity; (3) the ATR-FTIR spectra are similar to absorption spectra, but without significant spectral distortion...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{describes}} {{the mode of}} occurrences of Labuan Cenozoic coals as observed {{in the field and}} identifies the <b>coal</b> <b>macerals</b> based on their organic petrographic characteristics as observed under reflected white light and blue light excitation. In this study some sedimentological aspects such as the depositional environment were correlated with the organic petrological characteristics of the coals. Based on the organic petrographic features and the thermal maturity as determined by vitrinite reflectance some new stratigraphic associations have been identified. Similarities in sedimentological and organic petrological characteristics suggest that the shaly strata associated with carbonaceous sandstones exposed on the north-western part of Labuan Island and the outcrop exposed in the south within the east Kiam Sam Peninsula belong to the same sequence within the Setap Shale Formation. Based on petrographic characteristics described and vitrinite reflectance values obtained from this study, at least four distinct units that are associated with coal-bearing sediments can be recognized. Strata with vitrinite reflectance (VR,...|$|R
5000|$|During the First World War, Stopes {{was engaged}} in studies of coal for the British government, which culminated {{in the writing of}} [...] "Monograph on the {{constitution}} of coal" [...] with R.V. Wheeler in 1918. The success of Stopes' work on marriage issues and birth control led her to reduce her scholarly work; her last scientific publications were in 1935. According to W. G. Chaloner (2005), [...] "between 1903 and 1935 she published a series of palaeobotanical papers that placed her among the leading half-dozen British palaeobotanists of her time". Stopes made major contributions to knowledge of the earliest angiosperms, the formation of coal balls and the nature of <b>coal</b> <b>macerals.</b> The classification scheme and terminology she devised for coal are still being used. Stopes also wrote a popular book on palaeobotany, [...] "Ancient Plants" [...] (1910; Blackie, London), in what was called a successful pioneering effort to introduce the subject to non-scientists.|$|R
