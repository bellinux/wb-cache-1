25|$|One of {{the main}} {{missions}} of the aircraft is border patrol under the SIVAM programme. On 3 June 2009, two Brazilian Air Force Super Tucanos, guided by an Embraer E-99, intercepted a Cessna U206G engaged in drug trafficking activities. Inbound from Bolivia, the Cessna was intercepted {{in the region of}} Alta Floresta d'Oeste, and after exhausting all procedures, one of the Super Tucanos fired a warning shot from its 12.7mm machine guns, after which the aircraft followed the Super Tucanos to Cacoal airport. This incident was the first use of powers granted under the Shoot-Down Act, which was enacted in October 2004 to legislate for the downing of illegal flights. A total of 176kg of pure <b>cocaine</b> <b>base</b> paste, enough to produce almost a ton of cocaine, was discovered on board the Cessna; the aircraft's two occupants attempted a ground escape before being arrested by federal police in Pimenta Bueno.|$|E
500|$|Antoine Jones owned {{a nightclub}} in the District of Columbia; Lawrence Maynard managed the club. In 2004, a joint Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Metropolitan Police Department task force began {{investigating}} Jones and Maynard for narcotics violations.

This device tracked the vehicle's movements 24 hours a day for four weeks. [...] The FBI arrested Jones in late 2005, at which time Jones was represented by criminal defense attorney A. Eduardo Balarezo of Washington, D.C. [...] Balarezo filed multiple motions on Jones' behalf, including the motion to suppress the GPS data. [...] This motion formed the basis for Jones' appeals. [...] The government tried Jones {{for the first time in}} late 2006, and after a trial lasting over a month, a federal jury deadlocked on the conspiracy charge and acquitted him of multiple other counts.

5000|$|Crack cocaine is {{frequently}} purchased already in rock form, {{although it is}} not uncommon for some users to [...] "wash up" [...] or [...] "cook" [...] powder cocaine into crack themselves. This process {{is frequently}} done with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), water, and a spoon. Once mixed and heated, the bicarbonate reacts with the hydrochloride of the powder <b>cocaine,</b> forming free <b>base</b> <b>cocaine</b> and carbonic acid (H2CO3) in a reversible acid-base reaction. The heating accelerates the degradation of carbonic acid into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. Loss of CO2 prevents the reaction from reversing back to <b>cocaine</b> hydrochloride. Free <b>base</b> <b>cocaine</b> separates as an oily layer, floating on the top of the now leftover aqueous phase. It is at this point that the oil is picked up rapidly, usually with a pin or long thin object. This pulls the oil up and spins it, allowing air to set and dry the oil, and allows the maker to roll the oil into the rock-like shape.|$|R

40|$|Background: Fetal drug {{addiction}} {{is a serious}} public health problem. In the United States 10 to 15 % of children have been exposed "in utero" to cocaine. In a Chilean public health service, more than 200 offspring of <b>cocaine</b> free <b>base</b> abuser have been detected. Aim: To analyze the clinical and social features of 100 children exposed to <b>cocaine</b> free <b>base</b> during fetal development. Patients and methods: Clinical features of children born from <b>cocaine</b> free <b>base</b> consume mothers were described at birth. During subsequent follow up, growth and development, disease episodes, developmental alterations and social situation were recorded. Data was compared with other newborns from the same health service. Results: Compared to their normal counterparts, exposed children has a lower birth weight, the frequency of premature babies was thrice higher, and small-for-gestational age children were four times more common. There was also a higher prevalence of cardiac malformations, seizures and apnea. Hospital admissions were more frequent, prolonged and required more complex facilities. During follow up, undernutrition and stunting were more prevalent. Psychomotor retardation was present in 67 % of children and behavioral disturbances in 93 %. Most of these children are governmental protection.

40|$|The {{discovery}} and preclinical development of selective dopamine reuptake inhibitors as potential pharmacothera-pies for treating cocaine addiction are presented. The studies {{are based on}} the hypothesis that a dopamine reuptake inhibi-tor is expected to partially substitute for cocaine, thus decreasing cocaine self-administration and minimizing the craving for cocaine. This type of indirect agonist therapy has been highly effective for treating smoking addiction (nico-tine replacement therapy) and heroin addiction (methadone). To be an effective pharmacotherapy for cocaine addiction, the potential drug must be safe, long-acting, and have mini-mal abuse potential. We have developed several 3 -phenyl-tropane analogs that are potent dopamine uptake inhibitors, and some are selective for the dopamine transporter relative to the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. In animal studies, these compounds substitute for cocaine, reduce the intake of cocaine in rats and rhesus monkeys trained to self-administer cocaine, and have demonstrated a slow onset and long duration of action and lack of sensitization. The 3 -phen-yltropane analogs were also tested in a rhesus monkey self-administration model to defi ne their abuse potential relative to <b>cocaine.</b> <b>Based</b> on these studies, 3 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 2 -[3 -(4 ’-methylphenyl) isoxazol- 5 -yl]tropane (RTI- 336) has been selected for preclinical development.

40|$|Crack cocaine (free-base cocaine) smokers {{belong to}} a {{subgroup}} of marginalized drug users exposed to severe health risks and great social harm. Detection of the urinary, pyrolytic biomarker methylec-gonidine (MED) and its metabolite ecgonidine (ED) secures an unam-biguous confirmation of crack cocaine smoking. Although prevalence studies of <b>cocaine</b> <b>based</b> upon self-reporting may not be accurate, laboratory analysis is seldom used for neither diagnostic purpose nor early identification of crack cocaine smoking, which is far more severe than snorting cocaine. A new analytical method was validated for MED, ED and other relevant cocaine metabolites using automated liquid handling and column switching coupled to liq-uid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Limit of quanti-fication was 30 ng/mL for ED and MED. This method was applied in a laboratory study of urine samples (n 5 110) from cocaine users in Denmark subjected to routine drugs-of-abuse testing. Crack cocaine smoking was confirmed {{by the presence of}} MED and/or ED. Eighty-four samples (76. 4 %) were found positive for crack cocaine smoking in this group of problematic cocaine users. MED was only detected in 5. 9 % of the positive samples. The study shows a prevalence 3 -fold higher to that recently suggested by European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. We therefore advocate that the urinary biomarkers MED and ED are included in routine testing methods for clinical toxicology. This may lead to an earlier identification of crack cocaine smoking and possibly prevent a more severe drug use...|$|R
