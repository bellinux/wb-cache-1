40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} use of ocular testing to determine the toxicity of lunar dust. The OECD recommendations are reviewed. With these recommendations in mind the test methodology was to use EpiOcular, tissues derived from normal human epidermal keratinocytes, the cells {{of which have been}} differentiated on cell culture inserts to form a multi-layered structure, which closely parallels the corneal epithelium and to dose the tissue with 100 mg dust from various sources. The in-vitro study provides evidence that lunar dust is not severely <b>corrosive</b> <b>or</b> <b>irritating,</b> however, in vitro tests have limitations, and in vivo tests provides a more complete scenario, and information, it is recommended that in vivo tests be performed...|$|E
40|$|No {{quantitative}} {{data on the}} dermal absorption kinetics of heptachlor were identified. A mathematical model predicted heptachlor {{is not likely to}} be absorbed through the skin. However, acute toxicity studies in rats [Gaines 1960, 1969] showed that the chemical has the potential to be absorbed through the skin, systemically available, and toxic following acute dermal exposure. No studies were identified that evaluated the potential of heptachlor to be <b>corrosive</b> <b>or</b> <b>irritating</b> to the skin or be a skin sensitizer. A structure- activity relationship model predicted heptachlor to be negative for skin irritation, but a plausible skin sensitizer. Skin sensitization potential predicted by the model highlights testing for this endpoint as an important data gap. Therefore, on the basis of these assessments, heptachlor is assigned a composite skin notation of SK: SYS. Table 3 summarizes the skin hazard designations for heptachlor previously issued by NIOSH and other organizations. The equivalent dermal designation for heptachlor, according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, is Acute Toxicity Category 3 (Hazard statement: Toxic in contact with the skin) [European Parliament 2008].
