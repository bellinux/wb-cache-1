50|$|Comfrey (also comphrey) is {{a common}} name for plants in the genus Symphytum. Comfrey species are {{important}} herbs in organic gardening. It {{is used as a}} fertilizer and as an herbal medicine. The most commonly used species is Russian comfrey Symphytum ×&thinsp;uplandicum, which is a cross or hybrid of Symphytum officinale (<b>common</b> <b>comfrey)</b> and Symphytum asperum (rough comfrey).|$|E
50|$|Symphytum officinale is a {{perennial}} flowering plant {{of the genus}} Symphytum in the family Boraginaceae. Along with thirty four other species of Symphytum, it is known as comfrey. To differentiate it from {{other members of the}} genus Symphytum, this species is known as <b>common</b> <b>comfrey</b> or true comfrey. Other English names include Quaker comfrey, cultivated comfrey, boneset, knitbone, consound, and slippery-root. It is native to Europe and it is known elsewhere, including North America, as an introduced species and sometimes a weed. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees.|$|E

50|$|Symphytum is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Boraginaceae. Its species are known by the <b>common</b> name <b>comfrey.</b> There are up to 35 known species. Some species and hybrids, particularly S. officinale and S. × uplandicum, are used in gardening and herbal medicine.|$|R
50|$|In modern herbalism, comfrey is most {{commonly}} used topically. Some experts say that comfrey should be restricted to topical use, and should never be ingested, as it contains dangerous amounts of hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Studies associating comfrey with veno-occlusive disease (VOD), do not differentiate between Russian and <b>common</b> <b>comfrey,</b> plants with very different levels of PAs. VOD can in turn lead to liver failure, and comfrey has been implicated {{in at least one}} death, though the type of comfrey being consumed, and other dietary, physiological and pharmacodynamic factors were not accounted for. In 2001, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a ban of comfrey products marketed for internal use, and a warning label for those intended for external use. In addition to restrictions on oral use, some experts recommend applying comfrey extracts no longer than 10 days in a row, and no more than 4-6 weeks a year.|$|E
5000|$|The site {{is thought}} to be the last {{remaining}} example of a Thames valley hay meadow in Surrey. It contains a range of lime-loving (calcicole) plants which are characteristic of this type of meadow. The grassland is dominated by rough-stalked meadow grass Poa trivialis, crested dog’s-tail grass Cynosurus cristatus, and lesser knapweed Centaurea nigra. Yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, meadow-fescue grass Festuca pratensis, meadow barley Hordeum secalinum, smooth hawk’s-beard Crepis capillaris and common reed Phragmites australis are locally abundant, the last species being unusual in such dry situations. Other frequent species include meadow brome Bromus commutatus, a grass only recorded from one other Surrey location in recent years, meadow foxtail grass Alopecurus pratensis, Yorkshire-fog grass Holcus lanatus, pepper saxifrage Silaum silaus and meadow-sweet Filipendula ulmaria. Associated calcicole species include meadow cranesbill Geranium pratense, clustered bell-flower Campanula glomerata, cowslip Primula veris, hoary plantain Plantago media, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor and lady’s bedstraw Galium verum.The meadow is surrounded by old hedgerows with a variety of species such as ash Fraxinus excelsior, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, field maple Acer campestre, spindle Euonymus europaeus, dogwood Cornus sanguinea, and buckthorn Rhamnus catharticus. A drainage ditch along two sides of the site supports five species of willow including purple willow Salix purpurea and almond willow Salix triandra. <b>Common</b> <b>comfrey</b> Symphytum officinale, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, cyperus sedge Carex pseudocyperus and the uncommon aquatic liverwort Riccia fluitans...along this ditch.

40|$|The bacherol thesis {{with the}} title "Biology, {{incidence}} and regulation of <b>common</b> <b>comfrey</b> (Symphytum officinale L.) " deals with processing and presentation of accessible information about the weed <b>common</b> <b>comfrey.</b> First part of the bacherol thesis paid attention to information related to weed species general characteristics, occurrence and potential of their regulation. Prevailing part of the bacherol thesis occupied with the <b>common</b> <b>comfrey</b> characteristic and regulation possibilities. Information about comfrey biology, morphology, occurrence and environmental requirements was presented in this part. Comfrey regulation was in detail solved for its occurrence on meadow, arable soil or on soil without agricultural usage. The possibilities of preventive and direct regulation actions {{with the aim of}} comfrey occurrence limitation were suggested. These actions against comfrey include meadow regular cutting, intensive soil processing and usage of herbicide matters...|$|E
40|$|The thesis titled "Biology, seed {{characteristics}} and growth establishment of <b>common</b> <b>comfrey</b> (Symphytum officinale L.) " {{dealt with the}} evaluation methods of reproduction comfrey and evaluation {{of the impact of}} environmental conditions to the grow of comfrey. Further it dealt with germination tests and their statistical evaluation while respecting the specific work with seeds. They were evaluated seed characteristics, which are reflected in the growth of these plants arising both in soil and in a laboratory environment. Literary part gave information about biology, characteristics, morphology, prevention and regulation of comfrey even more its cultivation, nutrition of the grassland and seed characteristics, germination and dormancy. In the final section of work was monitored coverage, botanical images, representation of herbaceous species growing near comfrey. The study also discussed vernalization, size of comfrey leaves, growth and development depending on the content of nutrients (soil fertility) and water in the soil and on the number of cuts to its growth. There were designed a suitable ways of reproduction and growing of comfrey...|$|E
