5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are <b>coded</b> and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is <b>coded</b> as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is <b>coded</b> by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol.

40|$|In {{magnetic}} recording, {{a standard}} <b>code</b> architecture {{consists of an}} outer Reed–Solomon <b>code</b> in concatenation with an inner parity <b>code.</b> The inner parity <b>code</b> is used to detect and correct common error events.

In this paper, we study an inner <b>code</b> that offers the same system performance as a parity <b>code</b> with very short block length, even as short as the symbol length (in bits) of the outer Reed–Solomon <b>code,</b> but with higher <b>code</b> rate.
