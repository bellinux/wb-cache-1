The buckling is caused by prescribed motion of column ends toward each other with constant velocity. Simple model with one degree of freedom simulating static and dynamic buckling of a column is derived. In the case of small initial disturbances the model yields simple analytical dependencies between the main parameters of the problem: critical force, compression rate, and initial disturbance. It is shown that the time required for buckling is inversely proportional to cubic root of <b>compression</b> <b>velocity</b> and logarithmically depends on the initial disturbance. Analytical expression for critical buckling force {{as a function of}} <b>compression</b> <b>velocity</b> is derived. It is shown that in a range of compression rates typical for laboratory experiments the dependence is accurately approximated by a power law with exponent close to 2 / 3.

Although a number of numerical studies regarding ICM process {{has been carried out}} by few research groups, most of them employ Hele-Shaw approximation, which is appropriate for thin cavity geometry only. In this regard, this work presents a three-dimensional numerical analysis system of ICM process using a stabilized finite element method (FEM) and an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method. The developed system is verified by comparing the results with existing experimental data as well as simulation data obtained from commercial software. Then, the system is adopted for simulations of ICM process of an optical lens, which is a practical example of three-dimensional geometry.

Thus {{there is a}} strong demand in cell phone maker to move to embedded micro wafer level packaging (EMWLP). But the major problem encountered is die shift during compression molding. This paper presents a novel method to predict the die shift during wafer level molding process. A series of parametric studies are performed by changing the die thickness, die pitch distance and top mold chaste <b>compression</b> <b>velocity.</b> The effect of thinning down the chip thickness affects the pressure difference and local shear rate on the chip surfaces. The rate of change of epoxy mold compound fluid pressure across the die top surfaces is not constant. The local shear rate is increasing linearly from the centre of the wafer to the outermost die. From the parametric studies, the die shift is inversely proportional to the die thickness for wafer level molding. Such a phenomenon will reduce the lithography alignment error in the next process. This paper also shows that by reducing die pitch distance of a 5 × 5 mm 2, 500 μm thick chip, the die shift decreases by a factor of 12 %. In addition, the top mold chaste <b>compression</b> <b>velocity</b> contributes to the die shift by as much as 28 % when the velocity is reduced by 50 % from 100 μm/sec to 50 μm/sec Finally it is observed from experiment result that the die shift is not constant in all directions. © 2009 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|The elastic {{properties}} of a soil are usually investigated to describe its engineering behaviour. The results {{of previous studies}} indicate {{that the effect of}} changes in suction on the elastic response at a small strain level of soils is significant during compaction and post-compaction periods. Limited efforts have been focused on quantifying those post-compacted responses due to the changes in suction induced by wetting and drying cycles.

In this paper the aspects related to the elastic {{properties of}} compacted soils subjected to cycles of drying and wetting are described. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of compaction energy on the hysteric behaviour (i. e. amplitude of the hysteresis loop) and its dependence on the initial stress state conditions and suction history.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to identify relevant settling velocity and rheology model parameters and to assess the underlying filamentous microbial community characteristics that can influence the solids mixing and transport in secondary settling tanks. Parameter values for hindered, transient and <b>compression</b> settling <b>velocity</b> functions were estimated by carrying out biweekly batch settling tests using a novel column setup through a four-month long measurement campaign. To estimate viscosity model parameters, rheological experiments were carried out on the same sludge sample using a rotational viscometer. Quantitative fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (qFISH) analysis, targeting Microthrix parvicella and phylum Chloroflexi, was used. This study finds that M. parvicella – predominantly residing inside the microbial flocs in our samples – can significantly influence secondary settling through altering the hindered settling velocity and yield stress parameter. Strikingly, {{this is not the}} case for Chloroflexi, occurring in more than double the abundance of M. parvicella, and forming filaments primarily protruding from the flocs. The transient and compression settling parameters show a comparably high variability, and no significant association with filamentous abundance. A two-dimensional, axi-symmetrical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to assess calibration scenarios to model filamentous bulking. Our results suggest that model predictions can significantly benefit from explicitly accounting for filamentous bulking by calibrating the hindered settling velocity function. Furthermore, accounting for the transient and <b>compression</b> settling <b>velocity</b> in the computational domain is crucial to improve model accuracy when modelling filamentous bulking. However, the case-specific calibration of transient and compression settling parameters as well as yield stress is not necessary, and an average parameter set – obtained under bulking and good settling conditions – can be used...|$|R

MethodsTen patients with class 6 chronic venous disease (CEAP clinical classification) were recruited. Measurements of peak venous velocities in the popliteal vein were recorded by Duplex scanning in response to six test conditions; 1. Standing, 2. Voluntary calf muscle contraction, 3. Standing with NMES applied, 4. Standing with compression bandaging applied to the leg, 5. Voluntary calf muscle contraction with compression bandaging applied to the leg, 6. Stationary with compression bandaging applied to the leg and NMES applied. Comfort assessment was completed using visual analogue scales at each test stage and on study completion each patient completed a short structured interview to determine comfort and acceptability of NMES. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS, Version 9. Non-parametric testing was used in all analyses using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test for paired samples.

The viscometer determines force from the curvature of displacement data allowing calculations of viscosities at shear rates {{in excess of}} 1000 s- 1. Alternatively, the DFV can be operated like a conventional parallel-plate compression viscometer, attaining shear rates as low as 10 - 5 s- 1. Durations of an experiment range between approximately 5 ms and 24 hours. Most rapid compression tests resulted in periods of first rapidly increasing shear rate followed by rapidly decreasing shear rate. Viscosity during the increasing shear rate period decreased by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. The viscosity during the decreasing shear rate was {{an order of magnitude}} smaller (relative to another experiment) when it achieved a 75 % greater maximum shear rate. The DFV was used to calculate viscosity as a function of shear rate for Al-Si and Al-Cu alloys that were rheocast with the commercial SIMA and MHD processes, as well as the recently developed MIT method. Experiments were conducted between fractions solid of 0. 44 and 0. 67. Viscosity of A 357 produced by the three processing routes all had similar viscosities, ranging from 300 Pas at 120 s- 1 to 2. 2 Pas at 1500 s- 1.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises five manuscripts {{resulting from}} a study on a critical problem {{in the oil industry}} called 2 ̆ 2 Sanding 2 ̆ 2. Sanding is a phenomenon in which sand from a formation is drawn into a well during production and pumped along with oil and gas. This occurs in weakly cemented sands and sandstones, and can cause significant damage, including erosion of pipelines, loss of production, and in extreme cases the loss of oil wells. A knowledge of the strength of these formation is critical for the effective analysis of sanding potential and design of possible preventive measures. ^ The objective of this research is to develop a practical tool for estimating the strength of weakly cemented sands (i. e. unconfined compressive strength, real cohesion, and friction angle) from commonly measured geophysical logs (<b>compression</b> wave <b>velocity,</b> shear wave velocity, and porosity). To achieve this, an extensive laboratory testing program was conducted on artificially cemented samples of varying densities and levels of cementation. Geophysical measurements on these samples included bulk density and shear wave velocities. The laboratory testing program included triaxial compression tests, unconfined compression tests and indirect tension tests. Real cohesion and tangential friction angles were estimated using a nonlinear Mohr envelope. ^ Based on the laboratory results, four empirical models were developed that related small strain shear modulus or compression/shear wave velocity ratios with shear stresses at failure. Because in situ logs are influenced by environmental conditions, and pore fluid composition, a methodology was developed to estimate strength from synthetic velocities. This methodology has the potential to estimate the unconfined compressive strength, and real cohesion of weakly cemented sand directly from field measured porosity and <b>compression</b> wave <b>velocity</b> logs. ...|$|R

The observed slope of the ion density profile on approach to the comet is unexpectedly steep. Possible explanations for this are discussed. We present also a preliminary investigation of the quasilinear velocity-space diffusion of the implanted heavy ion population at G-S using a transport equation including souce, convection, adiabatic <b>compression,</b> and <b>velocity</b> diffusion terms. Resulting distributions are anisotropic, in agreement with observations. We consider theoretically the waves that may be generated by the diffusion process for the observed solar wind conditions. At initial ion injections, waves are generated at omega approximately Omega(sub i) the ion gyrofrequency, and lower frequencies are predicted for diffusion toward a bispherical shell...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of radiation {{sources in the}} THz spectral region has {{become more and more}} interesting because of the peculiar characteristics of this radiation: it is non ionizing, it penetrates dielectrics, it is highly absorbed by polar liquids, highly reflected by metals and reveals specific "fingerprint" absorption spectra arising from fundamentals physical processes. The THz source at SPARC is an accelerator based source for research investigations (e. g. material science, biology fields). By means of e-beam manipulation technique, a longitudinal modulated beam, the so-called comb beam, can be produced at SPARC. In terms of THz sources, such e-beam distribution allows to produce high intensitiy narrow band THz radiation, whose spectrum strongly depends on the charge distribution inside the e-beam. In this paper different linac schemes are compared. In particular, spectra obtained using the comb beam <b>compression</b> through <b>velocity</b> bunching including a IV harmonic RF section is showed...|$|R
