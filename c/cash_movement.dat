30|$|The {{structure}} {{of this paper}} is as follows: section “The mathematical model” is devoted to describing in mathematical terms the functioning of the cash flow of any branch, by separating the different types of deposits and expenditures and modeling them. In this section, we also choose the variables and we design a proper objective function which captures all the costs involved in the <b>cash</b> <b>movements.</b> In section “The random deposits and expenditures”, we catch the random elements of the model, such as number of branch users or number and quantities of <b>cash</b> <b>movements</b> (deposits and withdrawals), by defining suitable Poisson (compound) processes.

30|$|As we {{mentioned}} before, the central {{aim of this}} paper is to optimize the bank cash inventories across its branches. For this, our proposal is that the bankťs company must impose some restrictions to its branches <b>cash</b> <b>movements.</b> These restrictions are imposed in the shape of some formulae which help the branches to calculate their needs of cash, before they make a cash requirement to the cash central. These formulae accurately adjust the demand for money to the real needs of the branches, avoiding a surplus of money and, hence, minimizing the opportunity costs.|$|R
30|$|Different {{approaches}} to the problem {{can be made in}} order to optimize the bank cash handling: in the first place, a global approach, modeling the situation of a bankťs company viewed a solid piece of the puzzle.

In any case, these <b>cash</b> <b>movements</b> from the <b>cash</b> central to the branches take place after a concrete demand of money from branches to the cash central.

40|$|Highway {{agencies}} {{attempt to}} apply efficient accounting systems {{to help improve}} the transparency of their budget allocation and their overall performance. The accrual accounting system has been adopted to substitute the cash accounting system by many central governments around the world. The system reports transactions of economic value changes rather than when <b>cash</b> <b>movements</b> are made. The asset value and its depreciation determined by the accrual accounting system illustrate {{the total amount of}} economic value owned by an agency and the consumption of the future economic benefits for an asset. The age-based depreciation approach, which is a traditional approach, is applied to determine the depreciation of an asset based on the defined useful life and the straight-line depreciation method. The advantage of this approach is its simplicity and its ability to support the long-term asset management system. The condition-based depreciation is recommended as an alternative approach since the actual condition of an asset can reflect its depreciation. The depreciation of an asset based on the condition-based approach is suitable for single-year maintenance planning since the executives cannot estimate the required budget for replacing or preserving of an asset in the long-term period. This research focuses on developing the new depreciation approach by integrating the age-based and the condition-based depreciation approaches in order to strategically plan long-term highway maintenance and to enable the actual condition of an asset to be reflected.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro in 2002 offered a unique opportunity {{to learn more about the}} patterns and structures of cross-border <b>cash</b> <b>movements.</b> The Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) has carried out various surveys to analyze the migration of cash in greater depth. This article presents the results of two surveys, which demonstrate that cash is very mobile. An Austrian wallet will typically hold coins and banknotes from almost all euro area countries. Euro coins minted in countries other than Austria are readily discernible, as all coins have a common European face and a distinct national face. For euro banknotes, closer inspection is required, as only the letter contained in the banknote’s number betrays the country of origin. Surveys on cash migration show that the volume of euro banknotes and coins in circulation in Austria, as well as the mix of denominations, remained relatively stable at Austrian households from 2002 to 2004, albeit with a slight increase in the share of foreign banknotes and coins. In Austria, migration continues to generate an influx of banknotes. In particular, EUR 50, EUR 20 and EUR 5 banknotes exhibit a high degree of migration. The results of the two OeNB surveys clearly reveal that banknote migration took place at a considerably faster pace than coin migration. This brief study calculates migration factors for individual countries in order to explain the migration taking place. These factors throw light on whether a country is one of cash emigration or one of cash immigration, while falling short of offering a clear explanation for the underlying reasons of migration. cash, migration, cross-border cash flows. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{a new approach}} to measuring the impact of government cash transfers on poverty alleviation that takes into account endogenous reactions and consumption smoothing of households. We use the methodology to study the impact of changes in government cash benefits on poverty rates in Russia during 1994 to 1998. The methodological contribution is twofold. First, we estimate the propensity to consume from government cash transfers separately for each transfer type, and interpret the differences in the coefficients in the light of Friedman's permanent income hypothesis. The propensity to consume is higher from regular than from transitory income sources, and higher for pensions than for child benefits and other income. Second, we propose a new decomposition technique to disentangle the impact of changes in government transfers and changes in the expenditure distribution excluding <b>cash</b> transfers on <b>movements</b> in poverty rates. At least 30 % of the rise in poverty between 1994 and 1998 was due to the changes in cash transfer policy. Keeping benefits at the level of 1994, poverty would have been lower by around 20 % in 1998.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to establish a scientifically-based decision making procedure for determining the amount of cash {{to be held at}} a cash point at any time without compromising the customer service level or incurring undue cost. To reach the objective, the problem was divided into the following subproblems: To determine the cost parameters describing the nature of the problem of cash provision in South Africa. To investigate the characteristics unique to South African retail banking. To determine the nature of the demand distribution for a cash point. To develop a forecasting method appropriate for retail banking, although it was clearly stated that the methods used were specific to the branch studied. To investigate the existing order policies used by retail banks, as well as alternative order policies, with the aim of improving the cash replenishment process. As a result of the investigation a generic decision model was developed which may be used to improve the process at branch level for retail banks in South Africa. Some suggestions were also made regarding the implementation and maintenance of the model. To investigate the cash replenishment problem, the cooperation of one of the leading retail banks in South Africa was obtained. A typical branch was selected. The total withdrawal, deposit patterns and the withdrawal patterns at the automated teller machines (ATM's) for a three month period during 1998 were investigated. The cost parameters relevant to the cash replenishment process were quantified. The approach followed was based on the classical inventory theory where the total cost of carrying inventory comprised three cost categories, i. e. storage cost, supply cost and shortage cost. Since the banks do not quantify the shortage cost, assumptions regarding the scope of the shortage cost had to be made. The next step was to determine the cost of the existing order policy followed by the branch. This figure was used as a benchmark once alternate policies were investigated. The investigation resulted in alternate policies which significantly reduced the daily cost involved in carrying inventory as well as reduced the average amount of cash carried at the branch. It was also shown, that the branch should consider using an appropriate forecasting method, since once forecasting was combined with an appropriate order policy, it was possible to reduce the cost of carrying cash inventories even further. In conclusion, the research report suggested an implementation plan to be followed at branch level pointing out that certain changes to information systems were required. In addition, training needs were identified to enable the branch operations manager to successfully use the decision support model. A comparison was drawn between the existing approach followed at the branch (which is mainly experience-based and largely of a random nature) to the proposed method. It was shown that the daily cost of carrying cash inventory could be reduced by 13 per cent per day. This represented a daily bottom line cost reduction ofR 358. At the time that the research was carried out, this retail bank had 75 similar branches. Should the saving at this representative branch be extrapolated, it shows a potential saving of R 8 000 000 per year at this category of branch. It was further shown that the average cash inventory at this branch could be reduced by 52 per cent using the proposed method. The study was limited to an investigation at one particular branch of a leading South African retail bank. The figures used to describe <b>cash</b> <b>movements</b> at the branch were of an extremely sensitive nature and were fairly difficult to obtain due {{to the way in which}} transactions are reported. The accuracy of the data provided by the branch could not be verified, but had to be accepted at face value. Although a particular case was investigated, a concerted effort was made to point out how the methodology may be used in the generic situation. During the period under review, the branch relocated to a complex across the street from its previous location in a busy shopping mall. This had a direct impact on the ATM withdrawal patterns at the two ATM's located at the branch. In addition, soon after the research was carried out, a number of other branches of the same retail bank were consolidated into this one particular branch. This would impact on the validity of the branch specific factors determined as part of the research. The study proved the applicability of industrial engineering principles in a service environment, where the added value of having the optimum cash amount available when required would impact directly on the bottom line of the bank and thereby enhance share-holder value. In the changing environment confronting retail banks, enhanced share-holder value is of the utmost importance to increase competitiveness and long-term survival.
