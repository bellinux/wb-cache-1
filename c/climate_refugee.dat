An exhaustive sample of the online coverage from 2000 until 2017 has been gathered and examined through a content analysis guided by framing theory and multimodal critical discourse analysis. After reviewing the 29 news stories, this paper finds that <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> are framed in four ways: As victims, security threats, activists and abstractions. In both media outlets, <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> are aggregated, collectivized and made generic – and their situation is deagentialized. The study concludes that the BBC mainly talks about <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> instead of talking to them, and that this {{has an impact on}} the climate refugees’ depicted agency. Al Jazeera quotes more <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> in their journalistic coverage, and this allows the reader to understand and empathize.

The result indicated that the state of Tuvalu is adapting to climate threats, that in the future the population can be seen as <b>climate</b> <b>refugees,</b> if they are forced from their homes due to climate change, and that they, despite that definition, can not be included by the UN Refugee Convention. The study also indicates a need for greater international protection of <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> by, for example, an expansion of the UN Refugee Convention so that these vulnerable people do not fall into oblivion due to a question of definition...|$|R

40|$|Climate change poses {{a severe}} {{challenge}} {{to people and}} growing numbers of people flee from floods, rising sea levels and more intense hurricanes. So far, no international actor has taken up the challenge to promote a formal commitment to {{the human rights of}} <b>climate</b> <b>refugees.</b> Normative powers are actors who foster international commitment to the norms they promote. Within the European Union, the European Commission is the actor who pushes for new policy focuses. The aim of this research is to analyze how the notion ‘normative power’ can explain the discourse and policy implementation of the European Commission. The norm, which governs the treatment of refugees, is hospitality. Three different discourses on hospitality, the discourse on hospitality in liberalism, critical and liberal cosmopolitanism are discussed and the hospitality approach in liberal cosmopolitanism is assigned to serve as an indicator of a normative power on <b>climate</b> <b>refugees.</b> Key characteristics of the discourse on hospitality in liberal cosmopolitanism are the favoring of multiculturalism, granting of great freedoms to the refugee and a prioritization of hospitality over national economic and geopolitical interests. The analysis suggests that the European Commission is highly active in humanitarian aid on refugees – also on refugees who flee from climate and environmental change. The European Commission seems to prioritize integration of the refugees into local host communities over multiculturalism and takes into account national economic and geopolitical interests of the host countries. This means the European Commission cannot be identified as a normative power on <b>climate</b> <b>refugees.</b> Yet the application of the notion ‘normative power’ to the hot topic of <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> suggest that the European Commission, once it is agreed on a European definition of <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> is in an excellent position to promote the protection of <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> as global and local humanitarian aid and developmental support networks are already established...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{the term}} ?<b>climate</b> <b>refugee?</b> is widely {{promoted}} {{in the media}} and is also the result of a consensus of opinion, while the main issues addressed by this term include ?how can we protect these emigrants? and ?how can we be protected from these immigrants?. On the one hand, some people use the term {{in order to try to}} protect climate migrants by offering them a status inspired by the Geneva Convention refugee status. However they forget that refugee status is not constraining for States. The status was created to allow States to control migrations linked to asylum. It means that the right of asylum is not a right to asylum. And on the other hand, other people view the term ?<b>climate</b> <b>refugee?</b> as an opportunity to depoliticize the concept of refugee and to circulate the idea that all refugees should be protected in their own country or close by. Closing off the European borders to refugees would then be justified. <b>Climate</b> <b>refugee,</b> environment, asylum, Geneva Convention, UNHCR...|$|E
40|$|Global {{warming is}} a current topic on the {{international}} agenda. The rise of temperature in the atmosphere threatens populations living on island, deltas and coastal areas, and people living nearby the Arctic and areas covered by permafrost are threatened. In turn {{this leads to the}} people in these areas being projected to be homeless or displaced due to climate change and the rising numbers of natural disasters. Those people are what you can label as <b>climate</b> <b>refugees.</b> According to IOM and Brown (2001) <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> are persons who for compelling reasons of change in the environment which change their living conditions have to escape their homes, either within their country or abroad. The United Nations Refugee Convention is the binding legislation followed by 147 (in 2008) of the UN member states.

Both groups of refugees has in common that they live under the pressured decision they have to make as they flee their native homes to ensure their own and their families survival according to Grove (2006).

40|$|Climate {{change is}} more and more said to be a problem of migration. The common refrain is that climate change will bear in some way on {{patterns}} of human mobility, resulting in either insecurity, humanitarian crises, or all manner of inventive adaptive responses. The inherent challenge in such claims is, however, that of causality: the degree to which climate change influences migration alongside the myriad social, political, and economic reasons people migrate. This challenge is far from being settled. Importantly, the unsettled question of causality exposes how the crisis of humanism is central to the construction of the climate migrant or <b>climate</b> <b>refugee.</b> Coming to terms with this crisis means having to confront how issues of power and knowledge shape how we understand the relationship between climate change and migration. But even more importantly it means having to ask probing questions {{about what it means to}} be human today.

40|$|Climate change effects such as {{sea-level rise}} are almost certain. What these {{outcomes}} mean for different populations, however, {{is far less}} certain. Climate change is both a narrative and material phenomenon. In so being, understanding climate change requires broad conceptualisations that incorporate multiple voices and recognise the agency of vulnerable populations. In climate change discourse, climate mobility is often characterised as the production of 2 ̆ 7 refugees 2 ̆ 7, with a tendency to discount long histories of ordinary mobility among affected populations. The case of Tuvalu in the Pacific juxtaposes migration as everyday practice with <b>climate</b> <b>refugee</b> narratives. This climate-exposed population is being problematically positioned to speak for an entire planet under threat. Tuvaluans are being used as the immediate evidence of displacement that the climate change crisis narrative seems to require. Those identified as imminent climate refugees are being held up like ventriloquists to present a particular (western) 2 ̆ 7 crisis of nature 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|Climate-induced migration, and {{particularly}} the issue of <b>climate</b> <b>refugees,</b> is subject to growing attention in global climate governance. The debate on the topic sees the convergence of conflicting discourses (ranging from those of conservative European governments to southern NGOs) onto apocalyptic narratives that forecast massive, abrupt and unavoidable flows of <b>climate</b> <b>refugees.</b> Such dystopian narratives, either framed within humanitarian or ‘national security’ agendas, relegate the concerned populations {{to the status of}} victims (either to protect or to fear). This article, applying elements of poststructuralist discourse theory, analyzes the narratives via a set of influential reports on climate-induced migration and argues that apocalyptic narratives on <b>climate</b> <b>refugees,</b> although not totalizing or uncontested, represent a case of the depoliticization of global climate governance. The convergence into such narratives favors the drive towards a post-political discursive configuration, which, by supplanting politics with governance, leaves underlying power relations untouched and (re) produces present forms of representational and material marginalization. It therefore argues that such narratives, although often employed with the aim of attracting attention to a pressing issue, are detrimental for an emancipatory approach to climate chang...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change will}} {{fundamentally}} affect {{the lives of}} millions of people who will be forced over the next decades to leave their villages and cities to seek refuge in other areas. Although the exact numbers of climate refugees are unknowable and vary from assessment to assessment depending on underlying methods, scenarios, time frames, and assumptions (as laid out below), the available literature indicates that the <b>climate</b> <b>refugee</b> crisis will surpass all known refugee crises {{in terms of the number}} of people affected. Many climate refugees may seek refuge in their own countries; others will need to cross borders to find a new home. Some local refugee crises, in particular in the richer countries in the North, may be prevented through adaptation measures such as reinforced coastal protection or changes in agricultural production and water supply management. Many poorer countries, however, are unlikely to be able to initiate sufficient adaptation programmes, and climate-induced migration might be the only option for many communities in the South. In these situations, climate refugees will need to rely on effective protection and support from the international community, regardless of whether climate migration is internal or transnational...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{global warming}} {{has become an}} {{increasingly}} urgent universal concern. Probably the most important environmental challenge {{in the history of}} the modem world is now widely recognized to be a result of increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, generally produced by human activity. It is generally well accepted that this climate change will have serious environmental, economic and geopolitical consequences. The scientific projections of increased global temperatures present the prospect of rising sea levels and associated risks to coastal areas, increased risks of floods and droughts, new and exacerbated public health issues and threats to biodiversity and the viability of numerous ecosystems around the world. Economically, the impact of global warming could be dramatic, considering only the prospective 50 to 250 million displaced people in the next 50 years. Nevertheless, the impact of climate change also involves the geopolitical arena, several states being directly threatened by increased pollution activities of other countries and facing imminent disappearance. In this context, the complex problem of the Sinking Islands represents a relatively controversial and new aspect of global warming. The crisis faced by multiple island nations due to rising sea levels that are in tum a result of climate change in principal, is also supported by a general passivity of the international community in regard to the lives of the Pacific islanders, with severe global costs, as ecological disasters and civilizations collapse. This paper aims to analyze the case of sinking islands as a scientifically demonstrated fact from the environmental point of view, particularly focused on climate change as the main cause. With quality and academic progressive interpretation of law the paper will also legally thrash out the refugee aspect of the problem and the forced migration process, as a subsidiary effect. The legal analysis will be naturally corroborated with international human rights law and the related supporting documents, conclusively offering legal solutions under the umbrella of international law to this global cutting-edge problem. It is obligatory that these branches of international law, from which perspectives the problem will be analyzed (environmental, refugee and human rights) to be regarded and interpreted as interdependent and interconnected fields, as they together constitute the legal core of the problem. Furthermore, only intrinsically connected and not viewed in isolation from each other, the three main 2 ̆ 2 perspectives 2 ̆ 2 could provide a better legal identification, collating and enforcement of the international obligations to protect the Pacific islanders, along with more sustainable and equitable policy responses to this global predicament. In addition, one of the purposes of this dissertation is to extend the previous work in the 2 ̆ 2 <b>Climate</b> <b>Refugee</b> 2 ̆ 2 field in regard to a broad recognition and acceptance of the term in international (refugee) law and to explore the potential application of the 2 ̆ 2 Economic Refugee 2 ̆ 2 idiom, sui generis and its inevitability of use in the Pacific islanders 2 ̆ 7 context. The present work shall also extract its innovative component from the research and analyze the problem itself, supported by developed action-oriented case studies on specific Pacific islands, contributing inter alia with an academic insight in the field of international law. Hereby, the salient objective of the paper is to evaluate the challenge of the Sinking Pacific Islands, supported by research and policies analysis of the legal or legislative developments at international and national level for countries within the region (e. g., new domestic legislation, constitutional amendments, significant case law), finally aiming at the global aspect of the issue, its worldwide concern and the eventual international comprehensive plans of action, proposed in the conclusions and recommendations of the paper...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change has}} both direct and {{indirect}} impacts on territory, and hence on individuals. Extreme events such as floods and storms made more frequent by climate change can spoil portions of land and deprive its inhabitants of resources usually connected to residency in it. Climate change will provoke enlarging desertification, thereby making inhabitable, or less rich in resources, previously fertile lands. Due to climate change, the area of diffusion of typically tropical diseases will spread, and this may make more difficult human living in certain areas. Increased prices of food, connected to droughts, or difficulties in cultivation connected to alteration in ecosystems, can cause abandonment of certain previously cultivated areas. Finally, in some cases climate change has effects which can cause the disappearance of whole countries, as {{it is likely to}} happen when sea levels rising will cause the submersion of some archipelagos in the Pacific. ⁠ In this paper I shall focus on disappearing countries, i. e. on the countries whose territory will be entirely destroyed by submersion. In particular, I am going to consider the following claims: <b>Climate</b> <b>refugees</b> – People forcefully displaced from disappearing countries (from now onwards, <b>climate</b> <b>refugees)</b> have a right to compensation. Territorial rights of <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> – In particular, <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> suffer violations of their territorial rights; hence, compensation for them should mainly take the form of the restoration of their rights to a territory, through relocation. My main purpose here will be to claim that adaptation {{to some of the most}} harming effects of present and future climate change involves admittance of <b>climate</b> <b>refugees,</b> and that international law should make room for this new category. I shall also claim that two criteria should be balanced in order to frame a climate-refugee international regime – i. e. to assign <b>climate</b> <b>refugees</b> to host states. First, big historical emitters (understood in terms of their per capita emissions in the past century) should admit more than small emitters; second, refugees should be given admittance in the country most similar to their lost motherland. I shall claim that these two criteria are a sound applications of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The paper develops as follows. In § 1, I shall defend the view that people fleeing from disappearing countries may be considered proper refugees, in light of the 1952 Convention. In § 2 and 3, I shall present arguments in favour of my view of the climate-refugees international regime. § 4 concludes...|$|R
