5|$|During {{his early}} years as a practising barrister, Garrow was {{particularly}} noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence {{in the course of}} a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him to admit that he was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a dislike of most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave <b>character</b> <b>evidence</b> the defendants were found not guilty.|$|E

25|$|The {{measures}} to expand admissibility of bad <b>character</b> <b>evidence</b> were also opposed {{on the grounds}} of unfairness (the defendant's past bad character can more easily be adduced than a witness's) and of dangerous irrelevance.

The maximum period a suspected terrorist could be detained without charge was increased from 7 to 14 days. This was later increased to 28 days by the Terrorism Act 2006.|$|E

500|$|Charges were {{initially}} laid against Webster for sexual assault, though {{by the time}} the case went to trial they had been dropped without public explanation. Hillary Byrne-Armstrong, writing in The Australian Feminist Law Journal, stated it was likely that Webster was offered a plea bargain that would drop the lesser charges in exchange for his guilty plea for murder. Webster pleaded guilty to Leigh's murder on 24 October 1990. The guilty plea meant that no witnesses were called for the trial; Detective Chaffey instead read a list of facts to the court. Justice James Roland Wood sentenced Webster to a minimum of 14 years in prison, with an additional six years during which he would be eligible for parole, saying that a life sentence was inappropriate in view of Webster's potential to be rehabilitated. Wood found that Webster's motivation for killing Leigh was his fear she would report his sexual assault. Five Stockton citizens volunteered to give <b>character</b> <b>evidence</b> at his trial, describing the [...] teenager as a quiet [...] "gentle giant" [...] from a good family. Others expressed amazement at this description of Webster, who was also known as [...] "fat Matt, the thug of Stockton". Webster served his sentence at Parklea Correctional Centre.|$|E

A careful analysis of the situation of the accused on the witness stand-rather than an easy assumption about irrelevance-leads to this Article 2 ̆ 7 s broad conclusion that <b>character</b> impeachment <b>evidence</b> of criminal defendants ought to be eliminated.
