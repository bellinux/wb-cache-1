40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, the incidence, day of onset and {{severity}} of type II collagen (IIC) -induced polyarthritis (CA) in allogeneic bone marrow <b>chimaeras</b> were compared. These <b>chimaeras</b> were prepared by using reciprocal combinations between DBA/ 1 J (H- 2 q, Igh- 1 c, Hc 1), which are highly susceptible to CA, and SWR/J (H- 2 q, Igh- 1 c, Hc 0), which are CA resistant, strains of mice. The four kinds of <b>chimaeras,</b> [SWR [...] DBA/ 1], [DBA/ 1 [...] DBA/ 1], [DBA/ 1 [...] SWR] and [SWR [...] SWR], were shown to be full <b>chimaeras.</b> [SWR [...] DBA/ 1] and [DBA/ 1 [...] DBA/ 1] <b>chimaeras</b> showed serum C 5 antigens {{and most of these}} mice developed CA, even though severity of CA in [SWR [...] DBA/ 1] <b>chimaeras</b> was less than that in [DBA/ 1 [...] DBA/ 1] syngeneic <b>chimaeras.</b> By contrast, [DBA/ 1 [...] SWR] and [SWR [...] SWR] <b>chimaeras</b> completely lacked serum C 5 and did not develop CA at all. However, most of these <b>chimaeras</b> produced considerable total IgG and IgG 2 a antibodies to IIC in the sera after immunization with the antigens, although differences in the serum levels of IgG 2 a antibodies were seen between [SWR [...] DBA/ 1] and [DBA/ 1 [...] SWR] allogeneic <b>chimaeras.</b> The present results demonstrate directly a crucial role of complement cascade in the induction and development of CA and reveal that lymphoid cells of SWR mice potentially have the ability to develop CA. Differences in severity of the CA observed in some of these <b>chimaeras,</b> however, could not be readily explained by differences in C 5 concentrations alone...|$|R
40|$|Reciprocal {{transfers}} of spleen and bone marrow cell suspensions {{have been performed}} between mice of the C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) genetic background, differing at the lymphoproliferation (lpr) locus. These immune system <b>chimaeras</b> were followed for almost one year after sublethal irradiation and cell reconstitution. In addition {{to the survival of}} the <b>chimaeras,</b> the major lymphoid organs (bone marrow, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes) were examined for cell numbers, percentages of membrane immunoglobulin-positive cells and responses to mitogenic stimulations with concanavalin and lipopolysaccharide. The [lpr [...] lpr] <b>chimaeras</b> were similar to untreated lpr mice. The [wild [...] lpr] did not develop the lpr-induced syndrome and remained similar to [wild [...] wild] <b>chimaeras.</b> Therefore, B 6 wild haematopoietic stem cells could rescue sublethally irradiated B 6 lpr mice from the lpr-induced autoimmune pathology. The radioresistant lpr environment alone was not sufficient to induce the lpr syndrome. It may however be required for its development since [lpr [...] wild] <b>chimaeras</b> displayed a profound aplasia of their lymphoid organs, together with a normal cellularity of their bone marrow. In contrast to <b>chimaeras</b> constructed with MRL mice, the [lpr [...] wild] B 6 <b>chimaeras</b> did not die following the lpr haematopoietic stem cell transfer. Therefore, the lymphoid aplasia of [lpr [...] wild] radiation <b>chimaeras</b> does not result from an lpr graft-versus-host-like syndrome. More likely is that a normal, non-lpr, haematopoietic environment may not allow the differentiation of the lpr haematopoietic stem cells into the lymphoid lineages...|$|R

5|$|Known {{material}} of Dermotherium includes {{a handful of}} jaw fragments and isolated teeth. Dermotherium major is known only from a fragment of the left lower jaw bearing the third lower molar (m3) and a poorly preserved second lower molar (m2). The holotype of Dermotherium <b>chimaera</b> is a lower jaw fragment in which remnants of the deciduous third lower premolar are visible. X-ray microtomography reveals the unerupted lower third incisor (i3), canine (c1), third premolar (p3), and fourth premolar (p4) still inside the jaw. In addition, this species is known from two other jaw fragments, one bearing m1 and m2 and the other bearing m2 and m3, and two isolated molars, an upper first and second molar (M1 and M2).

5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} (Uratelornis <b>chimaera)</b> is {{a species of}} bird in the ground roller family Brachypteraciidae, placed in the {{monotypic}} genus Uratelornis. Endemic to arid spiny forests near the coast in southwestern Madagascar, this ground roller occurs at extremely low population densities throughout its habitat. This species requires shade and a deep layer of leaves on the ground, and it is absent from parts of the spiny forest lacking these features. It has no recognized subspecies, and its closest relative is the scaly ground roller. The long-tailed ground roller is the only ground roller to definitively display sexual dimorphism (differences in plumage or size between sexes). It is a medium-sized bird with a plump silhouette and a long tail. The upperparts are dark brown with black streaks while the underparts are light gray. The white throat is framed by black malar stripes and a black breastband, and a white stripe is present {{at the base of}} the bill. Sky-blue feathers are visible at the edge of the wings and the tail. Calls are rarely made outside the breeding season, though multiple courtship calls are made.|$|E
5|$|In Dermotherium <b>chimaera,</b> the p4 and m1 through m3 {{are similar}} to each other (and unlike the i3, canine, and p3) and appear to form a series of {{decreasing}} size from front to back. In D.major, only m2 and m3 are known, but they are similar in morphology and m3 is smaller than m2. In the Sunda colugo, however, the teeth get larger from p4 to m3. The p4 and molars have a distinct trigonid (a triangular group of cusps {{at the front of}} a tribosphenic tooth) and talonid. The trigonid contains strong protoconid and metaconid cusps. The metaconid is stronger than the protoconid in the molars, {{but it is not clear}} whether this is the case in the p4. In the living colugos, the protoconid is higher than the metaconid in both p4 and m1. The trigonid is longer in the p4 than in the molars. In D.chimaera, the trigonid is broader than in D.major. A low crest, the paracristid, descends from the protoconid lingually and towards the front, forming the front margin of the trigonid; there is no distinct cusp (a paraconid) at the front of the trigonid on the p4, but this cusp is present in the molars.|$|E
40|$|The {{generalized}} {{lymphoproliferative disease}} (gld) and lymphoproliferation (lpr) mutations induce {{the development of}} strikingly similar autoimmune and lymphoproliferative syndromes in C 57 BL/ 6 mice (B 6). These syndromes are characterized by hyperglobulinaemia, high levels of circulating autoantibodies and significant splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy resulting principally from the accumulation of a double negative CD 4 /CD 8 T-cell population. These similarities led to {{the suggestion that the}} gld and lpr mutations affect two different steps of a common metabolic pathway controlling the differentiation of the T cells. By transferring haematopoietic cells into sublethally irradiated recipients we provide evidence for the different aetiology of the gld- and lpr-induced syndromes. The [gld [...] gld] <b>chimaeras</b> developed a gld-induced syndrome, like the [lpr [...] lpr] <b>chimaeras</b> developed a lpr-induced syndrome. However, in contrast to the severe lymphoid aplasia observed in the [lpr [...] wild] <b>chimaeras,</b> the [gld [...] wild] <b>chimaeras</b> showed an attenuated form of the gld-induced syndrome. The [lpr [...] gld] <b>chimaeras</b> developed a lymphoid aplasia (as in the [lpr [...] wild] <b>chimaeras).</b> This result shows that the gld environment cannot substitute for the lpr environment and allow for the emergence of an lpr-induced pathology...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -In {{spite of}} early {{acquisition}} upon the germ line, tolerance to the Gross (gs) virus is short-lived in the AKR. From {{about the age}} of 3 months anti-gs antibodies occur and these complex with the corresponding viral antigens. Such complexes are best seen in the glomeruli by means of immunofluorescence. In marked contrast to the AKR, renal complexes were minimal in a group of AKR-CBA/H-T 6 <b>chimaeras</b> derived by early embryo aggregation. This was particularly surprising since large numbers of type C murine leukaemia virus-like particles were identified in the <b>chimaeras</b> and the tissues were found to be saturated with gs antigen. The lack of renal antigen-antibody complexes was the first suggestion that anti-gs antibody might not be present in the <b>chimaeras</b> and renal elution studies here support this assumption. In contrast to the AKR where " split " renal eluates have been shown to have anti-gs activity, no activity was demonstrated in eluates from any of the <b>chimaeras.</b> Tolerance to the oncogenic Gross virus in the <b>chimaeras</b> has to be attributed to the CBA parental strain component and since this component is also held responsible for the tumour resistance of these <b>chimaeras,</b> both phenomen...|$|R

5|$|In 1985, Zhao Xijin named two Megalosaurus species {{found in}} Tibet. He had earlier {{mentioned}} these species in an unpublished dissertation of 1983, implying they initially were invalid nomina ex dissertatione. However, his 1985 publication {{did not contain}} descriptions so the names are still nomina nuda. The first species was Megalosaurus dapukaensis, named for the Dapuka Group. It was, in the second edition of The Dinosauria, by mistake spelled as Megalosaurus cachuensis. The second species was Megalosaurus tibetensis. In 1987/1988, Monique Vianey-Liaud renamed Massospondylus rawesi (Lydekker, 1890), based on specimen NHMUK R4190, a tooth from the Maastrichtian of India, into Megalosaurus rawesi. This is a nomen dubium, a possible member of the Abelisauridae. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul renamed Torvosaurus tanneri Galton & Jensen 1979 into Megalosaurus tanneri. The change has found no acceptance. In 1973, Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky had renamed Poekilopleuron schmidti Kiprijanow 1883 into a Megalosaurus sp. However, as it is formally impossible to change a named species into an unnamed one, George Olshevsky in 1991 used the new combination Megalosaurus schmidti. It is a <b>chimaera.</b> In 1993, Ernst Probst and Raymund Windolf by mistake renamed Plateosaurus ornatus Huene 1905 into Megalosaurus ornatus by mentioning the latter name in a species list. This {{can be seen as}} a nomen vanum. The same publication listed the ichnospecies Megalosauropus teutonicus Kaever & Lapparent 1974 as a Megalosaurus teutonicus. In 1997, Windolf renamed Saurocephalus monasterii Münster 1846, based on a tooth found near Hannover, into Megalosaurus monasterii. It is a nomen dubium, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda. In 1998, Peter Malcolm Galton renamed Zanclodon cambrensis Newton 1899, based on a left lower jaw, specimen BGS 6532 found at Bridgend, into ?Megalosaurus cambrensis because it was not a basal sauropodomorph. It is a senior synonym of Gressylosaurus cambrensis Olshevsky 1991. The specific name refers to Cambria, the Latin name of Wales. It probably represents a member of the Coelophysoidea, or some other predatory archosaur.|$|E
5|$|The upper molars of Dermotherium <b>chimaera</b> are {{triangular}} {{in overall}} shape and much broader than long, with the narrow {{end of the}} triangle pointing lingually. The M2 from Pakistan that was tentatively placed in D.chimaera is slightly smaller than Thai fossils of the species, but otherwise very similar. The crest in front of and behind the major cusps on the buccal side of the tooth, the paracone and metacone, are well-developed, together forming a long W-shaped ridge. D.chimaera resembles the Philippine colugo in that the crests behind the paracone {{and in front of}} the metacone form an acute angle with each other, so that together they form a V; their shape rather resembles an U in the Sunda colugo. A cingulum (shelf) is present on the buccal margin of the tooth, but this cingulum is rather weak in the Pakistani fossil. On the M2, smaller cusps, the paraconule and metaconule, are present on the lingual sides of the paracone and metacone, but on the M1 the paraconule is missing and the metaconule is small and ridgelike. The small cusps are better developed in the Pakistani M2. A third major cusp, the protocone, is present on the lingual side of both upper molars. This crest is displaced towards the front in the living colugos, but less so in D.chimaera. Two strong crests descend from the front and back faces of the protocone in a buccal direction. These crests end in small cusps (protoconules) that are directly lingual to the paracone and metacone. The living colugos lack these protoconules. The enamel is wrinkled on the flanks of the paracone and metacone and, in the Thai but not the Pakistani specimens, on the lingual side of the protocone. Enamel wrinkling is also seen in some Philippine colugos.|$|E
