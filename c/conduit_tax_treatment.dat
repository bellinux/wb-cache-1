40|$|This Article argues that, while important, {{efficiency}} considerations {{should not}} {{function as the}} sole arbiter of the boundary between corporate and <b>conduit</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treatment.</b> First, classical corporate taxation is, in many ways, deeply embedded within a larger network of legal and social meanings. Classical corporate taxation operates in concert with, rather than separately from, these legal and social meanings. For this reason, the rules governing entities’ tax classification should take these interrelationships into account, if not as a primary norm, then as a secondary consideration when empirical or other uncertainties preclude a clear choice based on efficiency. The social boundaries of corporate taxation refer {{to the extent to}} which these types of nontax considerations implicate the Code’s structural distinction between corporations and conduits. 9 Second, efficiency is often conceptually tractable as a metric, but this intuitive appeal can mask significant empirical uncertainties about behavioral responses, especially if policymakers possess limited information, have difficulty reversing inapposite decisions, or face other constraints. In these situations, policymakers should take cues from the broader legal and social context in which tax law operates. Finally, by claiming that corporate tax law is situated in broader legal and social contexts, this Article does not attempt to validate or valorize the independent merit of these other contexts.

40|$|Historically, the tax law {{distinction}} between corporate and conduit treatment drew primarily on doctrinal understandings, treating state-law corporations as corporate for tax purposes and classifying unincorporated legal entities {{based on their}} resemblance to conventional state-law corporations. More recently, commentators and Treasury have abandoned these doctrinal touchstones in favor of efficiency, broadly construed, as the guiding principle in determining an entity’s tax classification.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of IRA/ 401 (k) s on U. S. {{personal}} saving is examined using household survey data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. The {{results suggest that the}} <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of IRA/ 401 (k) s encouraged households to increase the share of assets held in the form of pension savings, at the expense of saving in the form of housing equity. Some evidence also was found to suggest that the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of pension savings similarly affected the flow of saving. In particular, the data appeared to reject the hypothesis that the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of IRA/ 401 (k) s increased total personal saving. ...|$|R
40|$|The current {{concessional}} <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> {{of long-term}} capital gains creates {{an incentive for}} long-term shareholders to sell rights rather than participate in rights issues of shares by Australian companies. To achieve consistent <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of rights issues, we derive adjustments {{that can be made}} to the cost base of shares in companies which have made rights issues. * Inconsistencies exist in the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of investors participating in rights issues of shares by Australian companies and this <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> contains an error of logic, whereas, these issues do not exist when rights are sold. The efficiency consequences of this inconsistent treatment arise because of the concessional <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of long-term capital gains. We derive an appropriate adjustment to the deemed purchase price of shares for capital gains tax calculations associated with rights issues, which prevents a rights issue from adversely affecting existing shareholder tax obligations.

40|$|In Europe, the {{preferential}} <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> {{of company}} cars implies that many employees receive a company car {{as part of}} their compensation package. In this paper, we consider a model in which wages and the decision whether or not to provide a company car are the result of direct negotiation between employer and employee. Using this framework, we theoretically and numerically study first- and second-best optimal tax policies on labour and transport markets, focusing {{on the role of the}} <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars. We show that higher labour taxes and a more favourable <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars raise the fraction employees that receives a company car; congestion and congestion tolls reduce it. More importantly, we find that earlier models that ignored the preferential <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars may have substantially underestimated optimal congestion tolls in Europe. The numerical illustration, calibrated using Belgian data, suggests that about one third of the optimal congestion toll is due to the current <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars. We further find that eliminating the preferential <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars is an imperfect [...] but easy to implement [...] substitute for currently unavailable congestion tolls: it yields about half the welfare gain attainable through optimal congestion taxes. Finally, the favourable <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars justifies large public transport subsidies; the numerical results are consistent with zero public transport fares. ...|$|R
40|$|Where a {{lump sum}} is paid on {{termination}} of employment {{there are a number}} of tax consequences that may arise. The <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of {{a lump sum}} will depend on the circumstances surrounding the payment and what the payment refers to. In some circumstances a lump sum will give rise to <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> that is concessional in nature while in other circumstances the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of the lump sum will be more in the nature of a penalty.
