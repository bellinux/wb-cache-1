5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} source of new genes in {{eukaryotic}} lineages is gene duplication, which creates <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variation {{of an existing}} gene in the genome. The resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family. Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent {{a major source of}} evolutionary biodiversity. Sometimes, gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene, or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes.|$|E
25|$|The AMY1 gene <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> {{has been}} found to be {{correlated}} to different levels of starch in diets of different populations. 8 Populations from different continents were categorized into high starch diets and low starch diets and their AMY1 gene <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> was visualized using high resolution FISH and qPCR. It was found that the high starch diet populations which consists of the Japanese, Hadza, and European American populations had a significantly higher (2 times higher) average AMY1 <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> than the low starch diet populations including Biaka, Mbuti, Datog, Yakut populations. It was hypothesized that the levels of starch in one’s regular diet, the substrate for AMY1, can directly affect the <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> of the AMY1 gene. Since it was concluded that the <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> of AMY1 is directly correlated with salivary amylase, the more starch present in the population’s daily diet, the more evolutionarily favorable it is to have multiple copies of the AMY1 gene. The AMY1 gene was the first gene to provide strong evidence for evolution on a molecular genetics level. Moreover, using comparative genomic hybridization, <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variations of the entire genomes of the Japanese population was compared to that of the Yakut population. It was found that the <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variation of the AMY1 gene was significantly different from the <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variation in other genes or regions of the genome, suggesting that the AMY1 gene was under a strong selective pressure that had little or no influence on the other <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variations. Finally, the variability of length of 783 microsatellites between the two populations were compared to <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variability of the AMY1 gene. It was found that the AMY1 gene <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> range was larger than that of over 97% of the microsatellites examined. This implies that natural selection played a considerable role in shaping the average number of AMY1 genes in these two populations. However, as only 6 populations were studied, it is important to consider the possibility that there may be other factors in their diet or culture that influenced the AMY1 <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> other than starch.|$|E

Using quantitative PCR we determined the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene <b>copy</b> <b>numbers</b> from multiple groups of 15 or 20 pyramidal neurons, GFAP(+) astrocytes and dentate granule neurons isolated using laser capture microdissection, and the relative expression of mitochondrial biogenesis (mitobiogenesis) genes in hippocampi from 10 AD and 9 control (CTL) cases. AD pyramidal but not dentate granule neurons had significantly reduced mtDNA <b>copy</b> <b>numbers</b> compared to CTL neurons.

25|$|Research {{has shown}} that <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> {{variations}} are significantly more common in genes that encode proteins that directly interact with the environment than proteins {{that are involved in}} basic cellular activities. It was suggested that the gene dosage effect accompanying <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variation may lead to detrimental effects if essential cellular functions are disrupted, therefore proteins involved in cellular pathways are subjected to strong purifying selection. In addition, proteins function together and interact with proteins of other pathways, therefore it is important to view the effects of natural selection on bio-molecular pathways rather than on individual proteins. With that being said, it was found that proteins in the periphery of the pathway are enriched in <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variations whereas proteins {{in the center of the}} pathways are depleted in <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variations. It was explained that proteins in the periphery of the pathway interact with fewer proteins and so a change in protein dosage affected by a change in <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> may have a smaller effect on the overall outcome of the cellular pathway.|$|E

25|$|Amylase is {{an enzyme}} in saliva that is {{responsible}} for the breakdown of starch into monosaccharides, and one type of amylase is encoded by the alpha-amylase gene (AMY1). The AMY1 locus, as well as the amylase enzyme, {{is one of the most}} extensively studied and sequenced gene in the human genome. Its homologs are also found in other primates and therefore it is likely that the primate AMY1 gene is ancestral to the human AMY1 gene and was adapted early in primate evolution. AMY1 is a particularly interesting gene to examine as it is one of the most well studied genes which has wide range of variable numbers of copies throughout different human populations. The AMY1 gene is also one of the few genes that had been studied that displayed convincing evidence which correlates its protein function to its <b>copy</b> <b>number.</b> <b>Copy</b> <b>number</b> is known to alter transcription as well as translation levels of a particular gene, however research has shown that the relationship between protein levels and <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> is variable. In the AMY1 genes of European Americans it is found that the concentration of salivary amylase is closely correlated to the <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> of the AMY1 gene.

However, these molecules often exist in low <b>copy</b> <b>numbers</b> and {{are difficult to}} detect in single cells. We carried out quantitative system-wide analyses of protein and mRNA expression in individual cells with single-molecule sensitivity using a newly constructed yellow fluorescent protein fusion library for Escherichia coli. We found that almost all protein number distributions can be described by the gamma distribution with two fitting parameters which, at low expression levels, have clear physical interpretations as the transcription rate and protein burst size. At high expression levels, the distributions are dominated by extrinsic noise. We found that a single cell’s protein and mRNA <b>copy</b> <b>numbers</b> for any given gene are uncorrelated.

The study found 134 genes that showed human lineage-specific increases in <b>copy</b> <b>number,</b> one of which, MGC8902 (also known as NBPF15, cDNA IMAGE:843276), encoded 6 DUF1220 domains. DUF1220 protein domains are found almost exclusively in the NBPF gene family (which includes the MGC8902 gene), which was independently identified as a result of the first member of this family being disrupted in an individual with neuroblastoma. It was recently found that the exceptional increase in human DUF1220 <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> was the results of intragenic domain hyper-amplification primarily involving the three-domain unit called the HLS DUF1220 triplet. Hyper-amplification of the triplet resulted in the addition of ~149 copies of DUF1220 specifically to the human lineage since its divergence from the Pan species, chimpanzee and bonobo, approximately 6 million years ago. The ancestral DUF1220 domain is not part of the NBPF family but rather is found as a single copy within the PDE4DIP (Myomegalin) gene. PDE4DIP encodes a centrosomal protein and is a homolog of CDK5RAP2, a gene that lacks DUF1220 sequences and, when mutated, has been implicated in microcephaly.|$|E

25|$|The {{characterization}} of mtDNA via real-time {{polymerase chain reaction}} assays shows the presence of quantitative alteration of mtDNA <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> in many cancers. Increase in <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> is expected to occur because of oxidative stress.

Any increase/decrease in <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> then remains constant within tumor cells. The fact that the amount of mtDNA is constant in tumor cells suggests that the amount of mtDNA is controlled by a much more complicated system in tumor cells, rather than simply altered as a consequence of abnormal cell proliferation.

40|$|A quantitative, {{real-time}} PCR (Q-PCR) assay for {{the functional}} gene adenosine 5 &# 180;-phosphosulfate reductase (aprA) of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was designed. This assay was applied together with described Q-PCR assays for dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrA) and the 16 S rRNA gene of total Bacteria to marine sediments from the Peru margin (0 – 121 meters below seafloor (mbsf)) and the Black Sea (0 – 6 mbsf).
