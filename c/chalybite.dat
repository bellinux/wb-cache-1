40|$|Many {{minerals}} uch as siderite (= <b>chalybite)</b> and ferriferrous chlo-rites {{give rise}} to ferrous oxide on heating. At high temperatures this will be immediately oxidized to hematite if free access to air is per-mitted. The case of siderite requires special consideration {{as it is a}} constituent of coals and the 2. 79 z ~ line may well be due to residual siderite. On heating siderite in vacuum at 550 ~ C, both FeO and F% 04 have been reported to form (Bernal, Dasgupta, and Mackay, 1959), the latter from FeO itself by disproportation. The same process may {{give rise to}} hematite and wiistite with differing cell size. Acknowledgements. The author gratefully acknowledges the keen interest and encouragement shown by Dr. M. V. 1 N.
