Participants received 1050 training trials on the specific effector system before being transferred to the untrained one. Results indicated a <b>clear</b> <b>transfer</b> from handling to walking and only a moderate transfer from walking to handling.

40|$|The hazard {{function}} {{describes the}} conditional probability that an event {{will occur at}} a given moment, given {{that it has not}} yet occurred. In warned reaction time tasks, it is a classical finding that the response to a target stimulus is faster as its hazard is higher, which has led to the widespread belief that hazard somehow drives temporal preparation. Alternatively, recent cognitive theories propose that temporal preparation is driven by memory traces of earlier timing experiences. To distinguish between these views, we presented different groups of participants with different distributions of foreperiods between temporal cues and target stimuli. Three experiments revealed <b>clear</b> <b>transfer</b> effects of this manipulation in a test phase where all participants received, after explicit instruction, the same uniform distribution. These findings demonstrate that temporal preparation is driven by past experience, not by current hazard...|$|R

40|$|Considering the {{importance}} of prospective memory for independence in old age recently, research has started to examine interventions to reduce prospective memory errors. Two general approaches can be proposed: (a) process training of executive control associated with prospective memory functioning, and/or (b) strategy training to reduce executive task demands. The present study {{was the first to}} combine and compare both training methods in a sample of 62 community-dwelling older adults (60 – 86 years) and to explore their effects on an ecologically valid everyday life prospective memory task (here: regular blood pressure monitoring). Even though the training of executive control was successful in enhancing the trained ability, <b>clear</b> <b>transfer</b> effects on prospective memory performance could only be found for the strategy training. However, participants with low executive abilities benefited particularly from the implementation intention strategy.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{building}} on the discovery of circulating DNA in human blood by Mandel and Metais, Leon and his collaborators developed a radioimmunoassay for measuring nanogram quantities of nucleic acids in serum. This technique enabled them to observe that cancer patients tended to possess a greater quantity of circulating DNA in serum (on average) than their healthy counterparts. This led Stroun to explore if other methods could be developed to not only detect the overall abundance of nucleic acids in patients with disease (and specifically cancer) but to also detect the disease-specific components of such circulating nucleic acids themselves. Unlike bacterial transformations in plants and animal cells involving <b>clear</b> <b>transfer</b> of separately identifiable nucleic acids, {{it was not clear}} how malignancy in cancer arose, although there were many competing theories. Stroun’s postulate that neoplastic malignancy was associated with the presence of tumor specific nucleic acids, led to extensive research by his group of circulating nucleic acids in cancer patients in the late 1980s.|$|R
40|$|The Kiel {{locomotor}} maze requires {{participants to}} choose five targets from among 20 locations marked by small red {{lights on the}} floor of a dimly lit circular environment having four wall-mounted extramaze cues and two intramaze cues at floor level. In the present study, acquisition of the real task was examined in 11 -year-old children following prior accurate training in a virtual version, following misleading virtual training, or following no training. The virtual version was displayed on a desk-top computer monitor. Acquisition testing in the real maze was either locomotor or non-locomotor. Good transfer was achieved from virtual to real versions. Children’s exploration of the real maze prior to real maze acquisition training revealed a <b>clear</b> <b>transfer</b> of spatial information previously learned in the virtual version. Children taught the correct target configuration in the simulation made fewer errors and more rapid, confident responses to targets in the real maze than children given no training. However, acquisition was also better following misleading training than no training, suggesting that a non-specific components of performance also transferred. Male superiority was only seen following misleading training, which was interpreted in terms of male superiority in mental rotation. After acquisition, a single probe trial was performed, in which proximal cues and participants’ starting position were rotated, but this had equivalent effects on all groups’ performance. It is <b>clear</b> that <b>transfer</b> of spatial information occurs from the simulated Kiel maze to the real version. This has implications for its use in diagnosis and training...|$|R

30|$|We {{discussed}} the modeling, simulation and (at least the vision) of the optimization of acoustic fields. As {{an example of}} our industrial cooperation we studied frequency domain computations and modal reduction methods for the acoustic field inside a car, {{as well as the}} challenges of the resulting linear systems and eigenvalue problems. One lesson from the project was that the methods to be used in industrial practice cannot be constructed and implemented using textbook approaches. For instance, very often tricks have to be employed that increase the efficiency of the computation, but that lack a full mathematical understanding. This can lead to misunderstandings between engineers, programmers and mathematicians. A stronger communication and cooperation between these groups is necessary to address the described challenges. If this is achieved then all sides benefit from a cooperation. The work with SFE GmbH on the frequency response problem for interior acoustic field computation started out as a <b>clear</b> <b>transfer</b> project (a one way street), with the idea to transport the knowledge and know-how about current linear system and eigenvalue solver technologies available in the academic environment into an industrial software environment.|$|R
