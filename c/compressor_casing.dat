The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken <b>compressor</b> <b>casing.</b> The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E

In the subsequent Power Jets W.1 the compressor material was changed to RR.59. By 1943 the de Havilland Goblin, the first British production jet engine {{to be built in}} large numbers, was in development. The centrifugal compressor for this began as a 500lb 'cheese' of RR.50, the largest forging made of it. After machining, these were reduced to 109lbs. The size of this forging was so great that cooling rates in its centre affected the metallurgical properties of the alloy; Devereux advised the reduction of the silicon content to below 0.25% and this low silicon RR.50 alloy was used throughout Goblin production.|$|E
50|$|The RB162 was {{designed}} to meet an anticipated need for a lift engine to power VTOL aircraft {{with the emphasis on}} simplicity, durability and lightweight construction. Development costs were shared by Britain, France and Germany after signing a joint memorandum of agreement. The engine featured fibre glass <b>compressor</b> <b>casings</b> and plastic <b>compressor</b> blades to save weight which also had the effect of reducing production costs. The engine has no oil system, a metered dose of oil instead being injected into the two main bearings by the compressed air used to turn the compressor at startup. Although the RB.162 was a successful design the expected large VTOL aircraft market did not materialise and the engine was only produced in limited numbers.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} {{engine was}} not officially accepted, {{because at that}} time the US government was informed of British work on jet engines. However, Price was encouraged by USAAF officials at Wright Field to refine his design. His redesign incorporated two sixteen-stage axial compressors with a single stage of intercooling. The first four stages of the forward compressor remained clutched to allow them to operate at optimum speed. The turbine was reduced to four stages. The low-pressure compressor was encased in a two-part cylindrical casing with stiffening ribs, which gave it an odd appearance similar to the bottom of an egg carton. The shorter high-pressure compressor was similarly encased but with ribs running front-to-back only. Power was taken off between the two compressor stages to power accessories, with the gearbox placed {{on the top of the}} engine outside of the <b>compressor</b> <b>casings.</b>|$|R
40|$|The NASA Lewis Research Center has {{developed}} and implemented a unique process for forming flawless three-dimensional, compound-curvature laser windows to extreme accuracies. These windows represent an integral component of specialized nonintrusive laser data acquisition {{systems that are}} used in a variety of compressor and turbine research testing facilities. These windows are molded to the flow surface profile of turbine and <b>compressor</b> <b>casings</b> and are required to withstand extremely high pressures and temperatures. This method of glass formation could also be used to form compound-curvature mirrors that would require little polishing and for a variety of industrial applications, including research view ports for testing devices and view ports for factory machines with compound-curvature casings. Currently, sodium-alumino-silicate glass is recommended for three-dimensional laser windows because of its high strength due to chemical strengthening and its optical clarity.

50|$|Nevertheless, on 19 May 1943 Price {{agreed to}} start a more radical {{redesign}} {{at the urging of}} Wright Field. He produced a much simpler design consisting of two sixteen-stage axial compressors with a single stage of intercooling between them. The first four stages of the frontmost compressor remained clutched to allow them to operate at optimum speed. For testing purposes the compressor blades had no airfoil shaping and were attached to the central hub on rotating mounts to allow their angles to be changed between runs. The turbine was reduced to four stages. The low-pressure compressor was encased in a two-part cylindrical casing with stiffening ribs, which gave it an odd appearance similar to the bottom of an egg carton.

40|$|Case StudyThe {{purpose of}} this case study is to present an {{investigation}} of substantial damage to the rotor of a large centrifugal propane refrigeration compressor that is installed in an 800 MTPA Ethylene plant. After ten years of normal operation since its commissioning, the compressor was shut down during the plant?s scheduled turnaround to carry out peripheral inspection. As {{the speed of the}} compressor?steam turbine train was reduced; an abnormal sound was heard by the field operators. Instead of looking for the possible cause(s), the shutdown sequence was completed. Even twenty four hours after shutdown, the <b>compressor?s</b> <b>casing</b> remained unusually hot. This was a cause of concern. After deliberations, the train was isolated and released for external inspection. On decoupling the compressor, it was noticed that its rotor could not be moved axially and many attempts to turn the shaft to verify if there was binding proved to be unsuccessful. This case study outlines the sequence of events, the details of inspection, and the root cause analysis of the failure. It concludes with an understanding of thermal rub phenomenon and the primary causes which resulted in rotor-to-stator scuffing...|$|R
40|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are commonly}} used within the process industries as prime movers. For many years, plants have been designed with "single train", unspared, major machinery {{in order to reduce}} construction, operating, and maintenance costs. This has resulted in many of the compressors being quite large, operating at power levels in the 10, 000 to 50, 000 horsepower range. When new, the machines are aerodynamically and mechanically designed and built to {{the state of the art}} as it exists at that time. However, these <b>compressor</b> <b>casings</b> are commonly rerated in later years when process modifications or plant expansions dictate duty changes, and the state of the art has advanced. But because of design constraints imposed by the characteristics of the reused hardware, the assumptions of the machinery supplier, and less than thorough definition by the owner, the best available new components are not always offered or utilized. Unfortunately, the constraints that result in using "the good", rather than "the best", state of the art, components are often not actually valid. Significant additional operating costs can result, though, when the small efficiency differences between "the good" and "the best" are multiplied by large power consumptions. These unrecoverable, lost opportunities are preventable...|$|R

40|$|The single screw {{compressor}} {{is used in}} many fields such as air compression, chemical industry and refrigeration. During operation, different gas pressures and temperatures applied on the components can cause different degrees of deformation, {{which leads to a}} difference between the thermally induced clearance and the designed clearance.

In this paper, a temperature measurement instrument and a convective heat transfer model were described and used to establish the temperature of a single screw air <b>compressor’s</b> <b>casing,</b> screw rotor and star wheel. 3 -D models of these three main components were built. The gas force deformation, thermal-structure deformation and thermal-force coupling deformation were carried out by using a finite element simulation method. Results show that the clearance between the bottom of the groove and the top of star wheel is reduced by 0. 066 mm, the clearance between the side of groove and the star wheel is reduced by 0. 015 mm, and the clearance between the cylinder and the rotor is reduced by 0. 01 mm.

40|$|LectureCompressors {{for carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) {{applications}} {{have been widely}} used in the O&G industry for urea production, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and CO 2 pipeline services for many years. New environmental challenges have re-focused the attention on increasing the efficiency of rotating equipment including optimization of the equipment configuration. To address these challenges, an electric motor driven CO 2 compressor train has been designed for a large CO 2 injection project in Western Australia. This compressor train was equipped with two <b>compressor</b> <b>casings</b> coupled through two gearboxes on either side of a double-ended variable frequency drive (VFD) motor. For the CO 2 injection project, the risk of condensation inside the carbon steel pipeline between compressor discharge and the injection wells was identified as a concern. The mixture of liquid water and CO 2 results in carbonic acid that may result in corrosion of the carbon steel pipeline. To mitigate this risk the water needs to be removed from the CO 2 stream prior to entering the pipeline. To maximize the removal of water, the CO 2 compressor intermediate stage (3 rd stage) pressure is required to operate within a fixed pressure range. The compressor string with two gearboxes, two <b>compressor</b> <b>casings</b> and a VFD results in a complicated torsional system. In cases where torsional vibration frequencies coincide with resonance frequencies, large torsional deflections and internal stresses could be generated. Continuous operation under these conditions could result in fatigue failure. Free-vibration analysis and a forced-response analysis were conducted for an analytical review of rotor response to static and harmonic torsional loads. VFD motors generate pulsating torques; even if the pulsating torques are very small with respect to the main torque, they can excite compressor train resonances with potential shaft and/or couplings damages. Final validation of the compressor trains has been the Full Speed, Full Load test and ASME PTC 10 Type 1 performance test campaign conducted in June 2011. During this testing, torque pulsation measurements has been conducted for validation of torsional analytical results and pulsation amplitudes under steady state and start-up conditions. The compressor train was designed to be modularized. This required the package?s overall dimensions to meet very stringent space constraints. The project engineering challenges include: ergonomic design focusing on improving maintenance and operations access, compressor supports stiffness analysis for installation on module steel work and compressor train operability assessment. High CO 2 discharge pressures, high operating temperatures and the need to minimize fugitive emissions result in challenges for the dry gas seals system (DGS) and lead to the design of a highly customized DGS configuration...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{trend of}} high stage pressure ratio with increased aerodynamic loading {{has led to}} reduction in stable operating range of centrifugal compressors with stall and surge initiating at relatively higher mass flow rates. The casing treatment technique of stall control {{is found to be}} effective in axial compressors, but very limited research work is published on the application of this technique in centrifugal compressors. Present research was aimed to investigate the effect of casing treatment on the performance and stall margin of a high speed, 4 [*]:[*] 1 pressure ratio centrifugal compressor through numerical simulations using ANSYS CFX software. Three casing treatment configurations were developed and incorporated in the shroud over the inducer of the impeller. The predicted performance of baseline <b>compressor</b> (without <b>casing</b> treatment) was in good agreement with published experimental data. The compressor with different inducer casing treatment geometries showed varying levels of stall margin improvement, up to a maximum of 18 %. While the peak efficiency of the <b>compressor</b> with <b>casing</b> treatment dropped by 0. 8 %– 1 % compared to the baseline compressor, the choke mass flow rate was improved by 9. 5 %, thus enhancing the total stable operating range.

40|$|LecturePg. 57 - 62 The {{retrofit}} of a 35000 hp, two-case centrifugal, propylene refrigeration compressor with tandem dry {{gas seals}} in DuPont's ethylene plant at Orange, Texas, is described. The installation of these dry gas seals {{is one of}} the first applications to propylene refrigeration service in the United States. The new seal design eliminated seal oil contamination of the compressor and downstream heat exchangers which led to decreased efficiency, effectiveness, and subsequent loss of ethylene production. The seals also reduced the capital investment for a flare system upgrade project $ 1. 5 MM, by decreasing propylene losses during system shutdowns caused by existing seal system shortcomings. This retrofit was unique in several ways. The original compressor manufacturer had no experience with dry gas seals installed in their equipment. They were very willing to cooperate in this venture, but only to the point of providing dimensional data and engineering review. Due to the "sold-out" condition of the ethylene market, this installation had to be accomplished during a limited shutdown. In order to minimize downtime, an innovative installation method was developed which eliminated opening <b>compressor</b> <b>casings</b> even though the new design required removing-a shaft sleeve. To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, a mock up was built simulating working conditions to develop techniques and tooling to remove the shaft sleeve...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 62 The design premise in {{upgrading}} two operating {{plants for}} more compression capability is discussed.

The upgrade concentrates on a carbon monoxide (CO) compressor train which upstaged an original pair of compounded centrifugal <b>compressor</b> <b>casings</b> (15 impellers) to a larger casing (first body), roughly four sizes larger at 14 impellers compound compressor casings(two). The new train uses an available larger horsepower steam turbine available from the previous process conversion and its concrete mezzanine and intercoolers located {{just south of the}} present CO train. The timetable called for conversion in one year, plus shutdown and switchover at 30 to 45 days. The second upgrade required adding a third steam turbine driven centrifugal compressor air train, which had been "mothballed" some 13 years prior. The turbine and compressor rotors were vertically immersed in plant fabricated steel containers holding VSI inhibited ISO 43 turbine oil. The empty casings on a 20 foot mezzanine were coated with a tacky rust preventive and dead head blanketed with nitrogen. The time frame was 18 months.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{investigates the}} effects of {{circumferential}} casing grooves on stall flow characteristics of a transonic axial compressor.

The results of flow analysis for an axial <b>compressor</b> with smooth <b>casing</b> are validated in comparison with experimental data for the pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency. The numerical stall inception point is identified from the last converged point by convergence criteria, and the stall margin is predicted numerically. The peak adiabatic efficiency point is also obtained by reducing the normalized mass flow in the high mass flow region. In order to {{explore the influence of}} number of the circumferential casing grooves on the performance of the compressor, the stall margins and peak adiabatic efficiencies are evaluated compared to the case smooth casing.

50|$|The {{double-sided}} impeller was 28.8 {{inches in}} diameter, compared to 20.68 for the Derwent I, {{to produce an}} airflow of 80 lb/s, while the overall diameter of the engine was 49.5 inches. A scaled up Derwent would have a 60-inch diameter. The <b>compressor</b> <b>casing</b> was based on Whittle's Type 16 W.2/500 compressor case which was more aerodynamically efficient than that on the Derwent but also eliminated cracking. Other design advances included nine new low pressure-drop/high efficiency combustion chambers developed by Lucas and a small impeller for rear bearing and turbine disc cooling. The first engine start was attempted on 27 October 1944. A number of snags delayed the run until nearly midnight, when with almost the entire day and night shift staff watching, {{an attempt was made}} to start the engine, without the inlet vanes, which had not yet been fitted. To everyone's dismay the engine refused to light - positioning the igniter was a trial-and-error affair at the time. On the next attempt, Denis Drew unscrewed the igniter and as the starter motor ran the engine up to speed, lit the engine with an oxy-acetylene torch. The engine was run up to 4,000 lbf and more, and a cheer went up around the assembled personnel. Upon Hooker's arrival next morning, and informed that the inlet vanes had been fitted during the night, Hooker was satisfied to see the thrust gauge needle registering 5,000 lbf, making the B.41 the most powerful jet engine in the world.

40|$|A {{common problem}} occurs when {{refrigerant}} fluids wick inside the insulation of thermocouple wires through a <b>compressor's</b> <b>casing</b> feedthrough and then leak into the adjacent disconnect box outside the casing. Leaking fluids create an unfavorable situation inside the disconnect box and may contaminate the fluids. To address this problem, NASA Lewis Research Center s Manufacturing Engineering Division developed a customized hermetic feedthrough for {{a bank of}} Worthington compressors. In these compressors, bearing temperatures are measured by internal thermocouples embedded in bearings located inside the <b>compressor</b> <b>casings.</b> The thermocouple wires need to be routed outside the casing and read at another location. These wires are short and are terminated to a disconnect strip inside the casing. The bearings operate at about 170 F, but because the casing is filled with R 12 refrigerant oil, the casing has a maximum temperature of about 100 F. The operating conditions of these compressors {{permit the use of}} an epoxy that is compatible with the R 12 fluid. The desired finished product is a stainless steel tube that has been filled solid with epoxy after thermocouple wires bonded and sealed by epoxy have been inserted through its length. Shrink tubing extends from both ends of the tube. The process that was developed to isolate the thermocouple wires from the R 12 fluid follows. For this application, use an 8 -in. -long piece of 0. 500 -in. 304 stainless steel tube with six pairs of 24 -gauge stranded, PTFE-insulated (polytetrafluoroethylene) type "T" thermocouple wires for each feedthrough. Use shrink tubing to strain relief the insulated wires at their exit from the stainless steel tube. Cut the wire to length and identify the location of the stainless steel tube sleeve with masking tape. Then, remove the outer insulation from a 2 -in. section of wire that will be inside the tube, and carefully strip to bare wire a 1 -in. section {{in the middle of the}} section with the outer insulation removed. For an effective seal, the epoxy must penetrate between the strands when stranded conductors are used. Make the seal with epoxy bond on the bare wire. The bare wire must be encapsulated with a thin layer of the epoxy that leaves only a very low profile. These encapsulated wires must cure before the assembly can be continued. Then, inspect the cured wires for complete encapsulation before going to the next step. Insert the wires in the stainless steel tube and orient them so that the epoxied stripped sections are staggered within the tube; then, apply shrink tubing to one end of the cleaned wires, positioning it inside the edge of the tube. The small gaps between the wires on the other end will be used to inject the epoxy into the tube. Let the epoxy cure inside the tube, free of any voids. Then, continue to fill the tube until the entire 8 -in. length is nearly filled, allowing room for the other strain-relieving shrink tubing. Since this first design, the process has been adjusted to fit many needs and situations. Customized feedthroughs have been assembled from various wire types, wire gauges, and/or stainless steel tube passages. The fittings selected to mount these feedthroughs allow their use in other areas, such as pressure or vacuum systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow in the}} {{transonic}} {{front rotor}} stage of a multi-stage axial flow <b>compressor</b> with <b>casing</b> treatment is investigated with experiments and simulations. Measurements of the velocity field in the blade tip region are performed using particle image velocimetry {{in order to determine}} the flow structures in this area. Furthermore the measurements are used to evaluate the quality of corresponding time-accurate 3 D CFD simulations. When comparing simulations of the compressor with and without casing treatment with equal boundary conditions, an increase in total pressure ratio and mass flow is encountered for the <b>compressor</b> with <b>casing</b> treatment. The examination of the flow in the blade tip region presented a flow dominated by the interaction of different vortical structures. The origin of the vortices in the tip region can be attributed to two effects: One type of vortices arises from the interaction of the rotor blade bow shocks with the flow around the trailing edge of the inlet guide vanes. A second type of vortices results from the interaction of the inlet guide vane wakes with the tip leakage vortex of the rotor blades. The casing treatment effects both types of vortices by modulating vortex number and strength. Moreover the casing treatment influences the trajectory and the strength of the tip leakage vortex. The effects of the casing treatment result in increased and more homogeneous axial velocities in the tip region compared to a compressor with smooth wall and hence in a higher mass flow. The examination of the near tip flow field in measurements and simulations showed that simulations are able to reproduce all flow structures which can be encountered in the experiments. Trajectories of transient phenomena like vortex chains are found in good agreement between experiment and simulation. Simulations however present smaller gradients and weaker vortices compared to the measurements. Since the vortex induced flow has a major effect on the main flow through the rotor passage, the weaker vortices in the simulations result in differences in the velocity amplitudes between simulations and measurements...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 39 - 48 A two casing (three-stage) {{high-pressure}} injection compressor train {{driven by}} a gas turbine via a gearbox was full load and full speed performance tested to demonstrate satisfactory aerothermal and rotordynamic performance. During the PTC 10 (1997) Type I testing, rotor instability was observed on the back-to-back (first and second stage) <b>compressor</b> <b>casing.</b> The third stage final <b>compressor</b> <b>casing</b> exhibited anomalous rotor centerline positions in the bearings and rotating stall. This paper discusses the technical analysis, resolution, and retesting to resolve the rotor instability, rotor equilibrium/synchronous response, and rotating stall issues experienced during the testing. It also shows {{the need for additional}} joint industry research to better understand and analyze the use of honeycomb seals in hydrocarbon-gas centrifugal compressors...|$|E

The gas turbine operation history shows that the most fractures occur {{at the beginning of}} the cold seasons which may corroborate the probability that the <b>compressor</b> <b>casing</b> distortion due to the non-uniform temperature distribution, can lead to touch the blades tip section with the casing and their failures. Results show that the temperature distribution on the compressors casing is non-uniform at the cold season and this causes distortion on the casing. The casing distortion reduces clearance between first-row blades and <b>compressor</b> <b>casing.</b> Hence, it is concluded to modify the cooling procedure to prevent the occurrence of such a harmful problem...|$|E

The secondary flow which happens near hub and <b>casing</b> <b>compressors</b> is three dimentional flow separation phenomenon comes from interaction blade boundary layer with casing and hub boundary layers in the compressor. The secondary flow causes secondary losses, blockage effect, and turning angle (deflection) distribution along blade span. The result of the research shows that the increase of the angle of attack reveals lines of constan pressure to be curved forward (upstream) or pressure gives rise to spanwise caused by a strong curl flow. Separation is also increase and cross between two blades. Hence, three dimentional separation region in corner also increase...|$|R

40|$|The Transient Heat Transfer Facility was {{developed}} to test fullscale high pressure <b>compressor</b> and turbine <b>casing</b> air systems using gas turbine engine representative secondary air system conditions. Transient casing response together with blade and disc responses governs achievable tip clearances in both compressors and turbines. This paper investigates the use of air impingement {{as a means to}} speed up the casing response. The thermal growth of the casing was characterised by surface temperature rise over a given period to assess achievable dynamic response. The experimental set-up resembles a typical aircraft engine with features that can lead to circumferential temperature non-uniformities, as evident from the experimental results. The experimental data was compared against numerical predictions from a conjugate heat transfer model. The studies show the significance of analysing the full annulus, at engine representative conditions and the benefit of an impingement array to potentially speed up casing response for future engines...|$|R
