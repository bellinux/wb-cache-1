50|$|The final {{miles of}} the river flowing to the River Irwell have been {{extensively}} modified. The river is culverted underneath the car park of the City of Manchester Stadium (the site of a former gasworks). It is visible under a bridge on Baring Street, close to Piccadilly Station, before running again in a culvert beneath the former UMIST campus (London Road (A6) to Princess Street), then under Hulme Street, until it appears briefly at Gloucester Street before flowing under the former gasworks at Gaythorn, reappearing at City Road East. At the point where Deansgate and Chester Road (A56) meet (under the Bridgewater Viaduct) the river meets the Bridgewater Canal head on, where a sluice gate (a listed structure) allowed water to feed the canal, until the water quality of the Medlock became too polluted for canal use. Normally {{the level of the}} river is several feet below the level of the canal, and the river is carried in a tunnel under the Castlefield canal basin, reappearing at Potato Wharf, where it is supplemented by excess canal water draining into a <b>circular</b> <b>weir.</b> When the river is in spate the tunnel cannot cope and river water enters the canal, flows across the basin, and exits via the weir and manually operated gates. A quarter of a mile further on the Medlock enters the Irwell adjacent to the bottom gate of the disused Hulme Locks.|$|E

40|$|A <b>circular</b> sharp-crested <b>weir</b> is a <b>circular</b> {{control section}} used for {{measuring}} flow in open channels, reservoirs, and tanks. As flow measuring devices in open channels, these weirs are placed {{perpendicular to the}} sides and bottoms of straight-approach channels. Considering the complex patterns of flow passing over <b>circular</b> sharp-crested <b>weirs,</b> an equation having experimental correlation coefficients was used to extract a stage-discharge relation for weirs. Assuming the occurrence of critical flow over the weir crest, a theoretical stage-discharge relation was obtained in this study by solving two extracted non-linear equations. To study the precision of the theoretical stage-discharge relation, 58 experiments were performed on six <b>circular</b> <b>weirs</b> with different diameters and crest heights in a 30 cm-wide flume. The results show that, for each stage above the weirs, the theoretically calculated discharge {{is less than the}} measured discharge, and this difference increases with the stage. Finally, the theoretical stage-discharge relation was modified by exerting a correction coefficient which {{is a function of the}} ratio of the upstream flow depth to the weir crest height. The results show that the modified stage-discharge relation is in good agreement with the measured results...|$|R

It was observed that the cylinder size (i. e. radius of cylindrical weir (R)) has an effect on the (C d). The flow magnification factor (q w /q s) increases with an increase in (H w /R) value and values of (q w /q s) were always higher than one for all values of (H w /R), this means that weirs of cylindrical shape performed better than those of sharp crest for any value of weir radius tested in this study. </p...|$|R
40|$|Different {{construction}} materials with different roughness {{used to make}} circular weirs highly affect surface roughness and, in turn, flow hydraulics passing over these structures.   In the present research, numerous experiments under different hydraulic conditions were performed on a physical model to {{study the effects of}} roughness on flow hydraulics over a <b>circular</b> <b>weir.</b> The flow hydraulics included velocity profile, discharge coefficient and longitudinal water surface profile. The actual water surface elevation and velocity profile at different cross sections were measured using a point gauge and micro current meter, respectively. About 200 experimental tests were performed on a <b>circular</b> <b>weir</b> made of polyethylene with 29. 5 cm height, 30 cm wide, and 7. 5 cm radius. The results showed that for a constant discharge, as the weir surface roughness increases the upstream water level over the weir increases and the discharge coefficient reduces. The velocity profile at upstream sections of the weir crest is extremely different from that over the weir crest while the velocity profile at downstream sections of the weir crest follows the same pattern as those experienced at the weir crest. Also, the increased roughness makes the velocity profile over the weir more uniform, with a higher average velocity. Finally the effects of roughness on velocity values are less near weir in comparison with water surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{most common}} types of weirs are the broad-crested weir, the sharp-crested weir, the circular-crested weir and {{nowadays}} the ogee crest weir. Advantages of the cylindrical weir shape include the stable overflow pattern, the ease to pass floating debris, {{the simplicity of}} design compared to ogee crest design and the associated lower costs. In this study, the authors describe new experiments of <b>circular</b> <b>weir</b> overflows, with eight cylinder sizes, for several weir heights and for five types of inflow conditions: partially-developed inflow, fully-developed inflow, upstream ramp, upstream undular hydraulic jump and upstream (breaking) hydraulic jump. Within {{the range of the}} experiments, the cylinder size, the weir height D/R and the presence of an upstream ramp had no effect on the discharge coefficient, flow depth at crest and energy dissipation. But the inflow conditions had substantial effects on the discharge characteristics and flow properties at the crest. Practically the results indicate that discharge measurements with circular weirs are significantly affected by the upstream flow conditions...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: General {{objective}} of the study This thesis aims to evaluate the hydraulics of an inflatable weir in its fully inflated position to the almost fully deflated position using different diameter circular weirs with varying discharges, by considering {{the change in the}} weir radius and the dynamic pressures on the weir. In the evaluation, three cylindrical weirs were installed in a 2 m wide flume and tested over various discharges. Methodology The three weirs, one with a 300 mm diameter, another with a 250 mm diameter, and the last one with a 100 mm diameter, were used {{to determine the effects of}} over flow water on the weir as seen in the different stages of the normal operation of an inflatable weir. Simulation involved measurement of the upstream and downstream water levels with the weir height involved at stable over flow conditions. Measurement of pressure variations was done on the weir faces with different water inflow rates to the test flume with three pressure sensors installed on each weir at 0 °, 11. 25 ° and 22. 5 ° from the crest to the downstream. Additionally a single 0. 15 m radius weir was tested for pressures 67. 5 °, 78. 75 ° and 90 ° from weir crest. Water level variation on the downstream of the weir was created by means of a variable tail gate to observe its effects. Results of the investigation The effects of upstream arches, stage, radius of curvature, discharge, pressure, energy losses over the weir and the downstream hydraulic jump were investigated in the inflation and deflation of the inflatable weir. The findings were as follows: ►Based on literature by Chanson and Montes (1998), Shabanlou et al. (2013), Schmockeret al. (2011) and Bahzad et al. (2010), upstream arches have insignificant influence onthe performance of the inflatable weir. There is rather reduced afflux due to the shape ofthe upstream of the weir from the Bernoulli’s equation. This shape of the upstream of theweir also contributes to the transport of sediments Gebhardt et al. (2012). ►Investigation of the discharge coefficient and factors influencing showed that: oAs the weir radius is reduced during the deflation, the unit discharge over each weirincreased with increase in head above the crest. oDischarge coefficient of the inflatable weir increases with the increase in head aboveweir crest, and the discharge coefficient is inversely proportional to the radius ofcurvature of the weir. ►Investigation of pressures on the downstream face of the weir models showed that: oThe negative (suction) pressure acting on the downstream face of the weir becomesincreasingly negative with increase in H/R values. oPoint of separation of nappe was seen with pulsations of pressure of the recordpressure. Generally, energy dissipation over the weir decreases with the decrease in the weir radius and the jump is more stable with the smallest <b>circular</b> <b>weir</b> and can be more accurately determined in the case of a small weir. Conclusions and Recommendations The inflatable weir has a high discharge at its fully inflated position. Its hydraulic performance is largely influenced by inflow head and is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature. Nappe pulsation as seen in the nappe vibrations can cause the vibration of weir. Future research on inflatable weirs should aim to monitor the negative pressure on measuring pressures further down the face of the weir because larger negative pressures are expected to develop after 90 ˚ as with this study...|$|E
40|$|Many {{facilities}} for urban drainage systems {{are equipped with}} a pipe overflow structure that can often {{be treated as a}} <b>circular</b> broad-crested <b>weir.</b> Thus it is possible to evaluate the overflow discharge through this device by measuring the water levels in the upstream tank and at the outlet of the pipe. In the present study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to determine a relationship between the discharge and the water levels upstream and downstream of the orifice for a range of diameters between 200 and 600  mm and a relative head up to 2. Over 50 numerical simulations are performed to take into account all the operating conditions of the system: free flow, submerged flow and pressurized flow. A regression is applied to the resulting data in order to obtain an orifice equation valid in both free-flow and submerged-flow regimes. Specific formulas, derived from Bernoulli's theorem, are also given for pressurized flows. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the flow}} {{characteristics}} {{have been investigated}} by measuring separation zone, surface and velocity profiles over the <b>circular</b> crested side <b>weirs.</b> An equation was proposed {{for the length of}} the separation zone using dimensional, statistical and regression analysis. The dimensional analysis showed that the length of separation zone depends on the upstream to the downstream water depth over the side weir, channel width to the downstream water depth and the Froude number. Comparison of the longitudinal and sectional surface profiles showed that the surface profiles at the vicinity of the side weir are non-uniform, due to separation zone close to the side weir. Therefore, the suitable place for measuring the characteristics of flow is along the centre line of the channel. It was observed that the maximum velocity occurred below the surface water which might be due to the secondary flow around the side weir. By increasing the distance far enough from the side weir, the effects of secondary flow were minimized and the velocity profiles tended to be uniform...|$|R
40|$|The Study {{investigates the}} use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to analyze the mean {{characteristics}} of curvilinear flows in selected hydraulic structures. Three chosen turbulence models {{are associated with the}} Volume of Fluid (VOF) scheme to predict the characteristics of the mean flow. Many hydraulic structures in engineering practice involve highly curvilinear flows. Five typical hydraulic structures commonly used for flow regulation or flow measurement are considered in the present study; cut-throat flumes, lateral <b>weirs,</b> sharp-crested <b>weirs,</b> <b>circular</b> spillways, and siphon spillways. Velocity distributions, pressure distributions, water surface profiles, secondary flows, and discharge coefficients are the mean characteristics of flows that are studied. Presently, computing methods and high speed computers are strong tools for engineers. With the help of a properly validated numerical model, one can avoid the time consuming and expensive experimental tests based on the physical models to obtain the characteristics of highly curvilinear flows encountered in hydraulic practices. This is {{based on the fact that}} unlike physical models, it is far simpler to apply changing boundary conditions and flow parameters to a solved numerical model and obtain a flow characteristics for hydraulic structures associated with highly curvilinear flows. The flows in hydraulic structures are turbulent. Hence, one needs to solve numerically the continuity equation and momentum equations, including turbulent stresses, as the governing equations of turbulent flows. Because the above mentioned flows are generally complex and highly curvilinear, the transport equations are needed to model the turbulent stresses in the momentum equations. In the present study, three Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) schemes are used to simulate the turbulent flows. Specifically, the Reynolds stress model (RSM), the Standard k-[varepsilon] model, and the RNG k-[varepsilon] model were used in the present study. Further, the VOF scheme is adopted to find the shape of free surface profile...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{compound}} sharp-crested weirs {{are composed}} from several notches {{and those are}} designedin different shapes. One of the hydraulic advantagesof compound weirs is that atlowflow rate, the bottomnotchacts assimpleweir andwith the creation of morehydraulicheadonits upstream, due to theshape of thenotch, make dischargemeasurement withappropriatesensitivity. In high flow rates, the upper notch prevents of increasing upstream water level and backwater and discharge measurement is possible with acceptable accuracy. The compound sharp-crested weirs {{can be used as}} an appropriate solution for discharge measurement with reasonable accuracy and sensitivity of the extensive range of flows. Relations are derived from this kind of weirs hassufficientaccuracy withobservation of design criteriaandconstructionstandards. The purposeofthisresearch was a laboratory investigation of geometricandhydraulic effective parameterson discharge coefficient of compound arched circular- rectangular sharp-crested weirs in two cases of full width of channel and partially contracted weirs and compare the values of the discharge coefficient of compound and simple rectangular weirs. Materials and Methods:Considering the geometric, kinematic and dynamic variables affecting the free flow of sharp-crested weirs, there are 11 independent variableswiththree main quantities (length, massandtime). Usingdimensional analysis with π-Buckinghammethod,it can bederived thedimansionlessrelationship. In order to assess theeffect of various parametersonthe coefficient ofCd,thedimansionlessdiagramsare used. Inthe state of(h≤h 0), discharge relationship usedinsimplecircular weir. In thestate of(h>h 0), discharge of compound weir is computeted from the linear combination of discharge relationships in <b>circular</b> and rectangular <b>weirs.</b> Experimentsare conducted inthe hydraulic engineering models laboratory, Department of Water Engineering, University of Tabriz, in a rectangular glass-metal flume of 9 m length, 25 cm width and 50 cm height. Aftersetting up the weirs in a relevant place of flume andestablish thesteady flow,experiments were performedinthefree flowon 36 models of weirs. Results and Discussion:In this research, theeffects ofrectangularnotch width, the height of weir crest, the height ofcirculararch notch were investigated forchanges of headwithdimensionless ratios of h/P,h/R,h/h_ 0,h/Bon discharge coefficient. The results showthat fora known headover the weir, discharge coefficient increase about 2 to 10 percent with the development of the rectangular notch width of compound and simple rectangular sharp-crested weirs. For a given head over the weir, discharge coefficient decrease approximately 1 to 5 percent by increasing the height of the weir crest of compound and simple sharp-crested weirs. Fora given head over weir in low head values, discharge coefficient increase approximately 35 percent by reducing the height of circulararch notch in the compound weirs than simple rectangular weirs. Based on statistical indicators, computational and observation discharge coefficient values in most compound and simple weirs, acceptable coincidence with each other. The meanvalues of thecoefficient of determination (R 2) androot mean square error(RMSE) are 0. 630 and 0. 061,respectively. Among the effective factors that indicate the difference, it can be referred to the theoretical equation in the compound state that is obtained by assuming a linear combination of simple weirs. The effect of the lateral walls of the flume, the measurement accuracy of hydraulic head and discharge, the conditions of flow entrance, the extension of the range of empirical equations proposed in literature for discharge coefficient of simple weirs, Other factors contributing to the difference between the estimated and observed values of discharge coefficient. Inthistypeofweirs,the least amount ofdiscontinuityin thetransition region of simple to compound state in head-discharge relationship can be seenin thewide rangeofdischargescomparedwithother kinds ofcompound weirswithhorizontalorslopingcrests. Conclusion:In this research, a seri of experiments conducted to investigate Cd of the compound arched circular-rectangular sharp-crested weirs in both full width of the channel and partially contracted. The advantage of these weirsisdischarge measurement ina wide range. According to the parametersaffecting theweir, Cd has changed from 0. 54 to 0. 89 range in the compound weirs and 0. 55 to 0. 66 range in the simple rectangular weirs. Bychanging the weir specifications, Cd increase about 35 percentthan thesimplerectangular weir. Forchanges of the head by usingthe experimental data, the discharge continuityofthistypeofweir is far more thanthecompound weirs withhorizontal orinclined crests. Based on theevaluation criteria, using alinear combinationofthe discharge relationshipof circularandrectangularsharp-crested weirs, be able to estimate Cd of the compound weirs withacceptable accuracy...|$|R
