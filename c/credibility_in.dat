5|$|The {{decision}} to base the creatures on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, {{a mixture of}} benign and aggressive creatures was deemed necessary. The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their humanoid form evoked empathy, and <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{objected to}} Douglas's speech, stating {{that he had}} opposed the Korea bill {{because it did not}} include aid to Taiwan, and had {{supported}} it once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of the Marshall Plan that Douglas's charge had no <b>credibility.</b> <b>In</b> fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the issue}} of the law of large numbers for fuzzy {{variables}} is considered. Since <b>in</b> <b>credibility</b> theory convergence <b>in</b> <b>credibility</b> implies convergence almost sure, the strong law of large numbers is defined via convergence <b>in</b> <b>credibility,</b> while the weak law of large numbers is defined through convergence almost sure. Based on the convergence results about the unform integrability of fuzzy variables, a sufficient condition of the strong law of large numbers for a class of fuzzy variables with unbounded supports is established...|$|R

5|$|As a senator, McGovern was an {{exemplar of}} modern American liberalism. He became most {{known for his}} outspoken {{opposition}} to the growing U.S.involvement in the Vietnam War. He staged a brief nomination run in the 1968 presidential election as a stand-in for the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy. The subsequent McGovern–Fraser Commission fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process, by greatly {{increasing the number of}} caucuses and primaries and reducing the influence of party insiders. The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment sought to end the Vietnam War by legislative means but was defeated in 1970 and 1971. McGovern's long-shot, grassroots-based 1972 presidential campaign found triumph in gaining the Democratic nomination but left the party badly split ideologically, and the failed vice-presidential pick of Thomas Eagleton undermined McGovern's <b>credibility.</b> <b>In</b> the general election McGovern lost to incumbent Richard Nixon in one of the biggest landslides in American electoral history. Re-elected Senator in 1968 and 1974, McGovern was defeated in a bid for a fourth term in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E

25|$|In Colombia, however, a wave {{of attacks}} by the FARC in June seemed to undo the {{progress}} made in Havana.

These attacks left over one million people without electricity, and the attacks against oil infrastructure created an environmental catastrophe. With these actions, the FARC had sought to regain the military initiative after the hits they suffered from the military in May and put political pressure on the government, but analysts judged that the guerrilla had miscalculated as it had further reduced their <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> {{the eyes of the}} public.|$|E

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Bank of Spain's gold reserves to Moscow has been pointed {{out to be one}} of the main causes of the Spanish monetary crisis of 1937. While the gold became in practice an excellent source of funding, its usage dealt a hard blow against the coined and printed currency of the country. Nationalist efforts to expose the exportation of the gold put the government's financial <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> question, and caused general mistrust among the public. A decree issued by the Ministry of Finance on October 3, 1936, obliging Spaniards to yield all the gold they possessed, caused widespread alarm. Even though the government denied in January 1937 that it had deposited the gold reserves abroad (vide supra), it was forced to acknowledge that it had made various payments with such gold.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{policy was}} {{to support a}} swift war to destroy Serbia that would present a fait accompli to the world. Unlike the three earlier cases dating from 1912 when Austria had asked for German {{diplomatic}} support for a war against Serbia, {{this time it was}} felt that political conditions for such a war now existed. At this time, the German military supported the idea of an Austrian attack against Serbia as the best way of starting a general war, whereas Wilhelm believed that an Austro-Serbian war would be purely local. Austrian policy based upon pre-existing plans to destroy Serbia involved not waiting to complete judicial inquiries to strike back immediately and not to strain its <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> the coming weeks as it would become more and more clear that Austria was not reacting to the assassination. Likewise, Germany wished to give the impression of its ignorance of Austrian intentions.|$|E
25|$|However, due to {{his poor}} {{performance}} in economy and diplomacy, Roh was not a popular president, having the worst approval rating on average ever recorded in South Korean political history. His economic policy was often criticized for persisting with certain obsolete economic views and failing certain livelihood issues. There had been a considerable diplomatic dissonance between South Korea and its traditional allies during Roh's presidency as well. Former Bush administration officials such as Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates, in their memoirs published, claimed that Roh was anti-American and disclosed {{that there had been}} numerous conflicts between the U.S. and South Korea because of Roh's unpredictability. There has been criticism that Roh's anti-Americanism, nationalism, and pro-North Korean views contributed to a contradiction in diplomacy and impaired <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> the international community.
