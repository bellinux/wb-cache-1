50|$|Citrus canker {{bacteria}} can enter through a plant's stomata or through wounds on leaves or other green parts. In most cases, younger leaves {{are considered to}} be the most susceptible. Also, damage caused by <b>citrus</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> larvae (Phyllocnistis citrella) can be sites for infection to occur. Within a controlled laboratory setting, symptoms can appear in 14 days following inoculation into a susceptible host. In the field environment, the time for symptoms to appear and be clearly discernible from other foliar diseases varies; it may be on the order of several months after infection. Lower temperatures increase the latency of the disease. Citrus canker {{bacteria can}} stay viable in old lesions and other plant surfaces for several months.|$|E
50|$|The larvae are {{considered}} a serious agricultural pest on Citrus species, such as Aegle marmelos, Atalantia, Citrofortunella microcarpa, Citrus limon, Citrus paradisi, Citrus maxima, Fortunella margarita, Murraya paniculata and Poncirus trifoliate.

The mine consists of a long epidermal corridor with a well-marked central frass line. The mine is mostly lower-surface, but sometimes upper-surface, and rarely on the rind of the developing fruit. <b>Citrus</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> larvae are thus protected from many topic insecticide treatments.

Past <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> population estimates were obtained from NIFOR entomology division from 1976 - 1980. This study analyses temporal patterns in <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> abundance, and elucidates general patterns and factors influencing <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> abundance. Multiple linear regressions were {{used to analyze the}} relationship between abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its parasitoids and predators and the following climatic variables: maximum and minimum temperature (oC), rainfall (mm) and relative humidity (%). For the analyses, climate variables from the month of collection (control variable) or from the month before the collection (delayed variable) were used. The abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> and predatory ants peaked in the dry season, while parasitoids were most abundant in the rainy season. Significant correlations (P is not great than 0. 05) were found between <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables.

40|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lep., Gracillariidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} pest of citrus and related Rutaceae and ornamental plants in Iran. Larvae damage leaves by creating serpentine feeding mines, which have been lead to reduce yield. Resistance and toxicity problems derived from synthetic insecticides have made it necessary to find more effective and healthier alternatives; therefore, bio-insecticides (i. e., Bacillus thuringiensis) are becoming an important component in plant protection. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficiency of B. thuringiensis against P. citrella. Eight B. thuringiensis concentrations were used against P. citrella L 3 on orange and mortality was recorded at 1, 4, 7 and 10 days after spraying. The results showed that B. thuringiensis significantly affected mortality of P. citrella. After 1, 4, 7 and 10 days of spraying 108 concentration of B. thuringiensis had significantly caused the highest mortality to the pest with 59. 8, 68. 4, 73. 6 and 77. 0 %, respectively. Then the mortality percent decreased until it reached 6. 5, 9. 5, 39. 3 and 46. 7 % at 101 concentration, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Fungi {{are one of}} {{the most}} active members in {{biological}} community of cultural soils. Many saprophyte and facultative parasitic fungi live in soil. Metarhizium anisopliae, one of the most famous soil inhabitant entomopathogens has a virulence potential on plant and animal pests. Approach: Introducing a new method for its isolation from soil was an applied method to find it without any limitation. Metarhizium anisopliae shifts to saprophytic phase and remain alive within soil in absence of susceptible host. As a shortcut, we can transfer the fungus from soil to lab by culturing soil suspension. One hundred cultural soil samples from different regions of Iran were tested to finding Metarhizium isolates. Culturing 1 : 5000 - 1 : 10000 soil suspension on artificial medium containing necessary macro and micronutrients for fungal growth were resulted in isolation. Metarhizium anisopliae isolates were harvested seven days after culturing the suspensions.

In the present study, the {{possibility}} of insect mass rearing on four various citrus hosts and the effects of gamma irradiation on the pupal mortality and reproduction of this pest were studied. Trifoliate orange and grapefruit showed less infection, while the number of pupae in Valencia oranges and sweet lemons cages was so high. There was not any significant difference between weight of male and female pupae among different citrus hosts, but generally the weight of male pupae was less than females. Use of Valencia orange or sweet lemons seedlings in especial dark emergence and oviposition cages could be recommended for mass rearing of this pest. In this study, the effects of gamma radiation at doses 100 to 450 Gy on biological and reproductive parameters of the pest has been determined. The results show that mean percent of pupal mortality increased with increasing doses and reached to 28. 67 % at 450 Gy for male pupae and 38. 367 % for female pupae. Also, the mean values of this parameter were higher for irradiated female, which indicated the higher sensitivity of this sex. The gamma ray irradiation from 200 and 300 Gy caused decrease in male and female adult moth longevity, respectively. The eggs were laid by emerged females, and their hatchability was decreased by increasing gamma doses. The fecundity of females in both combinations of crosses (irradiated male × normal female and irradiated female × normal male) did not differ, but fertility of laid eggs by irradiated female × normal male affected seriously and the mean values of this parameter reached to zero at 300 Gy. The hatchability percentage of produced eggs by normal female × irradiated male at 300 Gy was 23. 29 % and reached to less than 2 % at 450 Gy as the highest tested dose.

Differences in vegetation characteristics in study plots did not correlate with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage perhaps because environmental factors act on pest populations at a larger spatial scale.
