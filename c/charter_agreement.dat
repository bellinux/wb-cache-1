25|$|LNG is shipped {{around the}} world in {{specially}} constructed seagoing vessels. The trade of LNG is completed by signing an SPA (sale and purchase agreement) between a supplier and receiving terminal, and by signing a GSA (gas sale agreement) between a receiving terminal and end-users. Most of the contract terms used to be DES or ex ship, holding the seller responsible for the transport of the gas. With low shipbuilding costs, and the buyers preferring to ensure reliable and stable supply, however, contracts with FOB terms increased. Under such terms the buyer, who often owns a vessel or signs a long-term <b>charter</b> <b>agreement</b> with independent carriers, is responsible for the transport.|$|E

40|$|<b>Charter</b> Party <b>agreements</b> {{underpin}} {{the relationship}} between ship owners and charterers. The agreement guarantees {{the performance of a}} vessel in terms of speed and fuel consumption. On this basis the charterers plan the arrival of their cargo and their profit margin. However, ship performance is degraded by age, periods between maintenance and many vessels fail to perform as expected. Moreover the performance is only warranted during the specific conditions stated in the charter party which are not always clear. These usually refer to Beaufort Force (BF) and the Douglas Sea and Swell (DSS) scale which is archaic in the age of Numerical Weather Prediction. Given these conditions, the stage is set for conflict and there are often disputes over the weather conditions experienced. Moreover ships’ often do not arrive on time because the charterer has assumed that the ship will make good its warranted speed and not taken account of the forecast weather conditions. The authors propose a new way of approaching <b>charter</b> <b>agreements</b> with the emphasis on consultation rather than confrontation facilitated by a new web based software platform...|$|R

40|$|In {{container}} shipping industry inter-firm {{agreements are}} becoming progressively popular as ship-owners share their slot capacity with commercial partners {{in order to}} have fully loaded container ships and reduce financial risk. This manuscript focuses on the co-operative agreements among shipping firms, i. e. vessel sharing and slot <b>charter</b> <b>agreements</b> within consortia and strategic alliances. Through a quantitative approach based on network and OLS regression analysis, we scrutinise the propensity to co-operate, the geographic extent and leveraging effect generated by this commercial practise on the container-shipping industry. Results show that carriers, usually regarded as independent, are instead fairly co-operative, especially when involved in trade lanes originating from the Far East. Finally, we show that carriers increase their commercial objectives by leveraging the operated fleet capacity. We conclude with some implications for managers and practitioners as well as a discussion on limitations and future extensions of this study...|$|R
