The <b>capacitive</b> <b>effects</b> are investigated through the thickness and dielectric permittivity of solid insulator. Different solid insulating materials are investigated; the considered liquid is a mineral oil of naphtenic type.

50|$|The <b>capacitive</b> <b>effect</b> of long {{underground}} or undersea cables in AC transmission applications {{also applies}} to AC overhead lines, although to a much lesser extent. Nevertheless, for a long AC overhead transmission line, the current flowing just to charge the line capacitance can be significant, and this reduces the capability of the line to carry useful current to the load at the remote end. Another factor that reduces the useful current carrying ability of AC lines is the skin effect, which causes a non-uniform distribution of current over the cross-sectional area of the conductor. Transmission line conductors operating with direct current do not suffer from either of these constraints. Therefore, for the same conductor losses (or heating effect), a given conductor can carry more current to the load when operating with HVDC than AC.|$|E

40|$|An {{assumption}} {{commonly used}} in cable theory is revised by taking into account electrical amplification due to intracellular <b>capacitive</b> <b>effects</b> in passive dendritic cables. A generalized cable equation for a cylindrical volume representation of a dendritic segment is derived from Maxwell's equations under assumptions: (i) the electric-field polarization is restricted longitudinally along the cable length; (ii) extracellular isopotentiality; (iii) quasielectrostatic conditions; and (iv) homogeneous medium with constant conductivity and permittivity. The generalized cable equation is identical to Barenblatt's equation arising {{in the theory of}} infiltration in fissured strata with a known analytical solution expressed in terms of a definite integral involving a modified Bessel function and the solution to a linear one-dimensional classical cable equation. Its solution is used to determine the impact of thermal noise on voltage attenuation with distance at any particular time. A regular perturbation expansion for the membrane potential about the linear one-dimensional classical cable equation solution is derived in terms of a Green's function in order to describe the dynamics of free charge within the Debye layer of endogenous structures in passive dendritic cables. The asymptotic value of the first perturbative term is explicitly evaluated for small values of time to predict how the slowly fluctuating (in submillisecond range) electric field attributed to intracellular <b>capacitive</b> <b>effects</b> alters the amplitude of the membrane potential. It was found that <b>capacitive</b> <b>effects</b> are almost negligible for cables with electrotonic lengths L > 0. 5, contributes up to 10 % of the signal for cables with electrotonic lengths in the range between 0. 25 < L < 0. 5, and dominates the membrane potential for electrotonically short cables (L < 0. 2).
