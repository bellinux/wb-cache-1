5|$|Michael's domain in Epirus {{became a}} refuge and <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> of the Greeks against the Latin Crusaders. At {{about the same}} time, {{according}} to some modern scholars, he may have led the abortive Greek resistance to the Crusaders in the Peloponnese, which was crushed at the Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras; according to other views, he may have led a campaign there between 1207 and 1209. In order to avoid invasion and buy time to consolidate his position in Epirus, Michael soon entered into negotiations with Pope Innocent III, and concluded treaties with the Latin Empire and the Republic of Venice. In the meantime, his rule received a boost in legitimacy when he ransomed the deposed Alexios III from captivity. According to later chroniclers, Alexios III conferred the hereditary rule of Epirus to Michael and his descendants.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Franco–Belgian forces to hold the Ardennes gap was fatal. The Belgians had {{withdrawn}} laterally upon the initial invasion and had demolished and blocked routes of advance, which held up the French 2nd Army units moving north toward Namur and Huy. Devoid of any <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance,</b> the German assault engineers had cleared the obstacles unchallenged. The delay that the Belgian Ardennes Light Infantry, {{considered to be an}} elite formation, could have inflicted upon the advancing German armour was proved by the fight for Bodange, where the 1st Panzer Division was held up for a total of eight hours. This battle was a result of a breakdown in communications and ran contrary to the operational intentions of the Belgian Army.|$|E

500|$|When other Nazi leaders urged Hitler {{to leave}} Berlin and {{establish}} a new <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> in the National Redoubt in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin. His family (except for Magda's son Harald, who {{had served in the}} Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end. He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January.

2500|$|After 711, in {{the period}} of {{dominance}} of the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors, the Christian Kingdom of Asturias (c.711-910), located in the Northern part of the peninsula, was a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> (see Reconquista). In addition, many Christians (Mozarabs) lived in Moorish territories and were allowed to practicise their religion and build churches. Asturian architecture [...] and Mozarabic art influenced Christian buildings in the future Portuguese territory, as seen on the few structures that have survived from this time. The most important of these is the Church of São Pedro de Lourosa, located near Oliveira do Hospital, which bears an inscription that gives 912 as the year of its construction. The church is a basilica with three aisles separated by horseshoe arches, a narthex on the façade and mullioned, horseshoe-shaped windows of Asturian influence on the central aisle.|$|E
2500|$|The enslaved {{families}} {{formed the}} large {{labour force required}} to work the sugar plantations. After the 1650s the supply of white indentured servants began to dry up due to increased wages in England and less incentive to migrate to the colonies. [...] By {{the end of the}} 17th century, the population of Nevis consisted of a small, rich planter elite in control, a marginal population of poor whites, a great majority of African-descended slaves, and an unknown number of maroons, escaped slaves living in the mountains. In 1780, 90 percent of the 10,000 people living on Nevis were black. Some of the maroons joined with the few remaining Caribs in Nevis to form a resistance force. Memories of the Nevisian maroons' struggle under the plantation system are preserved in place names such as Maroon Hill, an early <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

50|$|That autumn, the {{government}} had just succeeded in putting down a rising in Lincolnshire, when on 13 October 1536, the far more serious Pilgrimage of Grace broke out, mustering an enormous multitude of adherents, {{perhaps as many as}} 40,000. This time, having dealt with the problem, {{the government}} was desperate to stamp out any <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance.</b> Since one <b>of</b> the flashpoints had been the Northern capital of York, it was necessary for the government to mount a lesson in the city.|$|R
25|$|After the {{territorial}} {{changes in the}} Treaty of Versailles (28 June 1919) transferred the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to France, natural resources, industry and population close to the frontier, vital for the prosecution of another war of exhaustion, meant that the French army {{would not be able}} to gain time by retreating into the interior as it had in 1914. By the 1930s, the importance of the two provinces and north-west France had grown in importance to the French economy. How to protect the frontiers was a matter for the French army under the Conseil supérieur de la guerre (CSG, Supreme War Council), which was revived on 23 January 1920. By 1922, two schools of thought had emerged, one led by General Edmond Buat that advocated the building of continuous fortifications along the frontier for a relatively static defence and one supported by Marshal Ferdinand Foch and Marshal Philippe Pétain, which wanted the construction of fortified regions, to act as <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> for offensive action. Armies would manoeuvre around the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> until the most favourable time and conditions for attack. By the end of 1922, majority opinion in the CSG favoured a system that could be used offensively and defensively.|$|R

60|$|That {{there should}} be, in every polity, a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> to the {{predominant}} {{power in the}} Constitution--and in a democratic constitution, therefore, a nucleus {{of resistance to the}} democracy--I have already maintained; and I regard it as a fundamental maxim of government. If any people who possess a democratic representation are, from their historical antecedents, more willing to tolerate such a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> {{in the form of a}} Second Chamber or House of Lords than in any other shape, this constitutes a stronger reason for having it in that shape. But it does not appear to me the best shape in itself, nor by any means the most efficacious for its object. If there are two houses, one considered to represent the people, the other to represent only a class, or not to be representative at all, I can not think that, where democracy is the ruling power in society, the second House would have any real ability to resist even the aberrations of the first. It might be suffered to exist in deference to habit and association, but not as an effective check. If it exercised an independent will, it would be required to do so in the same general spirit as the other House; to be equally democratic with it, and to content itself with correcting the accidental oversights of the more popular branch of the Legislature, or competing with it in popular measures.|$|E

6000|$|It may be {{said that}} the Convention was the proper <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> to the designs of the Committee, and that if Danton and Robespierre had united their forces in the Convention they would have {{defeated}} Billaud and his allies. This seems to us more than doubtful. The Committee had acquired an immense preponderance over the Convention. They had been eminently successful in the immense tasks imposed upon them. They had the prestige not only of being the government--so great a thing in a country that had just emerged from the condition of a centralised monarchy; they had also the prestige of being a government that had done its work triumphantly. We are now in March. In July we shall find that Robespierre adopted the very policy that we are now discussing, of playing off the Convention against the Committee. In July that policy ended in his headlong fall. Why should it have been any more successful four months earlier? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{blockhouse}} {{system had}} been developed to a very complete extent in the Orange River Colony, and the small bands of Boers found {{it increasingly difficult to}} escape from the British columns who were for ever at their heels. The southern portion of the country had been cut off from the northern by a line which extended through Bloemfontein on the east to the Basuto frontier, and on the west to Jacobsdal. To the south of this line the Boer resistance had practically ceased, although several columns moved continually through it, and gleaned up the broken fragments of the commandos. The north-west had also settled down to a large extent, and during the last three months of 1901 no action of importance occurred in that region. Even in the turbulent north-east, which had always been the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance,</b> there was little opposition to the British columns, which continued every week to send in their tale of prisoners. Of the column commanders, Williams, Damant, Du Moulin, Lowry Cole, and Wilson were the most successful. In their operations they were much aided by the South African Constabulary. One young officer of this force, Major Pack-Beresford, especially distinguished himself by his gallantry and ability. His premature death from enteric was a grave loss to the British army. Save for one skirmish of Colonel Wilson's early in October, and another of Byng's on November 14th, there can hardly be said to have been any actual fighting until the events late in December which I am about to describe.|$|E
60|$|The {{practicability}} of {{any real}} check to the ascendancy of the majority depends henceforth {{on the distribution of}} strength in the most popular branch of the governing body; and I have indicated the mode in which, {{to the best of my}} judgment, a balance of forces might most advantageously be established there. I have also pointed out that, even if the numerical majority were allowed to exercise complete predominance by means of a corresponding majority in Parliament, yet if minorities also are permitted to enjoy the equal right due to them on strictly democratic principles, of being represented proportionally to their numbers, this provision will insure the perpetual presence in the House, by the same popular title as its other members, of so many of the first intellects in the country, that without being in any way banded apart, or invested with any invidious prerogative, this portion of the national representation will have a personal weight much more than in proportion to its numerical strength, and will afford, in a most effective form, the moral <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> which is needed. A second Chamber, therefore, is not required for this purpose, and would not contribute to it, but might even, in some degree, tend to compromise it. If, however, for the other reasons already mentioned, the decision were taken that there should be such a Chamber, it is desirable that it should be composed of elements which, without being open to the imputation of class interests adverse to the majority, would incline it to oppose itself to the class interests of the majority, and qualify it to raise its voice with authority against their errors and weaknesses. These conditions evidently are not found in a body constituted in the manner of our House of Lords. So soon as conventional rank and individual riches no longer overawe the democracy, a House of Lords becomes insignificant.|$|E

In addition, so long as they remained in German hands, they had propaganda value.|$|R

The Uprising was to be started in three phases, the first being in the East (with main <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> in Lwów and Wilno), before the advancing Red Army.
