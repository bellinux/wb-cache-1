40|$|Birds are {{the most}} {{frequent}} patients in <b>rescue</b> <b>stations.</b> Vehicular traffic, glass - fronted areas, power lines and also illegal hunting they all endanger birds in modern countryside. Thanks to <b>rescue</b> <b>stations</b> lots of birds injured in this way or ill ones are cured up and returned back to the wild. Thus <b>rescue</b> <b>stations</b> have {{a very important role}} in nature reservation as well as in ecological education. Presented work evaluates extent, means and success rate of handling and treatment of injured birds in <b>rescue</b> <b>stations.</b> The data concerning handling, treatment and aftereffects of the accidents of some injured and handicapped birds were found out in the following rescue stations: Záchranná stanice Třeboň při Českém nadačním fondu pro vydru (<b>Rescue</b> <b>Station</b> Třeboň under Czech Charitable Fund for the Otter), Stanice ochrany fauny Pavlov, o. p. s (Station for Fauna Protection in Pavlov, Social Enterpreneurship), Záchranná stanice pro zraněné živočichy na Huslíku u Poděbrad (<b>Rescue</b> <b>Station</b> for Injured Animals in Huslík near Podebrady) and Záchranná stanice pro živočichy ČSOP Vlašim (<b>Rescue</b> <b>Station</b> for Animals of the Czech Federation of Nature Protectors Vlašim). The numerical trend of the most common types of injuries was also carried out and in this case records of the <b>rescue</b> <b>stations</b> from 2008 2014 were used as the base. Each of the <b>rescue</b> <b>stations</b> has its own ways of treatment and handling the injured birds which sometimes differ from the ones in other stations. Some stations do not have any experience with some kinds of injuiries. The worst therapy is to cure poisoned birds and those burnt by electric current and poisoning. The most common cause of the receipt of birds in the mentoined stations was the hospital admission of non- independent young animals...|$|R
