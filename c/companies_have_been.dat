5|$|Over the city's history {{many large}} oil <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{headquartered}} in the city, including Warren Petroleum (which merged with Gulf Oil {{in what was}} then the largest merger in the energy industry), Skelly Oil, Getty Oil and CITGO.

5|$|Hollywood, a {{northern}} district of Los Angeles, California, {{is one of}} the leaders in motion picture production. The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> subject to the forces of globalization.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the city}} bought the two private systems. Some {{elevated}} lines ceased service immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was slow, but several connections were built between the IND and BMT; these now operate as one division called the B Division. Since the IRT tunnels, sharper curves, and stations {{are too small}} and therefore can not accommodate B Division cars, the IRT remains its own division, the A Division. However, many passenger transfers between stations of all three former <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created, allowing the entire network {{to be treated as}} a single unit.|$|E

5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is {{responsible}} for general strategy in {{the oil and gas}} sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is generally considered {{to be the most important}} energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> permitted to search for oil or gas.|$|E
5|$|The companies' {{first major}} {{projects}} were Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, which each proved successful enough to launch video game franchises. Since then, {{the majority of}} the games produced by the <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> localized for Western audiences, although the process was not given a high priority at Square until the international success of Final Fantasy VII. A dedicated localization department was consequently created at the company's Tokyo headquarters around 1998. Enix remained without a translation department until its merger with Square in 2003. In recent years, the process of localization has undergone changes, mainly due to difficult experiences with various titles. Most major titles are now developed with localization running in parallel to development, with more simultaneous releases and even occasional titles developed in localized form first in order to appeal to the Western market.|$|E
