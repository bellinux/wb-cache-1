5|$|To {{facilitate}} foreign {{athletes and}} officials, four immigration counters {{were set up}} at the airport. A time limit of 30 minutes was laid down to clear any athlete or official. To improve security speed, six interpreters of Russian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, French and Arabic were present at the airport. In addition, 24 specially trained immigration personnel were stationed round the <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airport.|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E

5|$|Between 1794 and 1795, in the {{aftermath}} of the French Revolution, the French government briefly mandated decimal clocks, with a day divided into 10hours of 100minutes each. The astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket watch to decimal time. A <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Palais des Tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread. Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the metric system, and it was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Andrew Felton (born 22 September 1987) is an English actor. Felton began {{appearing}} in commercials {{when he was}} eight years old for companies such as Commercial Union and Barclaycard. He made his screen debut in the role of Peagreen <b>Clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Borrowers (1997) and he portrayed Louis T. Leonowens in Anna and the King (1999). He rose to prominence for his role as Draco Malfoy in the film adaptions of the best-selling Harry Potter fantasy novels by J.K. Rowling. His performances in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 won him two consecutive MTV Movie Awards for Best Villain in 2010 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback. Texas' offense thus began its drive at its 20-yard line. The first play of the drive was an end-around that gained 10yards and a first down for Texas. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Mitchell gained five yards on a counter run. On third down, Williams caught a six-yard pass for a first down at the Texas 41-yard line. Mitchell ran six yards on first down, but was stopped after a gain of just one yard on second down. The second-down play caused the final seconds to tick off the <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 1410.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the Clemson 26-yard line, and the drive began with an incomplete pass from Dantzler. After that, the Tigers gained their first down of {{the game with a}} pass from Dantzler to wide receiver Rod Gardner at the 38-yard line. A run by Dantzler gained three yards, then Zachery gained five more with a run to the left side. Zachery's run ran the final seconds off the <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 140.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney was a {{lifeboat}} station {{from around}} 1825 to 1924. Various wall plaques commemorate the boats' rescues and crew losses from 1862, when the RNLI {{took over the}} running of the service, up to the station's closure. There are two blue wooden boards from the RNLI listing the earlier lifeboats and their achievements; the Brightwell (1862), another Brightwell (1863), the Zaccheus Burroughs (1891), and the Hettie (1873). Next to these is a stone plaque listing the rescues from 1877 to 1924, including those of the last lifeboat, the Caroline (1908), and further along the north aisle a painting of George Long, coxswain of the Caroline, is placed above the record of its most famous rescues on consecutive days on 7 and 8 January 1918, when 30 people were saved from two steamers in a storm. A large wooden board acts as a war memorial, listing those locals who died in various military engagements. The <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west tower was donated by a Mrs Cooke in 1945 in memory of her late husband and sons.|$|E

40|$|Circadian rhythms in {{organisms are}} {{involved}} in many aspects of metabolism, physiology, and behavior. In many animals, these rhythms are produced by the circadian system consisting of a central <b>clock</b> located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain and peripheral <b>clocks</b> <b>in</b> various peripheral tissues. The oscillatory machinery and entrainment mechanism of peripheral clocks vary between different tissues and organs. The relationship between the central and peripheral clocks is also tissue-dependent. Here we review the heterogeneous nature of peripheral circadian <b>clocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and their dependence on the central clock, and discuss their significance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temporal organization of physiology in peripheral tissues/organs...|$|R
2500|$|The {{regional}} {{district and}} the municipalities within it observe Mountain Standard Time (UTC−7) year round; {{they do not}} change their clocks for daylight saving time. [...] Hence, from March to November, <b>clocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regional district are synchronized {{with the rest of}} the province, which is on Pacific Daylight Time. [...] During the winter, they are synchronized with <b>clocks</b> <b>in</b> Alberta.|$|R
5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian <b>clock.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E

50|$|Also, {{most of the}} {{province}} of Saskatchewan is on Central Standard Time year-round, never adjusting for Daylight Saving Time.
