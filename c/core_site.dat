5|$|The largest {{change has}} been the {{downgrading}} of the former through route of New England Street in favour of a new north–south road, Fleet Street, which diverges to the west. This has allowed {{a large part of}} New England Street to be narrowed, pedestrianised and provided with cycle lanes. In contrast, Cheapside is expected to take a much higher volume of traffic, as it becomes the main east-west route in the New England Quarter, taking traffic between London Road and Fleet Street, the main north–south road. Two new roads, Stroudley Road and Billinton Road, have been built {{to the west of the}} new Fleet Street, between there and the railway line. These give access to the car park, Bellerbys College and a new pick-up and drop-off point immediately outside the side entrance to the station. Two new pedestrianised squares—Ann Square and New England Square—have also been created within the <b>core</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
5|$|The station {{closed on}} 31 March 2010 {{as part of}} the Ministry of Defence's Project MoDEL, a {{programme}} {{to reduce the number of}} defence sites in Greater London in favour of a <b>core</b> <b>site</b> at RAF Northolt. The closure ceremony was overseen by the Mayor of Hillingdon and included parades and the final lowering of the Royal Air Force Ensign over the parade ground. A Supermarine Spitfire conducted a flypast of the station. The final units marched to their new station at RAF Northolt the following day. The station, which had received the Freedom of the Borough of Hillingdon, returned the award to the London Borough of Hillingdon {{as part of the}} ceremony, though this was returned on 4 September to be stored in the museum of the Battle of Britain Bunker. A commemorative blue plaque dedicated to Douglas Bader was unveiled by the Mayor of Hillingdon at the entrance to the Officers' Mess.|$|E

40|$|The deep {{southern}} component water (SCW), comprising Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), is a {{major component}} of the global oceanic circulation. It has been suggested that the deep Atlantic water mass structure changed significantly during the last glacial/interglacial cycle. However, deep SCW source-proximal records remain sparse. Here we present three coherent deep SCW paleocurrent records from the deep Argentine continental margin shedding light on deep water circulation and deep SCW flow strength in the Southwest Atlantic since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Based on increased sortable silt values, we propose enhanced deep SCW flow strength from 14 to 10  cal ka B. P. relative to the early deglacial/LGM and the Holocene. We propose a direct influence of deep northern component water (NCW) on deep SCW flow strength due to vertical narrowing of deep SCW spreading, concurrent with a migration of the high-energetic LCDW/AABW interface occupying our <b>core</b> <b>sites.</b> We suggest a shoaled NCW until 13  cal ka B. P., thereby providing space for deep SCW spreading that resulted in reduced carbonate preservation at our <b>core</b> <b>sites.</b> Increased carbonate content from 13  cal ka B. P. indicates that the NCW expanded changing deep water properties at our <b>core</b> <b>sites</b> in the deep Southwest Atlantic. However, southern sourced terrigenous sediments continued to be deposited at our <b>core</b> <b>sites,</b> suggesting that deep SCW flow was uninterrupted along the Argentine continental margin since the LGM...|$|R
30|$|Above, a sharp, erosive contact to the {{subsequent}} massive, heterogeneous subunit {{of sand and}} gravel is documented (subunit II, Fig. 3, LEF 44 : 0.84 and 0.40 m b.s.l., LEF 45 : 0.56 – 0.32 m b.s.l., LEF 50 : 0.40 – 0.34 m b.s.l.). For the cores of transect A, in contrast to transect B, the grain size distribution of subunit II indicates an overall bimodal pattern for the investigated samples, characterized by two peaks at > 0.125 – 0.250 mm and, less pronounced, at > 2 mm (Fig. 5). Sections of higher and lower gravel content are present in particular at <b>coring</b> <b>site</b> LEF 44, but no clear internal sublayering could be inferred from the core. Thus, within this subunit, the amount of coarser grain sizes (> 4 mm and > 8 mm) is slightly different for the investigated samples (Fig. 5). However, for <b>coring</b> <b>sites</b> LEF 44, 45 and 50, an overall fining-upward trend can be observed. At <b>coring</b> <b>sites</b> LEF 45 and 50, the grain size peaks appear less defined and show a broader grain size spectrum. Here, no bimodal pattern {{can be observed in}} {{the upper part of the}} subunit, and grain size fractions peak between > 0.250 and > 0.125 mm (e.g. LEF 45 / 5, 50 / 1).|$|R

40|$|Xer {{site-specific}} recombination at cer and psi converts bacterial plasmid multimers into monomers {{so that they}} can be efficiently segregated to both daughter cells at cell division. Recombination is catalysed by the XerC and XerD recombinases acting at ~ 30  bp <b>core</b> <b>sites,</b> and is regulated by the action of accessory proteins bound to accessory DNA sequences adjacent to the <b>core</b> <b>sites.</b> Recombination normally occurs only between sites in direct repeat in a negatively supercoiled circular DNA molecule, and yields two circular products linked together in a right-handed four-node catenane with antiparallel sites. These and other topological results are explained by a model in which the accessory DNA sequences are interwrapped around the accessory proteins, trapping three negative supercoils so that strand exchange by the XerC and XerD yields the observed four-node catenane...|$|R
