40|$|Background and purpose: Emergency {{physicians}} play {{an important}} role in the immediate diagnosis of bioterrorism activities. The present study was conducted with the purpose of comparing the effectiveness of e-learning and classroom learning in approach to bioterrorism and <b>chemical</b> <b>terrorism</b> for emergency physicians. Methods: This was a semi-empirical study, which was conducted via testing knowledge before and after the educational intervention in the field of bioterrorism and <b>chemical</b> <b>terrorism</b> on the emergency physicians in Tehran. The external validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by two academic experts in order to determine the ability to detect bioterrorist and chemical terrorist diseases. In this study, education was done in both virtual and classroom forms. The education regarded 6 bioterrorist diseases in group A (anthrax, plague, viral hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, smallpox), and 5 chemical terrorist diseases (nerve gas, mustard, lewisite, phosgene, chlorine). Results: 160 doctors participated in this study. 96 people (60 %) were men and 64 people (40 %) were women. The average age of the participants was 36. 2 ± 5. 5 years. In e-learning method, the pre-test scores average was (30. 6 %), while the post-test scores average was (81. 6 %) (p= 0. 001). In classroom learning method, the pre-test scores average was (41. 9 %), while the post-test scores average was (72. 9 %), which the pre-test and post-test scores average differences in both cases are significant (p< 0. 001). In e-learning method, the difference was (51 %), and in the classroom method it was (31 %), which these two represent a 20 % difference between methods. From statistical point of view, this difference indicates that the e-learning method being more effective (p= 0. 02). Conclusions: Based on the study results, it seems that in comparison to the classroom learning, e-learning method is more effective in helping emergency physicians to diagnose bioterrorism or <b>chemical</b> <b>terrorism</b> factors.

Mega-terrorism has been existing, at a conceptual level,ever since the 70 ’s, when the experts of this phenomenon tried to find a semantic cover for thesituations that certain organizations, groups or terrorist or extremist sections would get someWeapons of Mass Destruction Systems.

In the next chapters my work describes {{the current state of the}} preparedness of crisis management authorities for the possible attack by a chemical substance in a hospital, single tasks of Integrated Rescue System bodies, through individual protection and possibilities of decontamination. The part of my work is the outline of the terrorist attack in a hospital building.
