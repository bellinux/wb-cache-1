It is a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> with either a ball or flapper closing mechanism.

The high pressure is needed to overcome the production pressure in the tubing upstream of the choke on the tree.

50|$|Once the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> has closed, {{the spring}} presses it still further {{down through the}} seat. There is a small {{distance}} between {{the point where the}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> first closes, and where the mitre valve finally closes. This has the effect of slightly increasing the volume of the closed-off volume, including the delivery pipe. As liquids are near-incompressible, even this tiny change in volume has the effect of dropping the pressure in the pipe. This drop in pressure allows the injector valve to close fully, without leakage or dribble.|$|E
50|$|Anti-dribble {{action is}} {{provided}} by a second valve seat, below the conical main seat (i.e. on the pump side). This is a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve,</b> fitting a cylindrical seat. This valve seat closes first, before the mitre valve, and shuts off the fuel flow. As the seat is cylindrical though, the spring pressure does not hold the seat surfaces {{together to make a}} tight seal, and so the mitre valve is still needed.|$|E

5000|$|Haas also focused {{considerable}} {{energy on}} improving the commercial flush valve. These efforts {{resulted in a}} series of patents issued throughout the late 1910s and early 1920s. On June 5, 1924 he submitted a patent application for a hydraulic flush valve with many similarities to commercial fixtures in use today. It is characterized by a metal toggle knob protruding from a socket in the side of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve.</b> In his application, Haas indicated [...] "the construction of the valve mechanism is simplified, rendered more efficient and certain of operation, and whereby the valve may be installed and adjusted to accommodate variations in the pressure of water available in the connected supply...." [...] The design is incorporated in Patent 1,614,468. Haas’ designs in this area have been cited in numerous patent applications over the intervening years.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century until the 1920s, [...] "German horn" [...] meant the most common type of F horn, with a bore as wide as 11.5 mm in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> portion of the instrument. It had three rotary valves and was fitted with a slide-crook which also served as a master tuning slide. The German horn had a broader bell than the [...] "French" [...] single horn and was played using a conical {{mouthpiece}} with a flat-edged rim. French makers, by contrast, preferred to preserve as much as possible the character of the natural horns exemplified by the instruments built in the eighteenth century by Raoux, which meant a narrower bore between 10.8 and(-) 11.0 mm and, in many earlier models, a removable set of piston valves which could be replaced by a simple centre crook to transform the instrument for hand-horn use. After about 1847, the French generally used an [...] "ascending" [...] third valve which normally sends the air through the extra length of the valve slide but, when, depressed, cuts out the slide instead of adding it as in the German horn and older French horns. Single horns use a single set of tubes connected to the valves. This allows for simplicity of use and a much lighter weight. They are usually in the keys of F or B, although many F horns have longer slides to tune them to E, and most B horns have a fourth valve to put them in the key of A. The problem with single horns is the inevitable choice between accuracy or tone. While the F horn has the [...] "typical" [...] horn sound, above third-space C accuracy is a concern for the majority of players because, by its nature, one plays high in the horn's harmonic series where the overtones are closer together. This led to the development of the B horn, which, although easier to play accurately, has a less desirable sound in the mid and especially the low register where it is not able to play all of the notes. The solution has been the development of the double horn, which combines the two into one horn with a single lead pipe and bell. Both main types of single horns are still used today as student models because they are cheaper and lighter than double horns. In addition, the single B horns are sometimes used in solo and chamber performances and the single F survives orchestrally as the Vienna horn. Additionally, single F alto and B alto descants are used in the performance of some baroque horn concertos and F, B, and F-alto (an octave above the usual F horn) singles are occasionally used by jazz performers.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have enabled accurate and reliable calculations of pressure, velocity and temperature field, during the fluid flow through different technical parts and systems. This paper presents {{the application of}} numerical analysis based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) {{for the analysis of}} hydraulic oil stationary flow through the channels and chambers of the <b>cylindrical</b> piston <b>valve.</b> By means of software COMET and numerical simulation, Δp- Q characteristics for 3 D model of the distributing <b>valve</b> with <b>cylindrical</b> piston were defined and compared to experimentally obtained characteristics. The applied mathematical model is established on the basic fluid mechanics equations given in integral form. The equations of the mass, momentum, energy and space conservation that define mathematical model were closed with appropriate constitutive relations. Basic equations were discretized and transformed into the subsystems of nonlinear algebraic relations with unknown variables as components of velocity, pressure, temperature, kinetic energy of turbulence and its dissipation rate. Due to nonlinearity, these subsystems were solved by iterative method based on the algorithm with segregated solution strategy.

40|$|We use the {{continuity}} equation and the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations {{to study the}} flow-pattern characteristics around a turbine runner for the small-opening <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> of a hydraulic turbine. For closure, we adopt the renormalization-group k-ε two-equation turbulence model and use the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT to numerically simulate the three-dimensional unsteady turbulent flow through the entire passage of the hydraulic turbine. The results show that a low-pressure zone develops around the runner blades when the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> is closed in a small opening; cavitation occurs at the blades, and a vortex appears at the outlet of the runner. As the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> is gradually closed, the flow velocity over the runner area increases, and the pressure gradient becomes more significant as the discharge decreases. In addition, the fluid flow velocity is relatively high between {{the lower end of}} the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> and the base, so that a high-velocity jet is easily induced.

40|$|Abstract: The paper aims to {{highlight}} the pressure and velocity variations on power lines created by water flowing through a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>valve.</b> Drain valve is typical cylindrical bottom of the dam or hydroelectric penstocks. Varieties of dimensions of these valves allow different analyses of the dynamics within them. The valves are able to access water from both sides and different ways of filling and closing action items. This paper presents a method to analyse the influence of parameters on physical-mechanical construction or operation and hence derive dynamic optimal design {{of these types of}} valves. Refer to the more intermediate positions of the piston sealing and visualization power lines and areas of turbulence for each position. Flow simulation allows for three power lines recording the flow velocity values then are the velocity and pressure variations in nine distinct points on each line current. <b>Cylindrical</b> <b>valve</b> characteristics Being performed {{in a wide range of}} sizes, cylinder valve has been tested only on hydraulic losses experimental methods to flow and seal leaked.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2016. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 209 pages. Valve timing {{is critical to}} the performance of hydraulic piston motors and pumps. With non-optimal valve timing, the pressure differential across the valve during a valve opening or closing can be significant, causing transitional throttling loss and reducing the energy efficiency. The goal of this thesis is to provide a fundamental understanding of the role of valve timing and propose a viable active valve solution for better efficiency of hydraulic pumps and motors. Previously, researchers have proposed a variety of valve timing models based on analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and optimization. However, many critical questions, such as the relationship between the valve timing and throttling energy loss, the meaning of the valve timing optimality, and the influence of the fluid compressibility with entrained gas, have not been fully answered. Prior work on valves with active timing have focused on reducing the valve transition time, leakage, and dead volume. The <b>cylindrical</b> rotary <b>valve</b> architecture {{has been found to be}} a promising solution, provided that the leakage issue is solved. In this research, a new two-phase analytical valve timing solution, a complete active motor-valve numerical model, a prototype <b>cylindrical</b> rotary <b>valve,</b> and a novel fluid compressibility experiment have been developed. Results have shown that the analytical valve timing solution is capable of capturing the trade-offs between throttling energy loss and output piston work. A full model of a motor was used to optimize valve timing for a specific operating condition. The numerical model was validated experimentally, where a prototype active rotary valve was integrated into a commercial pump. A rectified bulk modulus model was derived from a novel mass transfer experiment to determine the compressibility of oil with entrained gas based on an optical bubble size measurement. The contributions of the thesis are: (1) the validated analytical and numerical models that allow finding the optimal valve timing as a function of the operating conditions, (2) a new active valve architecture that enables variable valve timing motor/pump, and (3) a rectified fluid compressibility model based on a lumped interfacial mass transport equation that predicts the effective fluid bulk modulus dynamically...|$|R

40|$|Injection nozzles (conical and <b>cylindrical</b> surface) and <b>valve</b> needles (conical sur-face) {{demand a}} fast and {{accurate}} {{measurement of the}} shape of the surface. Standard white-light interferometers are optimized to measure flat surfaces and cannot acquire the complete surface of cylindrical or conical object in one single measurement. We modified our white-light interferometer to measure in cylindrical coordinates. For cylindrical objects a 90 ° conical mirror is use d to illuminate and to observe the measured object. For conical objects the angle of the conical mirror has to be properly adapted. To measure the inner surface, specifically the conical end of the injector nozzle hole, a conical micro-mirror was developed. 1 Basic Principle The white-light interferometer (Coherence radar [1]) measures surfaces by scanning the temporal coherence function of the broadband light source. For each object point we record a correlogram. From the maximum of the correlogram the position of the corresponding object point along the z-axis can be found. Fig. 1 White-light interferometry – optimal for the meas-urement of a flat surface. The standard white-light interferometer is optimal for measuring flat surfaces (Fig. 1). To measure a conical or cylindrical surface we modified the illu-mination and observation in the object arm of the white-light interferometer [2]. With use of the proper conical mirror (Figs. 2 and 3) the illuminating rays are directed perpendicular to the measured surface. The conical mirror acts {{at the same time as}} an imaging device for the re-flected rays [3]. This scheme has a significant advantage:- incoming light is reflected directly back into the interferometer,- we are measuring the whole surface of the ob-ject in one single measurement...|$|R
40|$|Objective“Field dependence” {{is used in}} {{cognitive}} psychology to describe an individual's tendency to be visually distracted by the surrounding environment. Notwithstanding the role of field dependence in contexts in which spatial judgment is important, such as piloting an aircraft, to date, studies linking field dependence to surgical skills have been limited. We evaluated whether field dependence correlates with an ability to anticipate appropriate needle angles in a simulated setting. MethodsTrainees underwent field dependence testing and then participated in a surgical skills exercise. Correlations between field dependence and surgical skill were computed. Specifically, cardiothoracic surgery residents (n =  11) took a battery of cognitive examinations to assess general reasoning and visuospatial judgment. Two written tests, the Rod and Frame test and the Judgment of Line Orientation test, measured the degree of field dependence. The subjects then underwent surgical skills testing. Using a standard needle driver, the participants placed curved needles into a <b>cylindrical</b> silicone mitral <b>valve</b> model with 10 premarked needle entry and exit sites. The components assessed included the ability to load a needle on driver at the appropriate angle. ResultsThe test results showed a parametric distribution, with internal cognitive testing controls demonstrating valid testing techniques and methods. Performance on the cognitive tests measuring spatial judgment and field dependence correlated significantly with skill at determining the appropriate needle angle load in an inverse fashion (Judgment of Line Orientation test, r =  0. 61, P < . 05; Rod and Frame test, r = − 0. 52, P = . 05), suggesting that residents who were not distracted by surrounding objects performed better. Performance on the cognitive examinations did not correlate with resident training level. ConclusionsAlthough our study was of a small cohort, {{the findings suggest that}} individuals described as field independent (not easily distracted by external visual cues) might possess improved ability to determine appropriate needle angle loads compared with field-dependent individuals. Additional studies examining the role field dependence might play in the acquisition and execution of surgical tasks are warranted...|$|R
