5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{in the street and}} shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
500|$|He lobbied {{influential}} {{figures in}} Hollywood {{to fund the}} project and {{was reported to have}} recruited the aid of fellow Scientologists in promoting it. According to Bill Mechanic, the former head of 20th Century Fox, [...] "John wanted me to make Battlefield Earth. He had Scientologists all over me. They <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and they know who you are. And they go, 'We're really excited about Battlefield Earth.'" [...] This did not impress Mechanic: [...] "Do you think in any way, shape, or form that weirding me out is going to make me want to make this movie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} do,' said Anne sweetly. 'If a Frenchman <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Derriman, would you take him on the hip, or on the thigh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{hardly a}} man in that place that wouldn't have been. They all know me by sight--and some of 'em better. You didn't see 'em {{grinning}} when I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but I did. My God--it's awful--it's awful I...." [...] She burst into violent weeping, long deferred.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{conquered the}} world. Well,--if you march {{along one of}} these streets, you must ride as I rode, when I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> You must not let your knights go first, and your men-at-arms straggle after in a tail a mile long, like a scratch pack of hounds, all sizes but except each others'. You must keep your footmen on the high street, and make your knights ride in two bodies, right and left, upon the wold, to protect their flanks and baggage." ...|$|R
500|$|The tank {{scene was}} created {{completely}} using CGI. The only actual footage {{from the scene}} was the background. A computer-generated tank, along with women, were designed on a computer. Then, special effects shots of smoke and explosions were layered {{on top of the}} vehicle to give it a more life-like appearance. Bruce Harwood, who portrayed Byers, noted that the action sequences in the episode were a challenge. He explained, [...] "It's pretty difficult on a set when the stuntmen <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and go, 'Don't worry, you'll be safe, Nothing to worry about. Okay. Everyone put their safety glasses on.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{publicly}} credited with [...] "thoroughly shap...the comedic sensibility" [...] of The Simpsons; in 2000, Mike Scully, the show runner {{for the series}} at the time, called him [...] "the best comedy writer in Hollywood." [...] Scully said he was [...] "the main reason" [...] why The Simpsons [...] still so good after all these years." [...] Vitti has said Meyer's [...] "fingerprints are on nearly every script" [...] and he [...] "exerts as much influence on the show as anyone can without {{being one of the}} creators," [...] while recounting how [...] "a show that you have the writer's credit for will run, and the next day people will <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and tell you how great it was. Then they'll mention their two favorite lines, and both of them will be George's." [...] Bill Oakley noted Meyer has [...] "he's been there since the beginning adding thousands of jokes and plot twists, etc., that everyone considers classic and brilliant.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{became known}} for his [...] "frightening" [...] {{tendency}} to not [...] "mince words". The director often had his cast do numerous takes for a scene {{in order to get}} the perfect shot, and was not afraid to call something [...] "boring" [...] if he disliked it. Thompson later recalled the director would [...] "always <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and say something unexpectedly crushing", such as asking her not to [...] "look so old." [...] She also commented, however, that [...] "he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail." [...] Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, the director encouraged her to practice t'ai chi to [...] "help her relax [...] make her do things simpler." [...] Other actors soon joined them in meditating – according to Doran, it [...] "was pretty interesting. There were all these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [...] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of." [...] He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him in order to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond. Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding side-saddle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I've done it before," [...] she laughed, as {{she read}} his wonder, with his gratitude, in his eyes. [...] "The horse was already stiff, and you were nearly so, by the time I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and got"--she laughed again--"the OTHER Chinaman to help me pull you out of that hole." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Hall's Separate but Equal (1991) co-star Jeffrey Wright {{told him}} that Apocalypse Now is his {{favorite}} film, he gave him a book in which he wrote inside, [...] "Jeffrey, evolution is when a young actor <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and says, 'I've seen your work, you know, a hundred so times, and it has meaning to me.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! old Rough and Tough: {{the picture}} hasn't {{anything}} to do with Peter Wilkins," [...] said Zack. [...] "Keep quiet, and wait here a minute for me. There are some friends of mine {{at the other end of}} the room that I must go and speak to. And, I say, if Blyth <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and asks you about the picture, say it's Columbus, and remarkably like him." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{obtaining the}} summit of the ridge the allied column found itself facing the French {{infantry}} line. The French guards rose and advanced towards the crest, whereupon the two forces confronted each other at a distance of 30 paces. The moment was immortalised by Lord Charles Hay of the 1st Regiment of Guards who later wrote that he stepped forward, took out a hip flask and drank with a flourish, shouting out to his opponent, [...] "We are the English Guards, and we hope you will stand till we <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and not swim the Scheldt as you did the Main at Dettingen." [...] He then led his men in three cheers. Voltaire's version of this famous episode has become proverbial. He wrote: [...] "The English officers saluted the French by doffing their hats … [...] the French, returned the greeting. My Lord Charles Hai, captain in the English Guards, cried, 'Gentlemen of the French Guards, fire.' The Comte d'Auteroche, then lieutenant of Grenadiers, shouted, 'Gentlemen, we never fire first; fire yourselves.'" [...] The French were the first to fire, the volley was somewhat ineffective but threw the Third Guards into some confusion and wounded George Churchill, the commander of the guards brigade. Captain Lord Panmure led the unbroken companies of the Third Guards to the flank of the First Guards. Up to this point the British column had not fired a single musket shot, but now the allied infantry poured a devastating discharge into the French. The volley of musketry with the battalion guns delivering numerous rounds of grape-shot, swept away the front rank of the ten battalions of the French first line, killing and wounding between 700–800 men, breaking the Gardes Françaises, while the Gardes Suisses and the four battalions of the Brigade Aubeterre were driven back by the British advance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no! I'm {{not going}} to bed. I believe, Father John, I did not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> because I was ashamed to see you afther last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what,' whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; 'he won't <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow morning. I saw him hesitate. He is deceiving you, my good friend.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Miltoun's answer: [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> some thing, sir," [...] riveted his father's stare for {{a second}} longer than was quite urbane.|$|R
6000|$|... "We fell {{in with a}} few wolves yesterday, but {{beat them}} off easily enough. Last night, we stopped at a little village in the forest. They {{certainly}} made me feel uneasy there, with their tales about the wolves, {{but there was no}} help for it. We started as soon as day broke, and had driven some fifteen miles, before we <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> We had not gone five when the wolves began to show themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had noticed}} a man {{lounging}} {{against the house}} opposite all the afternoon," [...] Jeanne said, [...] "and {{came to the conclusion}} that he must be watching us; so we looked out for him when we came out, and noticed that as soon as we went on he began to walk that way too. So I told Louise to walk straight on without stopping when we <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I was sure you would manage somehow to get rid of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} {{come down to}} us," [...] said Augustus, [...] "I shall <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> But may God speed you. And now I'll go to the governor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--I've come at last. It {{would not}} have done for me to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when you were in bed. Those women down-stairs would have talked about it everywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The mate {{said when}} you came aboard you was just to go and stand near the {{companion}} and whistle 'God Save the Queen' and he'll <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to see what's to be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well no more tragedies," [...] he insisted. [...] "I have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> remind <b>you</b> {{that we have}} guests here. When are <b>you</b> {{coming down}} <b>to</b> see them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Baas," [...] {{answered}} Otter, [...] "I {{have a word}} to say. We can all go {{down through}} that hole by which I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> The Water-Dweller is dead, I slew him with my own hand, so {{there is nothing to}} fear from him. Beneath the hole runs a tunnel, and that tunnel leads to the slope of the mountain above. At the top of this slope is an ice-bridge by which men may reach a fair country if they have a mind to." ...|$|R

60|$|It's been so wonderful, {{all these}} months. I've never known anyone to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Everything you said pleased me. I {{loved the way}} you walk, and your laugh, {{and the sound of}} your voice.|$|E
60|$|Boy. O yes, sir; I {{forgot to}} tell you that: This morning a strange fellow, as ever eyes beheld, would needs <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> when you were asleep; but when he came down again, he said, he had not waked you.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the Russian cavalry, Bowyer. Take the musketeers on with you, {{and keep}} {{close to the}} company ahead. I will break them up with the pikemen. If they do <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> give them a volley and then {{continue}} your retreat with the rest." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{later said}} in detail: [...] "When I was filming my Great Hall scene where I {{had to be}} sorted, we were rehearsing and I think it was sorting off-camera and I sat on the stool and the Sorting Hat was sort of {{next to me and}} I looked down and was thinking, 'Wow! It's the Sorting Hat. Okay!' ... And then there was Maggie Smith behind me and I've been told, you know, give her a bit of space. You know, let her breathe and if she <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> don't talk <b>to</b> her. And I was thinking, 'Oh, I'm really nervous!' Because I've been told not to say anything, not to talk her, just to sit there. And then she <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me and she's like, 'Oh, you have {{beautiful}} hair!' And I'm like this (mimics gawking), 'Oh my goodness, that's Maggie Smith!' And she's like, 'You have really beautiful hair! Well done! You're really catchy! Good job!' And I'm like, Thanks... Oh my God!' But because I was so nervous on set {{and that was the first}} scene I did, it kind of gave me more confidence. ... Even though it wasn't advice, it just gave me more confidence to be myself and just have fun and relax and everything. And is such a lovely lady. She just <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and talks <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kitty had {{returned}} in triumph from her ride. [...] "Mamma! the donkey {{did more than}} gallop--he kicked, and I fell off. Oh, I'm not hurt!" [...] cried the child, seeing the alarm in her mother's face. [...] "Tumbling off is such a funny sensation. It isn't as if you fell on the ground; it's as if the ground <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and said--Bump!" [...] She had {{got as far as}} that, when the progress of her narrative was suspended by the discovery of a strange gentleman in the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Miss Baker, timidly. [...] "Here it is; and I have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> consult <b>you</b> {{about the}} answer." [...] Mr. Bertram now did take the letter, and did read it through.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not altogether," [...] {{said his}} father. [...] "If you were lying {{down upon the}} ground, and I were to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with an axe, and make believe cut your head off, it would make you very uneasy, though there would be really no danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|The cook {{jerked his}} thumb towards the cabin. [...] "He’s down there," [...] {{he said in}} a hoarse whisper.

6000|$|... 'It HAS been a {{depressing}} day,' said Mrs Brangwen sympathetically. At {{that moment the}} voices of the children were heard calling from upstairs: 'Mother! Mother!' She lifted her face and answered mildly into the distance: 'I shall <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in a minute, Doysie.' Then to Birkin: 'There is nothing fresh at Shortlands, I suppose? Ah,' she sighed, 'no, poor things, I should think not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] I added, [...] "I {{am going}} away. <b>You</b> won't want <b>to</b> see me or anyone {{for a while}} after you have read this book. But I will <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> to-morrow." ...|$|R
5000|$|How about it? Funny movie. Terribly {{unpleasant}} experience. We didn’t get along, me and Bill Murray. But I’ve {{got to give}} it to him: I don’t like him, but {{he makes}} me laugh even now. I’m also jealous that he’s a better golfer than I am. It’s a funny movie. No one ever <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and says, “I identify with the patient.” They always say, “I have patients like that.
