40|$|For water <b>content</b> <b>determinations</b> on organic soils, several {{researchers}} have adopted lower oven-drying {{temperatures in the}} range 35 ? 90 ?C (instead of the standardised range for mineral soils of 100 ? 110 ?C) {{in order to prevent}} possible charring, oxidation and (or) vaporisation of substances other than water.

One major consequence of using such a wide range of drying temperatures for more sensitive materials is to produce considerable disparity in interpolated index values and in deduced correlations between water content and other engineering properties. This paper discusses the pros and cons regarding the ovendrying temperature adopted for routine water <b>content</b> <b>determinations</b> on organic sludges and residues.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe question {{pertaining to the}} acceptance of a standard drying temperature of 110 ± 5 °C in making water <b>content</b> <b>determinations</b> of soils has been extended to the oven drying of marine sediments. The implementation of a temperature within the 130 to 150 °C range appears {{to be just as}} adequate as the accepted standard for the drying of inorganic sediments and has the added advantage of shortening the drying time. Increasing the temperature above 150 °C does not appreciably reduce the drying time and may begin to break down the less stable clay sediments such as montmorillonite. The water <b>content</b> <b>determinations</b> appear to fluctuate in a random manner with increase in drying temperature suggesting that the mineralogy of the sediments somehow controls water content. The concept of normalized water content is introduced and appears to be an invaluable aid in considering the relationships between water content, sample weight and drying time.

40|$|There {{has been}} much debate in {{literature}} over the past 60 years regarding an appropriate oven-drying temperature for water <b>content</b> <b>determinations</b> on peat and other organic soils. For inorganic soils, the water content is usual based on the equilibrium dry mass corresponding to drying temperatures in the range 100 ? 110 oC. However, for peat and other organic soils, several researchers have recommended lower drying temperatures in the range 60 ? 90 oC {{in an attempt to}} prevent possible charring, oxidation and (or) vaporization of substances other than pore water. However, all of the relevant water is not fully evaporated at too low a temperature, and since specimen dry mass is a function of drying temperature, resulting water content values are lower than those determined for the temperature range 100 ? 110 oC. Experimental data reported in this paper show that oven drying of peat and other organic soils at 100 ? 110 oC using either gravity?convection or forced-draft ovens is acceptable for routine water <b>content</b> <b>determinations.</b> Since a standardized oven temperature is desirable when correlating water content with other material properties, it is recommended that oven drying of peat and other organic soils be performed over temperature ranges of either 105 ? 110 ?C or 105 ? 5 ?C, in line with standardized ranges for inorganic soils...|$|R
