60|$|Ulf of Romsdal {{did not die}} of his wounds, {{neither did}} he die of love. Disappointed love was then, as now, a terrible disease, but not {{necessarily}} fatal. Northmen were very sturdy in the olden time. They almost always recovered from that disease sooner or later. When his wounds were healed, Ulf married a fair girl of the Horlingdal district, and went to reside there, but his change of abode did not alter his title. He was always spoken of as Ulf of Romsdal. He and his old enemy Haldor the Fierce speedily became fast friends; and so was it with their wives, Astrid and Herfrida, who also took mightily to each other. They span, and <b>carded</b> <b>wool,</b> and sewed together oftentimes, and discussed the affairs of Horlingdal, no doubt with mutual advantage and satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, {{the white}} screen of vapour rolled {{up like the}} curtain in a playhouse, and {{uncovered}} a stately war-ship, lying so close {{that we could have}} thrown a biscuit aboard. Her long, lean, black hull rose and fell with a slow, graceful rhythm, while her beautiful spars and snow-white sails shot aloft until they were lost in the wreaths of fog which still hung around her. Nine bright brass cannons peeped out at us from her portholes. Above the line of hammocks, which hung like <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> along her bulwarks, we could see the heads of the seamen staring down at us, and pointing us out to each other. On the high poop stood an elderly officer with cocked hat and trim white wig, who at once whipped up his glass and gazed at us through it.|$|E
60|$|Then Little John and Will Scarlet and Allan a Dale ran leaping, full of joy, to make {{themselves}} ready, while Robin also prepared himself for the journey. After a while they all four came forth, and a right fair sight they made, for Robin was clad in blue from head to foot, and Little John and Will Scarlet in good Lincoln green, and as for Allan a Dale, {{he was dressed in}} scarlet from the crown of his head to the toes of his pointed shoes. Each man wore beneath his cap a little head covering of burnished steel set with rivets of gold, and underneath his jerkin a coat of linked mail, as fine as <b>carded</b> <b>wool,</b> yet so tough that no arrow could pierce it. Then, seeing all were ready, young Partington mounted his horse again, and the yeomen having shaken hands all around, the five departed upon their way.|$|E

6000|$|To Jane, his wife, [...] Thus spake the homely Priest of Ennerdale. [...] It was a July evening; and he sate [...] Upon {{the long}} stone-seat beneath the eaves [...] Of his old cottage,--as it chanced, that day, [...] 20 [...] Employed in winter's work. Upon the stone [...] His wife sate near him, teasing matted wool, [...] While, from the twin cards toothed with {{glittering}} wire, [...] He fed the spindle of his youngest child, [...] Who, {{in the open}} air, with due accord [...] 25 [...] Of busy hands and back-and-forward steps, [...] Her large round wheel was turning. [3] Towards the field [...] In which the Parish Chapel stood alone, [...] Girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall, [...] While half an hour went by, the Priest had sent [...] 30 [...] Many a long look of wonder: and at last, [...] Risen from his seat, beside the snow white ridge [...] Of <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> which {{the old man had}} piled [...] He laid his implements with gentle care, [...] Each in the other locked; and, down the path [...] 35 [...] That [4] from his cottage to the church-yard led, [...] He took his way, impatient to accost [...] The Stranger, whom he saw still lingering there.|$|E
60|$|I {{could write}} a {{treatise}} of lamentation upon the changes brought about among the cottages of Westmoreland by {{the silence of the}} spinning-wheel. During long winter's nights and wet days, the wheel upon which wool was spun gave employment to a great part of a family. The old man, however infirm, was able to card the wool, as he sate in the corner by the fireside; and often, when a boy, have I admired the cylinders of <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> which were softly laid upon each other by his side. Two wheels were often at work on the same floor, and others of the family, chiefly the little children, were occupied in teazing and clearing the wool to fit it for the hand of the carder. So that all, except the infants, were contributing to mutual support: Such was the employment that prevailed in the pastoral vales. Where wool was not at hand, in the small rural towns, the wheel for spinning flax was almost in as constant use, if knitting was not preferred; which latter occupation had the advantage (in some cases disadvantage) that not being of necessity stationary, it allowed of gossiping about from house to house, which good housewives reckoned an idle thing.|$|E

50|$|At {{various times}} in its history, the mill {{produced}} broadcloth, satinet, cashmere, doeskin, kersey and cloaking. The mill {{was used to}} spin and <b>card</b> <b>wool</b> until 1906, when the owners turned to buying yarn instead.|$|R
50|$|Nearby is Holden Park, {{which was}} the site of Oakworth House and its grounds, once owned by Sir Isaac Holden, an {{inventor}} who is said to have invented the lucifer match and revolutionised the process of <b>carding</b> <b>wool.</b> He also owned Oakworth Hall.|$|R
5000|$|Woolen is a soft, short-staple, <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> yarn {{typically}} used for knitting. [...] In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently {{combined with a}} worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.|$|E
50|$|Flannel is a soft woven fabric, {{of various}} fineness. Flannel was {{originally}} made from <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> or worsted yarn, {{but is now}} often made from either wool, cotton, or synthetic fiber. Vegetable flannel is made from Scots pine fibre.|$|E
50|$|Hand {{spinning}} {{can be done}} {{by using}} a spindle or the spinning wheel. Spinning turns the <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> fibres into yarn which can then be directly woven, knitted (flat or circular), crocheted, or by other means turned into fabric or a garment.|$|E

60|$|This {{was said}} to Herfrida, {{who was in the}} great hall {{spreading}} the board for the midday meal, and surrounded by her maidens, some of whom were engaged in spinning or <b>carding</b> <b>wool,</b> while others wove and sewed, or busied themselves about household matters.|$|R
50|$|By the mid 19th {{century the}} Spen Valley entered its golden era. In 1800 {{children}} were paid starvation wages for putting staples into leather for <b>carding</b> <b>wool,</b> but by 1838 there were eleven carding factories in Cleckheaton and by 1893 {{the town was}} recognised as the carding capital of the world.|$|R
50|$|Early {{settlers}} {{were also}} {{attracted to the}} vicinity of Yocumtown because of the water power of Fishing Creek. Along its banks they built fulling mills that <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> for area farmers, woolen cloth mills, and grist mills. By the mid-1820s, the village of Yocumtown had established itself with a log schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, and a tannery.|$|E
50|$|Woolen (American English) or woollen (Commonwealth English) {{is a type}} of yarn {{made from}} <b>carded</b> <b>wool.</b> Woolen yarn is soft, light, stretchy, and full of air. It is thus a good insulator, and makes a good {{knitting}} yarn. Woolen yarn is in contrast to worsted yarn, in which the fibers are combed to lie parallel rather than carded, producing a hard, strong yarn.|$|E

5000|$|... “The real {{prosperity}} of the Town had its birth in {{the introduction of the}} first machinery for <b>carding</b> <b>wool,</b> in 1801, when one carding-machine was put into Jeremiah Colegrove’s Grist-mill… Captain Colegrove erected a two-story mill on the east bank of the south branch, where the Phoenix mill now stands, for <b>wool</b> <b>carding,</b> cloth fulling, and cloth dressing; and he successfully carried on the business for fifteen years, despite the energetic competition of David Estes, who succeeded Roger Wing in the River Street mill…" ...|$|R
50|$|The second {{function}} of fulling was to thicken cloth by matting the fibres together {{to give it}} strength and increase waterproofing (felting). This was vital {{in the case of}} woollens, made from <b>carding</b> <b>wool,</b> but not for worsted materials made from combing wool. After this stage, water was used to rinse out the foul-smelling liquor used during cleansing.|$|R
50|$|The city of Prato {{has been}} {{producing}} woollen cloth since the 12th century. Industrialization in {{the mid-19th century}} caused the area to develop an industrial production system. Following the second world war, contrary to trends elsewhere in Europe, the industries of Prato expanded: by the early 1980s, the area was model industrial district.Changes in lifestyle {{and the development of}} new technologies made Prato textile companies abandon their traditional <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> businesses and investigate new markets.|$|E
50|$|The {{preparation}} of greasy wool demands several steps, and early procedures have been modified over the years. The oldest wool processing method followed by Cowichan women involved six basic steps: the wool was washed, dried, hand teased, hand carded, drawn out and loosely spun by hand {{to make a}} roving, then tightened with a spindle and whorl. Today, many of these steps have been mechanized or eliminated. Some knitters still buy shorn fleeces and go {{through most of the}} traditional preparation, but most buy the washed and <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> directly from a commercial carding mill.|$|E
5000|$|The alley {{is named}} Erik Ingemundssons gränd ("Alley of Erik Ingemundsson") in 1619, in {{reference}} to the mayor (1581-1622) who owned a property in the alley. While the present name appears in historical records as Öfwerskiärare gränden in 1684, and a certain Absalon överskärare is mentioned in 1643 as having bought a property near that of the major, it remains uncertain which of the masters of the trade gave his name to the alley. Notwithstanding, an överskärare was an occupation which could be translated to [...] "wool cloth finisher", a man who would go over <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> with a pair of scissors to remove upstanding hairs {{in order to make the}} cloth perfectly smooth, masters of the trade being merchants with their own workshops.|$|E
50|$|This mill, {{probably}} flour, is attested in the 18th century. It initially {{belongs to}} the Manoël d'Ayres family whose castle is 700 meters south. In the cadastre of 1841, it is mentioned as a fulling mill owned by Louis Pagett. In 1849 it is transformed into carding of silk floss, then gradually converted into <b>wool</b> <b>carding.</b> The spinning is managed by Benjamin Avesque, who goes bankrupt in 1855, then by David Saumade. His son sells the buildings in 1892 to Louis Couderc who operates the <b>carding</b> <b>wool</b> until 1926.|$|R
25|$|The fleece is cut in {{one piece}} from the sheep.This is then skirted to remove the soiled wool, and baled.

Fibres less than that form short wool and are described as clothing or <b>carding</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1778 a third {{feed mill}} was {{installed}} by the seminary. In 1810, Charles Bélanger obtained {{permission from the}} seminary to add a saw mill to the structure. Construction of the saw mill was completed in 1819. Several years after Quebec abandoned the seigneurial system, the mill was adapted for the additional function of <b>carding</b> <b>wool</b> by Joseph Joseph Coté.|$|R
50|$|Kersey yarns were spun {{in large}} gauges (thicknesses) from {{inferior}} <b>carded</b> <b>wool,</b> and made thick and sturdy cloth. Kersey was a warp-backed, twill-weave cloth woven on a four-treadle loom. As a rule, half the relatively small, numerous and closely set warp ends threads were struck {{with a big}} kersey weft in a two-and-two, unbalanced and highly prominent twill. The rest of the ends were simultaneously struck in a one-and-three twill, so they appeared mainly {{on the back of}} the cloth, while the back-warp stitches on the face of the cloth were concealed among the face-warp threads. One of the secrets of weaving a good kersey lay in combining the adequate stitching of the weft by the back warp with the concealment of the back-warp stitches.The back of the cloth was napped and shorn after fulling, producing a dense, warm fabric with a smooth back.|$|E
50|$|Yates Mill, one of {{the oldest}} {{buildings}} in Wake County, is the region’s only surviving operable gristmill. For nearly 200 years the water-powered mill produced lumber, milled corn and wheat, and <b>carded</b> <b>wool.</b> The land on which the mill is situated was surveyed for Samuel Pearson in October 1756, and granted to him by the Earl of Granville, {{one of the}} North Carolina colony’s Lord Proprietors. The original mill was built around at that time. Pearson steadily increased his land holdings, and owned more than 600 acre {{at the time of his}} death in 1802. In 1819, accumulated debts forced Pearson’s son, Simon, to sell the mill and its surrounding acreage at a sheriff’s auction. William Boylan, a prominent Raleigh businessman and director of the State Bank, bought the property, and over the next 30 years modernized the mill several times, adding a sawmill in the 1840s.|$|E
50|$|Sheep's wool, or mah-too-EHL-kel, is {{the most}} common {{material}} used for modern Salish weaving. Some knitters still buy shorn fleeces and go through most of the traditional preparation, but most buy the washed and <b>carded</b> <b>wool</b> directly from a commercial carding mill. The fleece is lightly washed in a tub of tepid water and then hung outside to dry. It is then teased or picked apart with fingers to remove any matted areas and loose dirt. The wool is then carded, leaving the wool in soft batts, where the fibers lie lengthwise. Taken to the spinning machine, the wool is deftly hand fed into the axle of the spindle. This separates sections of the batt of wool and allows the desired amount of spinning to take place before the tension is eased to wind the wool onto the spindle. When the spindle has filled, the wool is unwound and stored in balls or skeins.|$|E

50|$|Luce {{was born}} in Windsor, Ashtabula County, Ohio. His father, {{a veteran of the}} War of 1812 from Tolland, Connecticut, settled in the Connecticut Western Reserve after the war. When he was twelve years old, Luce moved west with his family to Steuben County, Indiana. After leaving school at seventeen, Luce worked from 1841 until 1848 in a woolen mill, <b>carding</b> <b>wool</b> and {{dressing}} the unfinished cloth for sale.|$|R
