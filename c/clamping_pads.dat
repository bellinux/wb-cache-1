30|$|The {{electric}} heating {{property of the}} CNF/PVDF-HFP composite coated on textiles was analyzed in order to investigate the heating property when a voltage was applied. The electrical heating property was measured using a heating <b>pad</b> <b>clamping</b> device (DongWoo Int. Ltd., Korea) connected to a DC power supply (CPS- 2450 B, CHUNGPAEMT. Co., Ltd., Korea) at an applied voltage interval of 5  V from 0  V to 20  V under a thermal imaging camera (FLIR i 5, FLIR Systems INC, USA). We measured the current generated when a voltage {{was applied to the}} sample. Five samples were tested and three randomly selected parts of the heating area of each sample were measured. The average was obtained and then the value was used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} a {{detailed}} study of ESD failure mode and how to strengthen of the VDMOS used for power applications. The ESD post-zapped failure of power VDMOS transistors due to HBM, MM, and CDM stresses are examined in this work. Through standard failure analysis techniques by using EMMI and SEM were applied to identify the failure locations. The MM failure mode in this power MOSFET {{was caused by the}} gate oxide breakdown near n+ region in the source end as an ESD zapping. And, the ESD failure damage under HBM and CDM stresses were caused by the gate material molten near the gate pad and tunneled through the oxide layer into silicon epitaxial layer. Furthermore, the ESD robustness designs of power VDMOS transistors are also addressed in this work. The first ESD incorporated design is Zener diodes back-to-back <b>clamping</b> the gate-to-source <b>pad,</b> and on the other hand, another one excellent design contains two Zener diodes clamping the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain terminals of a VDMOS, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{stunning}} of ostriches (Struthio camelus) {{has traditionally}} been carried out with hand-held tongs whilst birds are held in a restraining area by applying pressure normally from behind by gently pushing on the tail feathers. The area is often a V-shaped structure, high enough that the stunning operator is not kicked. After stunning, the birds are rocked backwards and a rubberised leg clamp placed over the legs at the tarso-metatarsal bone allowing the birds to be chain-shackled by the big toes. This stunning procedure {{has been replaced by}} a new restraining and stunning mechanism which completely envelops the ostrich in a <b>padded</b> <b>clamp</b> holder. Double-padded sides restrain the bird's upper thighs and a rubberised foot clamp holds the feet so there is no physical damage to the bird. As the bird is electrically stunned with electrodes placed both sides of the head, the entire stunning box rotates 180 ° so that toe clamps can be applied without any danger to the stunning operators. Within 20 s of stunning, the birds are bled by means of a complete ventral cut to the neck and/or by thoracic sticking. © 2012 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare...|$|R
40|$|This paper details a {{modeling}} and experimental {{assessment of the}} packaging process for a silicon carbide Schottky diode using pressure contacts. The work detailed in this paper is original, as it applies a combined electrothermomechanical modeling analysis to this packaging method supported by experimental validation. A key design objective for this packaging process is to identify suitable contact pad materials, heatsinks, and process variables such as clamping force to meet electrical, thermal, and reliability specifications. Molybdenum and aluminum graphite (ALG) {{have been identified as}} two suitable materials for the contact <b>pads.</b> <b>Clamping</b> forces ranging from 300 to 500 N and electric current ranging from 10 to 30 A have been investigated in terms of the resulting electrical and thermal contact resistances, temperatures, and stresses induced across the package. The performance of two heatsink designs with heat dissipation rates of 12893 and 4991 W/m 2 k has also been investigated. Both the {{modeling and}} initial experimental results detailed in this paper show that ALG provides better performance in terms of generating a lower average chip temperature. Both temperature and stress in the diode are predicted as a function of clamping force and load current. This will aid the packaging engineer to identify suitable process parameters to meet junction temperature requirements at different applied load currents. ...|$|R
5000|$|On April 6, 2017, Chevrolet {{announced}} that it will add a new package to the 2018 model year Suburban with the introduction of the street-themed RST (Rally Sport Truck) Special Edition Suburban. Originally {{at the time of the}} announcement, it was supposed to be available as an option for the LT and Premier trims as a Performance Package that included a 420-hp, 6.2L V-8 engine, a Magnetic Ride Control with performance calibration, and an all-new Hydra-Matic 10L80 10-speed automatic transmission. The press release also detailed additional features; The chrome elements are absent as body-color grilles surround the door and handles, along with an added gloss-black grille and mirror caps, black roof rails, window trim, badging and Chevy bowties, an exclusive 22-inch wheels wrapped in Bridgestone P285/45R 22 tires, a Borla performance exhaust system, massive front red Brembo six-piston, fixed aluminum calipers with brake <b>pads</b> <b>clamping</b> on larger-than-stock 410 x 32mm (16.1 inch x 1.3 inch) Duralife rotors, coupled with a 84 percent increase in brake pad area and a 42 percent increase in rotor area to increase system thermal capacity. However, after the press release Chevrolet confirmed that the RST Suburban will only be available as an appearance package, as the 6.2L engine will not be used.|$|R
40|$|Objective: •? To compare {{performance}} of three continence management devices and absorbent pads used by men with persistent urinary incontinence (> 1 yr) post treatment for prostate cancer. •? Patients and Methods •? Randomised, controlled trial of 56 men with one year follow up. •? Three devices were tested {{for three weeks}} each: sheath drainage system, body-worn urinal, penile <b>clamp.</b> Device and <b>pad</b> performance were assessed. •? Quality of life (QOL) was measured at baseline and follow-up with the King's Health Questionnaire. •? Stated (intended use) and revealed (actual use) preference for products was assessed •? Value-for-money was gathered. Results: substantial and significant differences in performance were found: •? Sheath: good for extended use (e. g. golf and travel) when pad changing is difficult. Good for keeping skin dry, not leaking, not smelling and convenient for storage and travel; •? Body-worn urinal: generally rated worse than the sheath and was mainly used for similar activities but by men who could not use a sheath (e. g. retracted penis); not good for seated activities. •? Clamp: good for short vigorous activities like swimming/exercise. Most secure, least likely to leak, most discreet but almost all men described it as uncomfortable or painful. •? Pads: good for everyday activities and best for night-time use. Most easy to use, comfortable when dry but most likely to leak and most uncomfortable when wet. •? A preference for having a mixture of products to meet daytime needs; around two thirds of men were {{using a combination of}} pads and devices after testing compared to baseline. Conclusions: this is the first trial to systematically compare different continence management devices for men •? Pads and devices have different strengths which make them particularly suited to certain circumstances and activities. •? Most men prefer to use pads at night but would choose a mixture of pads and devices during the day. •? Device limitations were important but may be overcome by better desig...|$|R
40|$|Cryogenic shrouds {{have been}} {{designed}} and built for use in thermomechanical testing of samples of thermalinsulation panels on cryogenic vessels. In the original application for which these shrouds were specifically designed, the samples {{are representative of the}} large-area thermal-insulation panels on the space-shuttle external tanks that hold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, and the purpose of the testing is to demonstrate the ability of bonded layers in the panels to resist delamination under a combination of applied uniaxial mechanical loads and realistic operational temperatures. Presumably, the shrouds and the tests performed by use of them could be modified to enable similar evaluation of thermomechanical properties of thermal-insulation panels for cryogenic vessels other than the external tanks of the space shuttles. The shrouds are required to enable maintenance of required temperatures on the inner and outer surfaces of the thermal-insulation-panel samples, to enable visual observation of the outer surfaces of the samples, and not to introduce any measurable loads into the panels. For each panel sample, there are two shrouds: one to be mounted on the inner surface (the surface that would be in contact with a tank containing a cryogenic liquid during normal use) and one to be mounted on the outer surface (the surface that would be exposed to ambient air or other warmer environment during normal use). The shrouds for testing specimens of thermal-insulation- panels for the liquid-hydrogen tank are made largely of titanium; the shrouds for testing specimens of thermal- insulation-panels for the liquid-oxygen tank are made largely of an aluminum- lithium alloy. The specific temperature requirements are the following: The inner shroud must make it possible to maintain a temperature of 321 degrees F (196 degrees C) [the approximate temperature of liquid nitrogen] or 453 F (about 269 C) [the approximate temperature of liquid helium] on the inner face of the sample. The outer shroud must make it possible to maintain a temperature between 30 degrees and 0 degrees F (between about 34 degrees and about 18 degrees C) on the outer surface of the sample by blowing a cryogenic gas or missile grade air along that surface. To enable viewing of the outer surface of the sample during testing, the outer shroud includes a window comprising two layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) with a gap between them to reduce fogging. To ensure that the shrouds do not introduce any measurable loads into a panel specimen, the shrouds are cushioned on the specimen by seals made of a fluoropolymer-membrane/fabric composite material and are held in place on the specimen by means of symmetrically placed <b>clamps</b> with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) <b>pads.</b> Instrumentation ports for thermocouples and strain gauges used in the tests are incorporated into the shrouds...|$|R
5000|$|A {{need was}} {{experienced}} by avid 4x4 enthusiasts and overland travelers {{for a simple}} tool to effectively and efficiently remove the tire from the rim of a wheel, in cases where a tire requires repairs to the inside. On ATV's, as well as motorcycles, passenger vehicles, trucks, many industrial and offroad vehicles, as well as light aircraft have an additional feature on the rim called the Bead Retainer. The bead retainer is a bump like feature that prevents the tire bead from slipping inward on the rim and losing the air seal. On ATV's (and UTV's/side-by-sides) this bead retainer is substantially large because these tires are often run at very low air pressures (~5 psi) and experience severe side loading forces from typical trail riding. The large bead retainer is necessary to prevent unintentional dislocation of the tire bead from the bead seat. Further, if a ATV tire does lose pressure from a puncture, the large bead retainer will keep the Tire in place for low speed riding allowing the operator to navigate to the trail head without the tire coming completely off of the rim. The large bead retainers of ATV's do {{such a good job}} keeping the tire in place during operating conditions, it also prevents the tire from being easily changed with normal tools even in a shop setting.There are three categories of tire bead breaker designs: 1) [...] "Shoe and Lever mechanism", 2) [...] "Plier-type mechanism", 3) [...] "Clamp and Ram mechanism". The Shoe and Lever mechanism performs well on many motorcycle tires, passenger vehicle tires and trailers, however with more difficult-to-change tires it often fails {{because of the nature of}} the design. The shoe pushes down on the tire sidewall next to the tire bead, and if the bead is stuck, the shoe will simply slide down the sidewall. [...] Further the Shoe and Lever mechanism is quite large, and is not a good portable solution for on-the-trail tire changes. Advantages are typically low cost, often less than $50, and can be found manufactured by many companies. The Plier-Type tool has a spike that pushes in between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and can actually put a separating force on the bead bundle. However the pivot point results in a arc that quickly transitions to pushing on the sidewall. The Plier-type mechanism is more effective than the Shoe and Lever, however it has some disadvantages. It must be adjusted for different diameter wheels, it makes metal on metal contact with the rim, and can easily scratch and mar the surface of aluminum or painted wheels, it takes a bit of coordination and balance to use as you have to stand on the tire and use your body weight to operate the tool, and it is also fairly large, but ultimately is portable and is often used at race tracks for pit-stop tire changes. Ultimately, this type of bead breaker also struggles to work reliably on very stubborn ATV tires, 4x4 trucks, and tractors. The cost of the Plier-type is variable, form $75 to $200, and is manufactured by multiple companies. Lastly, the Clamp-and-Ram mechanism tool [...] is by far the most effective and compact tool for breaking beads on ATV's and other difficult-to-change tires. The only company who makes a this style of ATV Bead Breaker is BeadBuster. This style of tool has a pointed foot that enters the space between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and it uses a <b>padded</b> <b>clamp</b> that is driven with a wrench to get pulled in all the way with very little user effort. The Ram foot then gets actuated by another bolt, with little effort by the user, and it completely breaks the bead loose in one motion. Because the tool is clamped in place, it cannot slide down the sidewall and damage the tire. The ram foot pushes directly on the steel bead bundle of the tire, and therefore works well on old and deteriorated tires. The Clamp and Ram tool (aka. [...] "BeadBuster") is extremely portable and easily fits in a tool box or glove compartment, and is priced at $99 up to $200 for a professional model.|$|R
