50|$|On lap 32 Holdsworth with damaged to {{the front}} left <b>corner</b> <b>speared</b> off at turn one after contact on the front {{straight}} with Brad Jones. Holdsworth pulled the car up short of crossing the track again and the car limped back to the pits. Jones suffered a puncture in the right rear.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{community}} called Avery, is {{all that}} remains of a village formerly known as <b>Spears</b> <b>Corners.</b> Avery takes its name from [...] "Avery Township" [...] (the original name of Milan Township) in Erie County ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{special feature}} of Formula E is the [...] "Fan Boost" [...] feature, an {{additional}} [...] {{of power to}} use in the driver's second car. The three drivers who were allowed to use the boost were determined by a fan vote. For the Vegas eRace, Pakhala, López and Greco were handed the extra power. The race was due to start at 16:05 PST, but multiple technical problems caused it to be delayed for half an hour and the distance of the event was reduced from 28 to 20 laps. Owing to an control issue that affected his simulator, di Grassi was unable to start the eRace. The exact number of viewers was not disclosed. When the race began from its standing start, Huis maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner and began to expand from a small lead over Rosenqvist in the opening laps. Towards the conclusion of lap one, Holzmann clipped the outside wall leaving the final <b>corner,</b> <b>speared</b> across the start/finish straight and collected Félix da Costa, ending the chances of both drivers standing on the podium. Holzmann retired but Félix da Costa continued with light damage to his car. Piquet fell to 17th on the first lap but regained positions to move back into 14th place by lap seven, while Bird on the other hand was running in sixth position by the third lap.|$|R
50|$|The Seavey-Robinson House {{is located}} in {{southern}} South Portland, {{on the east side}} of Ocean Street (Maine State Route 77 at the southeastern <b>corner</b> with <b>Spear</b> Avenue. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboard siding. The cornice and rake edge of the gable are decorated with delicate vergeboard that has an acorn motif. The main entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by a gabled cornice with cresting and vergeboard decoration. Windows are topped by bracketed cornices. An open veranda extends across the front, its balustrade also with delicate woodwork.|$|R
50|$|The Bethany Congregational Church (www.bethanycongchurch.org) {{is located}} at the {{northeast}} <b>corner</b> of <b>Spear</b> and Coddington Streets in downtown Quincy, just east of the Thomas Crane Public Library. It is a roughly T-shaped stone structure, with a tall square tower at the right (southern) corner of the T. The main facade, facing the street corner, has a projecting section in which the entrance is deeply recessed under an arch. An elaborate multipart stained glass window stands in the gable above this projecting section. The corners and side walls are buttressed, with three-part Gothic windows in the side walls. The tower is the building's most striking element, with three-part rectangular windows below a pinnacled parapet.|$|R
5000|$|It {{continued}} to rain throughout Saturday's qualifying session; the slower conditions meant {{that none of}} the top 24 drivers could improve upon their times from the previous day, setting the order of the starting grid and guaranteeing Hill pole position. Only Salo and Montermini's times counted for their starting positions: the Tyrrell driver set the fourth-fastest time of the session, albeit 12 seconds slower than Moreno's dry-weather Friday time, to take 23rd position on the grid; Montermini set a time almost four seconds slower again to complete the field. Many teams chose to complete only limited running in the wet conditions, to the frustration of the crowd: Häkkinen, Inoue and Gachot did not set a time, whilst Blundell, Diniz and Martini completed only exploratory laps. There was also frustration amongst the drivers and teams who felt that they had underperformed on Friday, and for Häkkinen and Irvine who had both been scheduled to run with more powerful engines which should have given an advantage in dry conditions. The Benetton mechanics also had a busy session: first Schumacher slid off the road at Stowe corner and had to rejoin the track by using part of the old circuit; then Herbert lost control of his car on standing water at the fast Copse <b>corner,</b> <b>spearing</b> off the road into a heavy impact against the tyre barriers. Herbert was uninjured and the Benetton mechanics were able to repair the B195's monocoque. Coulthard set the quickest time of the session with a lap of 1:29.752, ahead of Schumacher, Alesi and Salo, with Hill, Barrichello, Brundle, Badoer, Irvine and Frentzen completing the top ten. Hill admitted that the wet session was [...] "a bit of a let-down", and was cautious on his race prospects, as he had failed to win from his two pole positions earlier in the season, but was delighted with the outcome nonetheless. Schumacher was also disappointed with the weather conditions, but was optimistic that his car was fully competitive in either the dry or wet.|$|R
50|$|The events took {{a violent}} turn that afternoon, as {{hostilities}} resumed {{outside of the}} ILA strike kitchen. Eyewitness accounts differ on the exact events that transpired next. Some witnesses saw a group of strikers first surround a police car and attempt to tip it over, prompting the police to fire shotguns in the air, and then revolvers at the crowd. Other eyewitness accounts claim that police officers started shooting {{in the direction of}} the strikers, provoking strikers to defend themselves. Policemen fired a shotgun into the crowd, striking three men in intersection of Steuart and Mission streets. One of the men, Howard Sperry, a striking longshoreman, later died of his wounds. Another man, Charles Olsen, was also shot but later recovered from his wounds. A third man, Nick Bordoise - a Greek by birth (originally named Nick Counderakis) who was an out of work member of the cook's union volunteering at the ILA strike kitchen—was shot but managed to make his way around the <b>corner</b> onto <b>Spear</b> Street, where he was found several hours later. Like Sperry, he died at the hospital.|$|R
25|$|Plymouth Corporation's first {{venture into}} tramway {{operation}} {{was when it}} took over the failing Plymouth Tramways Company in 1892. Its new Tramway Department continued to operate the routes to Mutley and West Hoe with horse trams, new cars being delivered in 1894 and 1895. The West Hoe line was lengthened a short distance to Pier Street on 11 March 1893. From Mutley the line was extended north from Hyde Park Corner to Compton Lane on 3 April 1893. Next came a connection from Richmond Street along Old Town Street to Market Avenue to give the Mutley line a more convenient town centre terminus. In 1895 a new line was opened from Mutley Plain straight down North Hill, joining up with the flatter route via North Road at a place later known as <b>Spear's</b> <b>Corner</b> in Tavistock Road. The following year saw street widening that allowed {{the opening of the}} short section which the Board of Trade had previously refused to approve. 10 December 1896 a completely new line was opened eastwards from the junction at the bottom of Tavistock Road (now known as Drake's Circus) to Prince Rock.|$|R
50|$|It {{was three}} wins on the bounce for Wanderers, as they {{comprehensively}} won at Leeds United's Elland Road. Joe Mason scored his third {{in as many}} games and his third consecutive goal on 45 minutes as Bolton went into half-time 1-0 up. Jutkiewicz added a second; heading in a Jay Spearing free-kick and Zat Knight scored his first goal since 2010 just four minutes later. Mark Davies and André Moritz both added to the scoreline before Leeds' Matt Smith finished the scoring with a consolation goal. Bolton could not further their recent scoring record of 11 goals in three games, but kept a third clean sheet in four games away to Derby County; {{a game in which}} loanee Alan Hutton made his debut for the club. Against Brighton on 15 March, Neil Danns and Mark Davies made way for Lee Chung-Yong and Liam Trotter in midfield. A Will Buckley brace - one goal in each half - awarded the points to Brighton. For their next game, Bolton travelled to Somerset to face Yeovil Town at Huish Park. Bolton were two goals down at half-time thanks to goals from former Manchester City player Ishmael Miller and Kevin Dawson. However, Bolton retained their unbeaten status against Yeovil as a long-range effort from Lukas Jutkiewicz and a looping Zat Knight header - his second goal in three games - which went over the head of the stranded Marek Štěch completed the comeback for 10-man Whites, who had Alex Baptiste sent off after conceding a penalty which Miller squandered with Yeovil 2-1 up at the time; hitting the outside of the post. Against Blackpool at the Reebok in a midweek fixture, Bolton went into the lead early in the second half, with David Wheater heading in a Jay <b>Spearing</b> <b>corner.</b> Bolton held on for a clean sheet and three points, leaving them with only one loss in their last eight games. The next game at the Reebok Stadium came that weekend; another local derby this time against Wigan Athletic. Bolton took the lead when Lukas Jutkiewicz got a toe on Robert Hall's free-kick on 31 minutes and went into half-time with the lead still intact. Substitutions changed the game, however; Uwe Rösler brought on Manchester United loanee Nick Powell while Dougie Freedman brought on Alex Baptiste - back from a one-game suspension following his red card against Yeovil Town - in an unfamiliar holding midfield position while also shifting Medo Kamara to the wing. Powell proceeded to score on the 88th minute, firing home from Martyn Waghorn's cross, while Baptiste conceded a second penalty in two games, forcing Ádám Bogdán to rescue the point for Bolton; saving Jordi Gómez's spot-kick high to his right.|$|R
