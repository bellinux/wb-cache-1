40|$|A {{process model}} using Aspen Plus was {{established}} to simulate {{the performance of a}} lignite-fired 1, 025 t/h circulating fluidized bed boiler integrated with a dryer and a pyrolyzer for improving the energy efficiency. The combustion module of the proposed model was first verified by design data and the system characteristics of the circulating fluidized bed boiler combined with the <b>coal</b> <b>dryer</b> and the pyrolyzer were then investigated. The most suitable case for the retrofit of existing 1, 025 t/h CFB boilers is that 35 % of the coal was dried and then pyrolyzed with the energy efficiency of 95. 3 % and exergy efficiency of 50. 2 %. The results demonstrate the lignite-fired circulating fluidized bed boiler integrated with a dryer and a pyrolyzer facilitates the system performances effectively...|$|E
40|$|The 300, 000 lbs/hr steam {{capacity}} multicell fluidized-bed boiler (MFB) utilizes complex {{material handling}} systems. The material handling {{systems can be}} divided into the following areas: (1) coal preparation; transfer and delivery, (2) limestone handling system, (3) fly-ash removal and (4) bed material handling system. Each of the above systems are described in detail and some of the potential problem areas are discussed. A major potential problem that exists is the coal drying system. The <b>coal</b> <b>dryer</b> is designed to use 600 F preheated combustion air as drying medium and the dryer effluent is designed to enter a hot electrostatic precipitator (730 F) after passage through a cyclone. Other problem areas to be discussed include the steam generator coal and limestone feed system which may have operating difficulties with wet coal and/or coal fines...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the seventh}} Quarterly Report for this project. The {{background}} and technical {{justification for the}} project are described, including potential benefits of reducing fuel moisture, prior to firing in a pulverized coal boiler. Coal drying experiments were performed with lignite and Powder River Basin coals {{to determine the effects}} of inlet air moisture level on the equilibrium relationship between coal moisture and exit air relative humidity and temperature. The results show that, for lignite, there is a slight dependence of equilibrium moisture on inlet humidity level. However, the equilibrium relationship for PRB coal appears to be independent of inlet air humidity level. The specific equilibrium model used for computing lignite <b>coal</b> <b>dryer</b> performance has a significant effect on the prediction accuracy for exit air relative humidity; but its effects on predicted coal product moisture, exit air temperature and specific humidity are minimal. Analyses were performed to determine the effect of lignite product moisture on unit performance for a high temperature drying system. With this process design, energy for drying is obtained from the hot flue gas entering the air preheater and the hot circulating cooling water leaving the steam condenser. Comparisons were made to the same boiler operating with lignite which had been dried off-site...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} on new and innovative solutions, technologies and products {{carried out on}} an industrial scale is the most reliable method of verifying the validity of their implementation. The results obtained in this research method give almost one hundred percent certainty although, at the same time, the {{research on}} an industrial scale requires the expenditure of the highest amount of money. Therefore, this method is not commonly applied in the industrial practices. In {{the case of the}} decision to implement new and innovative technologies, it is reasonable to carry out industrial research, both because of the cognitive values and its economic efficiency. Research on an industrial scale may prevent investment failure as well as lead to an improvement of technologies, which is the source of economic efficiency. In this paper, an evaluation model of economic efficiency of the industrial scale research has been presented. This model is based on the discount method and the decision tree model. A practical application of this proposed evaluation model has been presented based on an example of the coal charge pre-drying technology before coke making in a coke oven battery, which may be preceded by industrial scale research on a new type of <b>coal</b> charge <b>dryer...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} {{technology}} development to utilize coal for efficient, affordable, and environmentally clean power generation, the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF), located in Wilsonville, Alabama, routinely demonstrates gasification technologies using {{various types of}} coals. The PSDF is an engineering scale demonstration of key features of advanced coal-fired power systems, including a KBR Transport Gasifier, a hot gas particulate control device, advanced syngas cleanup systems, and high-pressure solids handling systems. This report summarizes the results of TC 25, the second test campaign using a high moisture lignite coal from the Red Hills mine in Mississippi as the feedstock in the modified Transport Gasifier configuration. TC 25 was conducted from July 4, 2008, through August 12, 2008. During TC 25, the PSDF gasification process operated for 742 hours in air-blown gasification mode. Operation with the Mississippi lignite was significantly improved in TC 25 compared to the previous test (TC 22) with this fuel due to {{the addition of a}} fluid bed <b>coal</b> <b>dryer.</b> The new dryer was installed to dry coals with very high moisture contents for reliable coal feeding. The TC 25 test campaign demonstrated steady operation with high carbon conversion and optimized performance of the coal handling and gasifier systems. Operation during TC 25 provided the opportunity for further testing of instrumentation enhancements, hot gas filter materials, and advanced syngas cleanup technologies. The PSDF site was also made available for testing of the National Energy Technology Laboratory's fuel cell module and Media Process Technology's hydrogen selective membrane with syngas from the Transport Gasifier...|$|E
40|$|In {{line with}} Anglo American’s asset {{optimization}} and environmental policies, the <b>coal</b> burning flash <b>dryer</b> operations at its smelters {{have been identified}} for potential optimization by means of advanced process control. For this project, the process and related literature were studied in detail and a revised control philosophy, which includes modifications to the existing basic control structure {{as well as a}} hybrid rule and model-predictive advanced control layer, was developed, installed and tested on one of these flash drying operations. Since commissioning of the APC, the flash dryer’s average throughput has increased by more than 6 %, despite higher feed moistures. Furthermore, even though coal consumption has increased slightly, the operation efficiency has improved by almost 5 %. This was made possible by improving the stability of the drying column outlet temperature by approximately 40 %, which in turn enabled the selection of a more optimal setpoint. Recent data has shown that APC utilization now exceeds 95 %. This is indicative of a successful controller installation with good site acceptance.

40|$|Global trends {{stipulate}} {{the need}} to optimize existing assets while reducing environmental impacts. This paper illustrates the procedure that was followed to achieve such goals {{at one of the}} <b>coal</b> burning flash <b>dryer</b> units at an Anglo American smelter. An indepth study of the process and related literature led to the development and installation of a revised control philosophy. This system includes modifications to the existing regulatory control structure as well as a hybrid rule-based and model-predictive advanced process control (APC) layer. Since commissioning of the APC, this flash dryer’s average throughput has increased by more than 6 %, despite higher feed moistures. Furthermore, even though coal consumption has increased slightly, operating efficiency has improved by close to 5 %. This was made possible by improving stability of the drying column outlet temperature by approximately 40 %, which in turn enabled selection of a more optimal setpoint. Recent data has shown that APC utilization now exceeds 95 %. This is indicative of a successful controller installation with good site acceptance. The same philosophy has therefore since been rolled out to most of the other flash dryers in the group. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of coal {{preparation}} plants in the United States are troubled with coal fines and associated plant operation problems. As part of their process, these plants use thermal dryers for producing product coal, cyclones for first-stage recovery of coal fines, and wet scrubbers for the second-stage removal of coal fines carry-over from the dryer exhaust gas. The first challenge for these plants is to recover the clean ultra-fine coal captured in the scrubbers rather than to dispose of it in settling ponds. The second challenge is to mitigate the over-dry fine coal dusting problems in the dryer product. Prior to the completion of this program, the difficulties of the first challenge involving the recovery and use of fine clean coal from the thermal dryer scrubber effluent had not been solved. The second challenge, controlling fine coal dusting, was previously met by applying a solution of surfactants and process water to the over-dry coal fraction. As {{a result of the}} demonstration provided by the performance of this program, the implementation of a simple process improvement, involving the use of a thickener in combination with a belt press, simultaneously solved both challenges: the de-dusting and the dryer scrubber effluent recovery issues. The objective of this project was to: (1) Use a clean coal thickener with a squeeze belt press to recover the ultra-fine <b>coal</b> in <b>dryer</b> scrubber effluent; (2) Demonstrate that the coal-water mixture (CWM) produced from scrubber sludge of a thermal dryer {{can be used as a}} dust suppressant. The thickener/belt press system has increased the production of JWRI Mine Number 4 by approximately 0. 7 %. This production increase was accomplished by recovering and re-using 3 metric tons/hr (3. 3 tons/hr) of coal fines that were previously sent to holding ponds, returning this as a 50 % CWM to de-dust the 430 metric tons/hr (470 tons/hr) of existing dryer production...|$|R
