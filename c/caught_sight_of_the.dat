5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he {{gathered}} together {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to intercept the attackers. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, his force <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River {{within sight of the}} pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp.|$|E
5|$|Over France, {{the losses}} became quite severe, {{particularly}} over {{the port of}} Brest, France. German defences were strong, owing to Operation Cerberus and Operation Donnerkeil, a joint Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe plan to enable the escape of Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen through the English Channel. Five Spitfires and a Mosquito were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point {{the location of the}} ships, led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942. It was not until the day of the German operation that a Coastal Command aircraft <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships, and by then it was too late.|$|E
25|$|Iwate {{took out}} a knife and {{assaulted}} the woman, slicing open her belly {{and took out the}} liver from the fetus. However, at that moment, Iwate <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protective charm that the woman had on her, giving Iwate a great surprise. It was the very same one that she left for her daughter when she left the capital. The woman she had just killed was none other than her very own daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens! {{she is a}} steamer," [...] Tom exclaimed, as he <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> her <b>the</b> {{next time}} the Seabird lifted on a wave. [...] "Can she be the Southampton boat, do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> then <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heap <b>of</b> rubbish {{that had}} been the house, all misty in <b>the</b> cloud <b>of</b> dust. [...] "Ah!" [...] she cried, {{pressing}} her hand to her forehead.|$|R
6000|$|Then he <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Hooty <b>the</b> Owl. [...] "Ha, so that's it!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Those scamps have {{discovered}} Hooty {{and have been}} having no end of fun tormenting him. I wonder what he's doing there." ...|$|R
25|$|About 3 years later, {{a certain}} {{traveler}} <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> onibaba, and hearing of this report, Yūkei immediately went to go slay the onibaba, {{and after he}} chased and caught the fleeing onibaba, {{he was able to}} achieve slaying the onibaba. The head of the onibaba was stored in the building that Yūkei constructed, and the body was buried at a certain hill in Oyama, and as a memorial service for the onibaba, a cherry tree was planted there.|$|E
25|$|After {{hearing the}} attack on Apple in the distance, Dodge {{continued}} on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin), gathered a company of 29 mounted volunteers on arrival and sped off to intercept that band. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, they <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River {{within sight of the}} pursuing militia, and entered into a swamp. The militia crossed the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend ensued.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after departing German waters on 7 April, Lütjens′ {{force was}} {{attacked}} by British bombers which did no damage to the squadron. On 8 April, Admiral Hipper and the German destroyers were dispatched to Narvik while the German capital ships headed north for a diversionary manoeuver into the North Atlantic. As Admiral Hipper left, she met and engaged the British destroyer [...] which had become separated from Admiral Whitworth′s main force. Though Vizeadmiral Lütjens—and the two German battleships—was nearby, their assistance was deemed unnecessary, and Admiral Hipper sank Glowworm, though taking some damage in return. Whitworth′s main force then <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at 03:30 on 9 April and moved to engage the battleships.|$|E
60|$|The Rover {{boys had}} {{advanced}} {{but a few}} paces when <b>the</b> wild turkeys <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> them. <b>The</b> turkey cock issued a loud note of alarm, and all started to fly from the low bushes upon {{which they had been}} resting.|$|R

500|$|Texass {{service with}} the Grand Fleet {{consisted}} entirely of convoy missions and occasional forays {{to reinforce the}} British squadron on blockade duty in the North Sea whenever German heavy units threatened. The fleet alternated between bases at Scapa Flow and at the Firth of Forth in Scotland. Texas began her mission five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow, when she sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the 4th Battle Squadron, then on duty in the North Sea. She returned to Scapa Flow {{the next day and}} remained until 8 March, when she put to sea on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on 13 March. Texas and her division mates entered the Firth of Forth on 12 April, but got underway again on the 17th to escort a convoy. The American battleships returned to base on 20 April. Four days later, Texas again stood out to sea to support the Second Battle Squadron the day after the German High Seas Fleet had sortied from Jade Bay toward the Norwegian coast to threaten an Allied convoy. Forward units <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retiring Germans on 25 April, but at such an extreme range, [...] bringing the German fleet into engagement with the Grand Fleet was not possible. The Germans returned to their base that day, and the Grand Fleet, including Texas, did likewise on the next.|$|E
2500|$|The Armada {{failed to}} keep its course around the north of Shetland at 61'N. Instead, on 20 August, it passed safely to the south, between Orkney and Fair Isle, and was carried into the Atlantic at about 59'N. From there {{it was due to}} sail from North Uist in the Hebrides Islands until it <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distant islet of Rockall, but failed again. Southerly winds blew from 21 August to 3 September, stirred up by an {{anticyclone}} over Scandinavia, which prevented the fleet from running west-south-west as ordered. One report reflects the frustration of the navigators: [...] "We sailed without knowing whither through constant fogs, storms and squalls".|$|E
2500|$|King {{first saw}} the land that would {{become part of the}} King Ranch in April 1852 as he {{traveled}} north from Brownsville to attend the Lone Star Fair in Corpus Christi, a four-day trip by horseback. After a grueling ride, King <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Santa Gertrudis Creek, [...] from the Rio Grande. It was the first stream he had seen on the Wild Horse Desert. The land, which was shaded by large mesquite trees, so impressed him, {{when he arrived at the}} fair, he and a friend, Texas Ranger Captain Gideon K. [...] "Legs" [...] Lewis, agreed then and there to make it into a ranch.|$|E

60|$|Then {{both boys}} <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Snap and <b>the</b> others and broke off their talk. They, wanted to brush past without speaking, but Snap and Shep blocked the way.|$|R
2500|$|Following the christening an American {{worker at}} the Bath Iron Works {{approached}} {{and asked the}} attending German journalists [...] "do you only have Nazi heroes back home in Germany?" [...] US newspapers had introduced the namesake as a former Nazi sea hero. Present at the christening was a Bundeswehr helicopter which {{had been used to}} shuttle the official German government visitors around, and it bore the insignia of the Bundeswehr, a variant of the Iron Cross. When US radio reporters <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopter they mistakenly referred to the Iron Cross insignia as a swastika in their reports, thus further adding to the controversy.|$|E
2500|$|The Allied cruiser {{group was}} {{spread out in}} front of Warspite and at 15:15 they <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian main battle force and the two groups opened fire at [...] Italian {{rangefinding}} was better than the Allied, and within three minutes they had found the distance even though they were firing at extreme range. Although the Allies' rangefinding was not as good and they had trouble with their rounds falling short, the Allied gunlaying was better {{and they were able to}} place their rounds in much tighter groups. Generally the gunnery of the two forces was fairly well matched. After only a few minutes the range was down to [...] and the Allied guns became useful. However, by 15:22, the Italian fire came dangerously close to the Allied cruisers and Vice Admiral John Tovey decided to disengage. At this point splinters from a [...] shell fired by the cruiser [...] hit , damaging her catapult and the reconnaissance aircraft beyond repair. The cruisers continued to open the range and by 15:30 fire ceased.|$|E
2500|$|At [...] a Malta Baltimore {{crew had}} <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian fleet {{and gave a}} {{strength}} report of four cruisers with four destroyers, preceding two battleships and four destroyers, which reached Harwood at [...] A Photographic Reconnaissance (PR) flight over Taranto had verified {{the departure of the}} ships at [...] and another sighting reached Harwood that at [...] the fleet was making [...] southwards. At [...] Harwood signalled Vian that the Italian fleet (Admiral Angelo Iachino) with two battleships, two heavy and two light cruisers and [...] had sailed from Taranto and would reach the convoy by [...] Vian requested permission to turn back as it would be impossible for the escorts to protect the merchantmen for another long summer day and Harwood ordered Vigorous to continue towards Malta until [...] on 15 June, then turn onto a reciprocal course. At Gazala, the Eighth Army began to withdraw, after it had been defeated in the fighting from [...] leaving a garrison inside Tobruk; both sides sent aircraft to Vigorous, which gave a respite to the armies. Operation Harpoon came into range of the [...] bombers and [...] based in Sardinia. Fighter-bombers attacked first then bombers and torpedo-bombers at the same time which sank a merchant ship and damaged a cruiser. As the convoy came within range of Sicily, ten Luftwaffe Ju 88s joined in but the early attacks were defeated, seven British and [...] aircraft being lost.|$|E
60|$|As he {{did this}} he saw a man he knew hurrying along the street. The man stopped when he <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Dick and <b>the</b> two boys in the taxicab.|$|R

2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E
