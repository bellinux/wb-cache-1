In all cases a close correlation was found between the inhibitory effect on respiration and the enhancement of the sensitivity to x-rays at low oxygen pressures. EDTA, dipyridyl, and o-phenanthroline did not affect respiration to any greater extent, and they were without influence on the radiosensitivity. Cyanide, azide, and <b>cupferron,</b> which strongly inhibited respiration, also increased the frequencies of chromosome aberrations produced by x-rays at low oxygen pressures. The relation between oxygen concentration and radiosensitivity was determined both in the presence and the absence of the respiratory inhibitor <b>cupferron.</b> When <b>cupferron</b> was present, the radiosensitivity was influenced by oxygen concentrations 30 times lower than those effective {{in the absence of the}} inhibitor.

40|$|Mushroom {{tyrosinase}} (EC 1. 14. 18. 1) is {{a copper}} containing oxidase that catalyzes both the hydroxylation of tyrosine into o-diphenols and the oxidation of o-diphenols into o-quinones. In the present study, the kinetic assay {{was performed in}} air-saturated solutions and the kinetic behavior of this enzyme in the oxidation of L-tyrosine and L-DOPA has been studied. The effects of <b>cupferron</b> on the monophenolase and diphenolase activity of mushroom tyrosinase have been studied. The results show that <b>cupferron</b> can inhibit both monophenolase and diphenolase activity of mushroom tyrosinase. The lag phase of tyrosine oxidation catalyzed by the enzyme was obviously lengthened and the steady-state activity of the enzyme decreased sharply. <b>Cupferron</b> can lead to reversible inhibition of the enzyme, possibly by chelating copper at the active site of the enzyme. The IC 50 value was estimated as 0. 52 muM for monophenolase and 0. 84 muM for diphenolase. A kinetic analysis shows that the <b>cupferron</b> is a competitive inhibitor for both monophenolase and diphenolase.

At concentration lower than 1. 0 × 10 - 6 M, both V(IV) and V(V) <b>cupferron</b> complexes showed a single cathodic peak at - 0. 576 V in BRB of pH 4; thus V(IV) and V(V) ions cannot be differentiated at low concentration.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{application}} of N-benzoyl-N-phenylhydroxylamine (NBPHA) to separations of a number of transition and main group elements by liquid-liquid extraction methods. In general the partition of each element from aqueous hydrochloric or perchloric acid has been examined as a function of acidity, reagent concentration in chloroform (the second phase), rate of extraction and range of metal ion concentration. Where extraction occurred only at low hydrogen ion concentrations an aqueous acetate buffer was employed. Back-extraction into aqueous phases of various compositions was also investigated. Niobium is thus separated from zirconium; niobium, tantalum, protactinium from each other; protactinium from uranium, thorium and its fission products and gallium, indium, thallium, germanium, tin and lead from each other, A comparative study of KBPHA and the ammonium salt of N-nitroso-phenylhydroxylamine (<b>cupferron)</b> in the extraction of tin, antimony, arsenic and bismuth has also been carried out and potential separations with NBPHA noted. Depending on the valency state of tin, <b>cupferron</b> gives two distinct products, while NBPHA gives only a single product in which the valency state of the tin has previously been in some doubt. Partition studies have been devised to examine the dependence of extraction on reagent, chloride ion (a constituent of the product precipitated from hydrochloric acid) and hydrogen ion concentrations.

Presently, {{little is known}} about the marine biogeochemistry of Ti and there is a distinct lack of oceanic measurements of Ti, because of the combined difficulties of trace-metal clean sampling for an element at such low levels and the lack of a suitable shipboard method of analysis.

This method utilizes the catalytic enhancement of the reduction of the complex formed between <b>Cupferron</b> (N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine) and Ti(IV). While <b>Cupferron</b> itself acts as both a complexing agent and an oxidizing agent, it was found that the optimal sensitivity was with bromate as an auxiliary oxidant.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of Lilly and Thoday, {{that the presence}} of potassium cyanide (KCN) increases the production of chromosome aberrations by x-rays in anoxia, but has no effect on the production of chromosome aberrations by x-rays in air, was confirmed. In the presence of cyanide, the effect of a given dose of x-rays in nitrogen was found to be even greater than the effect of the same dose of x-rays in air. The cyanide effect on x-ray breakage in nitrogen was obtained at cyanide concentrations as low as 2 x 10 – 5 M. The breakage obtained after the combined x-ray-cyanide treatments was of the x-ray type, as evidenced by the distribution of breaks within and between the chromosomes. A number of other heavy metal complexing agents as well as some other compounds were tested for their ability to increase x-ray breakage in nitrogen and air. Of these compounds only <b>cupferron</b> proved to be effective. The results are discussed and it is concluded that the increased x-ray breakage in the presence of cyanide or <b>cupferron</b> cannot be due to an accumulation of peroxides. Instead it is suggested that the cyanide effect may be due to a complex formation between the active agents and heavy metals, presumably iron, within the chromosomes. The consequences of this hypothesis on the concept of the "oxygen effect," are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{finding of}} Lilly and Thoday that {{potassium}} cyanide produces structural chromosome changes in root tips of Vicia faba was confirmed. Like mustards, diepoxides, and maleic hydrazide, potassium cyanide seems {{to act on}} cells at early interphase. A tendency of cyanide breaks to be concentrated in heterochromatic segments of the chromosomes was evident. The production of chromosome aberrations by cyanide proved to be practically unaffected by the temperature during treatment. In agreement with Lilly and Thoday, the effect of potassium cyanide {{was found to be}} dependent on oxygen tension during treatment. The effect of potassium cyanide increases with increasing oxygen concentration up to 100 per cent oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, potassium cyanide was not completely inactive, but produced a low, though significant frequency of aberrations. Pretreatments with 2. 4 -dinitrophenol did not influence the effect of potassium cyanide. When bean roots were treated with potassium cyanide before a treatment with 8 -ethoxycaffeine, or {{at the same time as}} they were treated with 8 -ethoxycaffeine, the effect of 8 -ethoxycaffeine was almost completely suppressed. The effects of a number of other heavy metal complexing agents were also tested. Sodium fluoride, potassium thiocyanate, carbon monoxide, o-phenanthroline, 2. 2 -bipyridine, and sodium azide were without radiomimetic effect under the conditions employed, and so was a mixture of sodium azide and sodium fluoride. A low, but quite significant, radiomimetic effect was obtained after treatments with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, <b>cupferron,</b> and 8 -hydroxyquinoline. Under anaerobic conditions, the effects of cyanide and <b>cupferron</b> were both quantitatively and qualitatively indistinguishable. Unlike the effect of cyanide, the effect of <b>cupferron</b> was not enhanced by the presence of oxygen. The effects of the same heavy metal complexing agents were tested on the activities of the enzymes catalase and peroxidase. The activities of both of these enzymes were found to be totally inhibited only by potassium cyanide. In the other cases, little correlation was found between ability to inhibit the activities of these enzymes and ability to produce chromosome aberrations. In a number of experiments, hydrogen peroxide was found to be without radiomimetic effect, whether alone or in combination with potassium cyanide. t-Butyl hydroperoxide proved to be active. The effect of t-butyl hydroperoxide was substantially increased by pretreatments with 2. 4. -dinitrophenol. The results are discussed, and it is concluded that the observations made do not support the hypothesis that hydrogen peroxide is involved in the production of chromosome aberrations by potassium cyanide. The possibility that organic peroxides are involved cannot be excluded on the bases of the experimental results. As an alternative hypothesis, it is suggested that iron or other heavy metals are present in the chromosomes and that cyanide and other heavy metal complexing agents produce chromosome aberrations by reacting with these metals...|$|E

In the selected medium of pH 5. 5 (acetic acid-hexamine buffer solution), Cup can interact with Pb (II) to form a stable complex of [Cup-Pb(II) ], which has a sensitive second order derivative polarographic reductive peak at - 0. 64 V (vs. SCE). After the addition of CS into Cup-Pb (II) complex solution, the reductive peak current decreased without any shift of the peak potential and no new peak appeared, which indicated that an unelectroactive supramolecular complex of CS with [Cup-Pb(II) ] was formed.

40|$|Electroanalytical {{chemistry}} {{provides an}} elegant technique {{by which to}} explore, amongst others, various biological and environmental applications. To this end, four areas of electroanalytical chemistry are investigated {{in order to develop}} biologically- and environmentally-relevant sensors, together with exploring the electro-generation of a biologically important molecule and the diffusional factors that may affect this generation. The first study involves the dynamics of the bond cleavage involved in the electro-generation of nitric oxide from a range of N-nitrosoamines. Adsorption phenomena is found to be of pivotal significance in the release of nitric oxide from two of the compounds explored, namely <b>cupferron</b> and N-itrosodiphenylamine, whilst bis(nitroso) phenylenediamine released, as hoped, two moles of nitric oxide in a single step. The challenge is to isolate the product, and to determine which form of nitric oxide was generated, i. e. the cation, NO+ or nitric oxide, NO. Isolation remains a challenge, however analysis of the reaction mechanism does allow a prediction of the product, be it NO+ or NO. NO+ is a highly oxidising species and hence is difficult to isolate, therefore it is far more preferable to electro-generate NO, which <b>cupferron</b> was the only compound investigated that achieved this. The second study involved the investigation of axiosymmetric anisotropic diffusion to disc shaped microelectrodes, with theoretical expressions examined with experimental data in order to examine the factors. A ferrocene/PEG in acetonitrile system was examined in order to test this theory and to determine the effect of viscosity on the diffusion coefficients, and also if it was possible to investigate the anisotropy by effectively "blocking" either Dr or Dz. Excellent symmetry between theory and experiment was found, hence the focus turned to a ferricyanide in caesium pentadecafluorooctanoate/D 2 O system where once again the calculated value of root(Dr. Dz) affords a theoretical waveshape with reasonable agreement between theory and experiment. Potential step chronoamperometry then determined separate values for Dr and Dz, with the resulting values affording an anisotropic ratio of 1. 7, suggesting radial diffusion dominance over planar diffusion. Third, the modification of electrodes is explored in order to develop biologically and environmentally relevant sensors. In a first strand, two liquid crystal ferrocene compounds are examined, immobilised on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode simply via solvent evaporation. Both compounds demonstrated typical ion transfer processes across the liquid | liquid interface, with both anion insertion and cation expulsion processes demonstrated. The differing voltammetry observed in the presence of different anions formed the basis of the anion sensor. In a second avenue in this modified electrode work a cation sensor is developed, working {{on the basis of a}} biofilm, i. e. developing a modification of the electrode surface to mimic the action of a biofilm in chelating with cations. With this in mind, a basal plane graphite electrode was modified with a diazonium salt and polyphenol, and through the introduction of alginic acid into the polyphenol layer a degree of selectivity between the Group 2 cations was demonstrated, although quantitative properties eluded the work. Last, an environmental sensor for cyanide was developed using an electrochemical probe, tetramethylphenylenediamine (TMPD). The reaction between the electro-generated TMPD. + and cyanide is successfully followed colorimetrically, before product characterisation studies help to determine the reaction mechanism. Voltammetric studies form the basis of a sensor, with square wave voltammetry achieving a detection limit of 4. 4 microM. The reaction between TMPD and cyanide allowed remediation studies to be undertaken, with river freshwater samples from North Yorkshire (54 deg 15 ' 19. 19 " N, 1 deg 46 ' 13. 49 " W) and the Rodalquilar mine, Spain, (36 deg 50 ' 52. 9 " N, 2 deg 02 ' 36. 87 " W) demonstrating the removal of cyanide by an impressive three orders of magnitude.

40|$|Portable Analyzer Based on Microfluidic/Nanoengineered Electrochemical Sensors for in Situ Characterization of Mixed Wastes PI: Dr. Joseph Wang (In Collaboration {{with the}} PNNL PI Dr. Y. Lin). Objective of Research: This {{research}} effort aims at developing a portable analytical system for fast, sensitive, and inexpensive, on-site monitoring of toxic transition metals and radionuclides in contaminated DOE Sites. The portable devices {{will be based}} on Microscale Total Analytical systems (-TAS) or 'Lab-on-a-chip' in combination with electrochemical (stripping-voltammetric) sensors. The resulting microfluidics/electrochemical sensor system would allow testing for toxic metals to be performed more rapidly, inexpensively, and reliably in a field setting. Progress Summary/Accomplishments: This report summarizes the ASU activity over the second year of the project. In accordance to our original objectives our studies have focused on various fundamental and practical aspects of sensing and microchip devices for monitoring metal contaminants. As described in this section, we have made a substantial progress, and introduced effective routes for improving the on-site detection of toxic metals and for interfacing microchips with the real world. This activity has already resulted in 7 research papers (published or in press in major international journals). The electrochemical sensors being developed rely on the highly sensitive adsorptive stripping voltammetry (AdSV) technique to detect metal ions of interest to the DOE, particularly uranium and chromium. Traditionally, AdSV measurements of U and Cr require the use of mercury electrodes which are not suitable attractive for field deployment. Our initial goal was thus to replace these toxic mercury electrodes with 'environmentally-friendly' sensor materials. In particular, we demonstrated recently that bismuth-film electrodes offer high-quality measurements of heavy metals that compare favorably with that of mercury electrodes. Bismuth is a 'green' element, with very low toxicity, and widespread pharmaceutical use. A major effort of our activity this year has been devoted {{to the development of a}} 'mercury-free' uranium sensor based on the bismuth film electrode. Bismuth-coated carbon-fiber electrodes have thus been successfully applied for adsorptive-stripping voltammetric measurements of trace uranium in the presence of the <b>cupferron</b> complexing agent...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop novel electrochemical sensors for in-situ environmental monitoring of trace uranium and chromium. Such innovative remote/submersible and micromachined stripping-based devices will greatly enhance the detection of trace metals in a field setting, and should revolutionize the way such contaminants are being monitored. This report summarizes activity over the first 1. 5 years of a 3 -year project. This effort has led to the replacement of conventional stripping electrochemical protocols and systems with new innovative strategies for field monitoring of trace uranium and chromium, based on remotely deployable submersible sensors and micromachined hand-held total stripping analyzers. Eventually, these developments will allow to move the measurement of these metals to the field and to perform them more rapidly, reliably and inexpensively. Improved Stripping Procedures for U and Cr Traditionally, Cr and U have been measured separately using the adsorptive accumulation of their complexes with DTPA and propyl gallate (PG), respectively. To facilitate their on-site detection, the authors have developed new adsorptive stripping protocols that allow the simultaneous and rapid detection of Cr and U down to low ppb concentrations. One such new scheme involves the use of a mixed ligand (DTPA/PG) solution that allows simultaneous trace measurements in a single run (1). Numerous experimental parameters were optimized to assure that the attractive performance of the individual single-element protocols are not compromised. Simultaneous measurements in groundwater samples were documented. Alternately, they employed a single but more universal ligand (<b>cupferron)</b> for the simultaneous monitoring of Cr and U (2). Under optimal conditions, competition of these metals for the ligand and coadsoprtion effects were minimized, and different concentrations of the mixture components can be tolerated. A major goal and focus of this project has been the development of a miniaturized stripping analytical system, produced by micromachining technology. Such new micromachined stripping analyzers -integrating all the sample manipulations steps (including complex formation) with the adsorptive stripping measurement [...] will require minimal amounts of sample and reagent and will result in faster and cheaper operations. The newly designed microsystem uses an arrangement of functional modules, stacked {{on top of each other}} (to form a miniaturized flow system), including the sample and ligand/reagent reservoirs, two micro/piezo pumps, mixer, reaction coil, a silicon-based electrochemical detector and a micropotentiostat. The detector has a flow-through channel with an array of iridium microelectrodes, along with reference and counter electrodes, prepared by a photolithographic process. The size of the modules is 24 x 24 mm{sup 2 }. The complete pocket-size microanalyzer has been assembled and delivered. Preliminary results are very encouraging, with both trace (ppb) Cr and U yielding well-defined signals. Yet, there are still various technical challenges, such as limited stability of the microfabricated reference. ...|$|E
