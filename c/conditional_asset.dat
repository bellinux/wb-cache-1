Time variation in the market price of risk {{is characterized by a}} two state Markov regime switching process, while time variation in conditional betas is characterized by an asymmetric general dynamic covariance process. On the basis of estimated state dependent generalized impulse response functions, we find evidence of a flight to quality phenomenon, whereby investors shift funds from the stock market to the bond market in response to high stock market volatility. Our impulse response analysis also suggests that the degree of risk diversification achieved by cross market hedging is lowest when it is most desirable.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the best <b>conditional</b> <b>asset</b> pricing model for the Tokyo Stock Exchange sample by utilizing long-run daily data. It aims to investigate whether there are any other firm-specific variables that can explain abnormal returns of the estimated asset pricing model. Design/methodology/approach – The individual firm sample was used to conduct various cross-sectional tests of <b>conditional</b> <b>asset</b> pricing models, at the same time as using test portfolios in order to confirm the mean variance efficiency of basic unconditional models. Findings – The paper's multifactor models in unconditional forms are rejected, with the exception of the five-factor model. Further, the five-factor model is better overall than the Fama and French model and other alternative models, according to both the Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken test and the Hansen and Jagannathan distance measure test. Next, using the final conditional five-factor model as the de facto model, it was determined that the turnover ratio and the size can consistently predict Jensen's alphas. The book-to-market ratio (BM) and the past one-year returns can also significantly predict the alpha, albeit to a lesser extent. Originality/value – In the literature related to Japanese data, there has never been a comprehensive test of <b>conditional</b> <b>asset</b> pricing models using the long-run data of individual firms. The <b>conditional</b> <b>asset</b> pricing model derived for this study has led to new findings about the predictability of past one-year returns and the turnover ratio.

In line with economic intuition, the estimates of average degrees of integration show a noticeable downward trend with a decrease in the portfolio size and are also smaller for less diversified industries.

Traditional forecasting models for asset returns, in particular linear regression models and ARIMA time series based models, often provide economically meaningful asset allocation decisions. These results, however, only seem to possess power in-sample, and the out-of-sample performance of such methodologies suggests, consistent with efficient market theory, {{that there is no}} economic benefit from undertaking <b>conditional</b> <b>asset</b> allocation. Alternative forecasting models have only rarely been explored in the literature. Here, the economic forecasting power of kernel regression, a fairly common non-parametric statistical model, is investigated. As for the more traditional methodologies, it is found that the model has good economic significance in-sample. Unlike in the more traditional methods, this economic significance also persists in out-of-sample periods. Moreover, simple trading rules based on filtered signals from the model provide enhanced economic performance.
