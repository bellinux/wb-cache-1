5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven {{categories}} were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been made since.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has been}} remade several times for {{different}} platforms and has frequently been packaged with Final Fantasy II in various collections. While {{all of these}} remakes retain the same basic story and battle mechanics, various <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been made in different areas, including graphics, sound, and specific game elements.|$|E
40|$|Progress {{towards a}} {{general theory of}} {{semantic}} <b>change</b> <b>has</b> always been slow, and thus an independent characterization {{of what constitutes a}} “natural” semantic <b>change</b> <b>has</b> proven somewhat elusive.

5|$|Following Moores' {{exit from}} Everton's hierarchy, minimum <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> {{been made to}} Goodison Park's {{structure}} due to costs, two British Government Acts; the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Football Spectators Act 1989 have forced the club's hand into improving the facilities. Upon Moore's death the club was sold to Peter Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Following lengthy {{discussions between}} Royal Mail {{managers}} and union representatives {{a deal to}} settle the dispute was finally agreed to on 8 March 2010. This would see Royal Mail workers receiving a 6.9% pay rise over three years (worth 2% in 2010, 1.4% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012), while extra payments worth up to £1,400 would be made to full-time workers once all the agreed <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been made. These will {{take the form of a}} £400 payment following the agreement of union members and a further £1,000 to be paid once the planned <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been implemented. In addition the Royal Mail agreed to keep 75% of the workforce as full-time, rather than part-time staff, and to reduce working hours from 40 to 39 hours a week. In exchange, the CWU agreed to Royal Mail's modernisation strategy which include plans to introduce the automated walk sequencing machinery.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, a {{paved road}} was built from MS 2 to the Alcorn–Tishomingo county line. It was later {{extended}} to MS 25 in 1981, and was designated as MS 350 {{in the same}} year. No significant <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been made to the route since.|$|E

5|$|M-94 {{has been}} realigned several times. It {{has had its}} own roadway between the M-28 {{junctions}} in Munising and Shingleton. Other <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> flip-flopped M-94 with M-28 between Harvey and Munising and extended it across the former K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi Highway 350 (MS 350) is {{a highway}} in extreme {{northern}} Mississippi. Its western terminus is at MS 2 near Corinth. The road travels near the Tennessee state line to its eastern terminus at MS 25. The route was designated in 1981, and no significant <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been made since.|$|E
5|$|More taxonomic <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred}} at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|E

5|$|Since 1934, some {{important}} <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> {{been observed in}} the lake's biota, including {{a reduction in the}} number of Chara species, and an increase in the area covered by Salvinia since 1937. Analysis of the lake has also revealed the tendency for it to develop monospecific communities of submerged macrophytes such as Ceratophyllum and Myriophyllum.|$|E
5|$|The final {{modification}} to SH-34 occurred {{just under}} a month later, on February 2, 1987, when SH-34 was realigned in Elk City to follow I-40 {{instead of the}} old alignment of the now-dead US-66, which had become a business loop of I-40. No further <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> taken place since then.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building is also similar to how it appeared when the house was constructed. However, a few <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been made. In 1910 the two marble fireplaces were replaced by brick. The flooring has been replaced as needed. The home's basement, once the main living area, has since been converted several times for other uses.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1980s, {{many of the}} city's urban neighborhoods {{have been}} revitalized into areas popular with young {{professionals}} and college students. The greatest <b>change</b> <b>has</b> occurred along the Bardstown Road/Baxter Avenue and Frankfort Avenue corridors {{as well as the}} Old Louisville neighborhood. In recent years, such <b>change</b> <b>has</b> also occurred in the East Market District (NuLu).|$|R
5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|European {{classical}} music changed greatly in the 20th century. New music abandoned {{much of the}} historical, nationally developed schools of harmony and melody in favor of experimental music, atonality, minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features that have become common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. These <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> also made {{classical music}} less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E

5|$|Following the Romanian Revolution, due to {{shortage}} of funds, many units were disbanded and much equipment was phased out. Likewise, Romanian military capability declined {{because of a}} lack of fuel as well as training. However, since the late 1990s, a number of positive <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> come about and the level of combat readiness is growing greatly; since 1996, the military budget has grown more than four times - rising from 636 million dollars to 2.8 billion dollars in 2007. Conscription has been abolished and professionalisation has been completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, SH-19 was {{established}} through southern Caddo County, {{taking over the}} east–west section of SH-58. Thus, SH-58 was truncated to where it intersected with SH-19 (the present day western end of their concurrency). SH-58 was extended to its present terminus north of Hydro the next year. The highway was further extended in 1964, bringing the southern terminus to its present location near Medicine Park. No further routing <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> occurred since then.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} {{began to}} widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge, a project completed in 2012. The widening project added dedicated lanes for local traffic and for Blue Water Bridge traffic {{with a new}} permanent welcome center expected to open in 2015, replacing the temporary one near Capac. The lane configuration <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> confused drivers in the area, especially those with outdated GPS devices, a problem first noted as the department was preparing to reopen the freeway in October 2012. As a result, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.|$|E

50|$|The ASTAMIDS detects improvised {{explosives}} and minefields using two techniques. The first technique {{used to find}} explosives is {{a process known as}} coherent change detection. Change detection compares two images for inconsistencies. To detect whether or not a <b>change</b> <b>has</b> occurred, two images are taken of the same scene, but at different times. These images are then geometrically registered so that the same target pixels in each image align. After the images are registered, they are checked pixel by pixel. Where a <b>change</b> <b>has</b> not occurred between the two images, the pixels remain the same. When the pixels are different, a <b>change</b> <b>has</b> occurred.|$|R
