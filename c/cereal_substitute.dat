50|$|The skin of raw peeled {{chestnuts}} can {{be relatively}} easily removed by quickly blanching the nuts after scoring them by a cross slit at the tufted end. Once cooked, chestnuts acquire a sweet flavour and a floury texture {{similar to the}} sweet potato. The cooked nuts {{can be used for}} stuffing poultry, as a vegetable or in nut roasts. They can also be used in confections, puddings, desserts and cakes. They are used for flour, bread making, a <b>cereal</b> <b>substitute,</b> coffee substitute, a thickener in soups and other cookery uses, as well as for fattening stock. A sugar can be extracted from them. The Corsican variety of polenta (called pulenta) is made with sweet chestnut flour. A local variety of Corsican beer also uses chestnuts. The product is sold as a sweetened paste mixed with vanilla, crème de marron, sweetened or unsweetened as chestnut purée or purée de marron, and candied chestnuts as marrons glacés.In Switzerland, it is often served as Vermicelles.|$|E
50|$|The {{seeds of}} B. senegalensis are also {{important}} sources of nutrition, especially during times of famine. To {{gain access to the}} seeds, fruits are dried in the sun, pounded to remove the outer seed coat and soaked in water for several days, changing the water every day. The seed soaking process, also known as debittering, is essential to remove bitter and potentially toxic components. Seeds are usually cooked prior to consumption. Cooked seeds are texturally similar to a chickpea and {{can be used as a}} <b>cereal</b> <b>substitute</b> in stews, soups and porridges. Additionally, seeds can be re-dried and stored for later use or ground into a flour that can be used to make porridge. Roasted seeds can also serve as a substitute for coffee.Modern uses of B. senegalensis seeds are being developed in Niger Republic. They include cakes, cookies, bread, canned and popped seeds. These products from natural, wild B. senegalensis were recognised with the innovation award at an international food fair in Niamey, Niger, 2012.|$|E

The breakfast <b>cereals</b> <b>substitutes</b> were produced in a Brabender single screw extruder with a circular die with a 3 mm internal diameter. A central composite rotatable design was used to test the effect of different parameters on products characteristics. The independent factors were: barrel temperature (110 - 150 oC); sample composition (10 - 50 % of tomato pomace); screw speed (100 - 204 r. p. m). The tested dependent variables were color, expansion rate, texture, milk absorption ability, microstructure and antioxidant activity. The statistical analysis of the data showed that all the analyzed dependent variables were mainly affected by the mixture composition and the process temperature. Extrudates with higher chestnut flour concentration presented a darker color, high hardness and a continuous and dense structure. The extrudates with higher levels of tomato pomace presented a lighter color, low hardness and a brittle structure. Extrudates produced under higher temperatures showed a higher porous structure that led to a higher milk absorption capacity and to a higher breakdown on the hardness levels after milk immersion. Antioxidant activity of the extrudates was mainly affected by process temperatures, showing that extrudates processed at higher temperatures presented greater antioxidant activity...|$|R

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{main goal}} {{of this paper was}} to produce breakfast <b>cereal</b> <b>substitutes</b> from undervalued {{materials}} (dwells on tomato and chestnut flour), full of extrusion-cooking bioactive compounds. In the first phase, there was a physicochemical characterization of raw materials to use, in order to verify the presence of bioactive compounds and to define the processing conditions. In the second phase, it was the production and characterization of the substitutes. The parameters of the process that were studied were mixture composition, temperature and extrusion spin speed of extrusion process. So, it was established na array of experimental design with the following limits of variation: temperature T 2 T 3 = 110 - 150 ºC, 10 - 50 % of the sample composition of dwells on tomato, with the remainder of chestnut flour, and spin speed of 100 - 204 rpm. The products obtained were evaluated for color, texture absorption capacity, microstructure and antioxidant activity. The results indicated that the characteristics of extruded depend on the processing temperature and composition of the mixture. Thus, the extruded with highest quantity of dwells were those who absorbed more milk, with low hardness and a lower rate of expansion. The antioxidant activity of the products obtained was maximized for intermediate concentrations (40 / 50 %) of dwells on tomato and processing temperature (120 º to 140 º C).

A survey was conducted of the labelling of 6662 products in 40 different food categories on sale in New South Wales in 2001. Levels of compliance were assessed by comparing the claims on the label and data in the nutrition information panel with requirements of the Foods Standards Code and the Code of Practice on Nutrient Claims. Half of the products (51. 3 %) carried some type of nutrition related claim and 36. 2 % made at least one nutrient claim, with an average of 1. 2 nutrition related claims on every food product. The foods with the highest use of nutrient claims were sports drinks, breakfast <b>cereals,</b> meat <b>substitutes,</b> pretzels and rice cakes, muesli bars and yoghurt. The most common nutrient claims were for fat, cholesterol, vitamins, minerals, and sugar. More than 20 % of products carried claims related to additives. Many nutrient claims (12. 9 %) did not comply with current regulations, especially those in the voluntary Code of Practice.

30|$|On {{the basis}} of this study on intake and {{digestibility}} of nutrients, rumen fermentation attributes and nutritional profile of Malpura sheep, it may be suggested that complete rations using non conventional feed ingredients could be successfully made and tried in the diet of sheep {{to bridge the gap between}} demand and supply and to get maximum economic production. Feed costs were reduced by 26 % when PJP replaced up to 50 % of the concentrate diet of sheep, without affecting their growth (Sawal et al. 2004). The local price of PJP is observed to be 25 % of the price of concentrate mixture and thus at 40 % level of replacement the price would be reduced by 30 %. In a series of experiments, Talpada et al.

Australian rye foods are available, {{but have not}} been studied for their potential to influence health as whole grain foods and in amounts likely to be beneficial, as has occurred in Finland (1, 2). Objectives: To evaluate the effects of whole rye foods compared to fibre matched whole wheat and low fibre white wheat flour foods on markers of bowel health, colon cancer risk and on post prandial glucose and insulin response. Subjects: 28 males, mean age 56 years, mean BMI 30 kg/m 2 and no history of bowel disease or chronic constipation. Experimental Design: Three interventions of 4 weeks duration in a completely randomized crossover design: 1. Low Fibre Wheat (LFW) – 20 g dietary fibre/day. 2. High Fibre Wheat (HFW) – 35 g dietary fibre/day. 3. High Rye Fibre (RF) – 35 g dietary fibre. Key test foods {{in the form of}} bread, crackers and cereal were provided. Fasting blood and 48 hour faecal samples were collected {{at the end of each}} period. An assessment of insulin and glycemia one hour after a standard breakfast cereal meal (50 g available carbohydrate) was also performed. Results: Relative to LFW, both RF and HFW increased faecal output by 33 – 36 %, decreased pH by 0. 2 units, decreased post prandial insulin by 46 – 49 %, decreased post prandial glucose by 16 – 19 % and reduced faecal β-glucuronidase by 29 % and faecal p-cresol 21 – 33 % (all P < 0. 05). Only RF showed a significant 41 % increase in plasma enterolactone and a 36 % increase in faecal butyrate.

40|$|In a WTO {{battle and}} the press the {{argument}} is often made that eliminating US cotton subsidies would have a large effect on the incomes and competitive position of farmers in developing countries. In Francophone West Africa cotton productivity has stagnated after rapid gains {{in the first two}} decades following independence (1960 - 1980). A farm model was constructed based on farmers' definition of their decision-making framework which they use to respond to income and weather risks. With this model the effects on farmers of eliminating US subsidies are compared with various productivity increasing measures for cotton and sorghum in Dioila, Mali. Dioila is located in a representative cotton region producing 16 % of the cotton in Mali.

40|$|Background: Food allergy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} among other allergic diseases. Although it is less prevalent in adult but in infants it’s prevalence was reported as much as 8 percent. In part, wheat {{is one of the}} six main food allergens in infant and in other part there is extensive cross reactivity between the cereals. Therefore the aim of this study is selection of the best food substitute for wheat among other cereals. Materials and Methods: 24 patients with definitive diagnosis of type one hypersensitivity reaction to wheat were entered in this study. Skin prick test and serum specific IgE (Eliza) with 6 members of cereals family (wheat, barley, oat, Rye-Rice & Corn) were performed for them and open food challenge test was also done with three more available of the cereals (corn, Rice, barley) in our food culture and so comparison between allergenicity of wheat flour and wheat bran with skin prick test were done. Results: The Skin prick tests (SPTs) were positive in 66. 7 percent for Barley, 100 percent for wheat bran and 80 - 100 percent for other cereals. The results of specific IgE for wheat, Barley were positive in 94. 5 percent, 68 percent, 39 percent of patients respectively and the results for other cereals were positive in less than 11 percent of cases. The results of food challenge test, for barley were positive in 60 percent of cases and for Rice and Corn were negative in all cases.

40|$|The {{competition}} between {{food and feed}} challenges the use of alternative resources such as fibrous feedstuffs in diets for pigs. Adding fat to high fiber diets appears as a relevant strategy to improve dietary energy value and feed efficiency, but this changes the nutrients and energy source compared to a standard low fat diet. This study aimed to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms involved in variations of adiposity when pigs were fed a high fat high fiber diet. Growing barrows (Large White, n = 48) divergently selected for feed efficiency were offered during 10 weeks either a low fat, low fiber diet (LF) or a high fat, high fiber diet (HF) where oils and wheat straw were used to partially <b>substitute</b> <b>cereals</b> (n = 24 per diet). At 132 days of age, HF pigs displayed lower (P 1. 1 or < 0. 9). A multiple factor analysis revealed large similarities between the two adipose tissues in response to diets. Notably, different genes related to protein catabolism (33 DEG), protein transport (33 DEG), apoptosis (31 DEG), phosphate metabolic process including ATP synthesis (34 DEG), response to stress (26 DEG) and glucose metabolism (13 DEG) were commonly down-regulated in HF pigs. Conversely, IGF 1 R participating to the negative regulation of apoptotic process was up-regulated by the HF diet in the two adipose tissues. Correlation modules also stressed the up-regulation by the HF diet of genes related to immunity and defense response specifically in PRAT. Causality graph analysis highlighted MLXIPL, SREBF 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARG, PPARD) and their heterodimer partner RXRA as candidate upstream regulators of these processes. qPCR analyses confirmed dietary-related differences in expression levels of these regulators in the two adipose tissues. Altogether, high fiber intake in growing pigs was associated with lower body fatness, which was related to lower glucose metabolism in adipose tissues; its effect on immune factors in the perirenal fat deserves further studies...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{landfill}} directive {{has imposed}} a challenging set of {{targets for the}} UK {{to reduce the amount}} of waste sent to landfill. This has resulted in an increased realisation that wastes can be recycled and reprocessed into valuable products. One such area that is undergoing significant development is the composting of biodegradable waste products. The primary or secondary treatment of wastes by earthworms (vermicomposting) has been proposed as a mechanism to enhance the commercial value of composts. The commercialization of these technologies, however, requires the development of stable markets and consumer confidence in the end products. Currently, in the scientific literature, there are several reports that vermicomposts enhance plant growth; however the mechanism for this enhancement is poorly understood. The first experimental chapter of this thesis presents data from an experiment into the in-vessel co-composting of Green Wastes (GW), Green waste with Paper Pulp (GW/PP), and Green waste with Biosolids (GW/SS) using Ecopod® composting process. It aimed to determine whether compost chemistry and end-use was affected by feedstock quality. Consequently, three feedstock were made by mixing green waste with paper pulp or biosolids (paper I). Vermicomposts were subsequently produced from the three Ecopod® composts. In three separate plant growth trials the presence of vermicompost significantly affected plant growth. However, not all plant species responded in the positive manner previously reported (paper II). In <b>cereal</b> growth, <b>substituting</b> inorganic fertiliser with vermicompost did not decrease yield as long as some inorganic fertiliser was present in the feeding regime. This is true for wheat and maize (paper III, appendix 2). Similarly silage grass responded much better to applications of vermicompost than to conventional composts applied at the same rate (appendix 2). Tomatoes grown in commercial growth media substituted with vermicompost did not respond in the same way as reported in previous studies; no significant yield increases were observed. Few studies report on the effect of growing medium/ fertilising regime on vitamin content of foods. With increasing interest in organic food production systems in particular, it is becoming increasingly important that we understand the effects that growing conditions have on the nutritional properties of foods. In this case there was no effect of growing medium on ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content of tomatoes (paper IV). The final chapter (paper V) was a collaborative work with A. P. Williams and investigates the effect of earthworm digestion on the survival and proliferation of E. coli 0157 in composts and soil. Litter dwelling earthworms (e. g. Dendrobaena veneta) significantly aided the lateral movement of E. coli 0157 within compost. Our results imply that whilst long-term persistence of E. coli 0157 in soil and compost may be unaffected by the presence of earthworms, digestion from worms may aid proliferation of the pathogen during initial stages of soil or compost contamination. In summary, this thesis shows that feedstock can be used to manipulate compost product quality. After vermicomposting the plant growth response is often species specific. Our failure to replicate US studies suggests that vermicompost production methods and process management may also affect end product quality. This will hinder commercialisation of the technology. Significant further work is required to identify the method by which plant growth enhancement is facilitated by vermicomposts and to what extent this is specific to a particular vermicompost production method. i...|$|R
40|$|The use and {{partition}} of feed energy are key elements in productive efficiency of pigs. This study aimed {{to determine whether}} dietary energy sources affect the {{partition of}} body lipids and tissue biochemical pathways of energy use between pigs differing in feed efficiency. Forty-eight barrows (pure Large White) from two divergent lines selected for residual feed intake (RFI), a measure of feed efficiency, were compared. From 74 d to 132 ± 0. 5 d of age, pigs (n = 12 by line and by diet) were offered diets with equal protein and ME contents. A low fat, low fiber diet (LF) based on cereals and a high fat, high fiber diet (HF) where vegetal oils and wheat straw were used to partially <b>substitute</b> <b>cereals,</b> were compared. Irrespective of diet, gain to feed was 10 % better (P < 0. 001), and carcass yield was greater (+ 2. 3 %; P < 0. 001) in the low RFI compared with the high RFI line; the most-efficient line was also leaner (+ 3. 2 % for loin proportion in the carcass, P < 0. 001). In both lines, daily feed intake and average daily gain were lower when pigs were fed the HF diet (- 12. 3 % and - 15 %, respectively, relatively to LF diet; P < 0. 001). Feeding the HF diet reduced the perirenal fat weight and backfat proportion in the carcass {{to the same extent}} in both lines (- 27 % on average; P < 0. 05). Lipid contents in backfat and Longissimus muscle (LM) also declined (- 5 % and - 19 %, respectively; P < 0. 05) in pigs offered the HF diet. The proportion of saturated fatty acids (FA) was lower but the percentage of polyunsaturated FA, especially the essential FA C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3, was greater (P < 0. 001) in backfat of HF pigs. In both lines, these changes were associated with a marked decrease (P < 0. 001) in the activities of two lipogenic enzymes, the fatty acid synthase and the malic enzyme, in backfat. For the high RFI line, the hepatic lipid content was greater (P < 0. 05) in pigs fed the HF diet than in pigs fed the LF diet, despite a reduced fatty acid synthase activity (- 32 %; P < 0. 001). In both lines, the HF diet also led to lower glycogen content (- 70 %) and lower glucokinase activity (- 15 %; P < 0. 05) in the liver. These results show that dietary energy sources modified the partition of energy between liver, adipose tissue and muscle {{in a way that was}} partly dependent of the genetics for feed efficiency, and changed the activity levels of biochemical pathways involved in lipid and glucose storage in tissues...|$|R
