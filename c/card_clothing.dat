50|$|A {{dye-sublimation printer}} is a {{computer}} printer which uses heat to transfer dye onto materials such as a plastic, card, paper, or fabric. The sublimation name was first applied because the dye was considered {{to make the transition}} between the solid and gas states without going through a liquid stage. This understanding of the process was later shown to be incorrect. There is some liquifying of the dye. Since then, the process is sometimes known as dye-diffusion, though this has not eliminated the original name. Many consumer and professional dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints, ID <b>cards,</b> <b>clothing,</b> and more.|$|R

50|$|Carding is a {{mechanical}} process that disentangles, cleans and intermixes fibres {{to produce a}} continuous web or sliver suitable for subsequent processing. This is achieved by passing the fibers between differentially moving surfaces covered with <b>card</b> <b>clothing.</b> It breaks up locks and unorganised clumps of fibre and then aligns the individual fibers to be parallel with each other. In preparing wool fibre for spinning, carding is the step that comes after teasing.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} machine carder is {{the drum}} carder. Most drum carders are hand-cranked {{but some are}} powered by electric motor. These machines generally have two rollers, or drums, covered with <b>card</b> <b>clothing.</b> The licker-in, or smaller roller meters fibre from the infeed tray onto the larger storage drum. The two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain-drive so that their relative speeds cause the storage drum to gently pull fibres from the licker-in. This pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the storage drum's card cloth. Fibre is added until the storage drum's card cloth is full. A gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full.|$|E

[...] Shortly thereafter {{he was both}} drafted into the U.S. Navy and married his bookkeeper, Ella Mae Bennett, who managed the business in his absence. In the 1950s, Hollingsworth perfected metallic <b>card</b> <b>clothing,</b> revolutionizing the textile carding process. He also purchased and rebuilt used cards for sale. Though Hollingsworth products and his reputation for excellent service soon made him a wealthy, internationally significant manufacturer of textile machinery, {{he could be a}} slapdash businessman. In 1964, a newly hired accountant was horrified to discover that although Hollingsworth's company had annual sales of about $9 million, the business was not incorporated and Hollingsworth had kept no accounting books. Hollingsworth was also overly enamored of innovative textile machinery and made many uneconomical purchases.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The use {{of credit}} cards by young families, their money {{management}} practices, {{and the relationship between}} money management practices and their control of credit card use was researched in this study. A sample of 60 Oregon families was drawn from the 1975 Johnson's Albany Area City Directory. These families were composed of a married couple living together with at least 1 child between the ages of 6 and 10 years, who used credit cards monthly. The husbands had a mean age of 33 years, and had completed a mean of 14 years of schooling. The wives were younger {{with a mean age of}} 30 and had completed a mean of 13 years of schooling. The couples were married a mean of 10 years, and 60 percent had 2 children. The husbands were principally employed in operative and laborer occupations, and the wives were largely homemakers. Sixty-three percent of the families earned a total yearly income between 10, 000 and 22, 000. The mean yearly income was 17, 857. The number {{of credit cards}} used by the families in a month ranged from 1 to 21 with a mean of 4 cards. Credit cards were used 1 to 61 times in an average month, with a mean frequency of 9 times per month. The mean number of types of purchases made with credit cards in a month was 6. Sixty-seven percent of the families used an oil company credit card regularly, followed closely by 65 percent who used a retail store <b>card.</b> <b>Clothing</b> was the commodity purchased with credit cards by the largest number of families, gasoline was the second most frequently purchased item. Most families charged under 100 per month with credit cards. Eighty-seven percent of the families reported that both the husband and wife decided upon the purchases to make with credit cards, although 60 percent reported that the wives made the most purchases using credit cards. Most of the wives used a credit card bearing their names, including those whose accounts were in the husbands' names. Spending plans were used by 78 percent of the families; the most common being unwritten plans for a month. Eighty-two percent of the families kept their sales slips from credit card purchases as a means of keeping records of their purchases. A regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses that control of credit card use was linearly related to the money management practices of the families. The money management practices included 1) the number of credit cards used by the families, 2) the number of types of purchases for which the families used a credit card, 3) record keeping practices used by the families, 4) budgeting practices employed by the families, and 5) the frequency with which the families made purchases using a credit card. Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 1, the number of credit card bills paid in full is linearly related to the money management practices employed by a family, was not supported by the data at the. 10 level of significance. Fifty percent of the families paid their credit card bills in full 11 or 12 months of the year. The mean number of months in which all credit card bills were paid in full was 7. Hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 2, the number of monthly credit card billings that are missed is linearly related to the money management practices employed by a family, was not supported at the. 10 significance level. Eighty percent of the families reported that they never missed payment on a credit card debt. Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 3, the degree to which the family buys more with credit cards than if cash were required is linearly related to the money management practices employed by a family was not supported at the. 10 level of significance. Sixty-eight percent of the families reported that credit cards caused them to buy no more or just slightly more than if cash were required. Hypothesis 4. Hypothesis 4, the degree to which the family buys more with credit cards than if another loan were required is linearly related to the money management practices employed by a family, was not supported by the data at the. 10 level of significance. Fifty percent of the 60 families reported that credit cards caused them to buy no more than if another type of credit were required to make a purchase. Hypothesis 5. Hypothesis 5, the degree to which the family indicates that it feels in control of its credit card use is linearly related to the money management practices employed by a family, was supported at the. 01 level of significance. A strong direct relationship (significant at the. 001 level) was shown to exist between the families' feelings of control of credit card use and their budgeting practices. In the presence of all money management practices, the frequency with which families used credit cards was shown to have an inverse effect upon the families' feelings of control, significant at the. 05 level. The families in the study demonstrated control of their credit card use, and used them for convenience rather than for installment debt instruments. Credit cards were regarded by a large number of families as a temptation to overspend...|$|E

40|$|Privacy is a {{major concern}} in RFID systems, {{especially}} with widespread deployment of wireless-enabled interconnected personal devices e. g.

An RFID authentication protocol should not only allow a legitimate reader to authenticate a tag but it should also protect the privacy of the tag against unauthorized tracing: an adversary should {{not be able to get}} any useful information about the tag for tracking or discovering the tag’s identity. In this paper, we analyze the privacy of some recently proposed RFID authentication protocols (2006 and 2007) and show attacks on them that compromise their privacy.

We describe our attacks against a general untraceability model; from experience we view this endeavour as a good practice to keep in mind when designing and analyzing security protocols...|$|R
5000|$|Caswell {{came under}} fire from Michigan Public Radio [...] for a 2011 {{proposal}} to issue the Michigan state $80 clothing allowance for children that receive state welfare assistance [...] as an $80 gift card redeemable at secondhand clothing stores, such as Goodwill and Salvation Army, rather than just adding another $80 credit to the Bridge Card account that would be untraceable in how it was actually spent. The Michigan Radio article and a subsequent article in the Michigan Messenger incorrectly stated that this proposal would affect the clothing allowance for foster children; however, the foster care clothing allowance is a different program [...] and was never a part of Caswell's proposal. [...] Under the current system, DHS issues each year, on average, an additional $80 to a child’s parents’ Bridge <b>Card</b> for the <b>clothing</b> allowance.

5000|$|Jim Bambra {{reviewed}} Time of the Dragon for Dragon magazine #161 (September 1990). Bambra {{noted the}} [...] "satisfying and intriguing way" [...] {{that the absence}} of the gods following the events of the Cataclysm has had its effect on the development of Taladas, as the clerics of Taladas had to compensate by finding new ways to maintain their influence; with the return of the gods, they have refrained from making clerical powers widely available so that only a chosen few clerics from each culture are able to work miracles. He felt that the loss of clerical abilities following the Cataclysm is [...] "neatly integrated into the histories of the peoples" [...] and that the [...] "effects of the selective return of these powers are also well described". Bambra calls the book's emphasis on exotic cultures, rather than the feudal societies and economies that make up the bulk of fantasy game worlds [...] "a refreshing and intriguing change", noting that [...] "The background on these cultures is nicely detailed, evoking lifestyles and belief systems that fit in well with the land around them." [...] He considered the continent of Taladas [...] "an intriguing and impressive game world", although it [...] "falls down slightly is in its presentation" [...] because [...] "The information is all presented {{from the point of view}} of the DM, with no sections specifically for players to read. The burden of introducing the players to Taladas and bringing the world to life falls squarely on the GM. Sections written specifically for players ... would have enhanced this product immensely and made it more accessible." [...] Bambra felt that the player character kits [...] "make character generation easier and provide backgrounds for PCs, but fail to give a detailed overview of cultural and racial outlooks". He also considered that [...] "Anyone interested in the military side of Taladas will find the army organization charts and statistics for the Battlesystem supplement invaluable. Even if the Battlesystem supplement is never used, the information presented here is also very useful in standard role-playing encounters." [...] According to Bambra, [...] "Time of the Dragon contains some of the finest maps to ever appear in a role-playing product," [...] and that the large two-part map of the continent of Taladas is [...] "excellent", while the blow-up map of the lands of the League of Minotaurs and the map showing the minotaur-controlled city of Kristophan are [...] "nicely rendered, with good use of color". He called the color cards [...] "impressive and have been used to good effect" [...] and that the standard of the artwork on the cards is [...] "very high, with the armor and <b>clothing</b> <b>cards</b> being particularly noteworthy". Bambra concluded by saying that [...] "The background of Time of the Dragon is plausible and meticulously presented, with neatly integrated cultures and races. It can easily be used as a campaign setting in its own right, as it not tightly tied to the world of Krynn. Time of the Dragon is well worth looking at and marks a departure from the standard Dragonlance saga setting. It has plenty to recommend it to gamers looking for a harsh and gritty fantasy world." ...|$|R
