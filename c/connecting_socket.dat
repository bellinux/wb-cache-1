The charging system includes charging cable with one end connecting gang socket, electromagnetic gear driving the <b>connecting</b> <b>socket</b> and a charging pile breaking or closing, and detecting part for detecting electric vehicle static call or start state. The gang socket mentioned above {{is linked to}} electromagnetic gear, and the detecting part is connected with charging management system containing the intelligent charging power module which controls the electromagnetic drive action to close socket with a charging pile at static state and to break at start state.

The Windows Sockets API covered almost all the features of the BSD sockets API, but there were some unavoidable obstacles which mostly arose out of fundamental differences between Windows and Unix (though Windows Sockets differed less from BSD sockets than the latter did from STREAMS). All function calls in the API begin with the moniker WSA, e.g. WSASend (...) for sending data on a <b>connected</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — On a {{multi-socket}} architecture {{with load}} below peak, {{as is often}} the case in a server installation, it is common to consolidate load onto fewer sockets to save processor power. However, this can increase main memory power consumption due to the decreased total cache space. This paper describes inter-socket victim cacheing, a technique that enables such a system to do both load consolidation and cache aggregation at the same time. It uses the last level cache of an idle processor in a <b>connected</b> <b>socket</b> as a victim cache, holding evicted data from the active processor. This enables expensive main memory accesses to be replaced by cheaper cache hits. This work examines both static and dynamic victim cache management policies. Energy savings is as high as 32. 5 %, and averages 5. 8 %. I...|$|R

50|$|The SATA {{standard}} {{defines a}} data cable with seven conductors (three grounds and four active data lines in two pairs) and 8 mm wide wafer connectors on each end.

Thus, SATA connectors and cables are easier to fit in closed spaces, and reduce obstructions to air cooling. Although they are more susceptible to accidental unplugging and breakage than PATA, users can purchase cables that have a locking feature, whereby a small (usually metal) spring holds the plug in the socket.|$|R

5000|$|Multi-standard sockets are {{sometimes}} used in China {{and some other}} Asian countries; these are intended to accommodate plugs conforming to various different standards. They do not normally have earthing (grounding) connections for either CEE 7/4 [...] "Schuko", or CEE 7/5 (French), or their combination CEE 7/7. In multi-standard sockets, the aperture size for NEMA plugs is often the same for both Line (Hot) and Neutral, which allows a polarized plug to be inserted in either orientation, thus defeating the safety feature. Also, in a socket designed to accept both NEMA and BS 1363 plugs, the polarization can only be correct for one type of plug, so only appliances which do not require specific polarization should be <b>connected.</b> Multi-standard <b>sockets</b> made by Lengon are amongst those classified as serious safety risks, because they allow the user to {{come into contact with}} live parts.|$|R
