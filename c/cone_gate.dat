50|$|Maintaining her {{preference}} for large scale works, Webster’s sculptures are as dramatic and monumental as her installations. Although her sculptures generally pertain to environmental themes and incorporate natural materials, her pieces are sometimes composed of controlled geometric forms. Webster often {{turns to a}} certain roster of forms - <b>cones,</b> <b>gates,</b> hollows, beds, and rings - when creating her sculptures. Stick Spiral, created for the Panza Collection and later bequeathed to the Guggenheim Museum, consists of a simple spiral shape created solely from branches. The clean geometry is interrupted by the chaotic arrangement of branches, yet the piece remains contemplative rather than aggressive.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The cone SONOS {{memory device}} is a {{vertical}} device {{and has a}} merit of electric field concentration at the channel region near the drain. The key point of the device is excellent program/erase characteristic induced by electric field concentration in the channel region near the drain and electric field reduction in the blocking oxide. There are three important unit processes, patterning <b>cone</b> shape, overlapped <b>gate</b> formation, and drain contact. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} fabrication process of the structure. 1...|$|R
40|$|Increase in the {{complexity}} of VLSI digital circuit design demands faster logic simulation techniques than those currently available. One of the ways of speeding up existing logic simulation algorithms is by exploiting the inherent parallelism in the sequential version. We propose a T-algorithm based logic simulation algorithm on a network of workstations interconnected by a local area network. The main objective has been to balance the computational load among the processors {{and at the same}} time reduce the communication to a bare minimum. We have achieved these by partitioning the circuit into <b>cones</b> containing <b>gates</b> in a fanout free region (FFR). Further, the cones of FFRs at the same level (having the same distance from primary inputs) are assigned by the master processor and communicated to the other workstations through the network. We have kept the balance on the computational load among slave processors by assigning a proper number of FFR cones, using a good heuristic. We have also shown that FFR partitioning reduces the amount of communication between the processors We have implemented the distributed logic simulation algorithm on a network of workstations using the communication primitives send and receive on sockets provided by the BSD 4. 2 network library. The paper concludes with a tabulated results on the timings obtained on the ISCAS[8] benchmark circuits...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhysiological and {{pharmacological}} {{mechanisms of}} glutamatergic, GABAergic and glycinergic synapses in the tiger salamander retina were studied. We used immunocytochemical and autoradiographic methods to study localizations of these neurotransmitters and their uptake transporters; and electrophysiological methods (intracellular, extracellular and whole cell patch electrode recordings) {{to study the}} light responses, miniature postsynaptic currents and neurotransmitter-induced postsynaptic currents in various retinal neurons. Our {{results are consistent with}} the following scheme: Glutamate is used by the photoreceptor and bipolar cell output synapses and the release of glutamate is largely mediated by calcium-dependent vesicular processes. The postsynaptic glutamate receptors in DBCs are l-AP 4 receptors, in HBCs, HCs and ganglion cells are the kainate/AMPA and NMDA receptors. Subpopulations of HCs make GABAergic synapses on <b>cones</b> and <b>gate</b> chloride condunctance through GABAA receptors. GABAergic HCs do not make feedforward synapses on bipolar cell dendrites and the neurotransmitter identity of the HCs making feedforward synapses is unknown. Subpopulations of amacrine cells make GABAergic synapses on bipolar cell synaptic terminals, other amacrine cells and ganglion cells and GABA gates chloride conductances in theses cells. Glycinergic amacrine cells make synapses on bipolar cell synaptic terminals, other amacrine cells and ganglion cells and glycine opens postsynaptic chloride channels.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for identifying functionally equivalent faults {{and improving the}} performance of diagnostic test pattern generation is described in this paper. The procedure is based on evaluation of faulty functions in <b>cones</b> of dominator <b>gates</b> of fault pairs. This is enhanced by utilizing circuit redundancy information. Equivalence is proved without the previously required circuit transformations. Stem-branch equivalences for reconvergent stems and their branches are identified efficiently obviating the need to check for non-masking and multiple-path sensitization. Both static and dynamic techniques are developed to exploit relations among inputs of dominator cones. This reduces the simulation time required by the procedure and enables evaluation of larger cones than could be evaluated earlier. As a result, more equivalent fault pairs are identified. Experiments performed on ISCAS 85 circuits and full scan ISCAS 89 circuits are used to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|Fault {{diagnosis}} is performed {{to locate and}} identify physical failures in a defective integrated circuit. In this thesis, solutions to several problems in fault diagnosis are presented. First, techniques for identifying indistinguishable or functionally equivalent faults in combinational circuits are described. The techniques are based on implication of faulty values; and evaluation of faulty functions in <b>cones</b> of dominator <b>gates</b> of fault pairs. This is enhanced by utilizing circuit redundancy information. Static and dynamic methods are developed to exploit relations among inputs of dominator cones and further speed up the identification of equivalent fault pairs. Improvements compared to previous approaches are achieved in both the number of equivalent fault pairs identified and the time to prove equivalence. Second, theorems are introduced to identify indistinguishable fault pairs in synchronous sequential circuits using an iterative logic array of limited length. A theoretical framework for identification of sequential indistinguishability is developed utilizing information about reachable states, valid states and strongly connected components. Finally, an integrated approach for {{diagnosis is}} developed to accurately locate manufacturing defects. A fault model is used to encompass {{the behavior of a}} large variety of fault models and dominance relations among faults are used to reduce the list of candidate defect sites. Diagnosis techniques based on this fault model are described that accurately locate bridging defects and transition defects. ...|$|R
