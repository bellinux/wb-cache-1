5|$|The Song {{government}} provided {{tax incentives}} to farmers who tilled lands {{along the edges}} of lakes, marshes, seas, and terraced mountain slopes. Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes. The 10th century introduction of early-ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China, which experienced rapid development. The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An effective yield from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient weeding, maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest. Planting and weeding often required a dirty day of work, since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare feet. For other crops, water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> manure was constantly spread.|$|E
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E

Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures.|$|E
25|$|The Drammen Line {{past the}} site of Høvik Station opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872. The railway station serving Høvik opened on 1 May 1874. It was the first railway station between Sandvika Station and Lysaker Station. The new means of {{transport}} allowed the Høvik area to develop as a suburban residential area allowing commuters {{to travel to the}} capital. The original station building was a standard design by Georg Andreas Bull used for most stations along the Drammen Line. In addition to a station building it featured a Narvesen kiosk. A spur to load cars with <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> garbage was installed in 1908. Bærum Municipality established a public library for Høvik in 1911.

25|$|On 26 July {{more than}} 2,800 cattle carcasses, fed with cesium-contaminated food, had been shipped for public {{consumption}} to 46 of the 47 prefectures in Japan, with only Okinawa remaining free. Part of this beef, which {{had reached the}} markets, still needed to be tested. In an attempt to ease consumer concern the Japanese government promised to impose inspections on all this beef, and to buy the meat back when higher-than-permissible cesium levels were detected during the tests. The government planned to eventually pass on the buy-back costs to TEPCO. The same day the Japanese ministry of agriculture urged farmers and merchants to renounce the use and sale of compost made of manure from cows {{that may have been}} fed the contaminated straw. The measure also applied to humus from leaves fallen from trees. After developing guidelines for safety levels of radioactive caesium in <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> humus, this voluntary ban could be lifted.|$|E
500|$|Earwigs are {{generally}} nocturnal, and typically hide in small, dark, and often moist {{areas in the}} daytime. They can usually be seen on household walls and ceilings. Interaction with earwigs at this time results in a defensive free-fall to the ground followed by a scramble to a nearby cleft or crevice. During the summer they can be found around damp areas such as near sinks and in bathrooms. Earwigs tend to gather in shady cracks or openings or anywhere that they can remain concealed during daylight. Some people erroneously believe that earwigs burrow into people's ears; that is mostly a myth, although earwigs may crawl into ears and some can bite, as other insects do. [...] Picnic tables, <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> waste bins, patios, lawn furniture, window frames, or anything with minute spaces (even artichoke blossoms) can potentially harbour them.|$|E

2500|$|Species that {{originated}} from the coastal areas {{and from the}} lower foothills make most of their growth in winter whereas the true alpine species are summer growers. Tuberous Tropaeolum species are well known for occasionally remaining dormant for one or more years. The species with underground rhizomes and tubers can be propagated from these while other species are best raised from seed. Fresh seed is favoured by many growers but dried seed is also often successful. Seed from the winter growing species should be sown in the autumn while the summer growing species are best sown in the spring in well-drained <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> covered with [...] of grit or sand. The containers should be kept at below [...] until the seedlings appear in about a month, as too high a temperature inhibits germination.|$|E
2500|$|The duo {{reportedly}} {{first met}} in 1992, when de Luca DJed on a techno party organised by Fakesch. Their diverse musical backgrounds (hip hop and Heavy Metal) notwithstanding, they initially produced straight minimalist techno {{under the name}} Musik Aus Strom (German for music made of electricity) and signed for a six-album deal to Unit Moebius' label Bunker Records/Acid Planet in 1994. Acid Planet was unable to release anything until 1996 due to monetary constraints, however, and de Luca and Fakesch adopted the name Funkstörung and used the moniker Musik Aus Strom for their own label, on which they released a few EPs with a new, more melodic and rhythmically complex IDM/Glitch sound. After more EPs on the <b>Compost</b> <b>and</b> Chocolate Industries labels {{and a series of}} high-profile remixes for Björk mit Funkstörung on Fat Cat Records and Wu-Tang Clan, they finally signed to [...] in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the growth}} in {{biological}} farming practices becoming more common throughout the Australia, traditional synthetic based fertilisers are replaced {{by the use of}} organic fertilisers in the form of <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> soil conditioners. Compost can improve overall soil health when incorporated into the soil or surface-applied as a soil conditioner. Despite differing in nutrient requirements, crops such as wheat, barley, oats, maize, canola, lucerne, fruit trees, grapes, sugar cane and much more can all benefit from the addition of pasteurised and composted organic materials. Compost can improve the soil’s physical, biological and chemical properties and positively enhance actively growing crops. Australian farmers are leading the way in the [...] of organic materials both above and below the soil surface. This continued used of composted organics completes the law of return cycle in the soil food chain, where nutrients removed through the plants, are returned to the soil.|$|E
