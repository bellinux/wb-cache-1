40|$|Although the Bélanger-Böss theorem of {{critical}} flow {{has been widely}} applied in open channel hydraulics, it {{was derived from the}} laws governing ideal frictionless flow. This study explores a more general expression of this theorem and examines its applicability to flow with friction and sediment transport. It demonstrates that the theorem can be more generally presented as the principle of minimum energy (PME), with maximum efficiency of energy use and minimum friction or minimum energy dissipation as its equivalents. <b>Critical</b> <b>flow</b> <b>depth</b> under frictionless conditions, the best hydraulic section where friction is introduced, and the most efficient alluvial channel geometry where both friction and sediment transport apply are all shown to be the products of PME.

This leads to the formation of relatively stable but dynamic energy-consuming meandering and braided channel planforms and explains the existence of various extremal hypotheses...|$|E

Its determination depends upon the subjective judgment of the investigator. Effects of this judgment on sediment transport and flow parameters have been investigated in this paper by considering three flow conditions of M (when small number of particles start to move), M 1 (when large number of particles starts to move), and M 2 (when very large number of particles starts to move). Data used in this paper were collected from a sediment transport study conducted in the hydraulics laboratory of the University of Manitoba (Canada). Effects of each flow condition on sediment transport, critical discharge, <b>critical</b> velocity, and <b>flow</b> <b>depth</b> parameters were investigated and a significant variation in results was found when flow conditions varied. This variation was more pronounced with the smaller sediment sizes as compared to the larger ones. For the critical discharge, a difference between M and M 1, M 1 and M 2 and M and M 2 conditions ranged from 36 - 118 %, 16 - 129 % and 61 - 211 %, respectively.

Near <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> of practical relevance encompass the undular hydraulic jump when the flow changes from supercritical (F > 1) to subcritical (F 1). So far these flows were mainly studied based on ideal fluid flow computations, for which the flow is assumed irrotational and, thus, shear forces are absent. While the approach is accurate for <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> conditions (F = 1) in weir and flumes, near-critical flows involve long distances reaches, {{and the effect of}} friction on the flow properties cannot be neglected. In the present study the characteristics of near-critical free-surface flows are reanalysed based on a model accounting for both the streamline curvature and friction effects.

Theoretical development of a modified gradually varied flow formula for alluvial channel is investigated through proposing a set of modification factors to correct the normal flow depth, the <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> <b>depth</b> and the water slope. These factors are related exponentially to a sediment characteristics parameter. Furthermore, a new formula, sediment transporting energy head, is derived {{as a function of}} the sediment properties and incorporated in the development of a modified flow equation.

The modified equation, theoretically and conceptually, is tested and verified using SAFL large-scale laboratory experiments.

The method is aimed at routing sediment in morphologically diverse bedrock-controlled channels in which sediment transport and storage is not a continuous process {{in space and time}} and mostly occurs in response to discrete discharges. The relative value of the ultimate stable scour depth (Huss) for each steady discharge with respect to the current scour depth after adding sediment supply determines the potential to scour or store sediment.

40|$|Abstract In {{high-velocity}} free-surface flows, {{air entrainment}} is common through the interface, and intense interactions take place between turbulent structures and entrained bubbles. Two-phase flow properties were mea-sured herein in high-velocity open channel flows above a stepped chute. Detailed turbulence measurements {{were conducted in}} a large-size facility, and a comparative analysis was applied to test {{the validity of the}} Froude and Reynolds similarities. The results showed consistently that the Froude similitude was not satisfied using a 2 : 1 geo-metric scaling ratio. Lesser number of entrained bubbles and comparatively greater bubble sizes were observed at the smaller Reynolds numbers, as well as lower turbulence levels and larger turbulent length and time scales. The results implied that small-size models did underestimate the rate of energy dissipation and the aeration efficiency of prototype stepped spillways for similar flow conditions. Similarly a Reynolds similitude was tested. The results showed also some significant scale effects. However a number of self-similar relationships remained invariant under changes of scale and confirmed the analysis of Chanson and Carosi (Exp Fluids 42 : 385 - 401, 2007). The finding is significant because self-similarity may provide a picture general enough to be used to characterise the air– water flow field in large prototype channels.

Long term {{soil erosion}} studies imply {{substantial}} efforts, particularly {{when there is}} the need to maintain continuous measurements. There are high costs associated to maintenance of field equipment keeping and quality control of data collection. Energy supply and/or electronic failures, vandalism and burglary are common causes of gaps in datasets, reducing their reach in many cases. In this work, a system of three video-cameras, a recorder and a transmission modem (3 G technology) has been set up in a gauging station where rainfall, runoff flow and sediment concentration are monitored. The gauging station is located in the outlet of an olive orchard catchment of 6. 4 ha. Rainfall is measured with one automatic raingauge that records intensity at one minute intervals. The discharge is measured by a flume of <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> <b>depth,</b> where the water is recorded by an ultrasonic sensor. When the water level rises to a predetermined level, the automatic sampler turns on and fills a bottle at different intervals according to a program depending on the antecedent precipitation. A data logger controls the instruments’ functions and records the data. The purpose of the video-camera system is {{to improve the quality of}} the dataset by i) the visual analysis of the measurement conditions of flow into the flume; ii) the optimisation of the sampling programs. The cameras are positioned to record the flow at the approximation and the gorge of the flume. In order to contrast the values of ultrasonic sensor, there is a third camera recording the flow level close to a measure tape. This system is activated when the ultrasonic sensor detects a height threshold, equivalent to an electric intensity level. Thus, only when there is enough flow, video-cameras record the event. This simplifies post-processing and reduces the cost of download of recordings. The preliminary contrast analysis will be presented as well as the main improvements in the sample program. N...|$|E
40|$|Stepped chutes are {{commonly}} used for overtopping protection for embankment dams. Aerated flow is commonly associated with stepped chutes if the chute has sufficient length. The aeration and turbulence of the flow can create {{a significant amount of}} splash over the training wall if not appropriately accounted for {{in the design of the}} structure. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) -Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Technical Release 60 Earth Dams and Reservoirs, a structural spillway should be designed to pass the freeboard hydrograph such that it does not cause serious damage to the embankment or the structure itself. For stepped spillways, researchers have suggested the training wall height equal a design factor, ranging from 1. 4 to 1. 5, multiplied by the bulked flow depth, y 90. Yet, literature suggest that the design factor is a recommendation with little to no research provided to actually quantify what the design factor should be. Researchers at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Hydraulic Engineering Research Unit (HERU) in Stillwater, OK conducted a series of tests in a near prototype scale stepped chute facility to determine the design factor for training walls necessary to minimize the erosive splash that could result from the aerated flow. Tests were conducted in a stepped chute with a slope of 18. 4 degree for a wide range of skimming flow conditions. Data indicates for a step height, h, to <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> <b>depth,</b> dc, ratio of less than 0. 4, the design factor for the training wall is 1. 4, thus the training wall height is equal to 1. 4 y 90.

5000|$|In general, a {{hydraulic}} jump is formed {{at a location}} where the upstream and downstream <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> satisfy the conjugate depth equation. However, there can be conditions in a channel, such as downstream controls, that can alter where the conjugate depths form. Tailwater depth can play a very influential role on where the jump will occur in the channel, and changes in this depth can shift the jump either upstream or downstream. Figure 6 contains three scenarios of tailwater elevations (yd): yd [...] {{is equal to the}} conjugate depth (y2) of the upstream <b>flow</b> <b>depth</b> (y1), yd [...] is less than the conjugate depth (y2) of the upstream <b>flow</b> <b>depth</b> (y1), and yd [...] is greater than the conjugate depth (y2) of the upstream <b>flow</b> <b>depth</b> (y1). The upstream depth (y1) in all three cases is controlled by a sluice gate and remains constant. Its corresponding conjugate depth (y2) is shown by the dashed line in each of the scenarios.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} a procedure {{for the evaluation}} of the optimal number, position, configuration, and sizes of detention tanks in urban drainage networks, to decrease the maximum <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> and velocities for an assigned return period and to comply with the local design requirements. Each candidate solution of the optimization problem is evaluated by means of a semidistributed hydrological model in which the kinematic wave is used as flood routing model, whereas the variational approach is used to evaluate the <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics corresponding to a given return period. The procedure, which makes use of a genetic algorithm to search for the optimal solution among the candidates, is applied to a case study drainage network, considering superpipe-based detention tanks as detention systems. The results indicate that these tanks are effective in the rehabilitation of the drainage network and that the cost of this intervention is substantially lower than that corresponding to the upgrading of existing pipes...|$|R
30|$|The maximum <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> and {{inundated}} area {{based on}} simulations of the PIN and YAN tsunami sources are obtained, and the inundation maps are plotted. The inundation maps produced by simulation {{of these two}} tsunami sources are compared. According to the generated inundation maps, the tsunami source YAN is found more critical than the tsunami source PIN, since it causes greater <b>flow</b> <b>depth</b> and longer inundation distance.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{two-phase}} <b>critical</b> nozzle <b>flow</b> of simple fluids almost obeys {{the principle of}} corresponding states. Quantum fluid departures from the principle are resolved {{as a function of}} temperature for para-hydrogen and helium. The <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> rates are normalized, using a normalizing parameter for which the <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> rates of all simple fluids reduce to a single isothermal curve. The expression obtained for the normalizing parameter is shown to provide good agreement with the experiment for the <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> rates of nitrogen, oxygen, and para-hydrogen...|$|R
