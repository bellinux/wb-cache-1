60|$|The remonstrance of Damian, besides, if {{it could}} be termed such, was spoken in terms too {{contradictory}} to be intelligible. In one moment he professed his regret for the laurels which he had hoped to gather in Palestine, and implored his uncle not to alter his purpose, but permit him to attend his banner thither; and in the next sentence, he professed his readiness to defend the safety of Lady Eveline with the last drop of his blood. De Lacy saw nothing inconsistent in these feelings, though they were for the moment contradictory to each other. It was natural, he thought, that a young knight should be desirous to win honour--natural also that he should willingly assume a charge so honourable and important as that with which he proposed to invest him; and therefore he thought that it was no wonder that, assuming his new office willingly, the young man should yet feel regret at losing the prospect of honourable adventure, which he must abandon. He therefore only smiled in reply to the broken expostulations of his nephew; and, having confirmed his former arrangement, left the young man to reflect at leisure on his <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination,</b> while he himself, in a second visit to the Benedictine Abbey, communicated the purpose which he had adopted, to the Abbess, and to his bride-elect.|$|E

With improved transportation conditions, short run effects (e. g., route switches, mode switches, <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination,</b> and new trip generation) and long term effects (e. g., change in household auto ownership, and spatial reallocation of activities) will be observed.

40|$|The embezzling of European {{communities}} {{funds is}} an important problem included in all criminal legislations from the European countries. This approach has been developed both trough the embezzling of the obtained funds, and also through the embezzling of a specific legal interest. As to the financial communitarian interests in the expenses domain changing the destination of the obtained funds means to use these previously legally obtained funds for other purposes than those originally meant. In Greece and Ireland this fraud of illegal redirection of funds {{is one of the}} potential expressions of fraudulent behavior that is provided in specific laws or specific provisions in the criminal code through frauds related to aids and incentives. In these countries changing the destination for funds that cannot be regarded as aids or incentives is not subjected to the provisions of the criminal law unless it has the elements of the breach of trust. In criminal codes from Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and Sweden this fraudulent behavior related to the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> for funds is provided in specific stipulations different from those related to the fraud committed either by presenting false, inaccurate or incomplete documents or statements, or by avoiding to present information. The French criminal law stipulates this <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> for funds as a crime related to the breach of trust. Unlike the other member states, none of the Great Britain jurisdictions stipulates a specific crime related to this fraud of changing the destination for funds. As for the communitarian financial interests related to incomes, frauds in the field of changing the destination for a legally obtained interest has to be followed by the unlawful assignment of some funds or the unlawful retaining of these funds. At the same time the resources of the European communities budgets are diminished. In Denmark, Greece, Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg changing the destination for a legally obtained interest is one of the potential types of fraudulent behavior provided in the criminal law in respect of the communitarian incomes. In Germany, Italy, France, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland tax fraud, regardless of the unique regulation in one or more specific laws, related to the customs regulations and the VAT, is defined {{in such a way as}} the fraudulent behavior is defined by any avoidance to indicate any change in the circumstances that can lead either to the illegally obtained funds, or to the unlawful retaining of these funds. This will result in the illegal decrease of the communitarian resources. In Romania the criminal provisions related to the embezzling of funds or interests are included in the art. 18, par. 1, 2, 3, Law no. 78 / 2000. This fraud is directed at the social relations correlated with the financial discipline within the EU. Compliance with this discipline means to use the funds and the legally obtained interests in compliance with the legal provisions in force. This crime consists of affecting the money or the legally obtained interests by changing the destination for these funds. The crime of embezzling funds consists of changing the destination of the money, hence using it for other purposes than intended. Unlike the embezzlement of legally obtained interests, the crime of embezzling funds does not necessarily imply that the money is legally obtained...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in activity-based analysis has witnessed {{the development of}} some dynamic models of activity-travel rescheduling decisions. Most of this work involved descriptive analyses. Timmermans et al. (2001) elaborated this work and developed a more comprehensive theory and model of activity rescheduling and re-programming decisions {{as a function of}} time pressure. They assumed that rescheduling decisions are based on the marginal utility of time, subject to constraints. However, they also assumed bounded rationality due to the incomplete information that brings about uncertainty and imperfect behavior. They showed that various types of behavior could be embedded within an overall theory of rescheduling decisions. Originally, their theory and simulation model was only concerned with duration adjustment processes, and did not incorporate other potential dynamics such as <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination,</b> transport mode, and other facets of activity-travel patterns. Later, multiple choice facets were included, leading to their Aurora model (Joh, Arentze and Timmermans, 2002, 2003). Work to date on this model has focused on problems such as solving the problem of model estimation (Joh, et al., 2003), and estimating the duration parameters on cross-sectional empirical data (Joh, et al., 2004). However, if the model is going to be used for predicting short-term adjustment and traffic flows, an implementation of the model is required and additional operational decisions are required. This paper addresses this problem. It reports on the development of an agent-based micro-simulator that allows one to simulate activity-travel rescheduling decision in high resolution space and time. The implementation is illustrated using activity-travel diary data that for the Eindhoven region was collected originally to better understand the choice of urban parks in the study area...|$|E
40|$|In dieser Studie wurden 255 Round-the-World-Reisende (STA Travel) in einer re-präsentativen online-Erhebung zu ihren Reisemotiven, Länderimages sowie zu deren Einstellung gegenüber kulturellen Unterschieden verschiedener Länder befragt. Eine Vergleichsstichprobe selbst organisierter Weltreisender bestätigte alle Erkenntnisse. Die vorzüglich gebildeten, jungen Weltreisenden bewegen sich durchschnittlich sechs Monate entlang touristischer Routen. Zumeist kommen sie mit wenig Geld aus und knüpfen lose Kontakte, die ihr Bedürfnis, sich frei, offen, unabhängig und selb-ständig zu fühlen, unterstützen und bestätigen. Eine Weltreise wird von den Pro-banden selten als Flucht vor dem Alltag, sondern vielmehr als positive, nutz-bringende Auszeit gewertet. Das gängigste Motiv für eine Weltreise ist die Suche nach dem Fremden in sich und um einem selbst. Der auf Reisen gelernte, kon-struktive Umgang mit dem Fremden kann - Zivilcourage und die entsprechende Flexibilität und Weitsicht vorausgesetzt - die Heimatgesellschaft bereichern. Wie die Reisenden die fremde Welt betrachten, ist so individuell wie die Personen an sich und gestaltet die Erlebnisse auf der Reise entscheidend mit. Veränderte Länder-images führen nur selten zu einer Veränderung der Denkweisen der Reisenden hin zu ethnorelativeren Sichtweisen, eher sind dafür persönliche Begegnungen oder prägende lebensrelevante Erlebnisse des Alltags bedeutsam. Reisende differenzier-en und bewerten durch den Aufenthalt in den jeweiligen Ländern ihr Bild der Länder positiver. Präferenzen für bestimmte Ländertypen verändern sich jedoch während einer Weltreise kaum, über einen ständigen Wechsel unterschiedlicher Destinationen und eine lange Reisedauer gleicht sich die Wertschätzung verschiedenen Kulturen gegenüber gleichmäßig an. Insgesamt können Tourismusforschung und Reiseveranstalter von den vorliegenden Ergebnissen profitieren, die es zukünftigen Reisenden - und Bereisten - ermöglichen, ihre Reisen und die Rückkehr ins Heimatland sicherer, unbeschwerlicher und letztlich erfolgreicher zu gestalten. The study under {{consideration}} {{is based on}} a representative online survey that reveals individual travel motives and country images as well as different attitudes towards cultural differences of 255 selected round-the-world travellers (STA Travel). These young world travellers - most of whom are moving six months along tourist routes - are well educated, they spend little money while travelling and, most importantly, one has observed that they become only loosely acquainted with people. This {{can be traced back to}} their strong need for freedom, openness and independ-ence during their trip. To go on a world tour is often regarded as a beneficial break rather than an escape from daily routine by most individuals. Interestingly, the most common underlying motive displayed by world travellers is the quest for the foreign itself and the unknown surrounding oneself. Moreover, most world travellers are profoundly influenced by a prevailing attitude towards ethnorelativism. Given an appropriate amount of personal flexibility and foresight, the subjective impression of foreign cultures and the constructive dealing with the foreign can ultimately benefit the home society. One can argue that a world traveller’s experience of the alien is individually different and depends on a number of sociocultural factors all of which have a huge impact on the individual’s experiences made during his world trip. Different sociocultural images do rarely trigger off a world traveller’s change in attitudes towards a more ethno-relative attitude, since personal encounters or formative life experiences in everyday life still are of huge importance. Moreover, prevailing preferences for certain types of countries rarely change during a trip around the world. However, a traveller’s longer stay in a foreign country definitely improves his image of this particular country and its local people. It is noted, however, that both the duration of a world trip and the constant <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> heavily influence these images. As a result, the individual traveller’s appreciation towards different cultures is most likely to converge. In conclusion, both tourism research in general and travel business in particular will profit from the present findings, which shall enable future travellers - and locals - to make their world travelling safer, carefree, and a long-term success...|$|E

The research methods and applied theories are also identified and analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Three large databases, namely, ScienceDirect, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar, were selected to search for published articles (i. e. 107 empirical articles and 15 review/policy articles) related to China’s outbound tourism. Thereafter, the retrieved articles were categorized and analyzed. Finally, a theoretical framework was provided for future studies on China’s outbound tourism. Findings: The major findings indicated that the main topics related to China’s outbound tourism included market segmentation, travel motivation and travel behavior. One or two theories are generally applied to investigate a certain topic. The most common research methods are interviews and a questionnaire survey. Research limitations/implications: Future studies are suggested to apply more theories to investigate one topic. A single theory can also be applied to investigate different topics. Adopting different and innovative research methods, such as online interaction observation, can also be considered.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} the Proactive-optimal-path Selection with Coordinator Agents Assisted Routing (PSCAR) {{protocol}} for Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) {{in an urban}} environment. The main idea of PSCAR is to contribute static nodes as coordinator agents placed at each intersection, {{in order to improve}} the routing performance and to deal with radio obstacles (buildings, trees [...] .) and voids as encountered in urban environments. Since the coordinator agents are static nodes, each one knows all the paths to any other coordinator agent in the network. Thus, instead of searching an optimal path toward the destination node, PSCAR will determine an optimal path to the nearest coordinator agent to the destination node so as to better anticipate any <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the <b>destinations</b> position. The optimal path is selected according to two criteria: the total physical distance and the vehicle density on the path. The vehicle density is estimated based on a fundamental diagram of the traffic that allows estimating the vehicular traffic density on each road segment. To evaluate the performance of PSCAR we used the Network Simulator 2 (ns- 2) and the mobility simulator SUMO. We compare our scheme with some existing solutions with the aim of showing its effectiveness, in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and network overhead...|$|R

Each room contains decorations and furniture, as well as icons that represent applications. Bob offers the user the option of fully customizing the entire house. The user has full control over decorating each room, and can add, remove, or reposition all objects. The user can also add or remove rooms from the house and <b>change</b> the <b>destinations</b> <b>of</b> each door. There is also a feature in which Bob offers multiple themes for room designs and decorations, such as contemporary and postmodern.|$|R

Destination {{has become a}} product {{that has to be}} promoted and sold in the most advantageous terms. The work bellow is an analysis of "brand equity" concept for touristic destinations, as found in the specific literature. Destination brands differ from product brands, major distinction being given by their stability/ instability. Brands of products are stable; this constant is maintained by the use of quality standards. Even in case of services, situation can be controlled, as quality standards could be perpetuated by a franchise system. Destinations are not depending on a single person, who decides, but a variety of them, economic agents, businesses, institutions and local population that can create/print form and structure <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>destination.</b> The concept de brand equity applied for touristic destinations, is something relatively recent. The dimensions of a brand for touristic destinations are: awareness, image, loyalty, quality and value. All these dimensions build the branding equity <b>of</b> a <b>destination.</b> There is interdependency, between quality, image, loyalty and value. In order to determine the perception in regards to the quality of tourism services in Romania, in 2010 a comprehensive study was done among the inhabitants of Oradea city. Through this study we have pursued several objectives: to assess the importance of service characteristics, performance evaluation of tourism services in Romania, tourism personnel evaluation, in terms of evaluation and performance, perception of the quality-price ratio for Romania, compared with other tourist destinations. We call on the exploratory study conducted, as the value <b>of</b> the dimension- <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> the brand equity is given by the price-quality ratio. Using an explorative study on the market of Oradea city, it was highlighted the connection between perception of touristic services, estimation price-quality (value) and the loyalty potential of the foreign clients in proportion with the Romanian tourists, consumers of the Romanian touristic products. brand equity, destination, tourism, survey, Oradea...|$|R
40|$|Protection of {{existing}} constructions against natural hazards {{and in particular}} earthquakes is a relevant problem nowadays, since enlargement of seismic zones occurred in many European countries. As a consequence, {{a large number of}} constructions built without specific seismic provisions is characterized by relevant levels of structural risk. Quantitative evaluations of such risk is certainly of interest also for industrial buildings, that in many very urbanized areas are frequently subjected to extended and expensive interventions and <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> functional <b>destinations.</b> In this framework, a research study on industrial existing precast structures built in Italy between the 1950 s and the 1970 s appeared to be significant. Therefore, a large effort has been devoted to identify structural types, details and materials commonly adopted during the reference period. Then, {{attention has been paid to}} seismic vulnerability issues derived from nonlinear and dynamic analyses. Specific reference is made to elastic analyses under design forces with an evaluation of the relevance of the second order effects, to nonlinear static analyses by N 2 method, also taking into account the vertical seismic component effects and to nonlinear dynamic analyses forcing the structure by all the three components of the earthquake. The presented research study shows that existing industrial precast buildings can be affected by severe damages under medium intensity seismic forces because of beam–column connection failure...|$|R
