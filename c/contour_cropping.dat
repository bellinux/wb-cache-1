40|$|Implementing {{agricultural}} best {{management practices}} (BMPs) is influenced by a balance of desired environmental outcomes, economic feasibility, and stakeholder familiarity, the latter taken {{to be related to}} BMP acceptability. To explore this balance, we developed a multi-objective decision support system for allocating BMP type and placement by coupling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool with a nondominated sorted genetic algorithm that minimizes total phosphorus (TP) yields from agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs) and costs, while using stakeholder BMP familiarity as a constraint; conventional tillage, no tillage, nutrient management, riparian buffers, and <b>contour</b> <b>cropping</b> were explored. Using constraints representing current conditions, the optimization resulted in 59. 6 to 81. 0 % reduction in agricultural TP yield from HRUs at costs ranging between US $ 0. 8 and US $ 5. 3 million. The constrained optimization tended to select mostly single BMPs or at most two BMPs for a given HRU due to these BMPs having higher acceptability to stakeholders. In contrast, the unconstrained case, representing full familiarity, selected 2 - and 3 -BMP applications. There was little difference in costs between the constrained and unconstrained cases below an 80 % TP yield reduction; however, significant differences were found at larger reductions, supporting the value of stakeholder education and extension efforts...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the present}} study, we provide a land use {{planning}} recommendation for land conservation and agro-economical production for the Sumani watershed in West Sumatra, Indonesia, where intensive agriculture has long been practiced. We based our land conservation management recommendations on soil erosion rates using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) determined in our previous paper (Aflizar et al. 2010). Our {{land use planning}} vision is to maintain current land use practices as much as possible. In sites where the soil erosion rate remains less than the tolerable erosion rate (TER) (14 Mg ha- 1 y- 1; a rate set by the Indonesian government) land use was not altered. When soil erosion rates exceeded the TER, we selected a new land use with a smaller CP-factor than the former land practice to reduce soil erosion rates. The recommended land use planning resulted in a 16. 1 % change distributed as follows: vegetable gardens with terracing (10 %), vegetable gardens with <b>contour</b> <b>cropping</b> (1. 8 %) and sawah (4. 3 %). The changes made in the recommended land use plans could reduce soil erosion rates by 88 %, a reduction from 58. 9 to 7. 1 Mg ha- 1 y- 1, with a total profit loss in agricultural production of only 3. 9 % in the Sumani watershed.

30|$|However, PES ignores complex {{heterogeneity}} of ecosystems which undermines smooth market transactions (Kosoy and Corbera 2009). Conversely, Arild (2010) differentiated between generalizing PES and theory on market for ES as {{linked to the}} ES niche market leading to widely acceptable theoretical PES definition by Wunder (2005). Wunder’s definition is related to Brendan et al. (2010) who characterized PES as mechanism linking conservation outcomes to market-based incentive approaches. The environmental services are majorly regarded as public goods, with less information on their value or pricing in a normal market place. Non-excludability of these services limits direct marketing whose scarcity would provide warning sign of degradation and insufficiency unless there’s total breakdown of ecosystems providing the service. The PES practices implemented by farmers in study sites were rehabilitation and maintenance of riparian zones through tree planting, grass strips, terracing along steep slopes, <b>contour</b> <b>cropping,</b> agro-forestry, clean improved seed varieties, crop rotation, fallowing, and reduction in agro-chemicals use. This study focused on these practices which are envisaged to rehabilitate degraded land targeted as hot spot farms. The WTA in this study characterizes the amount land managers were willing to accept to forego or limit unsustainable practices as trade-off with PES conservation interventions. Willingness to accept pay to adopt PES practices will enhance sustainable provisioning services such as adequate quality water demanded by buyers as ecosystem services downstream as well as food security and improved supporting services for instance soil nutrient cycling and regulating services including flood and soil erosion control, climate regulation, water purification, and pollination.|$|E
30|$|The {{results in}} Table  2 on {{willingness}} to continue implementing PES practices imply significant importance farmers attached to PES farm practices. Similar studies (FAO 2011) have shown high willingness to restore ecological functions {{could be an}} indicator that PES can work in agriculture sector where ecosystem services are under threat and the opportunity costs for alternatives are not very high. However, Purvis et al. (1989) and Bond and Mayers (2010) demonstrated that farmers’ willingness to continue implementing PES interventions is influenced by annual incentives as beneficial additionality on ecological conditions and farmer opportunity cost. Conversely, Robertson et al. (2015) observed that farmers’ willingness to adopt new farm interventions that enhance sustainable ecosystem service provision depends on awareness creation, farmers’ attitudes, and incentive availability. High number of farmers willing to implement different PES interventions implies PES practices acceptance and possible understanding that the alternative PES interventions could have positive influence on environment and household livelihoods. Riparian land is important to farmers due to provision of water sources especially during dry season to support related ecosystem service for instance crop farming for food security. Farmers’ willingness to accept pay to implement grass strips is related to its dual purpose of {{soil and water conservation}} as well as provision of fodder for livestock. Low number of farmers (15  %) willing to accept pay to implement terracing is linked to different reasons ranging from high physical labour demand for mapping, marking, and digging terraces along with the high cost associated with the intervention. <b>Contour</b> <b>cropping</b> was a favoured practice by 32  %, and this is connected to less labour and skills required to implement the practice.|$|E

Hydrology analysis includes soil type, land use and utility for the erosion rate analysis through Hydrologic Response Unit (HRU). The biggest HRU value of sub-basin is on area 5 and the lowest one is on area 10. All four HRU in sub-basin area 5 are potentially donating high value for HRU. In short, this area has the longest slope length so that it has a large LS factor. About 50 % of the land was covered by bushes which gain higher C factor rather than forest. Moreover, it has <b>contour</b> <b>crop</b> conservation technique with 9 - 20 % declivity resulting in having dominant factor of P.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to describe and quantify biologically labile and refractory nitrogen and phosphorus constituents, transformations, and loads in the runoff of two sub-watersheds exhibiting differing agricultural land-use practices. Runoff was impacted by intensive row-cropping for corn production in one of the watersheds while the other one was impacted by dairy livestock management. BACKGROUND: Increasing agricultural development in watersheds has resulted in substantial water, sediment, and nutrient loadings, leading to reduced water quality in receiving waters over the past several decades. Accelerated soil and nutrient import from watersheds is exacerbated by agricultural land-use practices that promote intensive row cropping and rapid drainage of soils for crop production. High runoff of nutrient-rich constituents can also occur via dairy and livestock production, coupled with containment of large numbers of animals in barnyard and pasture settings, resulting in reduction of perennial cover, disturbance of soils, and localized soil nutrient enrichment via animal waste. There is a need to manage watersheds for reduction of soil and nutrient losses by implementing best management practices (BMP’s) (e. g., conservation tillage, perennial vegetation cover and buffering, terracing, <b>contour</b> strip <b>cropping,</b> animal wast...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cassava is a crop that induces {{high rates}} of soil erosion, {{especially}} if grown in sloping sandy soils. The joint research of the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT), the Department of Agriculture (DOA), and Kasetsart University (KU) revealed that adjustments in planting methods or planting systems could reduce soil erosion. Each method has certain advantages and disadvantages. While some methods give extra income, others need more management or higher investments; thus it is not certain whether farmers would adopt any of these methods. Therefore, CIAT {{in collaboration with the}} Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE) and DOA initiated a project, entitled “Enhancing the Adoption of Soil Erosion Control Practices in Cassava Fields ” in order to work with cassava farmers, using a Farmer Participatory Research (FPR) approach.

40|$|The key {{drivers of}} relief {{transformation}} in the Polish Carpathians (the best studied region of the Carpathians) have been local downpours, continuous rainfalls, and rapid snowmelt. Threshold values are quickly exceeded during such events and powerful morphological processes are initiated. However, due to human activities, geomorphic processes are often accelerated and intensified with serious consequences. Thus, increased human impact is {{a key factor in}} the recent geomorphic evolution of the Polish Carpathians. Over the last two centuries deforestation, intensive agriculture, mining, housing developments on slopes, channelization of streams, and construction of reservoirs all have contributed to changes in the rate of the particular geomorphic processes. The intensity of sheet erosion depends on vegetation cover, land use, and cultivation techniques (terracing, <b>contour</b> tillage, <b>crop</b> rotation, etc.). Slopes bearing poorly constructed infrastructure have become susceptible to mass movements. At higher elevations debris flows, dirty avalanches, and extreme floods are crucial in slope evolution. Over the last 20 years the ratio of agricultural land and the rate of sheet erosion and deflation have decreased, while gully erosion on slopes and the incision of river channels have intensified and the reactivation of shallow landslides has become more common. Increasingly frequent extreme weather events may reverse the stabilizing trend of landform evolution...|$|R

Results indicate a significant reduction in storm event total P (TP) concentrations (P = 0. 01) within the agricultural watershed after installation of the AGSS, but not total dissolved P (P = 0. 23). This indicates that the reduction in P concentration is that of the particulate form. Storm event organic N concentrations were also significantly reduced (P = 0. 03) after the AGSS was installed.

40|$|Many Iowa {{farmers are}} now farming around the hills instead of {{up and down}} them. The results of many {{investigations}} have justified for some time this practice as a soil- and water-conserving measure, but until comparatively recently there was little contour farming practiced in the state. Since contour farming has been adopted on many Iowa farms {{in the last few}} years, its value under real Iowa conditions can be appraised on the basis of actual experience. “The proof of the pudding is in the eating,’’ according to the old English proverb, and so it is with contour farming. Farmers have found it to be a wise and feasible practice as shown by the fact that only a very few of those who have given it a fair trial have abandoned it. The reasons why contour farming helps to conserve soil and water are obvious. Every row running around the hill acts as a little barrier which checks the velocity of the surface runoff, causing it to unload its silt and to flow more slowly from the land so that more of the water will have time to soak into the soil. Strips of close-growing, soil-binding crops, planted alternately between strips of <b>contour</b> row <b>crops,</b> likewise lessen the amount of the slope exposed by the clean tillage. The close-growing crop will check the velocity of any runoff from the cultivated strip above and cause it to drop its load of silt.

At the same time, excessive loading of pesticides in water bodies can produce toxic conditions that harm sensitive aquatic species, and render the water unfit for human consumption. Therefore, measures need to be designed, evaluated and undertaken in order to reduce pesticide pollution. In this study we focus on the Nil catchment, a small basin situated in the centre of Belgium. The necessary database and a watershed model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool-SWAT) were available to simulate different agricultural management scenarios. In order to make the model accurately predict pesticide loading to the river and instream transport, it was necessary to make several modifications to the source code. Special attention was given to implement an estimator for point losses (e. g. cleaning of spray equipment) and droplet drift, and improve the representation of physical processes in Filter strips.

40|$|Three soil {{conservation}} systems: <b>contour</b> drainage, strip <b>cropping,</b> and terracing, were designed and established within separate plots on hillside farmlands in St. Lucia. A control plot with no form of {{soil conservation}} was also established. Topographic and soils surveys of these plots were conducted. Rainfall, runoff and soil loss were measured over one wet season. Crop yields and construction and maintenance costs were also determined. For rainfall amounts between 14. 2 and 211. 2 mm, runoff depths varied from 0. 6 to 203. 6 mm {{in the control}} plot, 2. 1 to 199. 2 mm in the contour drained plot, 3. 2 to 155. 1 mm in the strip cropped plot and 1. 3 to 94. 7 mm in the terraced plot. The largest amounts of runoff were most often recorded in the strip cropped plot, while on most occasions, the terraced plot produced the least runoff. Soil loss rates varied from 0. 01 to 1. 77 kg/ha in the control plot, 0. 07 to 16. 88 kg/ha in the contour drained plot, 0. 2 to 28. 86 kg/ha in the strip cropped plot and 0. 01 to 6. 62 kg/ha in the terraced plot. Construction costs per hectare were EC$ 5565 for the contour drainage system, EC $ 5425 for the strip cropped system and EC$ 6350 for the terraced system. Further monitoring of the conservation systems is required for prediction of their long-term effectiveness in runoff and soil erosion control...|$|R

To effectively implement precision agriculture, data must be gathered from the field in an automated manner at minimal cost. In this study, a small autonomous field inspection vehicle was developed to minimise {{the impact of the}} scouting on the crop and soil compaction. The proposed approach integrates a camera with a GPS receiver to obtain a set of basic behaviours required of an autonomous mobile robot to inspect a crop field with full coverage. A path planner considered the field <b>contour</b> and the <b>crop</b> type to determine the best inspection route. An image-processing method capable of extracting the central crop row under uncontrolled lighting conditions in real time from images acquired with a reflex camera positioned {{on the front of the}} robot was developed. Two fuzzy controllers were also designed and developed to achieve vision-guided navigation. A method for detecting the end of a crop row using camera-acquired images was developed. In addition, manoeuvres necessary for the robot to change rows were established. These manoeuvres enabled the robot to autonomously cover the entire crop by following a previously established plan and without stepping on the crop row, which is an essential behaviour for covering crops such as maize without damaging them.

40|$|Sampling field soils to {{estimate}} soil water content and soil water storage (S) is difficult {{due to the}} spatial variability of these variables, which demands {{a large number of}} sampling points. Also, the methodology employed in most cases is invasive and destructive, so that sampling in the same positions at different times is impossible. However, neutron moderation, time domain reflectrometry, and, more recently, frequency domain reflectrometry methodologies allow measurements at the same points over long time intervals. This study evaluates a set of neutron probe data, collected at 15 positions placed randomly along a coffee <b>crop</b> <b>contour</b> line, over 2 years at 14 -day intervals. The temporal stability of S was again demonstrated, so that wetter or dryer locations remain so over time, and the definition of such positions in the field reduces the number of sampling points in future S evaluations under similar conditions. An analysis was made to determine the minimum number of sampling points to obtain the average S of the field within a chosen level of significance. Classical statistical analysis indicated that the 15 measurement positions could be reduced to four or even to one position to obtain a reliable field S average. State-time analysis showed S estimations depend more on previous measurements of rainfall P (52 %) than on evapotranspiration ET (28 %) and S (20 %). The analysis also showed that ET was not realistically estimated from previous measurements of S; it was more dependent on previous measurements of ET (59 %) than on P (30 %) and S (9 %). This statistical procedure showed great advantages over classical multiple regressions. Future studies of this type should be carried out at regularly spaced observation points in a grid, in order to allow a 2 -D and 3 -D state-space-time analysis...|$|R
