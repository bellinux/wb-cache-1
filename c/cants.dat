5|$|For his {{achievements}} on 28February, the RAF's most successful {{day of the}} campaign, Cullen was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). Italian sources recorded that a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 was only damaged on 28February, not shot down, and that the Breda 20s claimed by the RAF were in fact Fiat BR.20s. Cullen claimed another multiple kill on 3March, when he {{and one of his}} comrades chased a group of CANT Z.1007bis that had just bombed Larissa, Greece. Catching the retreating bombers south-west of Corfu, No.80 Squadron claimed six destroyed and one probable. Cullen was credited with destroying four <b>CANTs</b> and probably destroying another, though the Italians reported that only two CANT bombers were lost.|$|E
25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two ski poles in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. During training, skiers may use prosthesis, <b>cants,</b> wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis. For skiers using a prosthesis, a special skiing prosthesis is used {{and they may}} also require the user of outriggers. The nature of their disability will dictate the type of equipment required. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. <b>Cants</b> are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight. They are customised for {{the specific needs of}} the skier. The ski boot for below the knee amputees often has the prosthetic built into it, though for all competitors in this class, FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|LW1 {{classified}} skiers use outriggers, and two skis or one ski with a prosthesis. International Ski Federation {{rules for}} ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class {{and are not}} the same rules used for able-bodied skiers. Skiers in this class are allowed to use ski-tips in competition, using a setup sometimes called a Four Track. In training, they may use additional equipment. For example, skiers with cerebral palsy may use <b>cants,</b> wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis depending on the nature of their disability. Skiers with an amputation may use a prosthesis. As skiers in this classification improve, they require less use of this equipment. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. <b>Cants</b> are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight, and are customised for the specific needs of the skier. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cant</b> {{gradient}} is {{the amount}} by which <b>cant</b> is increased or decreased in a given length of track.

In training, skiers can also use <b>cants,</b> wedges and prostheses with a special skiing prosthesis having been developed for use. The prosthetic may be built into the ski boot for below knee amputees, though FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are enforced for everyone in this class.|$|E
500|$|An {{attack by}} the Italian cruisers {{appeared}} imminent, after air reconnaissance had sighted them the previous evening, heading south about [...] from {{the west end of}} Sicily, on course to reach the convoy at dawn. At 01:30 the cruisers had turned east and run along the north coast of Sicily; British aircraft from Malta had conducted a ruse to decoy the cruisers but the main attacking force on Malta was held back, in case the Italian battleships sailed from Taranto. Some of the Italian cruisers were ordered to return to port and the rest were sent through the Straits of Messina to join the 8th Cruiser Division against the MG 3 decoy convoy in the eastern Mediterranean. [...] (Lieutenant-Commander Alastair Mars) had been waiting since 10 August [...] north of the Capo Milazzo lighthouse and after being attacked, moved close to Stromboli, arriving early on 13 August. The Italian cruisers were heard first by hydrophone and then seen through the periscope at [...] 07:25, heading north between the islands of Filicudi and Panarea. The ships were making [...] with eight destroyer escorts and two CANT Z.506 aircraft overhead. Mars raised the periscope for only short periods, to avoid being seen by the destroyers and the <b>Cants,</b> while manoeuvring into an attack position.|$|E
2500|$|After Cant and {{his wife}} moved to the ranch, it became a popular {{overnight}} stop for people traveling between Dayville and the Columbia River. [...] Their hospitality was well known, {{and it was not}} uncommon for the <b>Cants</b> to serve dinner to twenty or more people including family, ranch hands, and traveling guest. [...] To accommodate their growing family, an expanding livestock business and their many guests, the <b>Cants</b> undertook a major expansion of the ranch between 1915 and 1918, replacing most of the original building constructed by the Officer family. [...] As part of this expansion, Cant built a large main house that became the centerpiece of the ranch complex.|$|E
40|$|The interannual to decadal {{variability}} in the transport of anthropogenic CO 2 (<b>Cant)</b> across the subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) is investigated, using summer data of the FOUREX and OVIDE high-resolution transoceanic sections, from Greenland to Portugal, occupied six times from 1997 to 2010. The transport of <b>Cant</b> across this section, T <b>cant</b> hereafter, is northward, with a mean value of 254 ± 29 kmol s − 1 over the 1997 – 2010 period. We find that T <b>cant</b> undergoes interannual variability, masking any trend different from 0 for this period. In {{order to understand the}} mechanisms controlling the variability of T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA, we propose a new method that quantifies the transport of <b>Cant</b> caused by the diapycnal and isopycnal circulation. The diapycnal component yields a large northward transport of <b>Cant</b> (400 ± 29 kmol s − 1) that is partially compensated by a southward transport of <b>Cant</b> caused by the isopycnal component (− 171 ± 11 kmol s − 1), mainly localized in the Irminger Sea. Most importantly, the diapycnal component is found to be the main driver of the variability of T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA. Both the Meridional Overturning Circulation (computed in density coordinates, MOC σ) and the <b>Cant</b> increase in the water column have an important effect on the variability of the diapycnal component and of T <b>cant</b> itself. Based on this analysis, we propose a simplified estimator for the variability of T <b>cant</b> based on the intensity of the MOC σ and on the difference of <b>Cant</b> between the upper and lower limb of the MOC σ (ΔCant). This estimator shows a good consistency with the diapycnal component of T <b>cant,</b> and help to disentangle the effect of the variability of both the circulation and the <b>Cant</b> increase on the T <b>cant</b> variability. We find that ΔCant keeps increasing over the past decade, and it is very likely that the continuous <b>Cant</b> increase in the water masses will cause an increase in T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA at long timescale. Nevertheless, at the timescale analyzed here (1997 – 2010), the MOC σ controls the T <b>cant</b> variability, blurring any T <b>cant</b> trend. Extrapolating the observed ΔCant increase rate and considering the predicted slow-down of 25 % of the MOC σ, T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA is expected to increase by 430 kmol s − 1 during the 21 st century. Consequently, an increase in the storage rate of <b>Cant</b> in the SPNA could be envisaged...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{identified}} the calcium-activated nucleotidase 1 (<b>CANT</b> 1) transcript as up-regulated in prostate cancer. Now, we studied <b>CANT</b> 1 protein expression {{in a large}} cohort of nearly 1000 prostatic tissue samples including normal tissue, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), primary carcinomas, metastases, and castrate-resistant carcinomas, and further investigated its functional relevance. <b>CANT</b> 1 displayed predominantly a Golgi-type immunoreactivity with additional and variable cytoplasmic staining. In comparison to normal tissues, the staining intensity was significantly increased in PIN lesions and cancer. In cancer, high <b>CANT</b> 1 levels were associated with a better prognosis, and castrate-resistant carcinomas commonly showed lower <b>CANT</b> 1 levels than primary carcinomas. The functional role of <b>CANT</b> 1 was investigated using RNA interference in two prostate cancer cell lines with abundant endogenous <b>CANT</b> 1 protein. On <b>CANT</b> 1 knockdown, a significantly diminished cell number and DNA synthesis rate, a cell cycle arrest in G 1 phase, and a strong decrease of cell transmigration rate and wound healing capacity of <b>CANT</b> 1 knockdown cells was found. However, on forced <b>CANT</b> 1 overexpression, cell proliferation and migration remained unchanged. In summary, <b>CANT</b> 1 is commonly overexpressed {{in the vast majority}} of primary prostate carcinomas and in the precursor lesion PIN and may represent a novel prognostic biomarker. Moreover, this is the first study to demonstrate a functional involvement of <b>CANT</b> 1 in tumor biology...|$|R

40|$|Heliostat <b>canting</b> (alignment of mirror facets) {{is known}} to have a major {{influence}} on the optical efficiency of heliostat fields and therefore on the power output of solar tower plants. In recent years several <b>canting</b> concepts were used, mainly on- and off-axis <b>canting.</b> Several new <b>canting</b> concepts, like stretched-parabolic or target aligned <b>canting,</b> were proposed in order to improve the performance of heliostats. As solar power plants become economically more attractive, knowledge about the influence of <b>canting</b> becomes more important. In this contribution, the influence of several factors on the <b>canting</b> method is discussed and optimal <b>canting</b> strategies are described. The considered factors comprise plant power level, heliostat position in the field, heliostat area, receiver dimension and site latitude. It is concluded that the target aligned tracking method is superior to all other variants in the majority of cases. As for the standard azimuth-elevation tracking methods, no one of these exhibits a clear advantage. It is only the on-axis method that performs worst in all cases. ...|$|R
