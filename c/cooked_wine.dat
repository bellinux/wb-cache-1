50|$|Vino cotto (literally <b>cooked</b> <b>wine)</b> {{is a form}} of {{wine from}} the Marche and Abruzzo in Central Italy. It is {{typically}} made by individuals for their own use as it cannot legally be sold as wine. The must, from any of several local varieties of grapes, is heated in a copper vessel where it is reduced in volume by up to a third before fermenting in old wooden barrels. It can be aged for years, barrels being topped up with each harvest. It is a strong ruby-colored wine, somewhat similar to Madeira, usually drunk with sweet puddings.|$|E

40|$|Antioxidative {{activity}} of wines {{may be reduced}} or increased by certain technological treatment processes used in winemaking. Effects of SO 2 addition, ageing and concentration of must at high temp. on total polyphenol content, oxygen scavenging ability and chain-breaking activity were investigated in a red wine (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo), a white wine (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo) and a model wine produced using the normal procedure for a typical <b>cooked</b> <b>wine</b> (Marsala-type wine) in S. Italy. SO 2 addition increased oxygen scavenging ability in commercial and model wine samples investigated; chain-breaking {{activity of}} wines was not affected. Antioxidative activities of phenols in white and red wine samples were similar despite the lower phenol concn. determined in white wine. A decrease in antioxidative activities of wines was associated with progressive polymerization of phenols during ageing; development of nonenzymic browning reactions during must heating increased antioxidative and chain-breaking activity in wines. It is concluded that technological procedures used in winemaking can cause significant changes in antioxidative activity of wines; with certain treatments, these changes may be positive...|$|E
