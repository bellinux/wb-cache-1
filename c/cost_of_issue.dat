50|$|A related {{question}} {{concerns the}} timing of convertibility. A dollar that is instantly convertible into one ounce of silver will be worth one ounce on the market. If convertibility is delayed by 1 year, then for some interest rate R, the dollar will be worth 1/(1+R) ounces today, and will grow to 1 ounce next year. When the annual cost of issuing a dollar (cost of printing, periodic redemption, protection against counterfeiting, etc.) is C/year, a dollar that promises 1 ounce of silver in 1 year will be worth 1/(1+R-C) today and grow to 1 oz. after 1 year. (Note-issuing bankers {{in the nineteenth century}} generally claimed that these costs made it unprofitable for them to issue paper dollars, and the dollars were issued more as a form of advertising.) If C=R, so that the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> exactly equals the rate of interest, then the dollar will start the year worth 1 ounce and end the year worth 1 ounce. This makes it seem as if the dollar bears no interest, but in truth the interest on the dollar was offset by the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 made it {{much more}} {{difficult}} for a plaintiff to bring suit successfully against a company’s auditors. While the act did codify as law the reporting requirements of SAS 59, it also made it more difficult for a plaintiff’s attorneys to successfully pursue class-action litigation against auditors. Furthermore, in cases where auditors did fail to modify their audit opinions in accordance with SAS 59, the damage awards were limited to proportionate liability. When comparing the potential <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> a going-concern opinion (hastening the demise of the client; losing audit fees) to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> not <b>issuing</b> a going-concern opinion (litigation), the result of the act was essentially to tip the scales in favor <b>of</b> not <b>issuing</b> a going-concern opinion.

40|$|The {{pecking order}} predicts that equity costs exceed debt costs when {{managers}} require outside funding. Primarily, these differential issuance costs arise because investors, who have inferior information, must discount new securities that managers issue. I use a statistical model to estimate issuance <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> equity. The model uses {{years in which}} managers choose not to <b>issue</b> a type <b>of</b> security in order to estimate the issuance <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> that security. These estimates exhibit patterns that challenge the pecking order. First, after controlling for issuance costs, profits and cash holdings reduce the amount <b>of</b> debt firms <b>issue,</b> but not the amount of equity. Second, debt costs increase from about 50 % <b>of</b> equity <b>costs</b> in 1973 to 140 % <b>of</b> equity <b>costs</b> in 2002. For all years after 1997, debt issuance costs actually exceed equity issuance costs. This pattern appears in a broad set of firms, {{as well as in}} subsets of firms chosen by market capitalization or analyst following. Third, information asymmetry does not increase the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> equity relative to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> debt. This is true whether asymmetric information is measured by market capitalization or analyst following. On the other hand, information asymmetry appears to increase debt and equity costs individually. Fourth, information asymmetry reduces the issuance <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> equity relative to debt across industries. Overall, this implies that the pecking order cannot consistently explain firm capital structure decisions. Moreover, the premise upon which the pecking order is founded, information asymmetry costs between insiders and outsiders, does not push firms toward a pecking order. Considering distress costs or debt capacity cannot reconcile the pecking order to these facts...|$|R
40|$|I explore whether Tobin (1969) ’s {{assumption}} of capital-constrained equity shares can induce asset price non-neutrality – wherein causality runs both ways between {{macroeconomic and financial}} variables – in a benchmark decentralized real business cycle (RBC) model. I permit the equity shares outstanding of a capitalist firm to vary over time, subject to the constraint that shares must be backed one-for-one by capital. I first consider {{a case in which}} the firm maximizes per-share profit, and find that this model results in an equilibrium identical to that chosen by the planner. I then explore a generalized model in which the firm can adopt an objective that over- or under-estimates the dilution <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> shares, resulting in under or over-investment (respectively) – motivated by the theoretical and empirical literature on managerial preferences. The resulting equilibria naturally incorporate a non-neutral share price. I further find a calibration that under-estimates the dilution <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> shares to provide the best fit to empirical data in terms of the standard deviations of consumption and investment relative to that of output, lending tentative support to “empire building ” theories of managerial preferences. I also determine that under the selected calibrations featuring over- or under-investment, the risk premium is negative, implying that the equity share acts as a form of insurance for the household...|$|R

30|$|The results {{reported}} in the table provide evidence that the coefficient of tangibility is negative and statistically significant, indicating that firms having more tangible assets do less external financing regardless whether firms are financially constrained or unconstrained. The pecking order theory of capital structure also suggests {{that the relationship between}} tangibility and external financing is negative. As tangible assets are easier to value for outsiders than intangible asset, they lower the information asymmetries between managers and financers. Low information asymmetries decrease the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> new equity. We also find that the negative effect of tangibility on external financing is higher for financially constrained firms than financially unconstrained firms.|$|R
