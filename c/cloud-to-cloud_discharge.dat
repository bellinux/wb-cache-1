40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{consider}} space-time representation to {{the magnetic}} field produced by a right-angle branching discharge. Current pulse starts and propagates to the T-branching point. Then one discharge segment carries {{a part of the}} initial current in the original direction to the first (cloud) terminal point. The rest of the current pulse propagates in the vertical direction to the other (ground) terminal point. This scheme can serve as a rough model of complicated <b>cloud-to-cloud</b> <b>discharge</b> that partially branches to the ground. The report was stimulated by observation of corresponding natural phenomenon in July 1996 at the Ladoga Lake. The discharge structure is shown in Figure 1. The current pulse starts at the point Ol and propagates to the T-junction point OH at which it branches. One segment carries the part of the initial current to the terminal point F. The rest of the current 1 - is directed at a right angle to the terminal point O. According to the superposition principle, the total field produced by a discharge of this shape is a sum of three partial fields of radiating segments OlOH, OHF, and OHO. To find these fields we consider some segment z[0, l] carrying current density...|$|E
40|$|Tweek {{atmospherics}} {{generated by}} lightning discharges and propagated in the night-time Earth-ionosphere waveguide, have often very pronounced dispersive features near {{the first few}} waveguide cut-off frequencies (fcm~mdot{s} fc 1 , fc 1 ~ 1. 6 – 1. 9 kHz, m= 1, 2,...,), being very extended in time, and have rather large amplitudes of oscillations with periods corresponding to the narrow vicinity of the cut-off frequencies. In this paper an analytical approach is developed to describe the waveform of distant tweeks. It {{is based on the}} solving of the Maxwell equations in two qualitatively different regions, whose changes are related in the first instance to the changes in the relative magnitudes of the displacement current and components of the conduction currents, and the following asymptotic matching of the solutions in the transitional region. The analytical night-time waveguide model accounts for both anisotropy and vertical inhomogeneity of the low ionosphere. The model is valid for upper ELF – lower VLF range and is well suitable for the analysis of the QTEm modes in the cut-off frequency regions, which determine {{the most important part of}} the tweek spectra and tweek amplitudes. The influence of the different ionospheric heights on the tweek characteristics is determined. The efficiency of the tweek generation by <b>cloud-to-cloud</b> <b>discharge</b> is also evaluated...|$|E

Venus' small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation. This radiation may result in <b>cloud-to-cloud</b> lightning <b>discharges.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1967, Venera 4 {{found the}} Venusian {{magnetic}} field {{to be much}} weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo in the core like the one inside Earth. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation. This radiation may result in <b>cloud-to-cloud</b> lightning <b>discharges.</b>|$|R
