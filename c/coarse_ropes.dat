And he laughed, and said to himself, 'Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared some dull monster {{that will be a}} marvel to men, or some thing of horror that the great Queen will desire,' and putting forth all his strength, he tugged at the <b>coarse</b> <b>ropes</b> till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms. He tugged at the thin ropes, and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net rose at last {{to the top of the}} water.|$|E
5000|$|The knot remains {{somewhat}} secure under tension; the <b>coarser</b> the <b>rope</b> {{the more}} secure it is (see Disadvantages, below) ...|$|R
2500|$|Lintel 17 {{refers to}} [...] "Bird Jaguars as Blood Lord of Yaxchilan" [...] and shows him {{preparing}} to draw {{blood from his}} penis with a stingray spine. Opposite Bird Jaguar is Lady Balam-Ix, who proceeds to pass <b>coarse</b> <b>rope</b> through a gouge in her tongue. The blood is being collected in the vessel near Bird Jaguar's feet. The Vision Serpent's mouth is green and, the trickles of blood characteristic of bloodletting are red".|$|R
5000|$|Graff {{exhibited}} his ‘Mummification’ {{series at}} the New Burlington Gallery, London in 1994, {{sponsored by the}} Emerging Art Foundation. The exhibition also included {{a body of work}} titled ‘Sand Reliefs’.Works were informed by similar concerns to his 1992 photographic exhibition ‘Constrictions’ at Hamiltons Gallery, London, which included images of string bound meat and sculptural female forms bound with <b>coarse</b> <b>rope.</b> David Cohen reviewed the exhibition in ‘Contemporary Art’:"His new sculptural works explore similar borderline territory between the animate and the static, the sensual and the morbid." ...|$|R
5000|$|Like other dive bars, such as Patrick [...] "Burly" [...] Bohan's The Doctor's, The Dump {{provided}} sleeping quarters, or [...] "velvet rooms", for its customers. But while Bohan's {{place and}} others usually provided cots, Lee and Reynolds made different arrangements, {{as described by}} Herbert Asbury in The Gangs of New York (1928), by screwing [...] "short iron stanchions into the floor about seven feet from the rear wall, and into the wall affixed an iron framework. From the latter to the stanchions was a net of <b>coarse</b> <b>rope,</b> and when a bum passed out from dope or the effects of whiskey and camphor, he was simply tossed into the net to sleep it off".|$|R

50|$|The Sapera {{are divided}} into two endogamous groups, the Saharpua and the Baiga in Uttar Pradesh, {{especially}} the Bareilly district. These are further segmented into exogamous clans, and they maintain a strict system of clan exogamy. The principal occupation of the Sapera remains snake charming, and they wander from village to village, performing with deadly snakes like cobras. They are also expert snake catchers, and are often called in by other villagers to catch snakes and remove the poison from persons bitten by snakes. A small number of Sapera have also {{been involved in the}} manufacture of a <b>coarse</b> <b>rope</b> called the munj. As with other nomadic groups, the Indian state has exerted pressure for them to settle down. A few have now taken up permanent settlement and are mainly sharecroppers. They remain an extremely marginalised group, suffering from poverty.|$|R
60|$|In a second, {{without more}} ado, while the poor {{trembling}} girl writhed and groaned in her agony before their eyes, that mob of wild savages, let loose to torture and slay, fell upon her with hideous shouts, and bound her, {{as they had}} bound their comrade before, with <b>coarse</b> native <b>ropes</b> of twisted plantain fibre.|$|R
5000|$|The inner fibers {{are used}} in the making of hats, {{including}} the [...] "Manila hats," [...] hammocks, matting, cordage, <b>ropes,</b> <b>coarse</b> twines, and types of canvas. It is called Manila hemp in the market although it is unlike true hemp, and is also known as Cebu hemp and Davao hemp. Abacá cloth is found in museum collections around the world, like the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Textile Museum of Canada.|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} been to church so often {{in a long time}} as I have in the last few weeks. The people in these old lands seem to make churches their specialty. Especially does this seem to be the case with the {{citizens}} of Genoa. I think there is a church every three or four hundred yards all over town. The streets are sprinkled from end to end with shovel-hatted, long-robed, well-fed priests, and the church bells by dozens are pealing all the day long, nearly. Every now and then one comes across a friar of orders gray, with shaven head, long, <b>coarse</b> robe, <b>rope</b> girdle and beads, and with feet cased in sandals or entirely bare. These worthies suffer in the flesh and do penance all their lives, I suppose, but they look like consummate famine-breeders. They are all fat and serene.|$|R
50|$|Date palm {{leaves are}} used for Palm Sunday in the Christian religion. In North Africa, they are {{commonly}} used for making huts. Mature leaves are also made into mats, screens, baskets and fans. Processed leaves {{can be used for}} insulating board. Dried leaf petioles are a source of cellulose pulp, used for walking sticks, brooms, fishing floats and fuel. Leaf sheaths are prized for their scent, and fibre from them is also used for <b>rope,</b> <b>coarse</b> cloth, and large hats. The leaves are also used as a lulav in the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.|$|R
50|$|The doum palm flourishes in hot dry {{regions where}} little else grows {{and the tree}} is {{appreciated}} for the shade it provides. All parts of the tree are useful, but {{probably the most important}} product is the leaves. The fibre and leaflets are used by people along the Niger and Nile Rivers to weave baskets, such as in the material culture of the Manasir. Other things made from the leaves are mats, <b>coarse</b> textiles, brooms, <b>ropes,</b> string and thatch. The timber is used for posts and poles, furniture manufacture and beehives, and the tree provides wood for fuel. The leaf stalks are used for fencing and the fibre is used for textiles. Other products include fishing rafts, brooms, hammocks, carpets, buttons and beads.|$|R
