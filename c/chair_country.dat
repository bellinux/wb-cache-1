40|$|The {{threat of}} large and rapid climate changes caused by human induced {{releases}} {{of greenhouse gases}} from the earth crust {{is perhaps the most}} challenging environmental problem the mankind has faced. Substantial reduction of this risk requires global co-operation. The first step towards an effective climate treaty – the Kyoto Protocol – did not attract the support hoped and strived for. There is at least one important lesson to be drawn from the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, namely that countries’ willingness to join a climate treaty critically depends on its design. In December 2009, the leaders of the world meet in Copenhagen to negotiate a climate treaty effective after the Kyoto Protocol’s first period. Being the <b>chair</b> <b>country</b> of the EU {{during the second half of}} 2009, Sweden has a particularly significant role in this attempt to negotiate a climate treaty capable of attracting broad support from world’s countries...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The Southern African {{countries}} colonial {{struggles and}} South African apartheid destabilization {{policies in the}} mid- 1960 s to 1980 s compelled Southern African states to establish a Security Organ. This was to assist them to formulate the common defence policy. This Organ {{became known as the}} Front Line States (FLS). However, as more countries attained independence and joined FLS, the grouping established the Southern African Coordination Conference (SADCC) that was later renamed the Southern African Development Community (SADC). It was SADC, which decided to establish another arm, which deals with Politics Defence and Security known as the Organ on Politics Defence and Security. The OPDS has experienced major problems in achieving its goals since its inception in June 1996. Member states had become suspicious of this body and as a result some members decided to operate outside the confines of this body. The main aim of this dissertation has been to trace the circumstances and the origin of this Security Organ and to evaluate its achievements. However, in august 2001, OPOS was renamed Organ of Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation (OPDSC). This Organ became accountable to the Summit not to the <b>chair</b> <b>country,</b> as was the case before. The protocol of this Organ is analysed in order to evaluate the roles of this Organ in relations to SADC member states. The dissertation also indicated the success and limitations of this Organ; the political trends of the region are also discussed. Finally, the dissertation deals with the unfinished question, which focuses on the future prospects and challenges of the OPDS as a policy implementation institution of SAOC...|$|E

G 20 has come to capture the spotlight of experts and policy-makers in all the countries as a new ‘world economic order’ to replace the well-known G 7. A browse of the countries {{on the list of}} G 20 reveals that G 20 represents a quite complex mix of countries compared to G 7. Within G 20, there exist so-called ‘advanced elite economies’ such as Germany, France, England, Japan, Italy, the United States and Canada, right next to emerging economies such as India, China, Brazil, Russia(so-called BRICs), South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. While G 20 is a hetero-genious group which covers both ‘advanced’ and ‘emerging’ economies, and incorporates countries with remarkably diverse cultural, political, and economic institutions, the emergence of G 20 as the world ‘premier forum’ to discuss and decide on the most critical issues of the global economy signals that a significant change is taking place in the world order. It is in this context that the series of study in ‘Vocational Education and Training Institutions in G 20 Member Countries’ are planned. The study is undertaken as a 3 -year-long project. In {{the first year of the}} study, the focus will be given to examining the VET systems of advanced economies and to find their major strengths. In the second year, the focus will be placed to exploring the VET institutions of emerging economies, while trying to discover right directions toward which these institutions should evolve which will help the countries continue to grow at a high rate. In the third year, the emphasis will be given to finding a model of international cooperation through exchanging VET practices among countries both within and outside G 20. In the 1 st year of the study, which is titled ‘Vocational Education and Training Institutions in G 20 Member Countries(I) : Best VET Practices in Selected Countries’, we selected 4 advanced economies, Germany, France, Japan, and Australia, according to the characteristics of the institutions these countries have developed. We also included China, one of the BRICs country, in our 1 st year of the study since in contrast to 4 advanced economies selected, the institutions of China will show clear features as an emerging economy which could help understand institutions of other emerging economies. The 1 st year’s study covers altogether VET institutions in the 5 countries mentioned above. In this study, it is our premise that the economic and political institutions each country has developed will have a bearing on the VET institutions of the country. And we predicted that the 5 countries in our study with distinctive economic and political institutions will have distinctive VET systems. Our major goal was to reveal the major features of each distinctive VET system. Germany, along with countries such as Switzerland, Finland, Denmark and Norway, represents a classical case of corporative market economy(CME). France is considered to be a corporative market economy, yet has specific features which distinguish it from Germany and nordic countries. Japan, the only Asian country in G 7, has developed its own corporative model reflecting Asian culture. Australia is selected as the only liberal market economy(LME) in our study. Australia is included in our study for two reasons. It is a liberal market economy, so are countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. At the same time, Australia is known to have developed a successful VET system among LMEs. China is not an advanced economy, but with its remarkable economic performance during the past decade, has grown to be the second largest economy among G 20 countries and in the world. Major contents of the study can be summarized as follows. For each country, we tried to describe key elements of VET institutions of each countryWe examined types of their VET institutions at each ISCED levelwe looked at both initial(IVET) and continuing VET(CVET) institutionswe also explored special VET topics such as VET teachers, VET curriculums, and the role of social partnerships in VET. For each country, we also described features in each county''s VET system that could be considered to be the best practices in VET. Then, we tried to find implications from VET institutions and best요약 제 1 장 서 론 제 1 절 연구의 배경 1 1. 연구의 필요성 1 2. 연구의 목적 5 제 2 절 연구의 내용 및 방법 9 1. 연구의 내용 9 2. 연구의 방법 12 제 2 장 G 20 과 직업교육훈련제도 제 1 절 G 20 체제 소개 15 1. 글로벌 거버넌스와 G 20 15 2.
