5|$|The {{mechanics}} of <b>crafting</b> and gathering have changed between the original release and A Realm Reborn. Most {{of these changes}} are geared toward reducing the randomness and guesswork involved in these processes. For Disciples of the Hand, all recipes of the appropriate level are unlocked by default in the <b>Crafting</b> Log. <b>Crafting</b> abilities have been rebalanced to allow successful high-quality synthesis without requiring multiple mastered Disciplines of the Hand. For Disciples of the Land, players are allowed to select which item {{they would like to}} attempt to collect at a gathering point, whereas before, the results of gathering attempts were randomized. The Gathering Log also displays the names and locations of items that can be gathered in the world.|$|E

5000|$|Studio <b>craft</b> is the {{practice}} of <b>craft</b> methodology in an artist's studio. Traditional <b>craft</b> tends to generate <b>craft</b> objects out of necessity or for ceremonial use while studio <b>craft</b> produces <b>craft</b> objects at the whim of the maker or intended owner. These objects are at most only desirable for use and often lack any utility. Because studio <b>craft</b> doesn't make objects out of necessity, it is similar to works of studio art which are made for aesthetic rather than functional purposes.|$|R
25|$|Historians {{believe that}} {{parchment}} <b>craft</b> originated {{as an art}} form in Europe during the fifteenth or sixteenth century.

The <b>craft</b> developed over time, with new techniques and refinements being added. Until the sixteenth century, parchment <b>craft</b> was a European art form. However, missionaries and other settlers relocated to South America, taking parchment <b>craft</b> with them. As before, the <b>craft</b> appeared largely among the Catholic communities. Often, young girls receiving their first communion received gifts of handmade parchment <b>crafts.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Craft</b> {{producers}} in South Africa face difficulties selling to formal <b>craft</b> retailers. This {{is due to}} the lack of understanding of what <b>craft</b> retailers consider as important when searching for suppliers. The study was conducted to determine the importance of various supplier selection criteria that <b>craft</b> retailers use to evaluate suppliers. Convenience sampling was adopted and self-administered questionnaires were completed by a total of 233 <b>craft</b> retailers. The findings revealed that <b>craft</b> retailers consider product quality as the most important supplier selection criteria when evaluating <b>craft</b> producers as suppliers. The MANOVA results further indicated that although the importance attached to supplier selection criteria differed for various types of <b>craft</b> retailers, such differences occur only for selected supplier criteria. An understanding of the supplier selection criteria used by <b>craft</b> retailers could enable informal <b>craft</b> producers to gain access to the formal market. [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|An air-cushioned landing <b>craft,</b> {{also called}} an LCAC (landing <b>craft,</b> air cushioned) {{is a modern}} {{variation}} on the amphibious landing boat.

Air cushion technology has vastly increased the landing capability of the <b>craft,</b> providing greater speed and flexibility over traditional landing <b>craft.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{has never}} been in Japan such a {{remarkable}} movement for modernization of designs and <b>craft</b> as has been the case in Europe. As for <b>craft,</b> there was barely the folk <b>craft</b> movement advanced by Muneyoshi Yanagi, whose goal was not the modernization of <b>craft.</b> During the Meiji Era, Japan was so urgent to adapt herself to European civilization that she could ill afford to start her own movement considering her position in the fields of design or <b>craft.</b> Especially, {{in most parts of the}} country, having little influence from Europe, the <b>craft</b> manufacturers were unable to get rid of their traditional way of thinking and manufacturing. In 1929, however, there came home to Japan a toung man called Fusaichiro Inouye, who had experienced a new movement for design and <b>craft</b> for seven years in France. In Takasaki, his native town, trying to connect art with local industry, he would start a movement to make high quality <b>craft</b> far more popular than ever. For this purpose, Inouye organized an Association for distribution of wood <b>craft,</b> established the Inouye <b>Craft</b> Institue, and actually started designing and manufacturing himself. What he aimed at was not only fostering local <b>craft</b> but also manufacturing such <b>craft</b> goods as would be well fit for overseas markets. It was because of such a basis well established that Bruno Taut moved to Takasaki in 1934 so as to be a leader in <b>craft.</b> Taut sympathized with Inouye in his ideal of fostering <b>craft</b> movement as had never been found in Japan, and gave a helping hand to the industrialization of <b>craft</b> and design. Indeed, he settled in Takasaki for twenty-seven months, devoting himself to the development of a new <b>craft.</b> What was a tiny <b>craft</b> movement started in Takasaki, grew big under Taut's leadership, whose designs have had a great influence on the local <b>craft</b> here. It would be necessary for us to evaluate highly this <b>craft</b> movement in Takasaki, if we were to make a panorama of our modern design and <b>craft...</b>|$|R

5|$|According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, {{the series}} {{had become too}} grueling and {{complicated}} for modern gamers, and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise to a broader audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans. It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players, <b>crafting</b> open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.|$|E
5|$|Artists were {{classified}} as artisans since they were nonagricultural laborers who manufactured and decorated objects. The philosopher Wang Fu argued that urban society exploited the contributions of food-producing farmers while able-bodied men in the cities wasted their time (among other listed pursuits) <b>crafting</b> miniature plaster carts, earthenware statues of dogs, horses, and human figures of singers and actors, and children's toys. However, during Eastern Han some scholar-officials began engaging in crafts originally reserved for artisans, such as mechanical engineering. Emperor Ling commissioned the official Cai Yong (132192 CE) to paint portraits and produce eulogies for five generations of the prominent Yang clan of officials and military officers. This is the first recorded instance in China where a scholar-official was commissioned to write eulogies and paint portraits in conjunction, instead of relying on skilled artisans to do the painting.|$|E
