40|$|Abstract. Statistical {{offices are}} faced with the problem of multiple-database data mining at least for two reasons. On one side, there is a trend to avoid direct col-lection of data from {{respondents}} and use instead administrative data sources to build statistical data; such administrative sources are typically diverses and scat-tered across several administration level. On the other side, intruders may attempt disclosure of <b>confidential</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> by using the same approach, i. e. by linking whatever databases they can obtain. This paper discusses issues related to multiple-database data mining, with a special focus on a method for linking records across databases which do not share any variables...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{algorithmic}} theory of convex optimization over discrete sets. Using {{a combination of}} algebraic and geometric tools {{we are able to}} provide polynomial time algorithms for solving broad classes of convex combinatorial optimization problems and convex integer programming problems in variable dimension. We discuss some of the many applications of this theory including to quadratic programming, matroids, bin packing and cutting-stock problems, vector partitioning and clustering, multiway transportation problems, and privacy and <b>confidential</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> disclosure. Highlights of our work include a strongly polynomial time algorithm for convex and linear combinatorial optimization over any family presented by a membership oracle when the underlying polytope has few edge-directions; a new theory of so-termed n-fold integer programming, yielding polynomial time solution of important and natural classes of convex and linear integer programming problems in variable dimension; and a complete complexity classification of high dimensional transportation problems, with practical applications to fundamenta...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} any {{rational}} convex polytope is polynomial-time representable as a 3 -way line-sum transportation polytope of “slim” (r, c, 3) format. This universality theorem has important consequences for linear and integer programming and for <b>confidential</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> disclosure. We provide a polynomial-time embedding of arbitrary linear programs and integer programs in such slim transportation programs and in bitransportation programs. Our construction resolves several standing problems on 3 -way transportation polytopes. For example, it demonstrates that, unlike {{the case of}} 2 -way contingency tables, the range of values an entry can attain in any slim 3 -way contingency table with specified 2 -margins can contain arbitrary gaps. Our smallest such example has format (6, 4, 3). Our construction provides a powerful automatic tool for studying concrete questions about transportation polytopes and contingency tables. For example, it automatically provides new proofs for some classical results, including a well-known “real-feasible but integer-infeasible” (6, 4, 3) -transportation polytope of M. Vlach, and bitransportation programs where any feasible bitransportation must have an arbitrarily large prescribed denominator...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{show the}} {{following}} two universality statements on the entry-ranges and Markov bases of spaces of 3 -way contingency tables with fixed 2 -margins:(1) For any finite set D of nonnegative integers, there are r,c, and 2 -margins for (r,c, 3) -tables such that the set of values occurring in a fixed entry in all possible tables with these margins is D. (2) For any integer n-vector d, there are r,c such that any Markov basis for (r,c, 3) -tables with fixed 2 -margins must contain an element whose restriction to some n entries is d. In particular, the degree and support of elements in the minimal Markov bases when r and c vary can be arbitrarily large, in striking contrast with the case for 1 -margined tables in any dimension and any format and with 2 -margined (r,c,h) -tables with both c,h fixed. These results have implications for <b>confidential</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> disclosure control. Specifically, they demonstrate that the entry-range of 2 -margined 3 -tables can contain arbitrary gaps, suggesting {{that even if the}} smallest and largest possible values of an entry are far apart, the disclosure of such margins may be insecure. Thus, the behavior of sensitive data under disclosure of aggregated data is far from what has been so far believed. Our results therefore call for the re-examination of aggregation and disclosure practices and for further research on the issues exposed herein. Our constructions also provides a powerful automatic tool in constructing concrete examples, such as the possibly smallest 2 -margins for (6, 4, 3) -tables with entry-range containing a gap...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> is {{inherently}} highly structured {{and comes with}} rich metadata (in form of code lists, data cubes etc.), {{it would be a}} missed opportunity to not tap into it from the Linked Data angle.

Given that SDMX (<b>Statistical</b> <b>Data</b> and Metadata eXchange) is arguably the most widely used standard for <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> exchange, a great amount of <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> about our societies is yet to be discoverable and identifiable in a uniform way.

40|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining {{is one of}} {{the popular}} {{research}} fields of exploring valuable information from the large number of collected <b>data.</b> Applying <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining techniques in several fields like medicine, bioinformatics, business, and bacteriology can be beneficial. Among them, bacteriology {{is one of the}} promising fields where <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining is hardly ever used. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate the contribution of <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining in the field of bacteriology. The research problem named as bacterial identification from bacteriology that we handle in this paper is a special kind of classification problem of <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining where the only single representation of every class is present in the dataset. After studying this research problem, this paper proposes a novel <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining approach using the decision tree technique in bacterial identification with better performance. The experimental results show significantly less number of biochemical tests are needed in bacterial identification using this proposed approach than the conventional approach that is being followed currently in the biochemical laboratory. Thus, the proposed approach not only benefits microbiologists, but it also improves the traditional approach of bacterial identification by saving time, total cost, and manual labour involvements. <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining; SDM; biology; bacteriology; bioinformatics; classification; decision tree; bacterial identification. ...|$|R
