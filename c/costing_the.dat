Should armour reach zero, the craft will be destroyed, <b>costing</b> <b>the</b> player a life. The player must outmanoeuvre enemies to avoid damage, but can replenish armour by means of power-ups or by airlifting rescued friendlies or captives to a landing zone. Vehicles have a finite amount of fuel which is steadily depleted as the level progresses. Should the fuel run out, the vehicle will crash, again <b>costing</b> <b>the</b> player a life. The craft can refuel by collecting fuel barrels. Vehicles also carry limited ammunition, which must be replenished by means of ammo crates.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the optimal policy of CSP- 1 with inspection errors and return cost. Specifically, for given Type I and Type II errors, the optimal clearance number and sampling frequency are determined by minimizing the long run average unit <b>cost</b> including <b>the</b> inspection <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> rejection <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> opportunity <b>cost,</b> and <b>the</b> return <b>cost.</b> Overall, <b>the</b> analytical results indicate that depending on seven parameters (Type I error, Type II error, <b>the</b> unit inspection <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> unit opportunity <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> rejection <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> unit return <b>cost,</b> and <b>the</b> process defective fraction), there are two main optimal inspection policies for CSP- 1 : No inspection and a 100 % inspection. Moreover, an interesting result is that the op-timal clearance number is independent of the inspection frequency which is the fraction of the units to be inspected during the partial inspection stage...|$|R

The Simpsons is the first television series still in production to receive this recognition. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009.

5|$|As the Seven Years' War entered its {{later stages}} through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attacks from British armies. In 1758 after defeat in July at the Battle of Carillon, the British took Louisbourg in August, causing Atlantic Canada {{to fall into}} British hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. Fort Frontenac fell to the British in the same month, <b>costing</b> <b>the</b> French {{supplies}} for the Ohio Valley campaign. When some of the Indian supporters of the French made peace with the British, France was forced to draw its troops back.

5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey.

However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition.

Fares also change based on service level, with local service within Snohomish County <b>costing</b> <b>the</b> least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive; commuter service from southern Snohomish County and Everett is also less costly compared to commuter service from northern and eastern Snohomish County.

On 20 March 2016, Buffon set a new Serie A record for the longest period without conceding a goal (974 minutes) in the Derby della Mole during the 2015–16 season. On 26 July 2016, Argentine forward Gonzalo Higuaín became the third highest football transfer of all-time and highest ever transfer for an Italian club, when he was signed by Juventus for €90 million from Napoli. On 8 August 2016, Paul Pogba returned to his first club, Manchester United, for an all-time record for highest football transfer fee of €105 million, surpassing the former record holder Gareth Bale.

In November 1992, WMATA reported that ridership at the Anacostia Station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. WMATA admitted that although riders had made the switch from bus to rail, the lower ridership numbers were due to the recession and not because of continuing downtown bus service in the area. Metro said ridership on buses in the neighborhood was down significantly, and the transit agency reduced the number of buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.|$|E

Just as he's about to fire, Cartman's new immense weight causes the stage to collapse, catapulting Gifford off it, and causing the bullet to hit Kenny in the head. Kenny is propelled through the air and impaled on a flagpole. Gifford's bodyguards whisk Gifford away, costing a disappointed Cartman his chance to be on television. Wendy takes to the stage and reveals that Cartman cheated on his essay, but the townspeople are too upset about Gifford's departure to care. Mr. Garrison is taken to a mental hospital, where Mr. Hat is placed into a straitjacket. Mr. Garrison apologizes to the kids for <b>costing</b> <b>the</b> town a chance to be on television, although Kyle explains to him that Cartman is now appearing on talk show Geraldo because of his tremendous obesity.
