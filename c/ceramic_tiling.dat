50|$|William Burton was {{a chemist}} with the Wedgwood Company at the Etruria Works in Stoke-on-Trent, with an {{extensive}} {{knowledge of the}} ceramics industry. It was he who suggested that the red clay and marl found at Clifton was suitable for production of <b>ceramic</b> tiles. Decorative <b>tiling</b> was becoming a popular trend at the time, and represented a long term commercial proposition. Burton oversaw the production of fine pottery {{in the style of}} ancient Persian and Chinese potters, employing fine artists and commissioning work from some of the top designers of the time. Burton was a friend of H. G. Wells and was inspired by the Arts & Crafts Movement, and in particular, the workings of William Morris and John Ruskin. He chose artists and designers that shared this inspiration, and Lancastrian Pottery works became high quality examples of the Arts & Crafts Movement.|$|R
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on a {{reconstruction}} of a cinema building in the town Gbely. It’s complete reconstruction of exterior and interior too. Original function, cinema, is change to sport and cultural centrum now. Object is consist of cafe, squash hall, climbing wall and sauna with rest room. Several thermal insulations are used to isolate object and satisfy a norm terms. The foundations are post insulated too. The interior is divided into functional spaces with Heluz system. New finishes in the object is created by brick paving, klinker, <b>ceramic</b> tiles and <b>tiling.</b> All windows and doors are replaced by new ones in the object. Sliding doors are used in interior for save space. The windows and doors are plastic between interior and exterior. All sanitations are replaced by new ones too. The reinforced concrete floor is used instead of lead bearing lintels. The wheelchair conditions are satisfied on ground floor...|$|R

50|$|The shopfronts are {{decorated}} with banded <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> below the display windows, with a fine continuous band decorating the door and window heads. The eastern-most display window retains its original timber backing shutters. The awning has a pressed metal soffit with geometric motifs.|$|E
50|$|The Carter company {{produced}} {{much of the}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> used on London Underground stations {{built in}} the 1930s and, of particular note, made the relief tiles, designed by Stabler, showing symbols of London-some of these can still be seen on stations such as Bethnal Green.|$|E
50|$|The cathedral's facade is {{a fusion}} of Spanish baroque and {{indigenous}} Bolivian styles. It has a Renaissance Latin Cross style groundplan. The structure itself is built of stone and adobe masonry, with the domes and vaults made with brick and lime mortar, ornamented with <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor {{contains}} retail outlets and has been extensively altered with an arcade from the Lake Street frontage through {{to the rear of}} the building. The street facade has <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling,</b> and some early shopfront elements including timber framing and leadlight panels. The first floor contains museum and display space, with suspended ceilings and air conditioning throughout, and french doors with fanlights opening onto the verandah. It is entered from Shields Street via a stair with a turned timber balustrade, and most internal walls have been removed.|$|E
5000|$|In visual art, pattern {{consists}} in regularity {{which in some}} way [...] "organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner." [...] At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a painting, drawing, tapestry, <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> or carpet, but a pattern need not necessarily repeat exactly {{as long as it}} provides some form or organizing [...] "skeleton" [...] in the artwork. In mathematics, a tessellation is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes (which mathematicians call tiles), with no overlaps and no gaps.|$|E
50|$|The medieval font stands {{underneath}} the west tower, {{there is a}} small statue of the church’s patron Saint Lawrence in an alcove on the north side while the floor has <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling.</b> There are two memorial slabs to the Britiffe family who were local gentry that rose up the social ladder from modest beginnings, they had strong connections with Hunworth for two centuries. Edmund and his wife Rebecca, who built nearby Hunworth Hall and its adjacent barns, lie beneath a memorial slab in the church nave. Edmund’s son, also Edmund, who was a civil servant, and his daughter Henrietta are buried under an ornate marble slab nearest the altar.|$|E
50|$|The three-story {{house was}} {{designed}} as a residential building, {{with the exception of the}} ground level which was intended to house shops. Bastl's design for a house entirely covered in decorative ceramic tiles was at the same time inspired by the Majolika Haus in Vienna (built by Wagner in 1898, itself covered in <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling)</b> and a way of turning the building into a giant advertisement for Josip Kallina's ceramics company (all the tiles used for the house were produced by his factory). The building features decorative iron balconies overlooking the street intersection, depictions of floral and geometric motifs typical for the Art Nouveau style of the period, and a bat-shaped patterned motif around the first floor façade.|$|E
50|$|The central hall {{is a large}} {{space with}} a stage area at the rear end. Full width timber arches {{separate}} the stage and gallery areas from the hall. Narrow timber steps lead up to the stage at {{both sides of the}} hall. Behind the stage are three rooms; a kitchen and two toilets. The wall dividing the stage area from the rear rooms is a single skinned timber lined wall with exposed cross bracing partially exposed in the kitchen area only. The toilet areas have been created by the installation of partition walls lined with fibrous cement sheeting. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> has been used to cover the timber floors in the toilet areas. Fretted fanlights above the toilet and kitchen doors are recent installations.|$|E
50|$|Cathedral of Intercession {{was built}} in 1671-1679 as a {{memorial}} to the expulsion of Poles in 1618 and modelled after the Alexandrov cathedral, but with five domes and without inhabitable basement. Construction is credited to architect Ivan Kuznechik, author {{of the church of}} Saint Gregory in Yakimanka District of Moscow; Kuznechik employed teams of craftsmen from Kostroma. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> was produced by craftsmen from Belarus in 1673. Iconostasis, icons and internal finishes were made by Moscow natives and monks of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. The cathedral stood out for its use of large (25×33 cm) coloured ceramic tiles with Eye of a peacock motive (extant) and unusually large window surfaces (lost during the 1840s reconstruction). Initially the cathedral exterior was finished in unpainted red brick; in 1729 it was painted white and is currently back to original red brick.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the {{exterior}} underwent additional restoration work. A number of ornamental details on {{the exterior}} had been removed in the 1950s due to earthquake concerns, {{and some of the}} Oamaru limestone was damaged during aggressive stone cleaning. After careful research and analysis, these were replaced by limestone sourced from the same levels of the North Otago quarry that provided the original stone. Interior acoustic performance was corrected by the removal of earlier ill-judged and obtrusive intervention measures and their replacement by less-visible and more effective treatments. Interior paintwork was restored throughout to the original Edwardian-era colours. Complex fragmented porcelain and glazed <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> was restored with exact, new purpose-made replicas in the lavish main entrance foyer. The original carpet was recreated (for reference, {{a small portion of the}} original was left in one corner of the Council Chamber). The stained glass windows were restored and (where necessary), rebuilt and the entire building was unobtrusively fire protected.|$|E
50|$|On the {{opposite}} end of the ring, a second new radius was planned to be built - Kaluzhsky, which would follow on a southeast contour to the first newly built Cheryomushki bedroom districts made from Khrushchyovka houses. Like the cheap buildings it expanded into the Kaluzhsky radius was made completely of any decorative architecture whatsoever. For the first time a joint project for a sub-surface station - the Sorkonozhka (Centipede) was created. Consisting of an enclosed concrete prism, it featured two supporting rows of pillars for the ceiling. The original design was standardised to the point where stations differed only in the colour of marble on the pillars and the <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> patterns of the walls. However the method allowed for even further increase in construction methods. A rational combination of using deep-level shield tunnels and a sub-surface station pit allowed for this, and would become the most widely used technique in many ex-USSR metro systems. In 1962 the Kaluzhskaya Line was opened, and in 1964 it had its first extension to the new Kaluzhskoye depot where a temporary surface station was opened.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCeramic tiling {{industry}} {{has become one}} of Turkey's fastest growing industries due to the outstanding achievements of Turkish ceramic producers with respect to producing high quality products with lower costs than their equivalents worldwide. Conversely high costs of the end product of Turkish building industry in general show that there is an important problem with the productivity and quality of construction crews. That's why most construction firms begin to realize the need for a detailed research on the factors affecting construction crew productivity. The {{purpose of this study is}} thus to classify the factors that affect the productivity of <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> crews by using data mining methods. To achieve the purpose of our study, a systematic time study was undertaken with <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> crews in Turkey. Daily productivity values of <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling</b> crews were collected together with the information related with the factors like the crew size, age and experience of crewmembers. Collected data was classified by using Weka program. The outlier values were first removed from the dataset and decision tree method was used to classify the new dataset. Decision tree method was preferred due to its easiness of use and rapidness in classification. Apriori algorithm, which is the mostly preferred association algorithm in previous studies, was also used to highlight the general trend in the dataset...|$|E

The aim of this article is to present the pilot project of the quality costs monitoring system in the production plant of a company that produces <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling.</b> The company is the largest manufacturer of ceramic tiles and paving in the Czech Republic and one of the biggest European manufacturers of tiling materials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe alkali–aggregate {{reaction}} (AAR) is {{an expansion}} {{reaction of the}} aggregate in concrete caused by the alkalinity of hydrated cement, which may disintegrate concrete. The alkali–silica reaction (ASR) is the most general form of AAR which only rarely causes degradation in Finland. The pool at Tampere Swimming Centre was only the third such case in the country. Condition assessment by several parallel methods {{was used to determine}} the existence and extent of ASR. A total of 34 samples were drilled from the concrete structures of the swimming pool. The samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and an X-ray diffractometer as well as by thin section analyses and tensile and compressive strength tests of concrete. Based on the assessment, it was decided to repair the damaged concrete and stop the ASR by proper waterproofing. Tensile and compressive strength tests on the concrete indicated that a relatively light renovation method was sufficient because the deterioration of the concrete was still incipient and the target service life of the repairs was only 20 – 25 years. Self-compacting concrete was determined to be a good solution for concreting the narrow spaces between dense reinforcement. Self-compacting concrete was used also for concreting the splash canals and supporting consoles. The renovation was based on installing proper waterproofing between the concrete surface and the <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling...</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} and analyses the experimental field {{results of the}} sound insulation from airborne and impact noise of the horizontal separating elements commonly used in the past, in which a uniform layer of sand was placed {{on top of the}} floor construction to serve as a base for the <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiling.</b> &# 13; The results of the acoustic measurements show that when there is an intermediate layer of sand in the horizontal separating element between rooms, the sound insulation is greater than would be obtained with other construction systems with equal mass per unit area, where the floor is joined rigidly to the floor construction. The effect on the sound insulation between the rooms produced by this layer of sand placed between the floor construction and the tiling is that of a cushioning layer, and demonstrates that this type of structure acts as a floating floor. En este trabajo se exponen y se analizan los resultados experimentales in situ del aislamiento acústico a ruido aéreo y a ruido de impactos de elementos de separación horizontales, habituales hace años, en los que sobre el forjado se coloca una capa uniforme de arena que sirve de asiento al suelo cerámico. &# 13; Los resultados de las mediciones acústicas muestran que, cuando en el elemento de separación horizontal entre los recintos hay una capa intermedia de arena, el aislamiento acústico es mejor que el que se obtendría con otros sistemas constructivos de igual masa por unidad de superficie, con el suelo unido rígidamente al forjado. El efecto de la capa de arena colocada entre el forjado y el suelo, en el aislamiento acústico entre los recintos, es el de una capa amortiguadora, que hace que este tipo de suelo pueda considerarse como flotante...|$|E
