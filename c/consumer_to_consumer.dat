Web 2. 0 emphasis interaction and exchanging information between individuals and business corporates, two major fundamental changes <b>to</b> traditional <b>consumer’s</b> behavior would be discussed in the thesis. Firstly, the development of online selling connects manufacturers directly to their customers, where retail front is no longer a place for simple transaction but a place where it emphasis customers experience. Secondly, web 2. 0 promoted the <b>consumers</b> <b>to</b> <b>consumer’s</b> activities (C 2 C), which allows the exchanging of physical resources between individual more frequently. The C 2 C activities transform the consumer’s behavior, which in turn transform the landscape of consumption. Two of the effects brought by the Internet consumerism on the site of consumption, i. e. branding of space and territory merging (collistive programme) of landscape will be discussed in the thesis. To seam line the existing logistics system for the <b>consumers</b> <b>to</b> <b>consumers</b> trading activity and enhance the convenience of online shopping experience, a new business model will be proposed after series of studies on the existing logistics system regarding the Internet consumerism. The proposed business model is operated by a third party logistics company i. e.

Detail operation of the system will be discussed in the thesis. Finally, a regional distribution hub in Kwun Tong and several drops off points will be selected for the design execution.
