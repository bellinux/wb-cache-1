50|$|The Jacobin cuckoo, pied cuckoo, or pied crested cuckoo (<b>Clamator</b> <b>jacobinus)</b> is {{a member}} of the cuckoo order of birds that is found in Africa and Asia. It is {{partially}} migratory and in India, it has been considered a harbinger of the monsoon rains due to the timing of its arrival.

50|$|Nests of {{the species}} have are seen round the year but the peak {{breeding}} season is prior to {{the onset of the}} Southwest Monsoon. It builds its nest in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The majority of nests are placed below a height of four metres. The nest is a small cup placed in a fork of a branch. The normal clutch is two to four turquoise blue eggs, although up to five may be laid by birds in the hills of Sri Lanka. The eggs hatch after 14 to 16 days. Brooding parent bird often stands {{on the rim of the}} nest rather than sit on the chicks. Brood parasitism by the pied cuckoo (<b>Clamator</b> <b>jacobinus)</b> is known from both the Indian and Sri Lankan region. The common hawk-cuckoo has also been noted as a brood-parasite. In an exceptional case, jungle babblers have been seen feeding the chicks of the yellow-billed babbler. Chicks are fed mainly insects and the occasional lizard. Like most perching birds, the parents take care of nest sanitation, removing the faecal sacs of the young, typically by swallowing them. Helpers have been seen to assist the parents in building the nest as well as in feeding the chicks at the nest.|$|E
40|$|Obligate brood para-sites are com-pletely depen-dent {{on other}} species {{to raise their}} offsprings. This form of {{parasitism}} occurs in about 80 species of birds around the world, (Payne 1977; Lyon & Eadie 1991). The Pied Cuckoo <b>Clamator</b> <b>jacobinus</b> (Cuculiformes; Cuculidae) is widely distributed throughout the low coun-try of Sri Lanka, being most numerous in the dry zone of the island. It belongs to the sub-family Cuculinae (true cuckoos), which are all parasitic on other birds in their breeding habits. They {{are referred to as}} brood parasites as they foist their eggs into the nests of various passerine species (Order Passeriformes), which incubate them and foster the young cuckoos (Henry, 1971; Harrison, 1999).

40|$|The {{southern}} African subspecies of Jacobin Cuckoo <b>Clamator</b> <b>jacobinus</b> serratus is a brood parasite of a {{range of}} host species. While Jacobin Cuckoos do not evict host young, previous research has found that host young rarely survive the nestling period. Here we provide the first records of Jacobin Cuckoo parasitism of a new host species, the Southern Pied Babbler Turdoides bicolor. We investigate rates of brood parasitism and the survival of host young. The Southern Pied Babbler {{is one of the largest}} recorded hosts for Jacobin Cuckoos and, unusually, we find that host young tend to survive the nestling period and maintain similar body mass to host young in unparasitized broods. However, host young were less likely to survive to independence than young raised in unparasitized nests, suggesting a post-fledging reproductive cost to hosts. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|I {{examined}} the breeding biology of the Cape Bulbul Pycnonotus capensis at a study site in Port Elizabeth for a {{comparison with the}} results obtained by Richard Liversidge from a study made 40 years ago. There were no differences in methods, so results were directly comparable. No {{differences were found between}} the two study periods in the timing of breeding, clutch size, number of fledglings per nesting attempt or successful nesting attempt, indicating no major shift in the life history strat-egy or breeding success of the population. During my study period, there was a strong calendar effect on breeding success: early nests were more likely to be successful than late ones. I found strong differences between bush species with regard to predation risk and brood parasitism risk by the Jacobin Cuckoo <b>Clamator</b> <b>jacobinus.</b> These differences emphasise the com-plex interaction between the timing of breeding, risk of predation and risk of brood parasitism, which influences decisions about when to start nesting and nest site selection in the Cape Bulbul. The breeding biology of animals is influenced by a great number of factors, such as food supply, predation risk and nest site selection, amongst others (Newton 1998). Changes in the breeding biology or even anatomy can be related to changes in the abiotic (Hughes 2000, Yom-Tov 2001, Gjerdrum et al. 2003) or biotic environment (Boveng et al...|$|E
40|$|In coevolutionary arms races, like between cuckoos {{and their}} hosts, {{it is easy}} to {{understand}} why the host is under selection favouring anti-parasitism behaviour, such as egg rejection, which can lead to parasites evolving remarkable adaptations to 'trick' their host, such as mimetic eggs. But what about cases where the cuckoo egg is not mimetic and where the host does not act against it? Classically, such apparently non-adaptive behaviour is put down to evolutionary lag: given enough time, egg mimicry and parasite avoidance strategies will evolve. An alternative is that absence of egg mimicry and of anti-parasite behaviour is stable. Such stability is at first sight highly paradoxical. I show, using both field and experimental data to parametrize a simulation model, that the absence of defence behaviour by Cape bulbuls (Pycnonotus capensis) against parasitic eggs of the Jacobin cuckoo (<b>Clamator</b> <b>jacobinus)</b> is optimal behaviour. The cuckoo has evolved massive eggs (double the size of bulbul eggs) with thick shells, making it very hard or impossible for the host to eject the cuckoo egg. The host could still avoid brood parasitism by nest desertion. However, higher predation and parasitism risks later in the season makes desertion more costly than accepting the cuckoo egg, a strategy aided by the fact that many cuckoo eggs are incorrectly timed, so do not hatch in time and hence do not reduce host fitness to zero. Selection will therefore prevent the continuation of any coevolutionary arms race. Non-mimetic eggs and absence of defence strategies against cuckoo eggs will be the stable, if at first sight paradoxical, result...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between brood parasitic cuckoos and their hosts represents a traditional example of coevolution, whereby obligate interspecific brood parasitic cuckoos completely {{rely on their}} hosts to do their parental care for them by laying their eggs in the host’s nest. This thesis brings together {{a great deal of}} information documenting and clarifying the interactions between different species of hosts and their respective parasitic cuckoos in Bangladesh. I recorded parasitism rates to determine the extent of brood parasitism and to identify the host species that were parasitised by sympatric cuckoos. Four parasitic cuckoos were documented: the Asian koel (Eudynamys scolopacea), the common hawk cuckoo (Cuculus varius; previously known as Hierococcyx varius), the pied cuckoo (<b>Clamator</b> <b>jacobinus)</b> and the Indian cuckoo (Cuculus micropterus). These cuckoos were sympatric and parasitised different host species, including the house crow (Corvus splendens), the long-tailed shrike (Lanius schach), the common myna (Acridotheres tristis), the jungle babbler (Turdoides striatus) and the black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus). All of these cuckoo species are obligate brood parasites. The Asian koel utilised the following three hosts: the house crow, the common myna and the long-tailed shrike. The latter was recorded for the first time as a host for the Asian koel in Bangladesh. We found that koel eggs were highly non-mimetic to those of common myna and long-tailed shrike, but showed good mimicry to house crow eggs. Indian cuckoos showed excellent egg mimicry with the eggs of their black drongo hosts, as did common hawk cuckoos and pied cuckoos with their jungle babbler host. The hosts accepted the eggs of all four cuckoo species. However, the common myna was more likely to abandon nests parasitised by the koel than unparasitised ones. All of the host species suffered the costs of koel parasitism, showing reduced breeding success. Proximity to fruit trees was an important predictor of the probability of parasitism in the three koel host species studied. There was a significant positive relationship between nest volume and probability of parasitism by Asian koels. Furthermore, the colonial breeding house crows suffered comparatively less parasitism than the other two koel host species. Long-tailed shrike nests close to conspecific neighbours were less likely to be parasitised, and the risk of parasitism was increased in nests lower to the ground. The risk of parasitism increased during the breeding season for house crows and common mynas. All three Asian koel hosts tolerated multiple parasitism. We investigated whether there was any interspecific competition among the sympatric cuckoos. In theory, sympatric parasites should show niche segregation through variation in host use. As predicted, each cuckoo species parasitised different host species; however, host use overlapped in common hawk cuckoos and pied cuckoos, but interspecific competition was reduced because these two cuckoo species have different breeding seasons. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in parasitism rate among the three main habitats: human habitations, mixed scrub forests and monoculture plantations. This indicated that different cuckoos favour specific habitats, even if their favourite host also occurs elsewhere. Finally, I tested responses against foreign eggs by the cuckoo hosts as well as by potential cuckoo hosts in the study area. For this purpose, I used differently sized and coloured model eggs. Common mynas and jungle babblers accepted all non-mimetic eggs, as did most of the house crows (91 %). Long-tailed shrikes rejected 75 % of the non-mimetic model eggs. Finally, black drongos turned out to be strong rejectors and could do so without damaging any of their own eggs, most likely because they grasped and ejected the non-mimetic model egg. This result indicates that the black drongo has been in a coevolutionary arms race with the Indian cuckoo since drongos accepted mimetic cuckoo eggs. Species such as the Oriental magpie robin (Copsychus saularis), red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) and Asian pied starling (Gracupica contra), which likely have no history of interaction with cuckoos, accepted 100 % of the non-mimetic model eggs. In conclusion, our findings describe host nest use cues used by the Asian koel, which may provide background for further studies in other sympatric brood parasites. In spite of the high degree of acceptance of parasitic eggs, the breeding success of both cuckoos and hosts should be more closely studied to obtain a better understanding of the costs of parasitism. Future experimental studies are highly recommended to achieve a better understanding of host responses to Asian cuckoo species. PhD i biologiPhD in Biolog...|$|E
