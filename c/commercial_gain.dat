5|$|Most {{of these}} events were {{organized}} by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they {{were excluded from the}} activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for <b>commercial</b> <b>gain.</b> In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.|$|E

Offering warez is generally understood to be a form of copyright infringement that is punishable as either a civil wrong or a crime.|$|E

Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals.

25|$|Newfoundland and Labrador and the Gulf of St. Lawrence {{were the}} first regions to {{experience}} large scale sealing. Migratory fishermen began the hunting from {{as early as the}} 1500s. Large-scale commercial seal hunting became an annual event starting in 1723 and expanded rapidly near the turn of the 18th century. Initially, the method used was to ensnare the migrating seals in nets anchored to shore installations, known as the 'landsman seal fishery'. The hunt was mainly for the procurement of seal meat as a form of sustenance for the settlements in the area, rather than for <b>commercial</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E

In the programme, Panorama revealed the secret trail of internal emails which show how GlaxoSmithKline manipulated the results of the trials for its own <b>commercial</b> <b>gain.</b> Access to the documents has been gained as GlaxoSmithKline fights a fraud trial in the US.|$|E

Due to the popularity and {{the large number of}} students of the Hokushin Ittō-ryū Hyōhō {{at the end of the}} Edo-period, this kind of practice contributed greatly to the spread of shinai and bōgu all over Japan. Also there are many waza like Suriage-Men, Oikomi-Men etc. in modern Kendo which were originally Hokushin Ittō-ryū techniques, named by Chiba Shusaku Narimasa for his school.

Among his later biographers was Octav Minar, who stood {{accused of having}} forged certain details for <b>commercial</b> <b>gain.</b> Direct or covert depictions of Caragiale are also present in several fiction works, {{starting}} with a revue first shown during his lifetime, and including novels by Goga, Slavici, N.

Jordan and Lucian Predescu, published a common signature novel on the writer, which was criticized for its style, tone, and inaccuracies. The short story writer Brătescu-Voineşti proposed that Ion Luca Caragiale's love affair with Veronica Micle and Eminescu's anger provide the key to Eminescu's poem Luceafărul, but his theory remains controversial. Caragiale is also probably present in his son Mateiu's work Craii de Curtea-Veche, where his lifestyle and contribution to literature appear to be the subjects of derision.|$|E

500|$|As an {{antagonist}} in {{a limited}} number of Batman comics during the 90's, Anarky was largely reserved for stories in which Grant wished to press a political point. Early incarnations of Anarky portrayed the character as an anarchist, and were intended to act as a medium for Grant's personal meditations on political philosophy, and specifically for his own anarchist, socialist, and populist leanings. However, according to Grant, anarchists with whom he associated were hostile to his creation of the character, seeing it as an act of recuperation for <b>commercial</b> <b>gain.</b> With libertarian socialism being the primary theme of the first three storylines in the collection, other concepts explored in the stories were informed by the umbrella of anarchist theory. Anti-electoralism and the tactic of non-voting are the dual focuses of [...] "Anarky: Tomorrow Belongs to Us", while economic exploitation, environmental issues, and political corruption are repeatedly referenced in the three remaining stories.|$|E

[...] However, unlike some critics who asserted Idol had no genuine interest in cyberculture, Christgau assumed he did and that this was to be expected, as many subcultures are eventually adopted by mainstream society.

500|$|The Sackler Gallery, {{part of the}} Smithsonian Institution, was due to {{host the}} US premiere {{exhibition}} of the Belitung cargo in early 2012—a date set {{to coincide with the}} Smithsonian museum's 25th anniversary celebration. On 28 June 2011 it was reported that the museum was postponing the show. The Sackler Gallery has received condemnation of the exhibition due to the time-frame and nature of the original excavation of the artefacts; with arguments put forwards about whether the display should be allowed. According to The New York Times, [...] "a group of archaeologists and anthropologists from the National Academy of Sciences — including Robert McCormick Adams, a former leader of the Smithsonian" [...] wrote {{to the head of the}} Smithsonian Institution, G. Wayne Clough, on 5 April 2011 claiming that [...] "proceeding with the exhibition would 'severely damage the stature and reputation' of the institution." [...] Proponents of the arguments against display say that the excavation was for <b>commercial</b> <b>gain</b> and conducted so quickly as to have caused a loss of information pertaining to the crew and cargo. The New York Times article goes on to say that further comments were made by [...] "the Society for American Archaeology, the Council of American Maritime Museums and the International Committee for Underwater Cultural Heritage, as well as groups within the Smithsonian, including the members of the anthropology department and the Senate of Scientists at its National Museum of Natural History" [...] all asking that the Smithsonian reconsider the exhibition. There are also claims that exhibiting the artefacts would be against international agreements on underwater excavations. Kimberly L.
