Hash tables {{have an excellent}} average-case behavior but, in the worst-case, it degrades to something like a <b>chained</b> <b>list.</b> Because of that, the use of hash tables in real-time systems is not usual, since those systems {{may be required to}} guarantee deadlines. This paper discusses the use of hash table in real-time systems, considering that when the probability of an undesirable behavior is low enough, it can be ignored. It also compares approaches simple and 2 -choice for the table design. 1...|$|E
40|$|The code LPIC++ {{presented}} here, {{is based}} on a one-dimensional, electromagnetic, relativistic PIC code that has originally been developed by one of the authors during a PhD thesis at the Max-Planck-Institut fuer Quantenoptik for kinetic simulations of high harmonic generation from overdense plasma surfaces. The code uses essentially the algorithm of Birdsall and Langdon and Villasenor and Bunemann. It is written in C++ in order to be easily extendable and has been parallelized to be able to grow in power linearly with the size of accessable hardware, e. g. massively parallel machines like Cray T 3 E. The parallel LPIC++ version uses PVM for communication between processors. PVM is public domain software, can be downloaded from the world wide web. A particular strength of LPIC++ lies in its clear program and data structure, which uses chained lists for the organization of grid cells and enables dynamic adjustment of spatial domain sizes in a very convenient way, and therefore easy balancing of processor loads. Also particles belonging to one cell are linked in a <b>chained</b> <b>list</b> and are immediately accessable from this cell. In addition to this convenient type of data organization in a PIC code, the code shows excellent performance in both its single processor and parallel version. (orig.)

Finally, implemented with C language, the {{algorithm is}} proved to have high compression efficiency with less time cost in the practical compression of bridge vibration data...|$|R

30|$|Different HASH methods: HASH in STRFINDUNI {{applies the}} 1 -stage HASH {{followed}} by two stages of indexing to construct. During the search process, the first 6  bytes of the head address of <b>chain</b> <b>list</b> of the network data service client pattern string list are found through the screening process and then matched to the network data service client pattern string in the linked list one by one. However, the HASH process in MWM uses only 1 -stage HASH level to accelerate the finding, matching {{them one by one}} in the network data service client pattern string array. This difference in HASH approach is magnified by testing with dictionary files because the number of phrases that begin with the same first 2  bytes is too large, often up to more than 100, and the number of words beginning with the same first 6  bytes is greatly reduced, usually less than three.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} a new algorithm for spatial deinterlacing {{that could easily}} be integrated in a more complete deinterlacing system, typically a spatio-temporal motion adaptive one. The spatial interpolation part often fails to reconstruct close to horizontal lines with a proper continuity, leading to highly visible artifacts. Our system preserves the structure continuity {{taking into account that}} the mis-interpolated points usually correspond to local value extrema. The processing is based on <b>chained</b> <b>lists</b> and connected graph construction. The new interpolation method is restricted to such structures, {{for the rest of the}} image, a proper traditional directional spatial interpolation gives satisfactory results already. Although the number of pixels affected by the extrema interpolation is relatively small, the overall image quality is subjectively well improved. Moreover, our solution allows to gain back one of the major advantages of motion compensation methods, without having to afford their complexity cost...|$|R
