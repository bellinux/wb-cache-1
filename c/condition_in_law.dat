40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to identify inconsistencies in the tax legislation in Kosovo and recommend solutions towards more comprehensive and user friendly laws for taxpayers, tax professionals and tax administrators. A crucial element of the tax legislation is its consistency. Tax laws {{need to be in}} accordance with each other as they are the building blocks of the same system – the tax system. Unfortunately, analysis on the tax <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> Kosovo resulted in identification of a number of inconsistencies that affect negatively the comprehensiveness, simplicity and the functionality of the laws. Moreover, interviews conducted with different stakeholders on the issue, namely businesses, tax officials, tax professionals and academicians reveal that in practice also these inconsistencies are noticed and interrupt the functionality of the legislation. The main issues identified are related with inconsistent structure of the <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> comparison with each other, inconsistent articles and paragraphs inside each law, missing components and unclear definitions, and also procedures and penalties regulated by the laws. Based on the findings and with the aim of improving the <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> which these <b>laws</b> currently are, the paper provides a list of recommendations technically feasible and exceptionally relevant...|$|R
40|$|Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) on Z {{is one of}} the {{classical}} exactly solvable models in the KPZ universality class. We study the "slow bond" model, where TASEP on Z is imputed with a slow bond at the origin. The slow bond increases the particle density immediately to its left and decreases the particle density immediately to its right. Whether or not this effect is detectable in the macroscopic current started from the step initial condition has attracted much interest over the years and this question was settled recently (Basu, Sidoravicius, Sly (2014)) by showing that the current is reduced even for arbitrarily small strength of the defect. Following non-rigorous physics arguments (Janowsky, Lebowitz (1992, 1994)) and some unpublished works by Bramson, a conjectural description of properties of invariant measures of TASEP with a slow bond at the origin was provided in Liggett's 1999 book. We establish Liggett's conjectures and in particular show that TASEP with a slow bond at the origin, started from step initial <b>condition,</b> converges <b>in</b> <b>law</b> to an invariant measure that is asymptotically close to product measures with different densities far away from the origin towards left and right.
