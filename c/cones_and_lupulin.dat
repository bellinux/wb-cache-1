50|$|H. lupulus {{can grow}} to be 10 meters tall {{and because it}} is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant it goes through several growing seasons sometimes living up to 20 years. H. lupulus has simple leaves that can be opposite or alternate with 3-5 lobes. The staminate flowers do not have petals, while the pistillate flowers’ petals completely cover the fruit. The cones found on female plants are called strobili. The fruit of H. lupulus is an achene meaning that the fruit is dry but does not split open at maturity. The achene is surrounded by tepals <b>and</b> <b>lupulin</b> secreting glands are concentrated on the fruit.|$|R

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the second-order <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> the {{circular}} <b>cone</b> have many analogous properties. In particular, there exists an important distance inequality associated with the second-order <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> the circular <b>cone.</b> The inequality indicates that the distances of arbitrary points to the second-order <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> the circular <b>cone</b> are equivalent, which is crucial in analyzing the tangent <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> normal <b>cone</b> for the circular cone. In this paper, we provide an alternative approach to achieve the aforementioned inequality. Although the proof is a bit longer than the existing one, the new approach offers a way to clarify when the equality holds. Such a clarification is helpful for further study {{of the relationship between the}} second-order <b>cone</b> programming problems <b>and</b> the circular <b>cone</b> programming problems.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The genetic {{variability}} in and association between 14 traits that affect maturity, yield, and chemical properties of its product. The plant characters measured were: vigor, flowering date, harvest date, yield, lateral length, nodes per lateral, cones per lateral, cones per vine, <b>cone</b> weight. Alpha-acid <b>and</b> beta-acid {{content of the}} cone, alpha:beta-acid ratio, total soft resin, <b>and</b> <b>lupulin</b> content of the cone {{were included in the}} chemical evaluation. Genetic variance, genetic coefficient of variation, broad sense heritability and expected gain were calculated for each of the traits. The degree of association between traits was determined on the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and environmental correlations. The phenotypic correlations were further analyzed by path coefficient analysis to determine the interrelationships of the traits. Highly significant differences among genotypes were shown for all characters measured. The genetic coefficients of variation, broad sense heritability, and expected gains indicated there was a large genetic potential for improvement of most traits studied. Vigor, flowering date, and harvest date appear to have the least genetic potential for improvement. Application of a five percent selection pressure should result in a 90 percent gain in number of <b>cones</b> per vine <b>and</b> yield, and a 70 percent gain in lateral length <b>and</b> <b>cones</b> per lateral. All agronomic characteristics other than cone weight were positively correlated with yield. Also, all possible combinations of harvest date, lateral length, nodes per lateral, cones per lateral, <b>cones</b> per vine, <b>and</b> yield had significant positive phenotypic correlations. With the exception of vigor, phenotypic correlations between agronomic characters and the quality traits, alpha-acid and betaacid content of the cone, were either significant in a positive direction or showed no relationship. Correlations between alpha-acid and beta-acid concentration tend to support the concept that the two compounds are genetically independent after their common biosynthetic pathways diverge. Path coefficient analyses of phenotypic correlation coefficients showed that lateral length <b>and</b> <b>cones</b> per vine have more of a direct and indirect effect on yield than does vigor, flowering date, harvest date, nodes per lateral, or cone weight. The results reported in this study are important to the hop breeder whose objective is to improve yield and quality. The results indicate: 1. There is a large genetic potential for improving most traits studied. 2. Associations between and among agronomic and quality traits show that selection can be practiced on either group separately without having a negative effect on the other. 3. Lateral length <b>and</b> <b>cones</b> per vine have a strong influence on yield. Improvement of these two traits provides a means for increasing yeild in early maturing cultivars...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1970 's {{there have been}} many papers devoted to tangent <b>cones</b> <b>and</b> their {{applications}} to optimization.
