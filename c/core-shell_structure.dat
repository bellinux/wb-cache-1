50|$|The {{upconversion}} {{process is}} said to be cooperative when there is one or more elementary steps (sensitization or luminescence) in the process which involve multiple lanthanide ions. In cooperative sensitization process, two ions in their excited state simultaneously decay to their ground states, generating a higher energy photon. Similarly, in cooperative luminescence, two excited state ions transfer their energy to a neighboring ion in one elementary step.Energy migration-mediated upconversion (EMU) involves four types of luminescent ion centers with different roles. They are located in separate layers of a <b>core-shell</b> <b>structure</b> of the nanomaterial to inhibit relaxation processes between ions. In this case, low-energy photons are excited in an ETU process that populates an excited state of another ion. Energy from this state can transfer to an adjacent ion through a core-shell interface and is then emitted.|$|E

The Cu is first electrodeposited {{on the surface of}} the porous carbon electrode (PCE) and the deposited Cu is then partially replaced by Pt spontaneously. The addition of the thiourea (TU) along with the pH adjustment can tremendously reduce the self-dissolution of Cu due to dissolved oxygen.

50|$|The {{properties}} desired of CSSNCs {{when using}} them for biological applications include high quantum yield, narrow fluorescence emission, broad absorption profile, stability against photobleaching, 20 second fluorescent lifetime, and high brightness. High quantum yields mean that minimal energy {{will need to}} be put into the quantum dot to induce fluorescence. A narrow fluorescence emission allows for multiple colors to be imaged at once without color overlap between different types of CSSNCs. Having a broad absorption profile allows multiple CSSNCs to be excited at the same wavelength and thus, multiple CSSNCs could be imaged simultaneously. Having a 20-second fluorescent lifetime allows for time-resolved bioimaging. The utility of CSSNCs is that they can be a complement to organic fluorophores. CSSNCs are less susceptible to photobleaching, but less is known about them compared to organic fluorophores. CSSNCs have 100-1000 times the two-photon fluorescence efficiency as organic dyes, exemplifying their value.In the cases where CSSNCs are used in biological medium, the core is a quantum dot and the shell can be an organic molecule or biological ligands, such as a DNA, that are used for biocompatibility and targeting. The shell can also be an organic molecule to which a biological molecule is later conjugated, furthering the modularity of <b>core-shell</b> <b>structure.</b> The most popular core/shell pair used is CdSe core with ZnS or CdS shell, which improves the quantum yield and protects against photobleaching compared to that of the core material alone. The size of the CSSNC is directly correlated to the color of fluorescence, so being able to control particle size is desirable. However, it is generally unknown how the shell molecules, and salt concentration, pH, and temperature of the media affect the CSSNCs’ properties and remains empirical.|$|E
