50|$|Schneier {{has said}} that {{homeland}} security money should be spent on intelligence, investigation, and emergency response. Defending against the broad threat of terrorism is generally better than focusing on specific potential terrorist plots. According to Schneier, analysis of intelligence data is difficult but {{is one of the}} better ways to deal with global terrorism. Human intelligence has advantages over automated and <b>computerized</b> <b>analysis,</b> and increasing the amount of intelligence data that is gathered does not help to improve the analysis process. Agencies that were designed around fighting the Cold War may have a culture that inhibits the sharing of information; the practice of sharing information is more important and less of a security threat in itself when dealing with more decentralized and poorly funded adversaries such as al Qaeda.|$|E

In his Ph.D. thesis, Vlado Dančík pioneered an alternative approach in which a deterministic finite automaton is used to read symbols from two input strings and produce a (long but not optimal) common subsequence of this inputs. The behavior of this automaton on random inputs can be analyzed as a Markov chain, the steady state of which determines the rate at which it finds elements of the common subsequence for large values of n. This rate is necessarily a lower bound on the Chvátal-Sankoff constant. By using Dančík's method, with an automaton whose state space buffers the most recent h characters from its two input strings, and with additional techniques for avoiding the expensive stead-state Markov chain analysis of this approach, [...] was able to perform a <b>computerized</b> <b>analysis</b> with h = 15 that proved [...] Similar methods can be generalized to non-binary alphabets.
