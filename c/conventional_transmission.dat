5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and <b>conventional</b> <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to producing projection images, PCI, like <b>conventional</b> <b>transmission,</b> {{can be combined}} with tomographic techniques to obtain the 3D distribution of the real part of the refractive index of the sample. When applied to samples that consist of atoms with low atomic number Z, PCI is more sensitive to density variations in the sample than conventional transmission-based X-ray imaging. This leads to images with improved soft tissue contrast.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM, also sometimes <b>conventional</b> <b>transmission</b> {{electron microscopy}} or CTEM) is a microscopy technique {{in which a}} beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from {{the interaction of the}} electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen, a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a charge-coupled device.|$|E

5000|$|Spread-spectrum {{transmissions}} {{can share}} a frequency band with {{many types of}} <b>conventional</b> <b>transmissions</b> with minimal interference.

5000|$|Until the Second World War AFN {{continued}} {{to produce a}} small number of sports cars badged Frazer Nash incorporating a unique multi-chain transmission. It continued after the war making another 85 sports cars before ending manufacture in 1957. The post-war cars had <b>conventional</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{was also}} an {{interest}} in producing rotorcraft that made use of tip-driven rotors, which {{had the advantage of}} avoiding the torque that would be produced by rotors driven by a <b>conventional</b> <b>transmission</b> as well as the consequential requirement to incorporate a complicated and vulnerable torque-compensating tail rotor. Some contemporary designs, such as the Sud-Ouest Djinn, bled high pressure air from the engine directly to the tips; Fairey had been conducting work into a drive where this air was mixed with fuel at the tips and burned. Such methods had already been flight tested on the Fairey Jet Gyrodyne, and Fairey decided that the technique would be suitable for a compact rotorcraft.|$|E
2500|$|In {{parallel}} hybrids, the ICE and {{the electric}} motor are both {{connected to the}} mechanical transmission and can simultaneously transmit power to drive the wheels, usually through a <b>conventional</b> <b>transmission.</b> Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system as found in the Insight, Civic, Accord, {{as well as the}} GM Belted Alternator/Starter (BAS Hybrid) system found in the Chevrolet Malibu hybrids are examples of production parallel hybrids. The internal combustion engine of many parallel hybrids can also act as a generator for supplemental recharging. [...] Currently, commercialized parallel hybrids use a full size combustion engine with a single, small (<20nbsp&kW) electric motor and small battery pack as the electric motor is designed to supplement the main engine, not to be the sole source of motive power from launch. Parallel hybrids are more efficient than comparable non-hybrid vehicles especially during urban stop-and-go conditions where the electric motor is permitted to contribute, and during highway operation.|$|E

50|$|Since any CVT {{may allow}} a power plant, human or motorized, {{to operate at}} (or closer to) its speed of oplimal {{efficiency}}, output torque or output power, the NuVinci CVT may improve a system's overall efficiency or performance compared to a 'conventional' geared transmission, but only if such gain in the efficiency or performance of the power plant exceeds any loss in efficiency or performance that may be introduced by replacing the <b>conventional</b> <b>transmission</b> with the NuVinci CVT. For example, if the NuVinci CVT were only 90% as efficient as the <b>conventional</b> <b>transmission</b> it replaced, the gain in operating efficiency from the power plant {{would have to be}} 11% (i.e., 1/0.90 - 1 = 0.11 or 11%) before the overall efficiency improved. The company does not provide any numbers relating to efficiency of their transmissions, and has declined to do so when requested.|$|E

50|$|One {{specific}} use of Spatial Multiplexing {{is to apply}} it to users who have the best signal quality, so that less time is spent transmitting to them.
