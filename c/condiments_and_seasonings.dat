40|$|Free {{glutamate}} {{has been}} known as flavor enhancer. Commercially, free glutamate is available in form of monosodium glutamate (MSG) crystal. Seasoning or premix may also contain free glutamate or MSG. The aim {{of the present study}} was focus on the determination of the usage and potential/actual exposure of consumers to free glutamate from <b>condiment</b> <b>and</b> <b>seasonings.</b> There were several steps of the study, i. e. survey, laboratory analyses, data analyses, and evaluation of total exposure of free glutamate from <b>condiment</b> <b>and</b> <b>seasonings.</b> The survey was conducted to the 110 households in Bogor (rural) and 112 households in Jakarta (urban). The samples of condiment/seasoning were analyzed by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescent detector. The condiment/seasonings were categorized into 15 types, i. e. sweet soy sauce, salty soy sauce, fermented soybean paste, tomato sauce, MSG, premix seasoning, fermented fish/shrimp paste, chili sauce, ready to use seasoning, seasoned flour, dip and sauce, mayonnaise and mustard, spread, oyster and fish sauce, and teriyaki and others. The results of condiment/seasonings survey revealed that sweet soy sauce, MSG, <b>and</b> premix <b>seasoning</b> were used by most of households (± 71 % or more than 80 households) both in Bogor and Jakarta. The laboratory analyses of free glutamate from condiment/seasonings revealed that the highest free glutamate content was found in MSG (733. 29 mg/g). Beside MSG, there were three other condiments that also had high free glutamate content, i. e. premix seasoning (70. 77 mg/g in Bogor and 63. 66 mg/g in Jakarta), oyster and fish sauce (46. 76 mg/g in Bogor), and ready to use seasoning (15. 71 mg/g in Jakarta). Although the average condiment/seasonings usage in Bogor (5. 39 g/cap/day) was lower than that in Jakarta (9. 62 g/cap/day), but the free glutamate intake from condiment/seasonings in Bogor (847. 04 mg/cap/day) was higher than that in Jakarta (615. 87 mg/cap/day). This was due to the high contribution of MSG that used in higher amount in Bogor...|$|R
40|$|Sesame seeds were {{fermented}} {{using the}} traditional method {{for four days}} and samples taken for analysis each day till {{the last day of}} fermentation to monitor the compositional changes in the seeds as fermentation progressed. The viable count obtained ranged from 8. 0 × 103 after 24 h to 2. 93 × 106 cfu/g on the 4 th day. The crude protein and fat content increased as fermentation progressed reaching 27. 84 % and 51. 58 % respectively. Fermentation yielded positive effect on the phytic acid, phytin phosphorus and oxalate content of the flour samples when compared with the control. Phytic acid content ranged from 31. 59 mg/g for raw seed to 18. 13 mg/g for fermented seed flour. Sesame seed are high in minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and slight increases in values were obtained at the end of processing. Sesame seeds are rich in both essential and non-essential amino acids with leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine and valine values higher than the recommended daily allowance. Processing significantly increased the amino acid values. Sesame flour demonstrated ability to scavenge free radicals. Fermentation of sesame seeds resulted in reduction in the antinutrients in the seed and the seed can serve as soup <b>condiment</b> <b>and</b> <b>seasoning</b> with improved nutritional composition with respect to protein and amino acid...|$|R

40|$|<b>Seasonings</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> can be {{candidate}} {{vehicles for}} micronutrient fortification if consumed consistently and if dietary practices ensure bioavailability of the nutrient. In this review, we identify {{factors that may}} affect the bioavailability of iron, vitamin A, zinc, and folic acid when added to <b>seasonings</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> <b>and</b> evaluate their effects on micronutrient status. We {{take into consideration the}} chemical and physical properties of different forms of the micronutrients, the influence of the physical and chemical properties of foods and meals to which fortified <b>seasonings</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> are typically added, and interactions between micronutrients and the physiological and nutritional status of the target population. Bioavailable fortificants of iron have been developed for use in dry or fluid vehicles. For example, sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaFeEDTA) and ferrous sulfate with citric acid are options for iron fortification of fish and soy sauce. Furthermore, NaFeEDTA, microencapsulated ferrous fumarate, and micronized elemental iron are potential fortificants in curry powder and salt. Dry forms of retinyl acetate or palmitate are bioavailable fortificants of vitamin A in dry candidate vehicles, but there are no published studies of these fortificants in fluid vehicles. Studies of zinc and folic acid bioavailability in <b>seasonings</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> are also lacking...|$|R

40|$|Fortification of {{staple foods}} with {{vitamins}} and minerals is an effective approach to increase micronutrient intake and improve nutritional status. The specific use of <b>condiments</b> <b>and</b> <b>seasonings</b> as vehicles in large-scale fortification programs {{is a relatively new}} public health strategy. This paper underscores equity considerations for the implementation of large-scale fortification of <b>condiments</b> <b>and</b> <b>seasonings</b> as a public health strategy by examining nonexhaustive examples of programmatic experiences and pilot projects in various settings. An overview of conceptual elements in implementation research and equity is presented, followed by an examination of equity considerations for five implementation strategies: (1) enhancing the capabilities of the public sector, (2) improving the performance of implementing agencies, (3) strengthening the capabilities and performance of frontline workers, (3) empowering communities and individuals, and (4) supporting multiple stakeholders engaged in improving health. Finally, specific considerations related to intersectoral action are considered. Large-scale fortification of <b>condiments</b> <b>and</b> <b>seasonings</b> cannot be a standalone strategy and needs to be implemented with concurrent and coordinated public health strategies, which should be informed by a health equity lens...|$|E
