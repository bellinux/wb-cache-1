40|$|A {{combined}} {{effect of}} cholesterol and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on the microsomal drug hydroxylation and glucuronidation {{in the liver}} of the rat was studied. PCBs, <b>Clophen</b> A- 50 and A- 60, having an average chlorination degree of 50 and 60 % affect the structure of microsomal membranes. It was found that <b>Clophen</b> A- 60 increased the binding of trypsin- and digitonin-sensitive proteins to the membranes.

Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity doubled with <b>Clophen</b> A- 50 and quadrupled with <b>Clophen</b> A- 60. Hepatic UDPglucuronosyltransferase activity was doubled with both PCBs. The enhancement in hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and in UDPglucuronosyntransferase was found to be lower in the presence of high cholesterol level in the diet when compared to earlier results.

40|$|The first {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate effects of endocrine disruptors on the developing brain and gonads of bird embryos. The substances studied were the insecticide methoxychlor, and nine UV-filters (3 -benzylidene camphor (3 BC), 4 methyl benzylidene camphor (4 MBC), benzophenone (BP) 1, 2 and 3, 4 hydroxy benzophenone (4 HB), 4 dihydroxy benzophenone (4 DHB), benzyl salicylate (BS), and ethyl- 4 -aminobenzoate Et-PABA)), commonly used in cosmetic products. Some of these substances have no estrogenic effect in vitro, but {{have been shown to}} be estrogenic in vivo. The PCB-mixture <b>Clophen</b> A 50 is a well-known inducer of biotransformation enzymes and was co-administered with methoxychlor and the UV-filters 3 BC and 4 MBC. Exposure to 3 BC or 4 MBC caused ovotestis formation and malformations of the Müllerian ducts in Japanese quail embryos. Co-exposure to one of these compounds and <b>Clophen</b> A 50 enhanced the effects, indicating that <b>Clophen</b> A 50 potentiates the effects of the UV-filters. Embryonic co-exposure to <b>Clophen</b> A 50 and methoxychlor caused a disturbed male sexual behaviour. The metabolites of methoxychlor are estrogen receptor (ER) α-selective, which indicates that the effects on behaviour following embryonic treatment were mediated by ERα. Another objective in this thesis was to localize estrogen receptors (ERs) in the brain of adult and embryonic Japanese quail. The ER localization provides a basis for mechanistic studies on effects of endocrine disruptors, by the identification of estrogen-responsive areas in the brain. We found that ERβ, not previously implicated in sex-differentiation of the brain, was the only ER-subtype present in a sexually dimorphic brain area during differentiation. In conclusion, the estrogenic effects of 3 BC, 4 MBC and methoxychlor were increased by co-exposure to PCB. These results raise concern since many wildlife species, as well as humans, carry large body burdens of persistent organic pollutants like PCBs, which potentially can interact and enhance the effects of other endocrine disruptors...|$|E

40|$|The {{results show}} that a cholesterol-rich diet changes the {{composition}} of mucosal membranes. A high cholesterol diet increases mucosal cholesterol and phospholipid contents. Cholesterol enhanced mucosal NADPH cytochrome c reductase and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities as well as mucosal UDP glucuronosyltransferase activity. When phenobarbitone or <b>Clophen</b> A 50 or 60 were administered intraperitoneally to cholesterol-fed rats, the hydroxylation and glucuronidation activities decreased to a lower level. 3 -Methylcholanthrene was, however, able to maintain or increase mucosal hydroxylative enzymes and UDP glucuronosyltransferase. These {{results indicate that the}} drug-metabolizing enzymes of the intestinal mucosa behave very differently from those in the liver. Diet apparently has a regulatory effect on the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes because only a very potent inducer, 3 -methylcholanthrene, was able to maintain and even induce mucosal drug-metabolizing enzymes in rats fed on a high cholesterol diet, possibly through changes in the microenvironment of enzymes caused by cholesterol...|$|E
40|$|Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the {{aetiological}} {{agent of}} rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS) and bacterial cold-water disease (BCWD) causes problems in salmonid aquaculture worldwide. Fry {{are the most}} seriously affected with a septicaemic disease, often with high mortalities. Skin ulcers and fin lesions are common, especially in fish infected at later life-stages. To investigate if Swedish brood fish are infected with F. psychrophilum, Baltic salmon (Salmo salar) brood fish were sampled for bacteriological examination. Both male and female fish, without any clinical signs of disease, {{were found to be}} infected with F. psychrophilum at the time of spawning. The bacterium was isolated from internal organs and sexual products. This shows that the brood fish may serve as a reservoir for the bacterium and indicates vertical transmission as a route of infection. Intraperitoneal experimental infections were performed in three species of salmonids, i. e. rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and sea trout (Salmo trutta) to evaluate any species-differences in susceptibility to the bacterium. Also, macro- and microscopical pathological changes, and the distribution of the bacterium, studied by immunohistochemistry, were evaluated. No species differences in mortality were recorded. Rainbow trout showed more pronounced changes in the spleen with haemorrhages, necrosis, and with numerous free bacteria present. A new experimental infection model, using nanoinjection of F. psychrophilum into newly fertilised rainbow trout eggs was performed to mimic vertical transmission of the bacterium. All infected groups showed higher mortalities compared with controls. Diseased fry showed clinical symptoms and morphological changes similar to RTFS. The nanoinjection method was also used to study the effects of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) on disease resistance to F. psychrophilum infection. Newly fertilised rainbow trout eggs were injected with a commercial blend of PCB (<b>Clophen</b> A 50) and F. psychrophilum. The highest mortality was recorded in groups exposed to bacteria and the lowest dose of <b>Clophen</b> A 50 whereas no effect on disease resistance was recorded in groups receiving the higher dose.

40|$|AIM: To {{study how}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) affect fetal {{growth and the}} {{expression}} of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF II) gene in the mink (Mustela vision). METHODS: Ten female mink were each exposed to 0. 65 or 1. 3 mg <b>Clophen</b> A 50 /day, respectively, during the reproductive season. The numbers and sizes of viable fetuses were recorded. The expression of the IGF II gene was studied by northern blotting using a mink specific IGF II cDNA probe. RESULTS: The number of viable fetuses decreased after PCB exposure in a dose dependent fashion. Expression of the IGF II gene in adult livers from PCB exposed animals was decreased, compared with control animals, in a dose dependent fashion. In contrast, IGF II expression in placentas and fetuses was unaltered. Furthermore, the maternal excretion of urinary cortisol increased in both exposed groups during the implantation period. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the IGF II gene is downregulated by PCB exposure in the adult liver. There is also an indication that the regulation of the expression of this gene differs between adult and fetal life...|$|E
40|$|Amphibian {{metamorphosis}} assays {{are used}} to evaluate potential effects of endocrine disrupting compounds on the thyroid hormone axis. In this study, Xenopus laevis tadpoles are kept in a solution of 0. 2 % thiourea (TU) to arrest and synchronise them in their development. The advantage of this synchronized amphibian metamorphosis assays is that synchronised tadpoles are available at any time to start metamorphosis experiments, and experimental groups are much more homogenous {{at the start of}} experimental exposure compared with groups selected from an untreated pool of animals. The water volume per animal was kept constant throughout the experimental period to overcome the influence of declining numbers of animals per aquarium due to metamorphosis and mortality on the density dependent development of the remaining tadpoles. <b>Clophen</b> A 50 (a technical PCB mixture), the single congener 3, 3 ¿, 4, 4 ¿-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) and apolar sediment extracts that were previously tested positive in the T-Screen, an in vitro proliferation assay for thyroid hormone disruption, were tested in the Synchronized Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay. Endpoints studied were mortality, malformations, body weight, and percentage of metamorphosed froglets {{at the end of the}} 60 -day experimental period, percentage of tadpoles in different developmental stages, and developmental stage-dependent awarded penalty points. Dietary exposure to <b>Clophen</b> A 50 (0. 2 ¿ 50 mg/kg food) resulted in a significant increased percentage of tadpoles that did not pass metamorphosis at concentrations higher than 2 mg/kg food. Time until metamorphosis in those animals that were able to metamorphose after the 60 -days experimental period was significantly decreased. Dietary exposure to PCB 77, a congener that can be readily metabolised, did not result in significant effects in any exposure group (2 ¿ 500 ¿g/kg food). Apolar sediment extracts from two of the three sites that are contaminated with a wide variety of chemicals significantly decreased the percentage of metamorphosed animals and significantly increased the number of tadpoles that remained in early and late metamorphic stages. These effects already occurred when the extracts where diluted more than 1000 times (on an organic carbon base) compared to environmental concentrations. The rank of potency was comparable to results obtained with the T-screen. This suggests the presence of thyroid hormone disrupting compounds in the aquatic environment and possible effects of such compounds on animal development in the wild...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Female mink {{were exposed}} to a {{technical}} polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) preparation (<b>Clophen</b> A 50 [A 50]; 0. 1 or 0. 3 mg/animal/d), one fraction of A 50 containing the non- and mono-ortho-chlorinated congeners (0 – 1 -ortho-chlorobiphenyls [CBs]), another fraction of A 50 containing the congeners with two to four ortho-chlorines (2 – 4 -ortho-CBs), or an organic extract from Baltic gray seal blubber. The animals were exposed for 18 months, including two reproduction seasons. Among the animals given the highest dose of A 50, the whelping frequency was reduced in the second reproductive season, and all kits died within 24 h of birth. Reproduction was also impaired by the lower dose of A 50. Daily exposure to the 0 – 1 -ortho-CBs separated from 0. 3 mg A 50 severely reduced kit survival. Reproduction was not significantly impaired by daily exposure to the 2 – 4 -ortho-CBs separated from 0. 3 mg A 50 or by exposure to the blubber extract. We conclude that the reproductive toxicity in chronically PCB-exposed mink {{is caused by the}} aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor agonists. The lowest-observed-effect level for reproductive impairment was 2. 4 ng 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents (TEQs) per kilogram body weight and day (22 pg TEQs/g feed). Ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) was strongly induced by the 0 – 1 -ortho-CBs and pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase by the 2 – 4 -ortho-CBs.

The data represent combined air samples from the Barents Sea (n = 2), eastern Arctic Ocean (n = 10), Norwegian Sea (n = 2), and two land-based monitoring stations at Alert, Canada (n = 5), and Dunai Island in eastern Siberia, Russia (n = 3). Values for ∑PCN (pg m- 3) were 6 − 49 for shipboard samples and 0. 3 − 8 for land-based stations and were dominated by the 3 -Cl and 4 -Cl homologues, which accounted for 90 − 95 % of the total mass. Average values for ∑PCB (pg m- 3) for the shipboard samples were 126, 24, and 75 for the Barents Sea, eastern Arctic, and Norwegian Sea, respectively. Three-dimensional 5 -day air parcel back-trajectories arriving at the ship at 850 and 925 hPa suggested that elevated PCB and PCN concentrations for shipboard samples originated in Europe. Concentrations (fg m- 3) of coplanar PCBs in artic air were 3 − 40 (PCB 77) and 0. 3 − 8 (PCB 126) about an order of magnitude lower than in urban air. Higher concentrations of PCB 77 and PCB 126, 347 and 5. 0 (fg m- 3), respectively, were found in the Barents Sea for two samples with elevated ∑PCBs.

However, the wipe sample showed weak mutagenic activity which disappeared when metabolizing cells were used. The chemical analysis of the wipe sample showed tri-, tetra- and pentachlorodibenzofurans in addition to PCBs. Gene Mutation in Mammalian Cells Various cell types-those of mesenchymal origin as well as tumor origin-are used frequently in mammalian mutagenesis tests. A few systems of epithelial origin are also available. The mesenchymal cells most commonly employed are established aneuploid cells such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and V 79, which we use as target cells. Other cell lines include mouse embryo or human skin fibroblasts. In many instances, the phenotypic change in these cells is the result of changes in enzymes of metabolic systems, and in some cells the mutations in the structural gene and production of abnormal protein have been characterized. The most widely used procedure for selection of mutants is based on 8 -azaguanine or 6 -thioguanine resistance, which is caused by a reduction in activity of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase due to a mutation in the HGPRT locus in the X-chromosome. Another selection procedure deals with ouabain resistance that results from a mutation affecting a membrane-associated sodium potassium ATPase. In the present cell-mediated mutagenesis assay method developed by Huberman (1) and Huberman and Sachs (2), target cells, V 79 with the appropriate markers for mutagenesis, are co-cultivated with lethally irradiated embryo cells or hepatocytes that can metabolize the chemical carcinogens.

40|$|Development of Cleanup Methods for PCB Containing Elastic Sealant Used in Outdoor Joints between Concrete Blocks in Buildings. The {{goals of}} the project were to develop cleanup methods for PCB {{containing}} elastic sealants used in outdoor joints between concrete blocks and to minimise the PCB spread to the outdoor environment, to the indoor air and also to keep the PCB levels as low as reasonably possible in the workplace environment during the work with taking away the sealant. Analyses of PCB are done within the project. The cleanup process consisted of different steps, (1) cutting the elastic sealant with an oscillating knife, (2) grinding of the concrete with a mechanical machine, (3) sawing the concrete with a machine (4) cutting the concrete with a machine chisel. At all these different steps a high capacity vacuum cleaner which {{was connected to the}} machines was used. The following PCB analyses were done (1) concentration in the elastic sealant, (2) concentration in the concrete close to the sealant, (3) concentration in soil, (4) concentration in the indoor air, (5) concentration in the air in the workplace environment. The elastic sealant contained 6 % total PCB of a technical product with a composition most similar to <b>Clophen</b> A 40. The concrete close to the sealant (first 1 - 2 mm) contained 0, 11 % and 1, 7 % total PCB at two different places. The pattern of the PCBs resembled that of the sealant. PCB concentrations, å 7 PCB, in the soil increased during the work with the sealants with 0, 08 mg/kg dry soil 1 meter from the building and with less than 0, 03 mg/kg dry soil 10 meters from the building. The source of the PCB in the soil is most likely the sealant as the pattern of the PCB-congenes is similar. The PCB levels in the workplace air {{in the beginning of the}} project when the equipment used were not fully developed were generally above the occupational exposure limit 10 mg/m 3 (up to 120 mg/m 3). Later when the equipment were optimised to better take care of dust and gases produced during the cutting and grinding etc, levels were below or close to 10 mg/m 3. The pattern of the PCBs in the workplace air was different from that of the sealant containing more of the lighter components. The PCB concentration in the indoor air were measured before and under the work with cleaning-up the sealants. The levels were around 600 ng/m 3 and there was no significant increase during the work with taking away the sealant.
