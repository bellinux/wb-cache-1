Temperature fluctuation on TBCs surface is evident. The inlet temperature of main flow (Tin) more than the heat transfer coefficient of cooling passages (hcool) impacted the fluctuation.

40|$|Due to {{the wide}} spread use of {{pharmaceuticals}} in both human and animal populations, the contamination of surface waters resulting from the outflow of waste water treatment facilities is of growing concern. Conventional methods used for the determination of these compounds often require extensive sample preparation {{in order to achieve}} appropriate limits of detection and quantitation. As a result, analytical methods which utilize these procedures are limited in their throughput capacity, while also generating large volumes of solvent waste. <b>Coated</b> <b>blade</b> spray (CBS) is a solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique which enables the direct to mass spectrometry analysis of extracted compounds with the application of limited organic solvent in order to desorb analyte and perform electrospray ionization. Demonstrated herein is the application of CBS for the concomitant MS/MS analysis of 12 pharmaceuticals in environmental waters which was able to demonstrate LODs for all compounds at concentrations of less than 50 ng/L while employing a 30 second analysis time. As select pharmaceuticals are susceptible to bioaccumulation, the analysis of fish tissue as a marker of environmental pollution is also an area of interest. For this reason a device was developed, the SPME needle, which is able to perform rapid tissue analysis without the need for a protective sheathing needle or house, simplifying the sampling process. The device was further validated to be reproducible and not effected by puncture through protective tissue. Finally, the device was incorporated into a projectile which was validated to enable rapid one handed SPME sampler administration {{in a matter of seconds}} in an on-site proof of concept...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{advances}} in direct sample to mass spectrometry (MS) techniques have {{allowed for the}} application of these methods towards quantitative analysis in complex matrices such as biofluids and tissue. However, the predictable limitations of these technologies, such as ionization suppression, poor sensitivity at trace levels, and narrow linear dynamic range, have been the driving force toward the development of methods that efficiently integrate sampling, sample cleanup, and analyte collection and ionization. In this context, the direct interface of microextraction technologies and MS has undoubtedly revolutionized the speed, efficacy, and robustness with which complex matrices can be scrutinized. In this thesis, numerous strategies recently developed for the direct and efficient coupling of Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) and MS are presented towards the analysis of complex matrices. Aiming to supply a range of technologies suited for diverse applications, different SPME geometries such as coated fibers, blades and meshes, as well as ionization approaches, such as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), were studied. In addition, these workflows are compatible with SPME devices that undergo either sampling of tissue or direct immersion into liquid samples. The strategies developed as part of this doctoral dissertation include the following: SPME-Transmission Mode coupled to MS via Direct Analysis in Real Time (SPME-TM-DART-MS), SPME coupled to MS via nano-ESI (SPME-nanoESI-MS), SPME coupled to MS via Open Port Probe (SPME-OPP-MS), and <b>Coated</b> <b>Blade</b> Spray-MS (CBS-MS). In most of the applications herein compiled, total analysis time does not exceed 5 minutes, while sample volumes ranging between 1 and 1500 μL can be utilized for analysis. Sampling/sample-preparation is performed either by spotting the sample onto the SPME device, or by immersing the SPME device on a vessel containing the sample. Despite short extraction times, limits of detection in the pg/mL to sub-ng/mL range were obtained, while good accuracy (i. e. 80 - 120 %) and linearity (i. e. ppt to ppm) were attained for all studied probes (i. e. therapeutic drugs, drugs of abuse, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides) in the diverse sample matrices (e. g. phosphate buffer saline, urine, plasma, blood, grape juice, orange juice, milk, and ground water). Lastly, this work describes exemplary cases in which the mere coupling of SPME to MS is not sufficient to answer relevant analytical questions, and the use of a chromatographic step is justified. Hence, supplementary instrumental strategies that allow for removal of co-extracted interferences or source artifacts, such as Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS), tandem MS in time (MSn), and Multiple Reaction Monitoring with Multistage Fragmentation (MRM 3), are also discussed in this dissertation. Although the body of this work is chiefly focused on biofluid analysis, the attained results certainly support the implementation of this group of technologies towards the analysis of diverse complex matrices of environmental, biological, food, clinical, military, forensic, and pharmaceutical significance. We are confident that in a foreseeable future, this work will encourage readers around the globe towards the use of SPME-MS as a workhorse for on-site and benchtop analysis. In few words, SPME-MS technologies appear poised to shift the paradigm of direct sample introduction to MS...|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{establish}} and analyze the mathematical models of the plowing force and trajectory curve for tiller blades and cultivation blades of a rotary. Both blades are widely used in Taiwan. To ensure good efficiency and uniform resistance of the plow to soil, the blade must be protected from intertwisting. The theoretical and calculated cutting angles are 85. 88 and 85. 10, the edge-curve angles are 55. 00 and 56. 18. The rear of well designed plowing blade does not cause any friction with the soil. The curve of plowing shows that when the relief angle of the tiller blades is 25, the turning and the throwing have good performance. When the relief angle of the plowing blade is 10, the impact force and the crashing force of the blade into the soil will be minimized during plowing. Under the same condition of soil, the different accelerations agree with the curves drew by different relief angles. The tiller blades developed by local companies are suitable to the plowing environment in Taiwan. The high attrition causes too much operation cost for soil preparation. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} apply alloy powder spray-welding technology to improve the attrition as well as to increase the stability of materials, and then the lift of the blade can be extended. Consequently, the quality of the soil can be maintained. The high attrition causes too much operation cost for soil preparation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply the Nickel-Base alloy powder welding technique to the blades of tillers. In order to measure surface temperature of <b>coated</b> <b>blade,</b> this research tried to use designed alloy powder spray-welding mechanism to precede the surface hardening for the blades, and to use the infrared thermal imager to collect the instant heat image and its radiant temperature. Experimental results showed that, at the measure spots, both the instant heat image displayed in the thermal imager and the surface temperature of the heat radiation collected after eight seconds consistent with the conclusions addressed by other foreign researchers. At the same time, two sets of heat radiant temperatures obtained from the thermal imager were uniformly distributed over two pieces of tiller blades. Therefore, it can be proved that the coating surface of the tiller blades treated with alloy powder welding would have more uniform, precise and stability when using the alloy powder spray-welding mechanism developed in this study. In the SRV experiment, the duration of attrition for the coating and the abrasive parameter has shown that SUP-HF behaves better than SUP-F. The SUP-HF also has better reaction to the anti-oxidize function. The hardness parameter (Hv) on the coating is 691 - 702. The adherence after compression has a grade of A-class on the SEM chart. There is no significant difference on overall parameters for both specimens. The results have shown that, the SUP-HF blades performed excellently to the sandy-loam 45 ha and stone gravel soil 65 ha plowing; by replacement of 168 tiller blades at the basis of same abrasives. The plowing capacity sandy and stone of SUP-HF is 2. 6 larger than SUP-H. Respectively the iron residues remained in the soil is less than 24, 360 g and 24, 347 g. The efficiency of the SUP-HF blades is undoubtedly confirmed. 本研究針對台灣廣泛使用的迴轉犁所配置耕耘刀及開墾刀建立耕耘土壤的力學模式，結果顯示：為發揮良好的耕耘性能及其均一耕耘抵抗，預防草桿纏繞現象，最佳切入角之理論與計算值得知為 88. 58 º、 85. 10 º 及最佳耕起角為 55. 00 º、 56. 18 º，兩者結果均符合文獻數據。為使刀背不與土壤摩擦，能順利切削翻轉及拋擲土壤，由耕耘軌跡極座標曲線得知，耕耘刀間隙角 25 º時，翻轉及拋擲效果較強；開墾刀間隙角 10 º時，刃端耕土突入衝擊力最小，耕作土壤時破碎作用力最小，且在不同耕土移動的加速度對應於不同型式的間隙角，所得之極座標軌跡曲線圖均相符合，這驗證台灣廠商所開發的耕耘刀適用於台灣耕地環境。考慮耐磨耗性造成田間整地作業成本過高，應用鎳基合金粉末噴銲系統之技術檢驗噴銲機構之作業性能，經紅外線熱像儀檢測結果：在相同測溫點，熱像儀所擷取噴銲瞬間熱影像及經八秒表面散發出之溫度值均與國外學者所研究之結論相符合；同時當測試六組耕耘刀時，其熱輻射影像相對應點溫度約略相同且皆呈現均勻分佈。因此，可證實使用所研發之合金粉末噴銲機構鍍層時確能達到耕耘刀噴銲鍍層表面溫度的均勻性、精密性與穩定性。其次，鎳基合金鍍層的磨耗特性，經往覆式滑移磨耗試驗機(SRV) 磨耗實驗結果顯示：鍍層耐磨耗性及摩擦係數的表現均以底材鍍層+熱處理(SUP-HF) 為佳，且鎳基合金抗氧化性良好，鍍層的硬度值(Hv) 維持於 691 - 702 之間，另由掃描式電子顯微鏡(SEM) 圖得知，壓痕附著性由均在A等級。田間試驗結果顯示：每台車在相同的磨耗下，耕作於砂質土壤 45 公頃與石礫土壤 65 公頃後，總共更換 168 支耕耘刀(SUP-HF有 42 支，底材+熱處理(SUP-H) 有 126 支) ，其耕作量經SUP-HF之耕耘刀，多於SUP-H者均有 2. 6 倍，且存留於兩類土壤中的鐵質分別少於 24, 360 公克及 24, 347 公克，在效率上來說，應該值得肯定。目 錄 謝誌 [...] I 摘要 [...] .

Practical element tests were conducted to evaluate basic features of this unique <b>coating.</b> Actual <b>blade</b> was <b>coated</b> to confirm coating condition for preparation of actual application...|$|R
40|$|Turbine blades, vacuum plasma spray {{coated with}} NiCrAlY, CoCrAlY or NiCrAlY/Cr 2 O 3, were {{evaluated}} and rated superior to standard space shuttle main engine (SSME) <b>coated</b> <b>blades.</b> Ratings were {{based primarily on}} 25 thermal cycles in the MSFC Burner Rig Tester, cycling between 1700 F (gaseous H 2) and - 423 F (liquid H 2). These tests showed no spalling on blades with improved vacuum plasma coatings, while standard blades spalled. Thermal barrier coatings of ZrO 2, while superior to standard coatings, lacked the overall performance desired. Fatigue and tensile specimens, machined from MAR-M- 246 (Hf) test bars identical to the blades were vacuum plasma spray coated, diffusion bond treated, and tested to qualify the vacuum plasma spray process for flight hardware testing and application. While NiCrAlY/Cr 2 O 3 offers significant improvement over standard coatings in durability and thermal protection, studies continue with an objective to develop coatings offering even greater improvements...|$|R
