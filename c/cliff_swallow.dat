5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow,</b> canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E

25|$|The Salmon Falls Creek {{watershed}} {{varies widely}} {{in terms of}} different habitats. Along the lower section of the creek, plentiful water flow and numerous springs create a rich riparian environment compared to an oasis, lined with coyote willow, dogwood, golden currant, cattail, mint and poison ivy. The upper section is a slow-moving waterway that supports a small wetland and extensive meadows. In contrast, {{the vast majority of}} the upper undeveloped watershed is a shrub-steppe sagebrush grassland, much of which is used for grazing. Many bird species use the Salmon Falls Creek canyon, including white-throated swift, canyon and rock wrens, <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow,</b> violet-green swallow, barn swallow, screech owl, long-eared owl, great horned owl, kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden eagles and prairie falcon. Mule deer also inhabit areas of the middle and upper Salmon Falls Creek basin.|$|E
2500|$|The American <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) is a {{migratory bird}} that spends its winters in Goya, Argentina but makes the [...] trek {{north to the}} warmer climes of the American Southwest in springtime. According to legend, the birds, who have visited the San Juan Capistrano area every summer for centuries, first took refuge at the Mission when an irate innkeeper began {{destroying}} their mud nests (the birds also frequent the Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo). The Mission's location near two rivers made it an ideal location for the swallows to nest, as there was a constant supply of the insects on which they feed, and the young birds are well-protected inside {{the ruins of the}} old stone church.|$|E

40|$|Episodes of food {{deprivation}} {{may change}} how nestling birds allocate {{energy to the}} growth of skeletal and feather morphological traits during development. <b>Cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) are colonial, insectivorous birds that regu­larly experience brief periods of severe weather–induced food deprivation during the nesting season which may affect offspring development. We investigated how annual variation in timing of rearing and weather were associated with length of wing and tail, skeletal traits, and body mass in juvenile <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> reared in southwestern Nebraska during 2001 – 2006. As predicted under conditions of food deprivation, nestling skeletal and feather measurements were generally smaller in cooler years. However, variability explained by weather was small, suggesting that morphometric traits of juvenile <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> were not highly sensitive to weather conditions experienced during this study. Measurements of juvenile morphological traits were positively correlated with measurements taken as adults, meaning that any variation among juveniles in response to rearing conditions showed evidence of persisting into a bird’s first breeding season. Our results show that body size in this species is phenotypically plastic and influ­enced, in part, by weather variables...|$|R

2500|$|The eggs of {{swallows}} {{tend to be}} white, {{although those}} of some mud-nesters are speckled. The average clutch size is around four to five eggs in temperate areas and two to three eggs in the tropics. The incubation duties are shared in some species, in others the eggs are incubated solely by the females. Amongst the species where the male helps with incubation the contribution varies amongst species, with some species like the <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> sharing the duties equally and the female {{doing most of the}} work in others. Amongst the barn swallows the male of the American subspecies helps (to a small extent) whereas the European subspecies does not. Even in species where the male does not incubate the eggs the male may sit on them when the female is away to reduce heat loss (this is different from incubation as that involves warming the eggs, not just stopping heat loss). Incubation stints last for 5–15 minutes and are followed by bursts of feeding activity. From laying, swallow eggs take between 10–21 days to hatch, with 14–18 days being more typical.|$|E

40|$|Ecologists {{often use}} mark-recapture to {{estimate}} demographic {{variables such as}} abundance, growth rate, or survival for samples of wild animal populations. A common assumption underlying mark-recapture is that all animals have an equal probability of detection, and failure to meet or correct for this assumption–as when certain members of the population are either easier or more difficult to capture than other animals–can lead to biased and inaccurate demographic estimates. We built within-year and among-years Cormack-Jolly-Seber recaptures-only models to identify causes of capture heterogeneity for a population of colonially nesting <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) caught using mist-netting {{as a part of}} a 20 - year mark-recapture study in southwestern Nebraska, U. S. A. Daily detection of <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> caught in stationary mist nets at their colony sites declined as the birds got older and as the frequency of netting at a site within a season increased. Experienced birds’ avoidance of the net could be countered by sudden disturbances that startled them into a net, such as when we dropped a net over the side of a bridge or flushed nesting <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> into a stationary net positioned at a colony entrance. Our results support the widely held, but seldom tested, belief that birds learn to avoid stationary mist nets over time, but also show that modifications of traditional field methods can reduce this source of recapture heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|Nestling <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallows</b> (Hirundo pyrrhonota) {{in southwestern}} Nebraska that were {{relatively}} heavily parasitized by hematophagous fleas (Ceratophyllus celsus) and swallow bugs (Oeciacus vicarius) dispersed to nonnatal colonies to breed the subsequent year, whereas nestlings that were relatively lightly parasitized {{returned to their}} natal colony to breed.

There were no sex differences in dispersal tendencies. Dispersing birds tended to move to smaller colonies to breed, and in some cases settled in breeding colonies later than nondispersers. Ectoparasitism may be a major cause of natal dispersal in <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallows</b> and perhaps should be considered another potential cause of dispersal in general, especially in group-living species that may be associated with large numbers of highly co-evolved ectoparasites...|$|R
40|$|While {{epidemiological}} {{models have}} suggested that the spread of parasitesand infectious diseases often depends critically on the extent of movement by infectedindividuals between populations, there is little empirical information for any organism onthe frequency of between-group parasite transmission or how it varies spatially.

We measured the introduction of parasitic bugs(Oeciacus vicarius) into colonies of <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallows</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) by transientbirds from outside each group. The transmission of bugs increased strongly as the size ofa nesting colony increased. More total transients visited the larger colonies, and the directionof change in transient numbers and the numbers of bugs introduced at a site from week toweek tended to vary together.
