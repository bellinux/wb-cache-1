50|$|A 2007 {{analysis}} of 1,016 systematic reviews from all 50 Cochrane Collaboration Review Groups found that 44% of the reviews <b>concluded</b> that the intervention {{was likely to}} be beneficial, 7% <b>concluded</b> that the intervention {{was likely to be}} harmful, and 49% <b>concluded</b> that evidence did not support either benefit or harm. 96% recommended further research.

A review of 145 alternative medicine Cochrane reviews using the 2004 database revealed that 38.4% <b>concluded</b> positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%) effect, 4.8% <b>concluded</b> no effect, 0.7% <b>concluded</b> harmful effect, and 56.6% <b>concluded</b> insufficient evidence.|$|R

An {{analysis of the}} conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed {{with one of the}} initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% <b>concluded</b> positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% <b>concluded</b> no effect, 0.7% <b>concluded</b> harmful effect, and 56.6% <b>concluded</b> insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% <b>concluded</b> positive or possibly positive effect, 20% <b>concluded</b> no effect, 8.1% <b>concluded</b> net harmful effects, and 21.3% <b>concluded</b> insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.|$|R
