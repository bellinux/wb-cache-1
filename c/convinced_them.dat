5|$|At dawn, Tanaka {{learned that}} the palace had been invaded. He went there and confronted the rebellious officers, berating them for acting {{contrary}} {{to the spirit of}} the Japanese army. He <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> to return to their barracks. By 08:00, the rebellion was entirely dismantled, having succeeded in holding the palace grounds for much of the night but failing to find the recordings.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} the brigades' {{scattered}} landing was that several small groups of men caused havoc among the Germans, ambushing men and vehicles. One lone sergeant arrived at brigade headquarters with eighty prisoners, having <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> that they were surrounded and should surrender. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion's 'B' Company, which had landed on the correct drop zone, ambushed a convoy of five trucks, killing twelve Germans, then assaulted a château, killing another thirty men before the surviving fifty surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E

5|$|On March 22, 1989, three Will Rogers Turnpike tollbooth attendants made a {{surprise}} appearance at a Tulsans Against Turnpikes {{press conference to}} offer support to the opposition movement, expressing dissatisfaction with working conditions while manning the turnpike. The three attendants also gave examples of firsthand experience with turnpike customers that had <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> that motorists were not as supportive of turnpikes as OTA executives believed. OTA responded to their employees' remarks by highlighting an Occupational Safety and Health Administration study that found that the toll gate that the three attendants worked at met all safety standards.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} tactics {{appeared}} to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month. Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancock's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat there, some talked of dropping English from the ticket, but he <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Fort Mohave {{began the process}} of military subjugation of the Mohave, and {{the next step was}} the establishment of reservations. In 1863, Charles Debrille Poston, the first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Arizona Territory, called a conference between the Chemehuevi and Irataba's faction of the Mohave, in which he <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> to form an alliance with the US against the Apache. The treaty was never ratified by the US Congress but formed an important step in establishing friendly relations between the Mohave and the US government following the military campaigns and the establishment of Fort Mohave.|$|E

5|$|When the French and Indian War {{began in}} 1754 {{as part of}} the Seven Years' War, Franklin {{recruited}} militias. During the war, the city attracted many refugees from the western frontier. When Pontiac's Rebellion occurred in 1763, refugees again fled into the city, including a group of Lenape hiding from other Native Americans, angry at their pacifism, and white frontiersmen. The Paxton Boys tried to follow them into Philadelphia for attacks, but was prevented by the city's militia and Franklin, who <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> to leave.|$|E
5|$|After news of {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached the Indies in early August 1945, {{followed}} by the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August, {{it was evident that}} Japanese control was weakening. Sudirman led a break out from the camp in Bogor. Although his fellow internees wanted to attack the Japanese soldiers, Sudirman <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> against it. After ordering the others to their hometowns, Sudirman made his way to Jakarta and met with President Sukarno, who asked him to lead resistance against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19August 1945. At the same time, Allied forces {{were in the process of}} retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands. The first British forces arrived on 8September 1945.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of clergy was {{severely}} limited, Soegijapranata roamed from church to church to attend to parishioners, actively preaching and serving as the de facto head of the Catholic Church in the country; this was in part to counteract rumours of his detention by the Japanese. He travelled by foot, bicycle, and carriage, as his car had been seized. He sent pastors to apostolic prefectures in Bandung, Surabaya, and Malang {{to deal with the}} lack of clergy there. Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to produce new pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector. He also granted native priests the authority to perform marriages. To calm the Catholic populace, he visited their homes and <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> that the streets were safe.|$|E

5|$|As {{the siege}} continued, {{supplies}} once again {{began to run}} out for the defending army, and Parliament identified the relief of Taunton as being a priority. On 28 April, they ordered Thomas Fairfax, the Commander in Chief of the recently established New Model Army, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before he could reach London, but Prince Rupert <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> instead to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel Ralph Weldon, while Fairfax led the rest north.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge rode into Abbeville, South Carolina on {{the morning}} of April 28. While there, Breckinridge and Brigadier General Basil W. Duke finally {{convinced}} Davis that further prosecution of the war was hopeless. Breckinridge was put in charge of the $150,000 in gold specie remaining in the Confederate treasury; traveling southward by rail toward Washington, Georgia, a group of soldiers in his military escort – unpaid for months – threatened to divide the gold among themselves before it could be captured by federal troops. Breckinridge <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> to abandon their scheme after paying them their wages from the treasury, but some of them refused to escort Breckinridge and the bullion any further. Breckinridge's party arrived in Washington on May 4 and, after paying out several requisitions from the treasury, deposited the rest in banks there. He also composed a letter to his remaining deputies in which he disbanded the War Department.|$|E
5|$|Late {{that night}} the generals held a council of war in which Floyd and Pillow {{expressed}} satisfaction with {{the events of the}} day, but Buckner <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for treason if captured by the North, sought Buckner's assurance that he would be given time to escape with some of his Virginia regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E

5|$|The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's {{suffrage}} activist from New York City, {{to investigate}} the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment in Waco, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. She found that almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event. She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them. Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed {{the challenge of the}} investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not to talk to outsiders. Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.|$|E
5|$|The Spartan {{council of}} Elders, the gerousia, {{suggested}} that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia, the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> that the women could assist in the city's defence. In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest, the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance. Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus, despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile. Pausanias, the Greek geographer, claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of the fall of the Junta of Seville arrived, the group headed by Castelli and Belgrano led the process leading to the May Revolution. Castelli and Saavedra were the most {{important}} leaders of the time, and first discarded Martín Rodríguez's plan to expel Cisneros in a coup d'état. After several discussions, they decided to request an open cabildo, an emergency popular assembly. Castelli and Belgrano negotiated with the senior alcalde and nobleman, Juan de Lezica, and the procurator, Julián de Leiva. Although they <b>convinced</b> <b>them,</b> they still needed the permission of Cisneros himself, for which Castelli and Rodriguez went to his office at the Fort of Buenos Aires. Previously, Cornelio Saavedra had denied Cisneros the support of the Regiment of Patricians, on the premise that with the disappearance of the Junta of Seville—who had appointed him as viceroy—he no longer had the right to hold that position.|$|E

5|$|Who's That Girl: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is {{the first}} soundtrack album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records to promote the film of the same name. It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, Coati Mundi and Michael Davidson. The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album, despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album. After the commercial success of her film Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled Slammer, about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused of homicide. However, due to the critical and commercial failure of her adventure film Shanghai Surprise (1986), Warner Bros. were initially reluctant to green light the project, but later agreed, after Madonna <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> and also {{because they wanted to}} cash in on Madonna's success with soundtracks.|$|E
5|$|According to Baer, {{after the}} initial holiday season Magnavox {{considered}} dropping the console, but the modest continuing demand the following year <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> to manufacture an additional 27,000 units for the 1973 holiday season, selling 20,000 of them. The console was also released in 12 other countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela, with different games. The international release was focused in the United Kingdom, with some non-English versions not released until 1974. Late in 1973, Magnavox ran a large advertising campaign for all of their 1974 products, with the result being that they sold 129,000 Odyssey units in 1974, or 150,000 according to Baer. Magnavox discontinued the console after 1975; according to Baer it sold 350,000 units in total worldwide, though statements by Fritsche indicate {{it may have been}} higher. The light gun peripheral sold 20,000 units. As the Odyssey was discontinued Magnavox released the first successive dedicated consoles—consoles that could only play games built into the system—in the Magnavox Odyssey series, the Odyssey 100 and Odyssey 200, as part of the first generation of video game consoles; the Odyssey 100 was only capable of playing the ping pong and hockey games from the original Odyssey. Eleven dedicated Odyssey consoles were produced before a true follow-up console in 1978, the Magnavox Odyssey².|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} closed in May 2006, Lasseter {{revealed}} that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade {{at the opening}} of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information {{to the board of directors}} at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.|$|E
