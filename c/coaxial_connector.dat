50|$|Integrated {{electronic}} piezoelectric (IEPE) accelerometers are a {{class of}} piezoelectric accelerometers that incorporate an electronic amplifier and use a single two-pole <b>coaxial</b> <b>connector</b> for both power input and signal output. The devices are also known by proprietary names such as integrated circuit piezoelectric sensor (ICP). Compared with earlier sensor interface systems requiring a charge-sensitive preamplifier external to the sensor, {{the use of a}} single <b>coaxial</b> <b>connector</b> with integrated electronics gives IEPE devices their main advantages: small size, light weight, robustness and low cabling costs.

50|$|The APC-7 {{connector}} (also {{referred to}} as a 7 mm connector) is a precision <b>coaxial</b> <b>connector</b> used on laboratory microwave test equipment for frequencies up to 18 GHz. APC-7 connectors are advantageous because they have a low-reflection coefficient, make repeatable coaxial connections, and are genderless. The connectors are expensive, so they are seldom used outside the laboratory where their cost can be justified by their accuracy and convenience. Due to their high cost, their 18 GHz frequency limitation, and new laboratory practices, the connectors are now uncommon. Modern low frequency microwave equipment often uses the less expensive 3.5 mm (26.5 GHz) connector. Higher frequency equipment must use higher performance connectors such as the 2.92 mm (40 GHz), 2.4 mm (50 GHz), 1.85 mm (67 GHz), or 1.0 mm (110 GHz) connectors.|$|E

5000|$|Twelve {{systems were}} built between 1958 and 1962. The {{prototype}} at Eufaula, Alabama, was perched atop a steel lattice structure tower of shorter (but unconfirmed) height. Depending {{on the location}} {{it was to be}} deployed in operational production, the radar antenna (sail) itself was perched atop one of two different towers: a cast-in-place concrete tower or a metal-sided steel-framed tower both with equal dimensions of 84'6" [...] in height and side dimensions of 60'3" [...] square (63'3" [...] square when including the thickness of corner buttresses). This tower design was also used for the AN/FPS-35 frequency diverse SAGE search radar built by Sperry Corporation. The FPS-24 radar antenna sail rotated 5 revolutions per minute (a SAGE specification, but varied slightly depending on wind conditions) and was often the cause of microwave interference reported by nearby residents who could hear the radar signal in television and radio broadcasts. At some locations, the radar signal was [...] "blanked" [...] as it passed over television broadcast antenna sites such as Mt. Loma Prieta in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California. However, at DEFCON 3 or higher, the signal was ordered [...] "unblanked" [...] in all directions. The 7.5 Megawatt (maximum power) transmitter ran in normal operation at 5 Megawatt output pulse (nearly 20 microseconds in duration) and was conveyed from the transmitter to the antenna feed horn via a 9-inch diameter rigid <b>coaxial</b> <b>connector.</b> The feed horn consisted of a cross dipole antenna design for both A and B channels.|$|E
