40|$|Cooking induces many {{chemical}} and physical modifications in foods; among these the phytochemical content can change. Many authors have studied variations in vegetable nutrients after cooking, and great {{variability in the}} data has been reported. In this review more than 100 articles from indexed scientific journals were considered {{in order to assess}} the effect of cooking on different phytochemical classes. Changes in phytochemicals upon cooking may result from two opposite phenomena: (1) thermal degradation, which reduces their concentration, and (2) a matrix softening effect, which increases the extractability of phytochemicals, resulting in a higher concentration with respect to the raw material. The final effect of cooking on phytochemical concentration depends on the processing parameters, the structure of food matrix, and the chemical nature of the specific compound. Looking at the different cooking procedures it can be concluded that steaming will ensure better preservation/extraction yield of phenols and glucosinolates than do other cooking methods: steamed tissues are not in direct contact with the <b>cooking</b> <b>material</b> (water or oil) so leaching of soluble compounds into water is minimised and, at the same time, thermal degradation is limited. Carotenoids showed a different behaviour; a positive effect on extraction and the solubilisation of carotenes were reported after severe processing. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E
40|$|Background: Food based {{approaches}} {{are recognized as}} {{an essential part of}} an urgently needed more comprehensive strategy for improving nutrition by increasing the availability and consumption to combat iron and other micronutrient deficiencies. Aims & Objective: The specific objective of the study was utilization of Foxtail millet (Setariaitalica) along with other flour for production of micronutrients rich ready-to-eat snack products using homemade extrusion <b>cooking.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods: Methods Composite flour were prepared using processed Foxtail millet flour (FMF) and other processed flours namely; wheat flour (WF), and chick pea flour (CPF). Nutritional properties of the blends were analyzed by using standard procedure. Two homemade extruded products namely; namkeensev, seviyan were prepared with four treatments T 0, T 1, T 2, & T 3. The commonly consumed recipes were developed by incorporating 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of best result malted composite flour (FMF+CPF+WF). Results: The organoleptic qualities of these extruded samples were analyzed by panelists on a 9 point hedonic scale. The result indicate that the processed composite flour (FMF+CPF+WF) based products were significantly accepted at the level of p< 0. 05 50 % incorporation followed by 75 % and 100 % respectively. Conclusions: The present study conclude that, processed composite flour (Foxtail millet; wheat; chickpea) in the ratios of (50 : 50) could be used to produce nutritive quality of homemade extrudates with acceptable sensory properties as they deliver vehicles for malnourished children. </p...|$|E

40|$|By {{their very}} nature as {{transient}} properties, the hospitality industry brings {{a large number of}} people together in unfamiliar surroundings. In this report, data collected by the New Zealand Fire Service were used to identify the trends for hospitality industry fire experience. Overall, the hospitality industry stands not only for a high percentage of national economic development but also builds the reputation of New Zealand. A severe fire incident may cause job losses for an indefinite period of time, tradesmen and suppliers may lose a large and regular source of income, the town may lose one of its greatest assets and New Zealand's reputation might be damaged and tourism discouraged. Generally the number of fire incidents in the New Zealand hospitality industry has decreased since 1997. It was found that over the 15 years analysed, careless action was the most common cause, followed by suspicious, but these were not the most hazardous. The most hazardous fires were shown to be bedroom fires originating in soft furnishings. Almost all the fatal fire incidents could be associated with accommodation type properties, and most of them occurred at night-time when occupants were still asleep. Since the highest percentage of fire incidents occurred in wintertime, it was suspected that more frequent usage of heating appliances was the main cause. As opposed to fatal incidents, most incidents that lead to an injury originated in kitchens where the injured occupants were attempting to control the fire. Heat sources were mainly from cooking appliances with <b>cooking</b> <b>material</b> being ignited, and incidents mainly occurred at night-time but not during sleeping hours. Restaurant/Cafe/Diner as a subcategory of the hospitality industry stands out with the highest incidents with injury or incidents as a total. It is therefore essential to improve the current fire protection system of the hospitality industry. Fire detection and suppression systems are urged to be installed, as well as suitable law enforcement. Regular inspection and maintenance are also required together with public education, staff training, good housekeeping, and increased security. These would go far toward reducing the number of hospitality fire incidents and, consequently, the life hazards they involve...|$|E

Snails on the compounded feed were more palatable than those on natural and mixture of natural and compounded food. Meat colour was best in those fed natural food. Cooking loss was highest in those on the compounded food. Meat tenderness was the highest in those on natural food. It was concluded that snail meat is very rich in nutrients and if properly fed good compounded diets the meat value and the sensory properties, will be greatly enhanced. The low values in palatability, nutritive value and weight gain obtained in those on natural food might be an indication that it is not rich enough to meet the basic nutrient requirements of the animal.
