5000|$|Red's syntax and {{semantics}} {{are very}} close to those of Rebol. Like Rebol, it strongly supports metaprogramming and domain-specific languages (DSLs) and is therefore a highly efficient tool for dialecting. Red builds on a dialect called Red/System, which provides system programming facilities. Red is easy to embed ("Think Lua") and very lightweight (no more than a megabyte). It is also able to cross-compile to various platforms (see <b>Cross</b> <b>Compilation</b> section below) as well as creating packages (like [...]APK packages on Android) for some platforms (currently, Android is the only platform supported but development is still in process) via bridges intended for implementation of Red on the former (like the Java JVM, [...]NET, JavaScript etc).|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{variations}} of such compilers exist for different environments. For embedded systems, the code may instead be written to another computer, a technique known as <b>cross</b> <b>compilation,</b> over a serial port {{or even a}} single TTL bit, while keeping the word names and other non-executing parts of the dictionary in the original compiling computer. The minimum definitions for such a Forth compiler are the words that fetch and store a byte, and the word that commands a Forth word to be executed. Often the most time-consuming part of writing a remote port is constructing the initial program to implement fetch, store and execute, but many modern microprocessors have integrated debugging features (such as the Motorola CPU32) that eliminate this task.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a new web based data resource being developed {{to provide access}} to accurate and validated cross sections of low energy neutrino and antineutrino interactions. The proposed content of this database are outlined which cover total and differential cross from inclusive, quasi-elastic and exclusive pion production processes from charged and neutral current interactions. Efforts to obtain these data, which come mainly from old bubble chamber experiments, are described as well as the implementation of an embryonic web site to make the resource generally accessible. 1. PREAMBLE This talk will introduce a new and developing resource, namely a database of cross sections of low energy neutrino interactions. This is being constructed by the author in collaboration with those listed below. Several earlier talks at this conference have emphasised the importance of a good knowledge of the low energy neutrino cross sections, the vast majority of which come from bubble chamber experiments performed many years ago. In particular they are needed for Monte Carlo (MC) tuning and model development. It is very important when adjusting the parameters of a MC programme to fit new data, that agreement with older data sets is not lost. In the past comparisons with data have tended to be qualitative rather than rigorously quantitative. There have been many <b>cross</b> section <b>compilation</b> plots at various workshops [1] and there is a danger of data being transfered from plot to plot with the possibility of inaccuracies creeping in and the original sources of the data being lost.

50|$|This Forth use of {{metacompiler}} is disputed {{in mainstream}} computer science. See Forth (programming language) and History of compiler construction.

Metacompilers are a general compiler writing system. Besides the FORTH metacompiler concept being indistinguishable from self-hosting and extensible language. The actual process acts at a lower level defining a minimum subset of forth words, {{that can be used to}} define additional forth words, A full FORTH implementation can then be defined from the base set. This sounds like a bootstrap process. The problem is that almost ever general purpose language compiler also fits the FORTH metacompiler description.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Gas and Aerosol Measurement Sensor (GAMS) was {{deployed}} {{aboard the}} NASA DC- 8 aircraft {{during the second}} SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE II). GAMS acquired line-of-sight (LOS) direct solar irradiance spectra during the sunlit portions of ten science flights of the DC- 8 between 12 January and 4 February 2003. Differential line-of-sight (DLOS) optical depth spectra are produced from the GAMS raw solar irradiance spectra. Then, DLOS ozone number densities are retrieved from the GAMS spectra using a multiple linear regression spectral fitting technique. Both the DLOS optical depth spectra and retrieved ozone data are compared with coincident measurements from two other solar instruments aboard the DC- 8 platform to demonstrate the robustness and stability of the GAMS data. The GAMS ozone measurements are then utilized to evaluate {{the quality of the}} Wulf band ozone cross sections, a critical component of the SAGE III aerosol, water vapor, and temperature/pressure retrievals. Results suggest the ozone <b>cross</b> section <b>compilation</b> of Shettle and Anderson currently used operationally in SAGE III data processing may be in error by as much as 10 ? 20 % in the Wulf bands, and their lack of reported temperature dependence is a significant deficiency.

40|$|This volume, a {{collection}} of the papers presented at an Agricultural History Symposium held at Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University in May 1980, brings together the work of twenty-six discussants {{on a wide variety}} of topics designed to illumine the Southwest as 2 ̆ 2 a distinctive region, neither south nor west, but a cultural amalgam that is greater than the sum of its parts 2 ̆ 2 (p. 1). Like most symposia, the Texas sessions provided an assemblage of papers uneven in both the subjects covered and the quality of research. Major gaps in the survey of southwestern agriculture are evident in the absence of studies of the adjustment of the livestock industry to the introduction of deep-well drilling around 1900; the lack of any consideration of sheep raising; only brief comment upon the development of irrigation; still less reference to dry farming; and almost no attention to the westward shift of cotton, wheat, and citrus fruits, which the latter technologies made possible. While the Southwest was presumably defined to encompass Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, the concentration upon subjects relating to the last of these states is so pervasive that only a fifth of the papers ranges farther afield. Richard W. Etulain, speaking specifically of the 2 ̆ 2 diversity of [...] . locations and experiences 2 ̆ 2 represented in the literature (p. 30), points to the want of a sense of regional unity that characterizes this volume generally. Scholars will neglect, however, such <b>cross</b> disciplined <b>compilations</b> of regional study at some hazard. Harry Shafer 2 ̆ 7 s summation of his findings on the Classic Mimbres phase of prehistoric agriculture in New Mexico provides new interpretation, as do the pieces by B. Byron Price on the activities of Charles Goodnight and other ranchers during the Civil War; by Robert C. McMath, Jr., updating his own earlier research on the origins of the Farmers 2 ̆ 7 Alliance; and by James L. Forsythe, in exposition of Clinton P. Anderson 2 ̆ 7 s post-World War II agricultural policies. The adaptations from the recent publications by Manuel A. Machado, Jr. (The North Mexican Cattle Industry) and by William N. Stokes, Jr. (Oil Mill on the Texas Plains) also emphasize new material. The surveys of entrepreneurial history presented by Archie P. McDonald, on the 2 ̆ 2 Lone Star Brand 2 ̆ 2 of Texas Farm Products, and Ralph S. Newman, Jr., on the American Rice Company, although both clearly out of context in a volume on the Southwest, do bring significant innovational records to attention.
