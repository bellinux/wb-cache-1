5000|$|Polenta has {{a creamy}} texture {{due to the}} {{gelatinization}} of starch in the grain. However, its consistency may not be completely homogeneous if a coarse grind or hard grain such as flint corn is used. The variety of cereal used is usually yellow maize, but buckwheat, white maize, or mixtures thereof may be used. Coarse grinds make a firm, <b>coarse</b> polenta; <b>finer</b> <b>grinds</b> make a creamy, soft polenta. [...] Polenta is a staple of Northern Italian cuisine (and, to a lesser extent, a Central Italian one, e.g. Tuscany) and its consumption is traditionally associated with lower classes, as in times past cornmeal mush was an essential food in their everyday nutrition.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} <b>coarse</b> or <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> of three forms of corn {{on the performance of}} lactating cows. Six diets, fed as total mixed rations, were identical except for the corn portion of the diet. Corn treatments were dry shelled corn, high moisture ensiled ear corn, and high moisture ensiled shelled corn, either coarsely or finely ground. The experimental design was a 6 × 6 Latin square with 36 cows. Eighteen cows were assigned to the six different treatments and were fed once daily. Within this group of 18 cows, six had a ruminal cannula and were used to evaluate nutrient digestibilities and ruminal fermentation. The remaining 18 cows, six of which were ruminally cannulated, were similarly assigned, except they were fed twice daily. In the group fed once daily, milk production and composition were not affected by treatment. Starch digestibility was greater with the high moisture and with the finely ground corn treatments. In addition, the high moisture ensiled corn treatments had reduced ruminal ammonia concentrations. In the group that was fed twice daily, milk production and protein yield were greatest for the finely ground high moisture ensiled shelled corn treatment. Starch utilization was improved by <b>fine</b> <b>grinding.</b> Lower ruminal ammonia concentrations were obtained with the high moisture ensiled corn treatments, and there was a tendency for reduced ammonia concentration with <b>fine</b> <b>grinding.</b> Results indicate that high moisture ensiled corn as well as <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> improved nitrogen and starch utilization.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Tumbling mills {{are still}} the mostly used milling device in the mineral {{processing}} industry for both <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> applications. A number of factors affect the performance of tumbling mill. One of these factors is volumetric filling which is the volume of charge in the mill expressed as {{a fraction of the}} total volume available. The volumetric filling controls the mill throughput, power draw and product size. The common method of measuring volumetric filling is by taking in situ measurements when the mill is stationary. This method is disruptive to production due to the mill downtime involved. The use of on-line sensors for measuring the volumetric filling using acoustic, inductive proximity and conductive sensors are the new technologies attempting to monitor volumetric filling in situ. The methods are non-intrusive and low cost approach for direct monitoring of dynamic volumetric filling conditions in the tumbling mill. The dynamic volumetric filling was assumed to be directly related to static mill filling conditions. In this study, the volumetric filling was calculated from the toe and shoulder angles estimated by the CSIRO monitor (acoustic) and the Magotteaux Sensomag (inductive proximity and conductive) sensors. The CSIRO acoustic sensor was installed on a run-of-mine (RoM) ball mill at Angloplatinum UG 2 Concentrator at Rustenburg, South Africa. The toe and shoulder angles were obtained from the surface vibration caused by the impact of the charge on the mill shell. The industrial scale experiments were performed at varied mill feed rate at constant ball load of 28 %. In the pilot scale experiments, the Magotteaux ball mill at Frank Concentrator was equipped with a Sensomag sensor for measuring the toe and shoulder angles of the slurry and ball load based on the principle of conductance and induction, respectively. The mill was configured to operate as a RoM ball mill. The experiments were conducted at varying mill speeds (75 %- 85 % critical speed), feed rate (1200 - 2800 kg/hr) and ball loads (15 - 26 %). The static mill filling was determined from physical measurements after crash stopping the mill...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> is that problem {{connected}} with the reduction of a rock material to a size such that the valuable mineral it contains may be satisfactorily extracted. <b>Fine</b> <b>grinding</b> {{is perhaps the most}} significant process in any milling operation, and forms a commensurate percentage of the unit milling cost. There has been for many years a wide divergence of opinion as to what constitute best operating conditions in a grinding plant. This divergence of opinion was mainly {{due to a lack of}} suitable methods of measuring the true efficiency of <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> operations. The efficiency of a <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> or crushing operation is the ratio of the amount of useful crushing work done to the amount of work (power) applied to the crushing operation.

40|$|The mineral {{liberation size}} of {{run of mine}} ores has {{dramatically}} reduced over recent years. As a result, the demand for <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> {{which is the most}} energy-intensive form of grinding has markedly increased in the minerals industry. Furthermore, the <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> costs increase exponentially with decreasing product particle size. As a result of the increased energy requirement for <b>fine</b> <b>grinding,</b> it is desirable to optimise <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> processes such as stirred media milling (ie IsaMill) to enhance energy efficiency, throughput and the product fineness. In the present study, the influence of slurry rheology, grinding media type and grinding media-to-feed size ratio on energy efficiency in a pilotscale IsaMill was investigated under certain industrially relevant pulp processing conditions. It was shown that a critical rheological state existed, below which the energy required to achieve an 80 per cent passing (ie P 80) 20 μm product size was unaffected by shear rheology (ie apparent viscosity and shear yield stress) whilst above which the grinding energy required increased dramatically with increasing shear rheology. Colorado River sand (3. 35 mm) showed higher energy efficiency than MT 1 ceramic media (2. 5 mm) for a target P 80 of 20 μm in the solids concentration range of 38 to 55 per cent by weight, but the former experienced more than four times the wear rate of the later. The high wear rate of the Colorado River sand may be due to its much lower hardness. For feeds with an 80 per cent passing (ie F 80) 70 to 110 μm, 2. 0 or 2. 5 mm MT 1 media appeared to be more energy efficient than 3. 5 mm MT 1 media whilst a media-to-feed size ratio of 41 to 53 is applicable for ~ 50 μm (ie F 80) feeds for effi cient grinding...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMeasuring {{the action}} of energy on matter is a complex problem, {{especially}} in the case of granular materials.

We studied the appearance of free radicals during the grinding of a-lactose monohydrate by means of electron spin resonance (ESR).

Because forest woody detritus production and decay rates may partially depend on climatic conditions, the accumulation of <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris carbon stocks in forests may be correlated with climate. This study used a nationwide inventory of <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris in the United States to examine how these carbon stocks vary by climatic regions and variables. Results Mean <b>coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris forest carbon stocks vary by Köppen's climatic regions across the United States. The highest carbon stocks were found in regions with cool summers while the lowest carbon stocks were found in arid desert/steppes or temperate humid regions. <b>Coarse</b> and <b>fine</b> woody debris carbon stocks were found to be positively correlated with available moisture and negatively correlated with maximum temperature.
