2500|$|The {{calendar}} recognises {{two types}} of day: astronomical and civil. The mean Burmese astronomical day is from midnight to midnight, and represents 1/30th of a synodic month or 23 hours, 37 minutes and 28.08 seconds. The <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> comprises two halves, the first half beginning at sunrise and the second half at sunset. In practice, four points of the astronomical and <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> (sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight) were used as reference points. The <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> is divided into 8 baho ( [...] ) (3 hours) or 60 nayi ( [...] ) (24 minutes), each baho equalling 7.5 nayi. In the past, a gong ( [...] ) was struck every nayi while a drum ( [...] ) and a large bell ( [...] ) were struck to mark every baho.|$|E

50|$|Over shorter timescales, {{there are}} a variety of {{practices}} for defining when each day begins. In ordinary usage, the <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> is reckoned by the midnight epoch, that is, the <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> begins at midnight. But in older astronomical usage, it was usual, until 1 January 1925, to reckon by a noon epoch, 12 hours after the start of the <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> of the same denomination, so that the day began when the mean sun crossed the meridian at noon. This is still reflected in the definition of J2000, which started at noon, Terrestrial Time.|$|E

5000|$|The {{field of}} Jyotisha deals with ascertaining time, {{particularly}} forecasting auspicious day {{and time for}} Vedic rituals. The field of Vedanga structured time into Yuga which was a 5-year interval, divided into multiple lunisolar intervals such as 60 solar months, 61 savana months, 62 synodic months and 67 sidereal months. A Vedic Yuga had 1,860 tithis ( [...] , dates), and it defined a savana-day (<b>civil</b> <b>day)</b> from one sunrise to another.|$|E
5000|$|In many cultures, {{nights are}} {{named after the}} {{previous}} day. For example,"Friday night" [...] usually means the entire night between Friday and Saturday. This difference from the <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> often leads to confusion. Events starting at midnight are often announced as occurring the day before. TV-guides tend to list nightly programs at the previous day, although programming a VCR requires the strict logic of starting the new day at 00:00 (to further confuse the issue, VCRs set to the 12-hour clock notation will label this [...] "12:00 AM"). Expressions like [...] "today", [...] "yesterday" [...] and [...] "tomorrow" [...] become ambiguous during the night.

5000|$|For most diurnal animals, the day {{naturally}} {{begins at}} dawn and ends at sunset. Humans, with their cultural norms and scientific knowledge, have employed several different conceptions of the day's boundaries. The Jewish day begins at either sunset or nightfall (when three second-magnitude stars appear). Medieval Europe also followed this tradition, known as Florentine reckoning: in this system, a reference like [...] "two hours into the day" [...] meant two hours after sunset and thus times during the evening need to be shifted back one calendar day in modern reckoning. Days such as Christmas Eve, Halloween, and the Eve of Saint Agnes are remnants of the older pattern when holidays began during the prior evening. Common convention in modern times is for the <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> to begin at midnight, i.e. 00:00, and last a full 24 hours until 24:00 (i.e. 00:00 of the next day). Prior to 1926, Turkey had two time systems: Turkish (counting the hours from sunset) and French (counting the hours from midnight).|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} {{of what is}} now known as UTC time came about historically as an effort which first began as a collaboration between 41 nations, officially agreed to and signed at the International Meridian Conference, in Washington D.C. in 1884. At this conference, the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the [...] "universal day", counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight. This agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast astronomical GMT began at mean noon, i.e. astronomical day X began at noon of <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> X. The purpose of this was to keep one night's observations under one date. The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil) 1 January 1925. Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least until 1805 in the Royal Navy, but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich meridian was used for two - thirds of all charts and maps as their Prime Meridian.|$|E
5000|$|Just like months, the Hindu {{calendar}} has {{two measures}} of a day, {{one based on}} the lunar movement {{and the other on}} solar. The solar day or <b>civil</b> <b>day,</b> called divasa ( [...] दिवस), has been what most Hindus traditionally use, is easy and empirical to observe, by poor and rich, with or without a clock, and it is defined as the period from one sunrise to another. The lunar day is called tithi (तिथि), and this is based on complicated measures of lunar movement. A lunar day or tithi may, for example, begin {{in the middle of an}} afternoon and end next afternoon. Both these days do not directly correspond to a mathematical measure for a day such as equal 24 hours of a solar year, a fact that the Hindu calendar scholars knew, but the system of divasa was convenient for the general population. The tithi have been the basis for timing rituals and festivals, while divasa for everyday use. The Hindu calendars adjust the mismatch in divasa and tithi, using a methodology similar to the solar and lunar months.|$|E
50|$|In the Indian astronomical tradition, a Yuga is {{a period}} {{consisting}} of 1,577,917,500 <b>civil</b> <b>days.</b> Saturn makes 146,564 revolutions and Mars makes 229,6824 revolutions in a Yuga. So Saturn makes 146,564/1,577,917,500 = 36,641/394,479,375 revolutions in a day. By saying that the residue of the revolution of Saturn is x, what is meant is that the fractional number of revolutions is x/394,479,375. Similarly, Mars makes 229,6824/1,577,917,500 = 190,412/131,493,125 revolutions in a day. By saying that the residue of the revolution of Mars is y, what is meant is that the fractional number of revolutions is y/131,493,125.|$|R

5000|$|A {{day is a}} unit of time. In common usage, it {{is either}} an {{interval}} equal to 24 hours or daytime, the consecutive period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon. The period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation {{with respect to the}} Sun is called a solar day. Several definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need and convenience. In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth, and was designated the SI base unit of time. The unit of measurement [...] "day", redefined in 1960 as 86 400 SI seconds and symbolized d, is not an SI unit, but is accepted for use with SI. A <b>civil</b> <b>day</b> is usually 86 400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, [...] "On which day?" [...] The life patterns of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle (see circadian rhythms).|$|E
