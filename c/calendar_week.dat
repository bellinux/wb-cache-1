The phone was made available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in <b>calendar</b> <b>week</b> 28 {{of that year}} for a price of €679 (799CHF) which {{at that time was}} slightly higher than the MSRP of €649 for the single SIM version but some €100 higher than typical retail prices which had already begun to drop for the regular model. Other selected markets followed. In Germany the release was limited with only METRO-owned electronics store chains Media Markt and Saturn carrying the phone in small quantities. The only color option is [...] "Gunmetal Grey". The hardware is mostly identical to the regular model without the option to double the 16GB of on-device storage {{as is the case with}} the single SIM variant. Also, the radio supports less LTE-bands, most notably omitting band 20 which reduces LTE-usability in countries like Germany where providers prefer the 800MHz frequency outside of downtown areas. Both SIM-slots are of nano-size and the device retains the additional microSD-slot.|$|E
