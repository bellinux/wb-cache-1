5|$|Healthy {{ecosystems}} provide vital {{goods and}} services to humans and other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing ecosystem services and {{the first of these}} is environmental management. This direct approach is based largely on information gained from earth science, environmental science and <b>conservation</b> <b>biology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{ecosystems}} and environments {{are necessary to}} the survival of humans and other organisms. Ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentally-friendly chemical engineering, environmental resources management and environmental protection. Information is gained from green chemistry, earth science, environmental science and <b>conservation</b> <b>biology.</b> Ecological economics studies the fields of academic research that aim to address human economies and natural ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The shrub grows amongst {{scrubland}} in seasonally wet lowland {{areas of}} the coastal sandplain between Badgingarra and Serpentine in Western Australia. A little studied species, not much is known of its ecology or <b>conservation</b> <b>biology.</b> Reports do suggest, however, that it is pollinated {{by a variety of}} birds and small mammals. Like many members of series Abietinae, it has not been considered to have much horticultural potential and is rarely cultivated.|$|E

5|$|While the long-toed {{salamander}} {{is classified as}} least concern by the IUCN, many forms of land development negatively affect the salamander's habitat and have put new perspectives and priorities into its <b>conservation</b> <b>biology.</b> Conservation priorities focus at the population level of diversity, which is declining at rates ten times that of species extinction. Population level diversity is what provides ecosystem services, such as the keystone role that salamanders play in the soil ecosystems, including the nutrient cycling that supports wetland and forested ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} <b>conservation</b> <b>biology,</b> such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E
