Two years later a <b>communion</b> <b>bench</b> was installed. The tower was also given a clock and bells during this period; the clock was removed in 1978 since the machinery was broken. Lijden died in 1882, and the Jesuit Joannes de Vries became the parish priest, the first in an unbroken line of Jesuit pastors which continues until the present day. De Vries was soon after elected provincial superior for the province, and thus {{he spent much of}} his time away from the church. By 1885 there were 1,620 Catholics in Semarang, up from approximately a thousand four years earlier. Many of these were in the colonial military.|$|E

50|$|Built on {{the site}} of an earlier medieval chapel, it {{provided}} worship for the nearby Langley Hall, whose ruins are contained within a nearby private farm. The Chapel was built with wooden box pews, a musicians desk and <b>Communion</b> table <b>bench</b> seats. It has no known dedication.|$|R
50|$|The baroque {{building}} {{proved too}} small to accommodate the congregations of up to 1,500 coming to mass here (a first expansion project had already been designed by Louis Montoyer in 1789 shortly before the Revolution). Having for a moment thought of demolishing the chapel anew and rebuilding a church at Mont-Saint-Jean, the idea of expansion resurfaced and was felt to be an easier option, since the town had access to sufficient land to do so. After some time raising gifts and subsidies, the works were completed in 1823 and 1824. A brick hall with a slate roof extended the dome towards the back. Closed off towards the street, it then joined the choir. The masterpieces of church furniture - the pulpit and the massive sculpted-oak <b>communion</b> <b>benches</b> - were recovered from the abbey of the Blanches Dames at Aywier.|$|R
5000|$|A Grade II listed {{building}}, it {{was built}} in 1909-10 in the Early English style by two local building firms, Samuel Parsons (also the architect) and William F. Glover. The church, built on the site of an earlier chapel (c.1876), has the same appearance as the earlier chapel but {{with the addition of a}} two-stage octagonal crenelated tower with spire. At the base of the tower there is a two-light window. The gabled facade is of Bath stone with Plymouth limestone dressings. The gable ends are decorated with crocketed finials. The arch over the double doors, of the gabled porch, is inscribed [...] "United Methodist Church 1910". The porch, which has a two-light window above, is flanked by two-light windows under continuous hood moulds. The church and hall have shallow raking buttresses and slate roofs with decorative ridge tiles. The interior is in the form of a four-bay apsidal basilica with a serpentine-curve gallery over the entrance. The gallery has pierced decorative wooden panels and is supported on cast-iron columns with decorative capitals. The five-bay hammer-beam, ceiled and boarded, roof has pierced braces, green marble corbels and metal ties. Four roof trusses converge at the apsial end. The organ, with stencilled pipes, was built in 1887 and later enlarged. Two stained-glass windows, one each side of the organ, are said to have been removed from the Wesleyan chapel in Chapel Street, Holsworthy. Other windows are filled with pastel-coloured glass of an Art Nouveau style. Internal fittings include a pitch pine pulpit, <b>communion</b> table and <b>benches.</b> The interior of the church is rendered and the internal doors are part-glazed with coloured glass. The gable fronted hall has a two-light window over the gabled porch, which is flanked by two-light windows.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Communion</b> <b>bench</b> is an {{adaptation}} of the sanctuary guard or altar rail. Standing {{in front of this}} barrier, in a space called the chancel, or pectoral, the faithful were wont in early times to receive Holy Communion, the men taking the Consecrated Bread into their hands and the women receiving it on a white cloth, called the domenical, while deacons administered the Precious Blood which each took through a reed of gold or silver.|$|E
50|$|The Catholic Saint Cecilia’s Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Cäcilia) {{was built}} in 1739 by {{well-known}} Baroque architect Johann Balthasar Neumann by appointment from Countess Maria Theresia von Schönborn, and it was given its ceiling frescoes in 1741 by Christoph Thomas Scheffler. The sculptor Johann Wolfgang von der Auwera created the high altar. The Electoral Mainz court carpenter Franz Anton Herrmann made the pulpit, the choir stalls, the <b>Communion</b> <b>bench,</b> sacristy table and tabernacle table.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main part}} of the {{structure}} consists of two concrete membranes separated by a space of 6'11", forming a shell which constitutes the roof of the building. This roof, both insulating and watertight, is supported by short struts, which form part of a vertical surface of concrete covered with [...] "gunite" [...] and which, in addition, brace the walls of old Vosges stone provided by the former chapel which was destroyed by the bombings. These walls which are without buttresses follow, in plan, the curvilinear forms calculated to provide stability to this rough masonry. A space of several centimeters between the shell of the roof and the vertical envelope of the walls furnishes a significant entry for daylight. The floor of the chapel follows the natural slope of the hill down towards the altar. Certain parts, in particular those upon which the interior and exterior altars rest, are of beautiful white stone from Bourgogne, as are the altars themselves. The towers are constructed of stone masonry and are capped by cement domes. The vertical elements of the chapel are surfaced with mortar sprayed on with a cement gun and then white-washed — both on the interior and exterior. The concrete shell of the roof is left rough, just as it comes from the formwork. Watertightness is effected by a built-up roofing with an exterior cladding of aluminium. The interior walls are white; the ceiling grey; the bench of African wood created by Savina; the <b>communion</b> <b>bench</b> is of cast iron made by the foundries of the Lure.|$|E
