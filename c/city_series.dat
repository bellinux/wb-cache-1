5|$|Lavender's primary pitch was the spitball, and {{his method}} of {{preparation}} was to lick the ball. In a game on July19, Lavender was about to load the ball when he smelled a liniment on the ball. He reported this to the home plate umpire, who then ejected the Phillies manager, Red Dooin, from the game. Dooin had been caught doing this to another spitballer, Marty O'Toole, a few days earlier. On September26, Lavender and the Cubs were ahead 9–0in {{the top half of}} the ninth inning versus Cincinnati, when the Reds scored 10runs against Lavender and two other pitchers to take the lead 10–9. The Cubs ultimately prevailed and gained the victory by scoring two runs in the bottom half of the ninth. Lavender started just one more game in 1912, a 3–2victory on October5 against St. Louis. Following the season, the Cubs played a series of exhibition games with the Chicago White Sox of the American League called the <b>City</b> <b>Series.</b> Lavender started the first game against Ed Walsh, and the game ended after nine innings with a scoreless tie. Lavender gave six hits and Walsh just one. After the two teams played to a 12-inning tie two days later, Lavender pitched the Cubs to victory in game three. Two additional victories gave the Cubs a 3–0series lead, but the White Sox were able to win four straight games, twice defeating Lavender, including in the series finale. He completed his rookie season with his career-high 16victories, against 13losses, and a 3.04earned run average(ERA) in 251innings pitched.|$|E

25|$|The <b>City</b> <b>Series</b> was {{the name}} of a series of {{baseball}} games played between the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League and the Phillies that ran from 1903 through 1955. After the A's move to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955, the <b>City</b> <b>Series</b> rivalry came to an end. The teams have since faced each other in Interleague play (since its introduction in 1997) but the rivalry has effectively died in the intervening years since the A's left Philadelphia. In 2014, when the A's faced the Phillies in inter-league play at O.Co Coliseum, the Athletics didn't bother to mark the historical connection, {{going so far as to}} have a Connie Mack promotion the day before the series while the Texas Rangers were in Oakland.|$|E

25|$|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz {{has become}} an {{established}} part of multiple cultures, spreading from its early young American readership to becoming known throughout the world. It has been translated or adapted into well over fifty languages, at times being modified in local variations. For instance, in some abridged Indian editions, the Tin Woodman was replaced with a horse. In Russia, a translation by Alexander Melentyevich Volkov produced six books, The Wizard of the Emerald <b>City</b> <b>series,</b> which became progressively distanced from the Baum version, as Ellie and her dog Totoshka travel throughout the Magic Land. The 1939 film adaptation has become a classic of popular culture, shown annually on American television from 1959 to 1991 and then {{several times a year}} every year beginning in 1999. More recently, the story {{has become an}} American stage production with an all-black cast, set in the context of modern African-American culture.|$|E
500|$|Clareson also {{suggests}} that Unknown influenced the science fiction that appeared in Astounding after Unknown folded.

Clareson further proposes that Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, {{two of the most}} important and successful science fiction and fantasy magazines, were direct descendants of Unknown.|$|E

The Wachowskis' {{original}} director of photography resigned {{on the grounds that}} he could not do the film with the limited budget he had available, nor did he know anyone he believed could. Subsequently, cinematographer Bill Pope was hired, who knew [...] "a bunch of cheap guys". Pope became heavily involved in creating the visual noir style of the film. He and the Wachowskis drew from their love of comics and were influenced by Frank Miller's neo-noir Sin <b>City</b> <b>series</b> in particular. Pope's sound counterpart was sound director Dane Davis. One of his ideas was to give Corky a cat-like quality by making a [...] "swishing" [...] sound every time she walks past the camera in the scene where she and Violet plan the theft.|$|E

500|$|In early 1940, Farnsworth Wright was {{replaced}} {{as editor of}} Weird Tales by Dorothy McIlwraith, who also edited Short Stories. [...] McIlwraith had no particular expertise in the horror field and, although she was a competent editor, the Wright era is generally considered to have been Weird Tales heyday. With Wright's departure, Unknown quickly became the leading magazine in its small field. [...] Unknown acquired a stable of regular writers, {{many of whom were}} also appearing in Astounding, and all of whom were comfortable with the rigor that Campbell demanded even of a fantasy plot. [...] Frequent contributors included L. Ron Hubbard, Theodore Sturgeon, and L. Sprague de Camp, who, in collaboration with Fletcher Pratt, contributed three stories about a world where magic operates by logical rules. [...] The stories were later collected as part of Pratt and de Camp's [...] "Incompleat Enchanter" [...] series; John Clute has commented that the title of one of them, [...] "The Mathematics of Magic", is [...] "perfectly expressive of the terms under which magic found easy mention in Unknown". [...] Other stories still regarded as classics include [...] "They" [...] by Heinlein, [...] "Smoke Ghost" [...] by Fritz Leiber, along with several stories in Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series, and [...] "Trouble With Water" [...] by H.L. Gold. [...] Unknowns influence was far-reaching; according to Ashley, the magazine created the modern genre of fantasy, and science fiction scholar Thomas Clareson suggests that by destroying the genre boundaries between sf and fantasy it allowed stories such as Simak's <b>City</b> <b>series</b> to be written. [...] Clareson also proposes that Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, two of the most important and successful science fiction and fantasy magazines, were direct descendants of Unknown.|$|E
