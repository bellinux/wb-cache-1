5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> in hundreds of feet. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{interests}} {{have their own}} set of weather maps. One type of map shows where VFR (visual flight rules) are in effect and where IFR (instrument flight rules) are in effect. Weather depiction plots show <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> (level where {{at least half the}} sky is covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard for flying. Aviation-related maps also show areas of turbulence.|$|E
5|$|The 250-metre {{long and}} 35-metre tall {{building}} has nine floors, but {{the height of}} the ground floor varies (4.6–4.2 m). This variation is reflected in the roof line which looks taller at the wings than the spine. The volume of the building is 280,000 m³, constructed from 4,600tonnes of steel frame with brick infill and floors constructed of hollow blocks to provide over 55740 m² of usable office space". The façade is clad with 33,000 m² Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt Travertine marble, punctuated in bands of windows decreasing in height with each storey. Only at the corners are the glazed strips interrupted for emphasis. The top storey is lit from skylights rather than banded glazing and has a very low <b>ceiling</b> <b>height.</b> It forms a clear building conclusion. Until the 1950s, the building was the largest and most modern office building in Europe.|$|E

25|$|The Great Hall is {{the largest}} and most {{spectacular}} of the Royal Reception Rooms. The Hall is 40 metres long with a <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> of 10 metres, and a gallery runs {{all the way around the}} room. The Hall seats 400 guests and is used for banquets, state dinners and receptions.|$|E
25|$|Under Governor George Pataki the LIRR remodeled {{its lower}} level {{concourse}} of Penn Station between 1990 and 1994, increasing the <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> {{and making it}} less dreary, as well as opening two new entrance/exit corridors spanning various tracks and lengthening some platforms. The LIRR also added air conditioning, which {{was not in the}} original Penn Station.|$|E
25|$|Another room, {{designed}} by Michael Inchbald, where QE2s advanced interior design was demonstrated {{was the first}} class lounge, the Queen's Room on Quarter Deck. This space, in colours of white and tan, featured a lowered ceiling with large indirectly lit slots, which, despite reducing the <b>ceiling</b> <b>height,</b> created an impression of airy openness above {{to deal with the}} otherwise oppressive dimensions of the single storey room (c. 30m x 30m x 2.4m). In addition the structural columns were flared at the top to blend into the ceiling and to lose the visual indication of low <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> that straight columns would have given. (The Midships Lobby copied these features but without achieving the airiness.) Michael Inchbald repeated the flaring of the columns in the bases of his tables and leather shell chairs. The indirect lighting from above could be switched from a cool hue for summer to a warm hue for winter.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technical}} rooms, usually {{placed on}} the roof, have been inserted in strategic floors (so that the pool's underlying structure would not diminish <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights</b> on any inhabitable floors) {{in order to provide}} breath-taking terraces and views to the top-floor luxury penthouses.|$|R
25|$|The building's {{rehabilitation}} {{has been}} hampered {{by a number}} of structural problems, notably water damage and vandalism on some of the floors. However, many of the floors and hotel rooms have remained untouched since 2001. Ironically, the flat-slab structural system that was so innovative in the 1950s now limits <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> to 9 feet and adds challenges to any renovation. The building also contains a large amount of asbestos.|$|E
25|$|The Tesla Model X, first {{introduced}} in 2015, has double hinged gull-wing doors, called falcon-wing doors by Tesla. The Model X has several design considerations {{to make the}} doors more practical. Being double hinged allows them to open with less clearance (horizontal and vertical) than would otherwise be required. The vehicle also has sensors to determine <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> {{and the presence of}} potential obstacles and determines how the hinges will operate to open the doors and avoid the obstacles, if possible.|$|E
25|$|For the {{interior}} of the ship, Hapag-Lloyd decided to adapt a design previously used in cruiseferries such as Svea Corona of 1975 and Finnjet of 1977, with {{the interior}}s divided vertically. Cabins are located {{to the front of the}} ship, furthest away from engine noise, while public spaces and various storageswhere engine noise is not as big of an issue as in cabinsare located at the rear of the ship, above the engines. Most of the public spaces were built with higher than standard <b>ceiling</b> <b>height.</b>|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has been extensively renovated and adapted to include ground level speciality shops and a restaurant and bar on the top floor. Two of the shops {{on the ground floor}} have had mezzanine levels inserted. Otherwise original <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights</b> have been retained.|$|R
50|$|The {{design for}} the new {{building}} took those spaces, together with the study collections, conservation workshops and library {{as the basis of}} its overall layout. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights</b> of the new building were designed to accommodate the longest staff weapons in the collections, displayed vertically, and the principal lift to move the largest object.|$|R
50|$|North Hill Centre was {{originally}} {{built as a}} strip mall accompanied by a freestanding Simpson-Sears department store. In 1973 the mall underwent a major renovation, which added 20 more stores and enclosed the shopping area. The design featured a central corridor with irregularly sized columns and <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights,</b> presenting an inconsistent look to the storefronts in the mall.|$|R
25|$|The library {{aimed to}} provide open {{access to all}} its 900,000 volumes. No {{basement}} was possible because of the low level roads beneath the library and a tall book stack was deemed inappropriate because of the desire to keep {{the height of the}} building low, so it did not overwhelm the surrounding buildings. Storage of the volumes was on the same level as the reading areas: this dual function led to the low <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> of three metres. Space was created in the reference library by opening up sections of the floors into double height reading spaces. The furniture for the library was specified by the architects, with a preference for oak veneer book stacks and black linoleum floor covering.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} design for 834 {{called for a}} midblock 120 foot wide building, but it was asymmetrically extended southward during construction after a holdout corner mansion was acquired by the developer. [...] Because this happened with the steel frame of the building's structure already in place, the extra 30 feet of frontage would be allocated as a line of duplex apartments, so that the original developer blueprints remained more or less intact. All the apartments were designed with high ceilings, and several units have outdoor space. Apartments in the building have <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights</b> of 11 to 12 feet in the public rooms, while the bedroom floors have <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights</b> of 9 to 11 feet (9 feet in the duplexes and 10 to 11 feet in the simplexes). There are three maisonette apartments, units which have entrances from the street {{as well as from}} the building's interior lobby.|$|R
50|$|In 1898 {{the house}} passed to Henry Rogers, son of Henry Montague Rogers, later knighted and known as 'Sir Montague'. Still further enlargements {{were made to the}} house. His {{extension}} to the south-east was much grander and to a different scale altogether, considerably larger rooms with greater <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights,</b> as are evidenced in the lounge and bedrooms one, two and three.|$|R
5000|$|Conversion to {{its current}} use was {{undertaken}} in the mid 1990s [...] including the insertion of additional windows and raising {{the height of the}} top storey to satisfy current standards for <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights,</b> work undertaken by the engineering firm Abbey Pynford.

ThyssenKrupp provided the building's 30 gearless elevators, seven hydraulic elevators, and two escalators.|$|E
500|$|The upper gallery on {{the northwestern}} {{side of the}} church is {{accessed}} by a twelve-step wooden spiral staircase, and has an unfinished wooden floor. Four wooden pews have white-painted sides and unfinished seats and rails. The gallery's <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> is about [...] at its tallest and about [...] at its shortest, due to the sloping wooden floor. Two stained-glass windows, which cannot be opened, are along the northwest wall. A small closet, accessible through a wooden door with two parallel vertical panels and original latch hardware, is {{at the base of the}} staircase. The church's original plasterwork and a [...] vertically cut wooden board, suggesting half-timbering, are visible in the closet.|$|E
500|$|Leavesden Studios, a {{converted}} airplane factory, presented problems {{because of its}} relatively low ceilings. This was less of an issue for The Phantom Menace, in which set height was generally achieved by digital means. [...] "Our visual choices get channeled and violent," [...] Heinrichs elaborated, [...] "so {{you end up with}} liabilities that you tend to exploit as virtues. When you've got a certain <b>ceiling</b> <b>height,</b> and you're dealing with painted backings, you need to push atmosphere and diffusion." [...] This was particularly the case in several exteriors that were built on sound stages. [...] "We would mitigate the disadvantages by hiding lights with teasers and smoke." ...|$|E
50|$|With the {{elimination}} of ramps, driving lanes, pedestrians and the reduction in <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights,</b> the APS requires substantially less structural material than the multi-story parking garage. Many APS utilize a steel framework (some use thin concrete slabs) rather than the monolithic concrete design of the multi-story parking garage. These factors contribute to an overall volume reduction and further space savings for the APS.|$|R
50|$|In 1875, the Public Health Act was introduced. It {{required}} urban {{authorities to}} make byelaws for new streets, to ensure structural stability of houses and prevent fires, {{and to provide}} for the drainage of buildings and the provision of air space around buildings. Section 57 determined that all houses must be through houses - no more back-to-back housing. Three years later the Building Act of 1878 provided more detail with constructions, defining foundations, damp proof courses, thickness of walls, <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights,</b> space between dwellings, under floor ventilation, ventilation of rooms, size of windows. The Local Government Board, established in 1871, issued the first Model Bye-laws in 1877/78. Urban authorities either adopted them, or wrote their own versions adapted to local conditions. While local versions were frequently not so rigorous, they could be generous by modern standards as regards <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights.</b> The importance of the Act was that it defined building standards for the housing of the working class.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Singapore Expo building comprised six interconnected {{halls of}} 10,000 square metres each, with column free-spaces and <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights</b> {{of up to}} 16 metres.

An additional 40,000 square metres (four new halls) were completed in September 2005 and linked to the original building across Expo Drive via a sheltered walkway.|$|R
500|$|Textiles {{have been}} {{exported}} from the Peak {{for hundreds of}} years. Even {{as early as the}} 14th century, the area traded in unprocessed wool. There was a number of skilled hand spinners and weavers in the area. By the 1780s, inventors such as Richard Arkwright developed machinery to produce textiles more quickly and to a higher standard. The early mills were narrow and low in height, of light construction, powered by water wheels and containing small machines. Interior lighting was by daylight, and <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> was only [...] These Arkwright type mills are about [...] wide. The Peak District was the ideal location, with its rivers and humid atmosphere. The local pool of labour was quickly exhausted and the new mills such as Litton Mill and Cressbrook Mill in Millers Dale brought in children as young as four from the workhouses of London as apprentices.|$|E
500|$|An 1895 {{newspaper}} {{description of}} the furnishings of the mansion relates there are several hunting trophies displayed in the entrance hall.

Decorated in a deep maroon, steel engravings, drawings and old prints adorn the walls. It was furnished with antiques and an organ was the centrepiece. Some of the first floor rooms accessed from the gallery were a Ballroom and a Drawing Room. Three arches separated these two rooms and the side arches were fitted with mirrors. Silk damask in a light blue shade was the Ball Room wall covering while satin of a light green colour was used in the Drawing Room. Among the paintings displayed in the Dining Room were family portraits by Henry Raeburn and a painting by John Hoppner was in the Library.|$|E

The venue also features a cafeteria which can seat 200 people. For trade fairs, the venue offers , in addition to the VIP and lobby facilities. The same area can also be used for conferences, and the venue can be split up into section to create group rooms, theme rooms and banquet rooms.|$|E
50|$|This {{level was}} the main floor of activity, {{recognizable}} by the greater <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights</b> and two Doric columns that adorn it. From the description of Androuet du Cerceau, ceilings of this floor were quite remarkable, especially the enrayure-style box struts that are aligned diagonally with the room walls.
