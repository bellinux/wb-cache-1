This face otherwise reverses the main façade, with the addition of mezzanine windows.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 Raptor is a {{fifth-generation}} fighter that {{is considered}} fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the <b>canted</b> vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{trains are}} not running on {{equilibrium}} <b>cants</b> at curves. The situation is called unbalance, {{which can be}} {{in one of the}} two following ways. For a given speed, if the actual <b>cant</b> is less than the equilibrium <b>cant,</b> the amount of <b>cant</b> difference is called <b>cant</b> deficiency. In the other word, it is the amount of missing <b>cant</b> to achieve the balance. On the contrary, for a given speed, if the actual <b>cant</b> is higher than the equilibrium <b>cant,</b> the amount of over <b>cant</b> from the balance is called <b>cant</b> excess.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cant</b> {{gradient}} is {{the amount}} by which <b>cant</b> is increased or decreased in a given length of track. The change in <b>cant</b> is {{required in order to}} connect a tangent track (no <b>cant)</b> to a curved track (with <b>cant)</b> through a transition curve. The rate of change of <b>cant</b> is used to determine the suitable <b>cant</b> gradient for a given design speed. Track twist may also be used to describe <b>cant</b> gradient which may be expressed in percentage of <b>cant</b> change per length unit. However, in the UK, the term track twist is normally used in the context of <b>cant</b> gradient with higher values which are considered to be faults.|$|R

5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering <b>canted</b> tail rotor assembly.|$|E
5|$|Ragusa Ibla, {{the lower}} city, boasts an {{impressive}} array of Baroque architecture, which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters <b>canted</b> against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820.|$|E
5|$|The upper tier is {{contoured}} {{to leave}} open {{space in the}} corners of the ground, and the roof is significantly <b>canted</b> inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible. The stadium gives an illusion that supporters in the upper tier {{on one side of the}} ground are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite. As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate HDTV streaming. In the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.|$|E

40|$|The interannual to decadal {{variability}} in the transport of anthropogenic CO 2 (<b>Cant)</b> across the subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) is investigated, using summer data of the FOUREX and OVIDE high-resolution transoceanic sections, from Greenland to Portugal, occupied six times from 1997 to 2010. The transport of <b>Cant</b> across this section, T <b>cant</b> hereafter, is northward, with a mean value of 254 ± 29 kmol s − 1 over the 1997 – 2010 period. We find that T <b>cant</b> undergoes interannual variability, masking any trend different from 0 for this period. In {{order to understand the}} mechanisms controlling the variability of T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA, we propose a new method that quantifies the transport of <b>Cant</b> caused by the diapycnal and isopycnal circulation. The diapycnal component yields a large northward transport of <b>Cant</b> (400 ± 29 kmol s − 1) that is partially compensated by a southward transport of <b>Cant</b> caused by the isopycnal component (− 171 ± 11 kmol s − 1), mainly localized in the Irminger Sea. Most importantly, the diapycnal component is found to be the main driver of the variability of T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA. Both the Meridional Overturning Circulation (computed in density coordinates, MOC σ) and the <b>Cant</b> increase in the water column have an important effect on the variability of the diapycnal component and of T <b>cant</b> itself. Based on this analysis, we propose a simplified estimator for the variability of T <b>cant</b> based on the intensity of the MOC σ and on the difference of <b>Cant</b> between the upper and lower limb of the MOC σ (ΔCant). This estimator shows a good consistency with the diapycnal component of T <b>cant,</b> and help to disentangle the effect of the variability of both the circulation and the <b>Cant</b> increase on the T <b>cant</b> variability. We find that ΔCant keeps increasing over the past decade, and it is very likely that the continuous <b>Cant</b> increase in the water masses will cause an increase in T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA at long timescale. Nevertheless, at the timescale analyzed here (1997 – 2010), the MOC σ controls the T <b>cant</b> variability, blurring any T <b>cant</b> trend. Extrapolating the observed ΔCant increase rate and considering the predicted slow-down of 25 % of the MOC σ, T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA is expected to increase by 430 kmol s − 1 during the 21 st century. Consequently, an increase in the storage rate of <b>Cant</b> in the SPNA could be envisaged...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{identified}} the calcium-activated nucleotidase 1 (<b>CANT</b> 1) transcript as up-regulated in prostate cancer. Now, we studied <b>CANT</b> 1 protein expression {{in a large}} cohort of nearly 1000 prostatic tissue samples including normal tissue, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), primary carcinomas, metastases, and castrate-resistant carcinomas, and further investigated its functional relevance. <b>CANT</b> 1 displayed predominantly a Golgi-type immunoreactivity with additional and variable cytoplasmic staining. In comparison to normal tissues, the staining intensity was significantly increased in PIN lesions and cancer. In cancer, high <b>CANT</b> 1 levels were associated with a better prognosis, and castrate-resistant carcinomas commonly showed lower <b>CANT</b> 1 levels than primary carcinomas. The functional role of <b>CANT</b> 1 was investigated using RNA interference in two prostate cancer cell lines with abundant endogenous <b>CANT</b> 1 protein. On <b>CANT</b> 1 knockdown, a significantly diminished cell number and DNA synthesis rate, a cell cycle arrest in G 1 phase, and a strong decrease of cell transmigration rate and wound healing capacity of <b>CANT</b> 1 knockdown cells was found. However, on forced <b>CANT</b> 1 overexpression, cell proliferation and migration remained unchanged. In summary, <b>CANT</b> 1 is commonly overexpressed {{in the vast majority}} of primary prostate carcinomas and in the precursor lesion PIN and may represent a novel prognostic biomarker. Moreover, this is the first study to demonstrate a functional involvement of <b>CANT</b> 1 in tumor biology...|$|R
5|$|Nothing survives of the {{original}} buildings, La Oriole and the smaller St Martin's Hall in the south-east; both were demolished before the quadrangle {{was built in the}} artisan mannerist style during the 17th century. The south and west ranges and the gate tower were built around 1620 to 1622; the north and east ranges and the chapel buildings date from 1637 to 1642. The façade of the east range forms a classical E shape comprising the college chapel, hall and undercroft. The exterior and interior of the ranges are topped by an alternating pattern of decorative gables. The gate house has a Perpendicular portal and <b>canted</b> Gothic oriel windows, with fan vaulting in the entrance. The room above has a particularly fine plaster ceiling and chimney piece of stucco caryatids and panelling interlaced with studded bands sprouting into large flowers.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{designed}} by Sir Charles Barry, shortly before he designed the Palace of Westminster. It was constructed between 1837 and 1839 out of sandstone, with a slate roof. It is in English neogothic style. The building has seven narrow bays, with buttresses and a lancet in each bay. The west end has a giant moulded archway, with an arched doorway at the ground floor with a window above. On the east end there is a rose window. The corners are square, with pinnacles. The inside of the chapel had galleries on three sides, and a ribbed, vaulted ceiling. The attached two-storey Sunday School {{is in the same}} style as the chapel, and has a triple-gabled north side, with large arched windows on the first floor. It also has a <b>canted</b> apse on the west end, and a lean-to porch. The building was listed on 3 October 1974, and is currently classed as Grade II*.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} two gate lodges; both are listed at grade II. The {{northern}} lodge at Slaughter Hill is by Blore and dates from 1847. In red brick with darker-brick diapering, stone dressings and a slate roof, {{it has a}} T-shaped plan with a single storey, and is Jacobean in style. It features two shaped gables, each decorated with a panel carved with Crewe Estate emblems, and a hexagonal central bay with a pyramidal roof which forms a porch. The Elizabethan-style Weston or Golden Gates Lodge {{to the south of}} the house dates from before 1865 and is attributed to William Eden Nesfield, although it is not typical of his style. In red brick with blue-brick zig–zag diapering, ashlar dressings and a slate roof, the lodge has two storeys, with a projecting <b>canted</b> bay to the road face. The driveway face has an ashlar panel with a shield bearing the Crewe family coat of arms.|$|E
50|$|Thieves' <b>cant</b> or Rogues' <b>cant</b> was {{a secret}} {{language}} (a <b>cant</b> or cryptolect) which was formerly used by thieves, beggars and hustlers of various kinds in Great Britain {{and to a lesser}} extent in other English-speaking countries.

5|$|The south (front) face of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around the arched main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by fluted Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters flanking a three-light window, all surmounted by a large cartouche decorated with strapwork. On {{the first floor of}} the central bay is a triple-mullion window, and above the parapet is a coat of arms. Flanking the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have <b>canted,</b> triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the parapet by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of this face are double transomed.|$|E
5|$|The western {{half of the}} {{building}} is stepped forward (southwards) by two bays from the original building. Originally the service wing, it is plainer than the eastern building and dates from the Georgian era. Though using Georgian proportions, {{it was built in}} an early Jacobean revival style which has been heightened by subsequent alterations, particularly the addition of a central gable. The main part of the south (front) face has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet running along the entire façade at eaves level. In the centre of the five east bays is a <b>canted</b> bay window beneath a shaped gable; the flanking bays have single-mullion, double-transomed windows. The two west bays are set backwards and have a central oriel window on the first floor with two single-mullion, double-transomed windows on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: <b>canted</b> and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front.|$|E

5|$|Constructed to Cubitt's own designs, the new mansion had a {{very similar}} style to that of Osborne House. Cubitt's {{attention}} to detail was such that he even manufactured his own bricks at a brickworks he {{set up for the}} purpose, using lime extracted from the chalk quarries on {{the eastern edge of the}} estate. Almost one hundred rooms made up the Italianate structure's three storeys, stretching across nine bays in a square formation. Cubitt contrived his own form of soundproofing by concealing seashells between levels. The flat roof was edged with a parapet embellished with balustrades, and a matching decoration was incorporated round the first floor, both made from Portland stone. Gibbs surrounds were used on the windows on the ground floor whereas triangular pediments featured on the windows included on the three central <b>canted</b> bays of the first floor. Segmented pediments adorned all the remaining windows. The water supply was provided by the well installed by Tyers, which was close to the southeast corner of the new mansion, via a corridor that spanned the entire outside of the mansion. The entrance had an attached porte-cochère enabling visitors to gain undercover access to the outer hall directly from their transport.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cathedral's {{fittings}} {{and monuments}} {{are hundreds of}} years old. The brass lectern in the Lady Chapel dates from 1661 and has a moulded stand and foliate crest. In the north transept chapel is a 17th-century oak screen with columns, formerly used in cow stalls, with artisan Ionic capitals and cornice, set forward over the chest tomb of John Godelee. There is a bound oak chest from the 14th century, which was used to store the chapter seal and key documents. The bishop's throne dates from 1340, and has a panelled, <b>canted</b> front and stone doorway, and a deep nodding cusped ogee canopy above it, with three-stepped statue niches and pinnacles. The throne was restored by Anthony Salvin around 1850. Opposite the throne is a 19th-century octagonal pulpit on a coved base with panelled sides, and steps up from the north aisle. The round font in the south transept is from the former Saxon cathedral and has an arcade of round-headed arches, on a round plinth. The font cover was made in 1635 and is decorated with the heads of putti. The Chapel of St Martin is a memorial to every Somerset man who fell in World War I.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey façade to Viaduct Road is E-shaped and regular, with a {{symmetrical}} seven-bay plan. The {{first and}} seventh bays project further forward than the centre (fourth) bay, which is formed by an elevated entrance porch. This has lancet {{windows on the}} sides, grouped under single hood moulds and with a string course. The doorway is under a segmental arch which is topped by a gable. The rest of the ground floor has larger lancets arranged in pairs and with a small trefoil above. The south-facing walls have two pairs together, while on the inward-facing walls {{of the first and}} seventh bays there are two sets of paired windows placed some distance apart. At first-floor level, similar paired lancets and trefoils rise as gabled dormers above the roofline. The south walls of the first and seventh bays have prominent five-light oriel windows, <b>canted</b> to form a 1–3–1 pattern of trefoil-headed panes. These oriel windows are supported on ornate corbels. Above these at first-floor level, and also above the entrance porch, there are three-light trefoil-headed windows set under a segmental arch-shaped hood mould. Many of the windows on the south side have plate tracery.|$|E

40|$|Heliostat <b>canting</b> (alignment of mirror facets) {{is known}} to have a major {{influence}} on the optical efficiency of heliostat fields and therefore on the power output of solar tower plants. In recent years several <b>canting</b> concepts were used, mainly on- and off-axis <b>canting.</b> Several new <b>canting</b> concepts, like stretched-parabolic or target aligned <b>canting,</b> were proposed in order to improve the performance of heliostats. As solar power plants become economically more attractive, knowledge about the influence of <b>canting</b> becomes more important. In this contribution, the influence of several factors on the <b>canting</b> method is discussed and optimal <b>canting</b> strategies are described. The considered factors comprise plant power level, heliostat position in the field, heliostat area, receiver dimension and site latitude. It is concluded that the target aligned tracking method is superior to all other variants in the majority of cases. As for the standard azimuth-elevation tracking methods, no one of these exhibits a clear advantage. It is only the on-axis method that performs worst in all cases. ...|$|R
