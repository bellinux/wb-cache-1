The variety known as [...] "Pudava and Kavani" [...] (veshti and upper cloth with pure zeri) still remains as a prestigious bridal gift in marriages. The designs with zeri or <b>coloured</b> <b>yarn,</b> using the age-old technique still has unparallel appeal which can attract even the most sophisticated customers.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} in France of the Jacquard loom {{in about}} 1803, enabled complicated patterned cloths to be woven, by using punched cards {{to determine which}} threads of <b>coloured</b> <b>yarn</b> should appear on the upper side of the cloth. The jacquard allowed individual control of each warp thread, row by row without repeating, so very complex patterns were suddenly feasible. Samples exist showing calligraphy, and woven copies of engravings. Jacquards could be attached to handlooms or powerlooms.|$|E
50|$|Nishijin-ori (Nishijin fabric) is a {{traditional}} textile produced in the Nishijin (西陣) district of Kamigyō-ku in Kyoto, Japan. Nishijin weaving originated in Heian-kyōto, Japan, over 1200 years ago. It uses {{many different types of}} <b>coloured</b> <b>yarns,</b> weaving them together into decorative designs. Nishijin employs very tedious and specialized procedures necessary to obtain the spectacular design, thus ensuring the quality of Nishijin weaving.|$|R
50|$|Textile {{manufacturing}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} human activities. The oldest known textiles date back to about 5000 B.C. In order to make textiles, the first requirement is a source of fibre from which a yarn can be made, primarily by spinning. The yarn is processed by knitting or weaving to create cloth. The machine used for weaving is the loom. Cloth is finished by what are described as wet processes to become fabric. The fabric may be dyed, printed or decorated by embroidering with <b>coloured</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
40|$|A project {{aimed at}} the 3 D {{simulation}} of textile yarns from technical specifications was begun in 1993 and attracted support from both industry and research councils to enable {{the formation of a}} multi-national team of researchers to come together in the UK. Considerable progress has been made particularly in the simulation of knitting yarn and plain knit fabric. In recent times the team has tackled the problem of simulating mixture <b>coloured</b> <b>yarns</b> sometimes called melange. This has necessitated a more complicated model of yarn structure based on queuing theory which is outlined {{at the end of the}} paper. References are provided for readers who wish to learn more of the various theories and models that have been used throughout the course of this project...|$|R
50|$|Mats are {{generally}} rectangular and vary in design between provinces. They {{are made from}} the Pandanus plant, a saltwater marsh plant also found throughout the Pacific and South East Asia. The leaves are boiled, pounded with a heavy wooden mallet and then dried and rolled into bundles. They are then woven into mats of varying design. The colours are normally an earthy beige and black or brown with dyes used from the mangrove tree, though now, some modern materials are used such as <b>coloured</b> <b>yarn</b> to make frilled edges. The exchanging of mats has been common practice in all forms of Fijian ceremony from ancient times.|$|E
40|$|The {{effluents}} from dyeing industries {{make the}} environment unaesthetic, contaminate groundwater and hence will cause ill effects on {{health of the}} inhabitants. The removal of colour from wastewater is often {{more important than the}} removal of other organic colourless chemicals because of aesthetic and environmental concerns. Dye production, textile preparation, dyeing and finishing plants are currently being forced to treat their effluents at least partially prior to discharge into treatment plants because of the high organic load, strong and resistant colour as well as high dissolved solids content of the discharged wastewater. The dyeing industries of Maruthamunai, considered in this project, too are not exceptional. The owners of the dyeing industries had either no idea of wastewater treatment or didn't want to invest on wastewater treatment. As a result, they were under pressure from the Kalmunai MC, Public Health Inspector (PHI), neighbours and the recreational users of the beach. Some of the owners were at the verge of closing the industry, which would have resulted losing jobs for them as well as their employees. Also, the local (handloom) textile industry too would have suffered without raw material (<b>coloured</b> <b>yarn)</b> for their products. In this study, we tried to remove or reduce the colour intensity of the effluent, at low cost and with simple efforts. Effluents were collected from a couple of dyeing plants of Maruthamunai, which were subjected to analysis for various physico-chemical parameters. Trials were carried out to remove/reduce the colour (dye particles) from the coloured effluents by various filtration, adsorption and coagulation methods on different materials, such as lime (powder and aq. solution), burnt charcoal from the industry itself and sand that are freely available in the area of study. The majority of the compounds found in wastewaters generated from a dyeing industry were derivatives of phenol, aniline and benzene, along with organic acids. Some of the identified compounds were chlorinated derivatives, resulting from the chlorination treatment (bleaching) carried out by some industries. The laboratory studies revealed that the colour reduction by different materials was 3. 1 % with charcoal (burnt firewood obtained from the industry), 39. 8 % with sand and 55. 1 %with filter paper. Whereas the field studies indicated, the reduction of the colour intensity by sand was lower (around 30 %). The COD reduction was also promising; it was 26. 3 % with charcoal (burnt firewood), 40. 2 % with sand and 47. 90 / 0 with filter paper. The field studies indicated the reduction of the COD values by around 29 %. A combination of different methods can be considered that would reduce the wastewater loading and the treatment cost...|$|E
50|$|A {{greater variety}} of colour was often {{provided}} by tying on the onion skin with different <b>coloured</b> woollen <b>yarn.</b> In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, from a dialectal form of Middle English pasche. They were usually eaten after an egg-jarping (egg tapping) competition.|$|R
50|$|Preparing {{the fiber}} was an {{extensive}} process that involved cleaning and teasing the fiber, spinning the yarn and plying it, dyeing the <b>coloured</b> <b>yarns,</b> and lastly weaving. Creating the yarn {{was done with}} a shank which is usually 2-3 ft. long and holds the stone or preferably whalebone whorl. The spindle is rotated by striking the lower side of the whorl with the right hand, while {{the upper end of}} the shank is held between the thumb and forefinger of the other hand, and the lower end rests on the ground. Using the spindle the two strands of yarn are twisted round each other into a single thread. Goat hair was always spun “s” meaning that the whorl would be turned counterclockwise in spinning. As goat hair was always made into two-ply yarn, the doubled yarn would have been spun by attaching two lengths of single -ply “s” spun yarn and then turning the whorl clockwise in a “l” twist.|$|R
5000|$|Marius Barbeau {{was very}} {{interested}} in ceinture fléchée trying to find its origin. He did not, but left many clues to learn more of its presence, popularity if not its origin. E.Z. Massicotte, archivist at Montreal City Hall and folklorist, continued Barbeau's research and concluded: [...] "la ceinture fléchée un chef d’œuvre de l’industrie domestique du Canada". Yet no such type of diagonal weaving is known elsewhere in the world, let alone in France. It seems that Native Americans were quick to improve their techniques upon the discovery of brightly <b>coloured</b> <b>yarns</b> {{that they did not have}} access to previous to contact, and often took apart fabrics to reuse the yarn for sashes, and a photo of an example is shown in Burnham's book. Since 1968 many persons learned to hand weave ceintures fléchées though not all kept weaving sashes, many taught the craft and are spreading its knowledge. [...] Many popular singers, folklore dancers and especially Bonhomme Carnaval are contributing to make it known to visitors and in various countries.|$|R

50|$|Red inclusions, {{found in}} some blankets, are made of wool fabric and were used by the Salish weavers {{in the last quarter}} of the 1800s. Strips were torn from {{imported}} blankets or other materials and used in weaving. It is likely that the introduction of these foreign materials into the weaving was based on colour; strips of richly dyed fabric are common in the later plain or solid style Salish blankets while brightly <b>coloured</b> commercial <b>yarns</b> are included in many of the decorative blankets. In most cases the introduced fabric strips and yarns use colours not available through native plant or mineral dyes.|$|R
50|$|Men shear {{sheep in}} spring and autumn, while women collect dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. The weaving is {{undertaken}} during winter by the female members of the extended family, girls learning from their mothers and grandmothers and wives assisting their mothers-in-law. The carpet is made on horizontal or vertical looms using multi-coloured wool, cotton or silk <b>yarn</b> <b>coloured</b> with natural dyes. Applying special techniques to create pile carpets, weavers knot the pile yarn around threads of the warp; pile-less carpets are variously made with interlacing structural warps, wefts, and patterning wefts. The cutting of a finished carpet from the loom is an unusually solemn celebration.|$|R
40|$|In Roman Egypt papyrologists and archaeologists {{sometimes}} seem {{to inhabit}} two different, if parallel, worlds, each apparently {{unaware of the}} treasures {{to be found in}} the other. This paper, however, is a co-operative venture between an ancient historian with papyrological interests – Kerstin Droß-Krüpe – and an archaeologist – John Peter Wild. In the research field of textiles we overlap, and we want to offer you insights from each of our worlds. At some point in the later 2 nd century AD an unnamed magnate in the territory of the Lingones in central Gaul dictated a will in which he stipulated that a number of his prized possessions should be cremated with him on his funeral pyre. Among those listed are vestes polymitae et plumariae. What do these two textile terms mean? And what did the textiles themselves look like? The images in Figures 1 and 2 are our provisional suggestions. The two items shown here are of wool – they are actually from Roman Egypt – and at first glance they look in decorative terms rather similar to one another; 4 but the textile in Figure 1 is in taqueté – vestis polymita, we argue – mechanically woven – while the piece in Figure 2 is in tapestry weave, vestis plumaria, and hand-woven. The structures of the two weaves can be characterised as follows: Tapestry weave, made famous by the Gobelin workshops in Paris, is essentially a mosaic in <b>coloured</b> wool <b>yarns,</b> constructed free-hand, and concealing the underlying warp. The weaver has available on individual spools a selection of dyed yarns which he or she interlaces with the warp threads according to the requirements of the pattern. A distinctive feature of tapestry is the oblique lines or even vertical slits where weft yarns in different colours meet one another and turn back (Fig. 3). Across an area, an accomplished weaver can achieve the subtle, gradual, changes in colour visible in the highest-quality floor and wall-mosaics and in wall painting. Taqueté, also known as ‘weft-faced compound tabby’ and in German Leinwandschusskompositbildung, aims for a similar decorative effect, but rarely in more than two colours. It is created mechanically by means of a complex planned sequence of different sheds on the loom, which the weaver memorises. The overall decorative scheme is constructed by repeating a single pattern unit, sometime in mirror image. The weave structure can be recognised by the fact that a weft thread in one colour disappears to the reverse side of the cloth behind an adjacent thread in a different colour as the pattern changes, only to re-appear on the obverse again later when it is required (Fig. 4). A variety of ancient sources can be deployed to inform discussion and argument about textile structure and terminology. Roman inscriptions and papyri in Greek and Latin are crucial documents, but tend to be laconic: both the writer and the reader knew exactly what was meant by a given technical expression, but we are left in the dark. Authors of classical literature write at greater length, and at first sight more helpfully; but their reliability is variable and often difficult to check. Poets, for example, treat of technical matters with artistic licence, especially when the vocabulary does not fit the metre. Scholars who consult another much-quoted source, the late Roman and early medieval encyclopaedists and glossators like Hesychius and Isidore, are well advised to exercise caution: for such compilers may simply be guessing. Ancient art, particularly funerary art, is a rich source of textile images, but, taken alone, the latter usually lack the necessary detail for precise technical identification. Surviving archaeological textiles are a relatively new and growing resource, and one might expect to find examples of vestis polymita and plumaria somewhere in the extant textile corpus. Both techniques are described explicitly as woven-in, and not decoration added afterwards, so that narrows the range of possibilities...|$|R
