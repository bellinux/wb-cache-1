25|$|A <b>countersink</b> is a conical hole {{cut into}} a {{manufactured}} object; a <b>countersink</b> bit (sometimes called simply <b>countersink)</b> is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A <b>countersink</b> may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.|$|E
25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a <b>countersink.</b> The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Thrilling is {{the process}} of {{threading}} and drilling (accomplished in the reverse order) internal threads using a specialized cutting tool on a CNC mill. The cutting tool tip is shaped like a drill or center-cutting endmill, while the body has a thread-shaped form with a <b>countersink</b> cutter form near the shank. The cutter first plunges to drill the hole. Then the thread is circularly interpolated just like the multiple-form cutter described above. This tool drills, chamfers, and threads a hole all in one compact cycle. The advantage is this process eliminates a tool, tool-holder, and tool change. The disadvantage is that the process is limited to hole depth no greater than three times the diameter of the tool.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the study and {{comparison}} of stress intensity factor solutions for cracks emanating from <b>countersunk</b> holes in a plate subjected to remote tension and bending moments. To explore {{the difference in the}} crack behavior at a straight-shank and <b>countersunk</b> rivet hole, models of holes with different shapes at various ratios of <b>countersunk</b> depth to plate thickness were generated, in which there were two extreme cases of <b>countersunk</b> holes: knife edge hole and straight-shank hole. The stress intensity factor solutions for cracks at the <b>countersunk</b> holes were predicted using the FEM-BEM alternating technique. The FEM-BEM alternating method, which is described in this paper, was verified by carrying out a study of the stress intensity factor for a crack at a straight-shank hole. A range of crack shapes and sizes under remote tension and bending moments were analyzed. The results from the crack analyses revealed that the crack behavior is considerably different at the <b>countersunk</b> holes with different <b>countersunk</b> depths.

40|$|Abstract—An {{investigation}} into the effect of <b>countersunk</b> depth, plate thickness, <b>countersunk</b> angle and plate width on the stress concentration around <b>countersunk</b> hole is carried out {{with the help of}} finite element analysis. The variation of stress concentration with respect to these parameters is studied for three types of loading viz. uniformly distributed load, uniformly varying load and functionally distributed load. The results of the finite element analysis are interpreted and some conclusions are drawn. The distribution of stress concentration around <b>countersunk</b> hole in isotropic plates simply supported at all the edges is found similar and is independent of loading. The maximum stress concentration also occurs at a particular point irrespective of the loading conditions...|$|R

40|$|Single-lap, carbon-epoxy joints with <b>countersunk</b> {{fasteners}} were modelled {{using the}} nonlinear finite element code Abaqus. A highly-detailed {{analysis of the}} stress distribution at the <b>countersunk</b> hole boundary is provided. Bolt-hole clearance, which arises due to limitations in manufacturing capabilities, is modelled extensively. Clearance levels {{both inside and outside}} typical aerospace fitting tolerances are studied and the finite element model is validated with experimental data. Plots of radial stress in each ply of the <b>countersunk</b> laminate show the load transfer to be severely localised, with only a few plies bearing the majority of the load. The inclusion of clearance in the model was shown to result in far higher radial stresses compared to those in the neat-fit joint model. An associated loss in joint stiffness of more than 10 % was recorded for the highest clearance considered (240 mu m). Finally compressive through-thickness stresses are shown to be present at the damageable region of the <b>countersunk</b> hole, and increase with bolt-hole clearance. These compressive stresses, which are an indicator of lateral constraint, are seen to suppress "brooming" failure in the <b>countersunk</b> laminate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the bolt clampup force relaxation behavior in <b>countersunk,</b> single-lap bolted joints between glass/vinylester resin laminates and steel panels. Additionally, the effect of bolt clampup force relaxation on the bearing strength of such joints was studied. Specially-instrumented bolts were used to measure clampup force relaxation in ten <b>countersunk</b> joint specimens. A 100, 000 pound capacity MTS testing machine {{was used to evaluate}} the bearing strength in tension of sixteen <b>countersunk</b> bolted joint specimens torqued to four different levels of initial torque, as well as four similar protruding-head bolted joint specimens (at the same levels of torque). The results of the relaxation experiments indicate that clampup force varies widely in nominally identical joints at identical torque levels, by as much as a factor of two. In <b>countersunk</b> bolt joints with sufficiently high initial clampup force, the clampup force relaxed in accordance with the inverse power equation proposed by Shivakumar and Crews for protruding-head bolt joints in graphite/epoxy laminates. Relaxation in the present experiments proceeded faster than in the protruding-head joints studied by Shivakumar and Crews; this {{is believed to have been}} due to the relative lack of constraint provided at the GRP surface by the <b>countersunk</b> bolt. The results from the bearing strength experiments suggest that clampup force has only a small beneficial effect on bearing strength in both <b>countersunk</b> and protruding head single-lap joints, when compared to double-lap joints. The reduced effectiveness of clampup force in increasing the bearing strength is believed to be a result of the increased joint rotation and bolt bending inherent in single-lap joints. These phenomena lead to delamination and brooming failure in the GRP, which can be avoided in double lap joints with sufficient bolt clampup force. The <b>countersunk</b> joints failed at a load approximately 20 % lower than the protruding head joints. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in the frictional resistance of a surface caused {{by the presence of}} rivet heads was determined by towing four planing surfaces of the same dimensions. One surface was smooth and represented a surface without rivet heads or one with perfectly flush <b>countersunk</b> rivets. The other three surfaces were each fitted with the same number of full-size rivet heads but of a different type arranged in the same pattern on each surface. The surfaces were towed at speeds representative of the high water speeds encountered by seaplanes during take-off and the range of Reynolds Number covered by the test was from 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 18 x 10 (exp 6). The rivet heads investigated were oval <b>countersunk,</b> brazier, and round for rivets having shanks 5 / 32 inch in diameter. The oval <b>countersunk</b> heads were sunk below the surface by dimpling the plating around them. The results of the tests showed that, for the rivet heads investigated, the {{increase in}} the friction coefficient of the surface is directly proportional to the height of the rivet head. The order of merit in regard to low resistance is flush <b>countersunk,</b> oval <b>countersunk</b> (whether sunk below the surface or not), brazier, and round...|$|R
5000|$|A back <b>countersink,</b> {{also known}} as an {{inserted}} <b>countersink,</b> is a two piece <b>countersink</b> used on tough to reach areas. One component is a rod that is inserted into the existing hole in the workpieces; the other component is the cutter, which {{is attached to the}} rod, or extends out of it, after it is in position. This is comparable to other types of [...] "back-" [...] machining, such as back-spotfacing, back-boring, back-counterboring, back-milling, and back-deburring. The common theme is accomplishing machining operations {{on the far side of}} the workpiece from the spindle face, which obviates a [...] "second operation" [...] setup. This reduces setup time and frustration in several ways. Not only does it obviate the flipping over, cleaning, reclamping, etc., but it also can allow effortless high concentricity, parallelism, and squareness with the first setup's datum without the hassle of reestablishing it on another setup (via indicating painstakingly).|$|E

50|$|A <b>countersink</b> (symbol: ⌵) is a conical hole {{cut into}} a {{manufactured}} object, or the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} countersunk bolt or screw, when placed in the hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material (by comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a socket-head capscrew). A <b>countersink</b> may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation thereby improving the finish of the product and removing any hazardous sharp edges.|$|E

50|$|The fluted <b>countersink</b> cutter is used {{to provide}} a heavy chamfer in the {{entrance}} to a drilled hole. This may be required to allow the correct seating for a countersunk-head screw or to provide the lead in for a second machining operation such as tapping. <b>Countersink</b> cutters are manufactured with six common angles, which are 60°, 82°, 90°, 100°, 110°, or 120°, with the two most common of those being 82° and 90°. Countersunk-head screws that follow the Unified Thread Standard very often have an 82° angle, and screws that follow the ISO standard very often have a 90° angle. Throughout the aerospace industry, countersunk fasteners typically have an angle of 100°.|$|E

50|$|Good chatter-free {{results can}} usually be had by {{countersinking}} by hand (as opposed to running the tool in a powered spindle). The slow speed and sensitive feed tend to prevent chatter.

5000|$|Small (c. 1/4" [...] diameter) {{threaded}} {{drill bits}} and countersinks {{are common in}} aircraft metal work. Threaded drill bits may be held in drills meant to reach into very tight spaces, and threaded <b>countersink</b> cutters are widely used (along with finely adjustable depth stops) to create holes which put a matching rivet directly flush with the surface.|$|E
50|$|It {{can often}} be {{difficult}} to avoid chatter (also known as machining vibrations) when cutting with <b>countersink</b> cutters. As usual in machining, the shorter and more rigid the setup, the better. Better-quality fluted <b>countersink</b> cutters sometimes have the flutes (or at least one flute) at an irregular pitching. This variation in pitching reduces the chance of the cutting edges setting up a harmonic action and leaving an undulated surface. This surface ripple is also dependent on the surface speed of the cutting edges, material type, and applied pressure (or feed rate); once started {{it is hard to}} remove. Too light a feed tends to increase chatter risk. As in many other machining operations, an appropriate response to the chatter may be to decrease speed and increase feed. On a drill press, the slowest available spindle speed is usually best. With a variable-speed handheld power drill, the trigger is best squeezed lightly to yield a low spindle speed.|$|E
