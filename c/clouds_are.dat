5|$|Night clouds or noctilucent <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> tenuous cloud-like {{phenomena}} {{in the upper}} atmosphere. They are made of ice crystals and are only visible in a deep twilight. Noctilucent roughly means night shining in Latin. They are most commonly observed in the summer months at latitudes between 50° and 70° {{north and south of}} the equator. These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and when the Sun is below the horizon for the observer, but while the <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> still in sunlight.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also likely}} that the Hills <b>cloud</b> <b>is</b> the largest {{concentration}} of comets across the Solar System.

5|$|Noctilucent <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> {{known to}} exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour {{is not well}} understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
5|$|They may {{be studied}} from the ground, from space, and {{directly}} by sounding rocket. Also, some noctilucent <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> made of smaller crystals, 30nm or less, which are invisible to observers {{on the ground}} {{because they do not}} scatter enough light.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus Spissatus <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> {{the highest}} clouds {{of the main}} cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower stratosphere. They are dense and opaque, not allowing {{the light of the}} sun or moon to pass through. They are more common on the anvils of cumulonimbus clouds.|$|E

5|$|Cirrus clouds form {{on other}} planets, {{including}} Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and possibly Neptune. They {{have even been}} seen on Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Some of these extraterrestrial cirrus <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> composed of ammonia or methane ice rather than water ice. The term cirrus is also used for certain interstellar clouds composed of sub-micrometer-sized dust grains.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> often {{precursors}} {{of other}} types of cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
5|$|Night clouds or noctilucent <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> {{composed}} of tiny crystals of water ice up to 100nm {{in diameter and}} exist at a height of about , higher than any other clouds in Earth's atmosphere. Clouds in the Earth's lower atmosphere form when water collects on particles, but mesospheric clouds may form directly from water vapour in addition to forming on dust particles.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
50|$|In cloud nomenclature, any funnel- or inverted-funnel-shaped cloud {{depending}} from cumulus or cumulonimbus <b>clouds</b> <b>is</b> technically {{described as}} an accessory feature called tuba.

5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> similar, {{except that}} they have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E

5|$|In meteorology, {{the trade}} winds {{act as the}} {{steering}} flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic, Pacific, and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America, Southeast Asia, and Madagascar and eastern Africa, respectively. Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea, as well as portions of southeastern North America. Shallow cumulus <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> seen within trade wind regimes, and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion, which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge. The weaker the trade winds become, the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> {{located in the}} tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E
5|$|On Jupiter, cirrus <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> {{composed}} of ammonia. When Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt disappeared, one hypothesis {{put forward by}} Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA's Cassini probe detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn's moon Titan. Cirrus clouds {{composed of}} methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the Great Dark Spot. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E
