This thesis investigates various techniques for forecasting {{the volume of}} containerizable cargo that flows into the <b>container</b> <b>stuffing</b> station at the Military Ocean Terminal, Bay Area, Oakland, California. Cargo input data is analyzed in terms of weekly cargo volume inputs for a selected number of major ports of debarkation. The time-series data for these ports is first tested for serial correlation. Based on the affirmative results of the serial correlation test, the following forecasting methods are investigated: the moving average, the exponentially weighted average, the exponentially weighted average with trend adjustment and the exponentially weighted average with an adaptive response rate. By means of statistical testing procedures, the "best" forecasting method is determined. [URL] United States Coast Guar...|$|E

This research used method of primary and secondary collecting data. While, techniques of collecting data are with internship observation (interview) to staffs of CV Nova Furniture Boyolali. The result of {{this research}} can be concluded that {{the implementation of the}} Cargo Shipment on the process of outdoor furniture to Denmark in CV Nova Furniture Boyolali in starting of the sales contract, booking container, the process of stuffing, trucking, shipment, documents negotiation and retrieval of goods. The parties that involved are exporters, banks, customs and tax, Department of Industry and Trade, freight forwarder, ship freight forwarding, surveyor, shipping companies and documents that involved are the approval of exports of goods, invoice, packing list, bill of lading, Certificate of Origin, and permits uploading of goods. The obstacles that encountered in Cargo shipment process is changing of the schedule, delay and leakage of the truck come on container. Suggestion that is proposed to CV Nova Furniture Boyolali is to increase of consistency of delivering of goods so that the goods arrive of the destination on time. Then, to reducing the risk of damage to be borne by company during the trip, the company should use insurance services. In addition, cooperation between CV Nova Furniture Boyolali and Freight Forwarder should remain intact so that the cooperation between buyers becomes better.

One way to achieve that goal is to optimize the charging <b>container</b> <b>stuffing</b> is made effective and efficient. Rakabu Furniture {{is a company that}} has made exports. To learn the steps in the optimization firms charging container, conducted this study in order to know the process of stuffing the effective and efficient in the preparation of goods into the container. Research method is qualitative descriptive source of practical internship for two months in Rakabu Furniture. To further described and conclusions drawn to describe the conditions of research objects obtained through data collection from interviews, data collection, and study the literature related to these activities. The data used are primary data and secondary data. The results obtained are include the importance of an effective process for stuffing Rakabu Furniture is reduced damage to goods, trucking costs, and improve corporate profitability. Company stuffing process with three main activities: the activities before, processes, and after stuffing. Companies doing optimization filling containers with a few steps to calculate the ratio of container volume with the volume of goods and arrange items by considering the ratio between the size of the container with the size of its foreign goods into account the requirements of a good stuffing. In the above explanation stuffing process efficient and effective optimization filling containers can be concluded that the comparison with the volume of container volume of goods and attention to good stuffing requirements are important in decisions about stuffing method is applied to the company.

40|$|Current customs {{applications}} are declaration based {{to support the}} various customs procedures based on (inter) national laws and regulations. To {{be able to perform}} a proper supply chain risk analysis, customs requires to have all data in supply chains. The current declaration procedures are not sufficient since they do not supported retrieval of <b>containers</b> <b>stuffing</b> information resulting in the fact that authorities do not have a complete data set. It has been shown that enterprises already have a lot of data available to meet their customer requirements that can be made directly accessible to authorities, instead of 'pushing' data to the authorities based on procedures. By not only making this data available to customs but also to other authorities, they also comply with Single Window implementations. There are various solutions to data retrieval, e. g. a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) offers a potential solution. The proposed approach in this paper is based on Linked Open Data (LOD) and implies innovative IT to be implemented by both authorities and enterprises in supply chains. The paper discusses LOD and its application to supply chain risk analysis. The proposed solution allows authorities to govern global supply chains in supply networks...|$|R

30|$|Developing {{energy-efficient}} MAC protocols for lightweight wireless {{systems has}} been a challenging task for decades because of the specific requirements of various applications and the varying environments in which wireless systems are deployed. Many MAC protocols for wireless networks have been proposed, often custom-made for a specific application. It is clear that one MAC does not fit all the requirements. So, how should a MAC layer deal with an application that has several modes (each with different requirements) or with the deployment of another application during the lifetime of the system? Especially in a mobile wireless system, like Smart Monitoring of Containers, we cannot know in advance the application state (empty <b>container</b> versus <b>stuffed</b> <b>container).</b> Dynamic switching between different energy-efficient MAC strategies is needed. Our architecture, called PluralisMAC, contains a generic multi-MAC framework and a generic neighbour monitoring and filtering framework. To validate the real-world feasibility of our architecture, we have implemented it in TinyOS and have done experiments on the TMote Sky nodes in the w-iLab.t testbed. Experimental results show that dynamic switching between MAC strategies is possible with minimal receive chain overhead, while meeting the various application requirements (reliability and low-energy consumption).|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} phases of nuclear research, {{scintillation}} counters proved valuable for detection of alpha particles. In this technique, as perfected by Rutherford and his co-workers, scintillations {{produced by the}} excitation of fluorescent and phosphorescent screens were observed visually. The method has been revived in modern form, principally by Kallman, {{with the use of}} photomultiplier tubes for the observation of light pulses, and large, transparent crystals for the conversion of as much of the energy of a penetrating particle into light as possible. A wide range of fluorescent materials has been tested by various workers. On the basis of reported efficiency and response time, the work at this laboratory was initiated using naphthalene. The first experimental arrangement consisted of a 1 P 21 P. M. tube mounted in a glass <b>container</b> <b>stuffed</b> with moth flakes and immersed in liquid air as shown in. With radium gamma ray source, a ratio of about 20 was observed between the counting rate of this set-up as compared with that of the photomultiplier surface alone exposed to the gamma radiation under otherwise identical conditions. As a consequence of the sensitivity (about 10 per cent gamma counting efficiency) of even this crude and inelegant device, as well as of its very simplicity, a program was undertaken with the aim of devising a rugged and adaptable basic counter unit. This program received added impetus when it was discovered that the much greater usable light output of anthracene made possible the elimination of the refrigerant. With respect to pulse width, it will be seen that the fortuitous condition exists whereby the minimum, independently observed pulse width coincides with the maximum resolution of simple, fairly conventional electronic recording equipment.

500|$|The deal ended a {{diplomatic}} deadlock that brought US {{relations with the}} nuclear-armed South Asian nation to a near standstill and hindered counter-terrorism operations against Pakistan-based militants. Because of the supply lines closure the United States has spent at least an additional $100 million a month because it was instead forced to move supplies by air, rail or truck through Russia and other countries north of Afghanistan at much longer and more expensive routes. The closure of the supply lines complicated the American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, cost the United States more than $1 billion in extra shipping fees {{as a result of}} having to use the alternative routes through Central Asia and also held up delivery of thousands of armoured vehicles and other equipment meant for the fledgling Afghan army and police, slowing US efforts to build Afghan forces that can stand up to the Taliban insurgency as foreign troops withdraw. The reopening of the supply lines means that the US will save {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in the run-up to the withdrawal of NATO forces from the Afghanistan and also that it would help the US and NATO to complete its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan [...] "at a much lower cost" [...] according to Clinton. Despite the reopening of critical supply routes from Pakistan, the US military confronts a giant logistical challenge to wind down the war in Afghanistan because it must withdraw till the end of 2014 nearly 90,000 troops and enormous depots of military equipment accumulated over a decade of war which includes 100,000 shipping <b>containers</b> <b>stuffed</b> with materiel and 50,000 wheeled vehicles.|$|R
40|$|How do you {{approach}} an elusive phenomena like “travel fever”, {{the kind of}} mixed feelings travellers experience, hovering between anxiety and exhilaration? In an ongoing study of such links between motion and emotion I have worked with different arenas, above all the production of shared or contested moods and atmospheres in transit spaces. Here, I {{would like to try}} another approach: the suitcase. It is an object into which emotionalities and materialities are thrown or neatly packed, entangled in interesting ways. The suitcase is not only a <b>container</b> for <b>stuffing</b> objects, but also emotions, dreams, anxieties and ideals. It can be many things: a condensation of the future, an icon of mobility, a last resort, a threatening or comforting object, a defense against a hostile world, a transitional object in Winnicott’s terms. This travel item is explored through a bricolage approach, mixing history, popular culture, field observations, art and fiction. My aim is to discuss the specific kind of throwntogtherness of materialities and emotionalities that a suitcase offers...|$|R
30|$|In this section, we will briefly {{summarize}} the container monitoring process as determined in the MoCo project. When a container is stored empty, its MoCo Device will daily report about its position and battery level {{according to a}} fixed Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) time (e.g. 12 : 00 UTC time). This way, neighbouring containers will all transmit {{around the same time}} and communication can be more easily optimized. This status is called REST mode. When the <b>container</b> is <b>stuffed,</b> its doors are closed and a MoCo Reader will send a trigger, putting the MoCo Device in Secured Transport Mode (STP mode). From now on, the MoCo Device will send 2 -hourly status updates and reports of optional sensors attached to the cargo, again according to UTC time. In addition, it will immediately report about any critical event that occurs. Finally, there is an optional mode called Secured Vessel Mode (SVE mode). By sending a trigger from a MoCo Router to a MoCo Device upon loading the container in the vessel, the MoCo Device can go to energy-saving mode, where the 802.15. 4 radio is disabled, an internal clock is scheduled and no status updates are sent until the device wakes up again.|$|R

5000|$|Eventually, a drawn purple octopus mascot was created, {{and in the}} 1995 playoffs a large Octopus prop was unveiled. The Octopus was {{eventually}} named [...] "Al" [...] (after former Joe Louis Arena building operations manager and current Little Caesars Arena building operations manager Al Sobotka), and every playoff year since, Al the Octopus gets raised to the rafters, when the Red Wings skate out onto the ice. As the years went on some modifications were made to Al, such as making it so his pupils light up red (blinking on and off), the adding of a large Red Wing Jersey to his body, {{and the removal of}} a tooth in order to give Al that [...] "hockey player" [...] look. Al often appears on Red Wings apparel and promotional items. Coca-Cola would later create stuffed Als, in their Fan in the Can or Al in the Can promotion. The promotion featured cases of Coke in which some cans were, in fact, <b>containers</b> holding the <b>stuffed</b> Al. Later, Michigan stores would carry the doll, and it would be sold via a mail-in.|$|R

He tells Mo that the {{destruction}} of the mine has not hurt his business, since The Stuff seeps out from many places in the ground, but Mo vows to find those places and get rid of them all. Another man, Mr. Vickers, brings in Mr. Evans, the ice cream mogul with whom he is now working--and who had originally hired Mo to find out about what The Stuff was. They tell him they {{have come up with a}} new product that they call [...] "The Taste," [...] which is a mix of 88% ice cream and 12% The Stuff, supposedly enough to make people crave more without it taking over their minds or killing them. However, Mo then brings in Jason, who is carrying a box, and then holds the two moguls at gunpoint. The box is full of pint <b>containers</b> of The <b>Stuff,</b> and Mo forces both to eat them all as punishment for all the lives lost to it, and for their greed. As they do, Rutherford asks pointedly, [...] "Are you eating it...or is it eating YOU?" [...] When they finish, Mo and Jason leave them to the approaching police.|$|R
