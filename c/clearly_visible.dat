5|$|Most of the district's {{buildings}} are set on large parcels of land, {{and many are}} <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> from U.S. Route 9 (the former Albany Post Road), the district's major thoroughfare. Stone and brick walls line Route 9 {{within the boundaries of}} the district. The district achieved State Register status on August 6, 1984, National Register district status on September 7, 1984, and local landmark status on January 5, 1988.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1942, a Dornier Do 17M-1 {{crashed in}} Hansakollen in Maridalen, outside of Oslo, Norway. The Do 17 was {{heading to the}} airport at Gardermoen, but crashed into a mountainside. All three German aviators on board were killed. They are buried at the German war {{cemetery}} at Alfaset. The wreck is well preserved and remains <b>clearly</b> <b>visible,</b> over 70 years after the accident.|$|E
5|$|When {{early in}} the film {{newspaper}} clippings {{from around the globe}} are shown, in the Japanese newspaper the iconic silhouette of Godzilla is <b>clearly</b> <b>visible.</b> Similarly, during the New York sequence when Sky Captain deploys a bomb to stop a giant robot, the shape of King Kong can be seen on the Empire State Building in the background.|$|E
50|$|It is now {{a private}} residence, but the {{platforms}} and former goods yard are <b>clearly</b> still <b>visible.</b>|$|R
60|$|This softness, or {{atmospheric}} influence, or subdued glow {{of affection}} radiating from a light within, was <b>clearly</b> enough <b>visible</b> in Ida that morning, and certainly it made our friend the Colonel unspeakably {{happy to see}} it.|$|R

5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> by {{microscopy}} in {{brains of}} those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.|$|E
5|$|In Paris it {{was planned}} that two stunt men, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would help film two takes of a {{parachute}} drop off a (<b>clearly</b> <b>visible)</b> platform that extended from a {{top edge of}} the Eiffel Tower. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E
5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer {{in a corner of}} the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is <b>clearly</b> <b>visible.</b>|$|E

50|$|Available sources do not {{acknowledge}} that Audacious was {{fitted with a}} fire-control director {{on the roof of}} the spotting top before her loss, but photographic evidence <b>clearly</b> shows one <b>visible</b> as she was sinking.|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to analyse}} the {{structural}} particularities of migrants in Botosani County, concerning the presentation {{model of the}} structure by age and sex. This is {{perhaps one of the}} most important elements in finding explanations and motivations of population leaving from county. However, demographic changes of this structure <b>clearly</b> present <b>visible</b> consequences such as increasing proportion of elderly people and reducing youth people, but also by reducing the active workforce. ...|$|R
5|$|Other Japanese characteristics, {{including}} the further use of traditional pentatonic scales, continued to crop up elsewhere {{in his early}} works. In the opening bars of Litany, for Michael Vyner (first movement), a reconstruction from memory by Takemitsu of Lento in Due Movimenti (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> in the upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis. The pitches of the opening melody combine to form the constituent notes of the ascending form of the Japanese in scale.|$|E
5|$|The final {{images were}} {{released}} {{at a meeting}} of the American Astronomical Society in January 1996, and revealed a plethora of distant, faint galaxies. About 3,000 distinct galaxies could be identified in the images, with both irregular and spiral galaxies <b>clearly</b> <b>visible,</b> although some galaxies in the field are only a few pixels across. In all, the HDF is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars; by far the majority of objects in the field are distant galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with either}} {{definite}} pulmonary AVMs or an abnormal contrast echocardiogram with no <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> lesions are {{deemed to be}} at risk from brain emboli. They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small air bubbles may form in the bloodsteam that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is advised during procedures in which bacteria may enter the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of air bubbles during intravenous therapy.|$|E
5000|$|Julie and Johnny have lunch; he is astounded by her healing {{abilities}} {{caused by the}} Kymellian changes to her DNA, noting that she was stabbed in [...] "the gut", despite her scar <b>clearly</b> being <b>visible</b> on her shoulder. Julie is intrigued by Hollow (formerly Penance) staying at Phil Urich's place, and fans the rumors about Mickey and Chris' romance. The two arrive at Marvel Studios to keep Julie's appointment for an audition.|$|R
5000|$|The ON and OFF {{positions}} for the switch must be <b>clearly</b> indicated and <b>visible</b> to someone {{standing on the}} ground. Additionally the OFF position must be on the top, this is to help prevent accidental movement to the ON position.|$|R
30|$|We also {{distinguished}} {{both positive}} and negative ‘socioemotional interactions’. The positive interactions implemented in the current study were ‘inclusion’ and ‘group cohesion’; the ‘active listening’ was difficult to prove, as explicit messages of active listening are not <b>clearly</b> readable or <b>visible</b> during the productive group work.|$|R
5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, a {{corridor}} was left open {{leading into the}} shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the site}} has been built over, {{but some of the}} {{terminal}} buildings near Purley Way (the A23 road) are still <b>visible,</b> <b>clearly</b> identifiable as to their former purpose. The former terminal building is called Airport House, and the former control tower houses a visitors' centre.|$|R
30|$|The {{average age}} of the {{particles}} in the simulation can be inferred by looking at distributions presented in Fig. 4. Near the exobase the lifetime of O+ and O 2 + is short, < 15 minutes, whereas ∼ 50 km above the exobase the average lifetime can be long, > 40 minutes. It is in the older populations that the heating <b>clearly</b> is <b>visible.</b> At low latitudes, since the particles are younger and have not been heated significantly the ion drift speeds can be used to infer the neutral wind speed and direction around the exobase.|$|R
40|$|More {{than one}} year ago in the Arab world started a {{political}} and social movement that rapidly expanded its influence from the North Africa and Middle East to the Occidental world. Since an historical perspective this is an atypical movement characterized {{by the presence of}} multiple actors and objectives, the lack of a <b>clearly</b> and <b>visible</b> leadership, a shortage of comprehensive proposals and the use of social networks. In this perspective the aim of this paper is advance in the analysis of this movement, assessing the nature of their motivations and identifying the factors that characterize, differentiate and explain the persistent social mobilization...|$|R
5|$|Circinus X-1 is an X-ray {{binary star}} system that {{includes}} a neutron star. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000light-years, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> in the X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was visible {{in the night sky}} for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.|$|E
5|$|East of {{this station}} on the IND side are {{turnouts}} for a connection to Phase 3 of the Second Avenue Subway, <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> from a moving train, which would allow future service from Queens towards Midtown and Downtown Manhattan. Also to the east, the eastbound track of the IND line rises to the upper level of the tunnel, as both IND tracks are located on the upper level of 63rd Street Tunnel for the trip under the East River. The two tracks on the lower level of that tunnel are being connected to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) via the East Side Access project. The project will bring trains from the LIRR's Main Line to Grand Central Terminal, but, as of December 2016, the lower level is currently unused.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his {{men around}} the bend, {{carefully}} keeping them behind cover, then sent Coey {{out into the}} open riverbed to give treatment. With his Red Cross flag <b>clearly</b> <b>visible,</b> Coey came out from cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E
40|$|Growth in {{the world}} economy is still {{relatively}} strong, although US growth has slowed slightly. Inflationary pressures are <b>clearly</b> more <b>visible</b> than previously and the general trend for global monetary policy is for a tighter stance. Prices continue to be driven by energy prices, although there are few signs of this feeding through into wage bargains. Japan and China once again have performed strongly in the East while the Euro Area has shown significant improvements. There is still some concern over the pace of private consumption growth in Germany. The outlook for the world economy is still optimistic over the next two years...|$|R
50|$|The nave and choir {{form the}} oldest part of Lojsta Church. They {{date from the}} middle of the 13th century. During the first half of the 14th century, an earlier tower was {{replaced}} by the presently <b>visible,</b> <b>clearly</b> Gothic tower. In connection with this, some additional reconstruction works were carried out in the church.|$|R
5000|$|The mineral wealth {{beneath the}} Herzberg and the {{proximity}} of the two [...] "High Roads" [...] (= watershed roads) suggest that the region was inhabited in prehistoric times. A prehistoric tumulus was not removed until 1935 by the Arbeitsdienst ("labour service"). The rampart section, which was to protect the ridge from enemies, is still <b>visible</b> <b>clearly.</b>|$|R
5|$|Modeste was <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> in the harbour, {{anchored}} at {{the mole}} near two tartanes (small Mediterranean sailing craft here armed with four guns and carrying crews of around 70 men). The senior {{officers of the}} squadron held a council {{to determine the best}} course of action, and decided that since diplomatic options had failed and the Genoese appeared to support the French, the British would resort to a military solution. On the afternoon of 5 October Bedford was slowly warped into the harbour and alongside Modeste, as Reeve launched the ship's boats from Captain and brought them close {{to the other side of}} the French frigate.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the white}} stone mosque, one village mill, the village health center, {{and a few}} {{partially}} destroyed houses remain on the site. The mosque has {{been converted into a}} carpentry workshop and one of the houses has been made into a chicken coop. The health center and grain mill are deserted, and the school is gone. The cemetery remains, but it is in a neglected state; the tomb of Yusuf al-Hamdan, a prominent nationalist who fell in the 1936 revolt, is <b>clearly</b> <b>visible.</b> The surrounding lands are planted with almond trees, wheat, and barley; they also contain animal sheds, a fodder plant, and a pump installed on the spring of 'Ayn al-Hajja. The site is tightly fenced in and entry is blocked.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{consists of}} neat lines of graves arranged on an east–west alignment, covering a nearly square area of about , in a layout {{not seen in}} any other known Anglo-Saxon cemetery. The enclosure within which the cemetery was laid out was many centuries older, dating to about 200BC; {{the establishment of a}} cemetery within its boundaries was probably intended to serve as a deliberate link to the past. It would still have been <b>clearly</b> <b>visible</b> in Saxon times. The layout of the cemetery seem to have consciously reflected that of the earlier enclosure, with its apparent main entrance aligned with that of the enclosure.|$|E
50|$|The Pride Week of 1973 {{marks the}} shift in Vancouver from the homophile {{movement}} into the gay liberation movement. The essence of the homophile movement is that of assimilation into the general society {{as well as the}} creation of hidden network for gays and lesbians to meet one another and form a community. The gay liberation movement is more active and aims to achieve change through visibility and protest. Pride Week 1973 was <b>clearly</b> a <b>visible</b> event aiming for openness and change, it was also the first one of its kind and is therefore a tangible shift of the mentality of the gay rights movement.|$|R
25|$|GAP is {{estimated}} to double Turkey's irrigable farmland. The increase of agricultural activity of GAP in its incomplete state is <b>visible</b> <b>clearly</b> on the USDA graph above. Cotton production increased from 150,000 metric tons to 400,000 metric tons, making the region the top cotton producer. But {{at the same time}} other regions declined, which means that Turkey's overall output stayed relatively steady.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} hide {{invisible}} patterns in color error diffused halftone images. The hidden pattern is embedded in different color components. The hidden patterns would be revealed when the watermarked color halftone images are under Boolean operation or overlaid. Simulation {{results show that the}} watermarked color halftone images have good visual quality and the hidden pattern is <b>visible</b> <b>clearly...</b>|$|R
