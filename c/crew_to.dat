5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E
5|$|If Progress M1-5 had {{launched}} on 16 January, the Soyuz launch {{would have occurred}} on 10 February {{if it had been}} required. It was stood down around 22 February, after the decaying altitude of Mir made it too dangerous to send a <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E

5|$|Mission {{managers}} {{called up}} to the <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> alert them of the find, advising Altman ("Scooter") {{that one of the}} orbiter's wing leading edge sensors recorded a debris event during ascent, around 104 – 106 seconds following liftoff, which may have been the cause of the damage seen in that area.|$|E
5|$|Monssen {{avoided the}} wreck of Barton and steamed onward looking for targets. She was noticed by Asagumo, Murasame, and Samidare who had just {{finished}} blasting Laffey.

5|$|On 24 July 1959, Vulcan B.1 XA891 crashed {{due to an}} {{electrical}} failure during an engine test. Shortly after take-off, the crew observed generator warning lights and loss of busbar voltage. The aircraft commander, Avro Chief Test Pilot Jimmy Harrison, climbed XA891 to , steering away from the airfield and populated areas while the AEO attempted to solve the problem. When {{it became clear that}} control would not be regained, Harrison instructed the rear compartment <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> exit the aircraft and the co-pilot to eject, before ejecting himself. All the crew survived, making them the first complete Vulcan <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> successfully escape. The aircraft crashed near Kingston upon Hull.|$|E
5|$|On Omega 3 {{they find}} several {{original}} sets from Star Trek, {{and most of}} the original cast with their bodies and eternal youth. An energy being named Melllvar appears and explains that he became an obsessed Star Trek fan after watching the dumped tapes over and over again. Melllvar gives Nimoy a body, and orders the actors and the Planet Express <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> participate in a Star Trek convention until the end of time. Welshie is killed in a show of force to force their obedience. While Melllvar forces the cast to perform his fan script, Bender, Leela and Fry escape in the Planet Express Ship. Fry convinces the <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> attack Melllvar to save the actors, but Melllvar destroys the ship's engine as he drags it back to the planet.|$|E

5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them. This {{was due to the}} relatively few locomotives in the class for <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|R

5|$|The book {{describes}} the explosion on April 19, 1989, and the heroic {{efforts by the}} ship's <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> contain the fires and avoid a cataclysmic detonation of the turret's powder magazines. After the fires were contained, Moosally ordered the <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> immediately begin cleaning up the turret. The cleanup involved removing {{the bodies of the}} deceased turret crewman and disposing of the damaged turret equipment, all without photographing or otherwise recording the locations of the bodies or equipment which would have presumably assisted with the resulting investigation.|$|E

On 9 March 1807, while en route, off Madeira, Revenant captured the British slave ship Aun, of sixteen 12-pounders, recently departed from Liverpool, which Surcouf let go for a ransom, after throwing her guns overboard, wetting her gunpowder and destroying some of her sails.|$|E
5|$|After the eruption, Glicken went to Toutle High School, {{the center}} for relief efforts, where he joined Air Force Reserve Rescue Squadron {{officials}} in a helicopter to look for Johnston or any sign of his post. Despite searching with three separate crews over a span of nearly six hours, Glicken found no trace. He attempted to enlist a fourth helicopter <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> aid his search, but they declined, fearing dangerous conditions. In his distraught state, Glicken refused to accept Johnston's death, {{and had to be}} comforted by Swanson before calming down.|$|E
5|$|Broke drilled his <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
