50|$|Paltridge was {{involved}} in studies on stratospheric electricity, {{the effect of the}} atmosphere on plant growth and the radiation properties of clouds. Paltridge researched topics such as the optimum design of plants and the economics of climate forecasting, and worked on atmospheric radiation and the theoretical basis of climate. Paltridge introduced the subsequently disputed hypothesis that the earth/atmosphere climate system adopts a format that maximises its rate of thermodynamic dissipation, i.e., entropy production. This suggests a governing constraint by a principle of maximum rate of entropy production. According to this principle, prediction of the broad-scale steady-state distribution of <b>cloud,</b> <b>temperature</b> and energy flows in the ocean and atmosphere may be possible when one has sufficient data about the system for that purpose, but does not have fully detailed data about every variable of the system.

In the thermal infrared windows, the outgoing radiances from the earth's atmosphere contain information about cloud emissivity and <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperature.</b> This information is clearly {{demonstrated in the}} brightness temperature difference curves of two window channels. For the purpose of illustration, two window channels centered at 810 and 930 cm are chosen to construct the brightness temperature difference curves {{for a range of}} <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperatures.</b> These curves vary for different <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperatures,</b> and along each of these curves the emissivity changes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the relationship between cirrus cloud ice water content and <b>cloud</b> <b>temperature</b> on climate change. A simple mechanistic climate model is used to study the feedback between ice water content and temperature. The central question studied in this paper concerns the extent to which both the radiative and microphysical properties of cirrus cloud influence such a feedback. To address this question, a parameterization of the albedo and emissivity of clouds is introduced. Observations that relate the ice water content to <b>cloud</b> <b>temperature</b> are incorporated in the parameterization to introduce a temperature dependence to both albedo and emittance. The cloud properties relevant to the cloud feedback are expressed as functions of particles size re, asymmetry parameter g and <b>cloud</b> <b>temperature</b> and analyses of aircraft measurements, lidar and ground based radiometer data are used to select re and g. It was shown that scattering calculations assuming spherical particles with a distribution described by r, = 16 pm reasonably matched the lidar and radiometer data. However, comparison of cloud radiation properties measured from aircraft to those parameterized in this study required values of g significantly smaller than those derived for spheres but consistent with our understanding of nonspherical particle scattering. The climate simulations revealed that the influence of cirrus cloud on climate was strongly affected by the choice of re and g: parameters that are both poorly known for cirrus. It was further shown that the effect of ice water feedback on a COZ warming simulation could be either positive or negative depending on the value of re assumed. Based on these results, it was concluded that prediction of cirrus cloud feedback on climate is both premature and limited by our lack of understanding of the relationship between size and shape of ice crystals and the gross radiative properties of cirrus. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{variability}} of convective cloud spans {{a wide range}} of temporal and spatial scales and is of fundamental importance for global weather and climate systems. Datasets from geostationary satellite instruments such as SEVIRI provide high time resolution observations across a large area. In this study we use data from SEVIRI to quantify the diurnal cycle of <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperature</b> within the instrument’s field of view and discuss these results in relation to retrieval biases. We evaluate SEVIRI <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperatures</b> from the new CLAAS- 2 (CLoud property dAtAset using SEVIRI, Edition 2) dataset against CALIOP data. Results show a mean bias of + 0. 44 K {{with a standard deviation of}} 11. 7 K, which is in agreement with previous validation studies. Analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of these errors shows that absolute retrieval biases vary from less than 5 K over the southeast Atlantic Ocean up to 30 K over central Africa at night. Night and daytime retrieval biases can also differ by up to 30 K in some areas, potentially contributing to biases in the estimated amplitude of the diurnal cycle. This illustrates the importance of considering spatial and diurnal variations in retrieval errors when using the CLAAS- 2 dataset. Keeping these biases in mind, we quantify the seasonal, diurnal and spatial variation of <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperature</b> across SEVIRI’s field of view using the CLAAS- 2 dataset. By comparing the mean diurnal cycle of <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperature</b> with the retrieval bias we find that diurnal variations in the retrieval bias can be small, but are often of the same order of magnitude as the amplitude of the observed diurnal cycle, indicating that in some regions the diurnal cycle apparent in the observations may be significantly impacted by diurnal variability in the accuracy of the retrieval. We show that the CLAAS- 2 dataset can measure the diurnal cycle of cloud tops accurately in regions of stratiform cloud such as the southeast Atlantic Ocean and Europe, where <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperature</b> retrieval biases are small and exhibit limited spatial and temporal variability. Quantifying the diurnal cycle over the tropics and regions of desert is more difficult, as retrieval biases are larger and display significant diurnal variability. CLAAS- 2 <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperature</b> data are found to be of limited skill in measuring the diurnal cycle accurately over desert regions. In tropical regions such as Central Africa, the diurnal cycle can be described by the CLAAS- 2 data to some extent, although retrieval biases appear to reduce the amplitude of the real diurnal cycle of <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperatures.</b> This is the first study to relate the diurnal variations in SEVIRI retrieval bias to observed diurnal cycles in <b>cloud</b> top <b>temperature.</b> Our results may be of interest to those in the observation and modelling communities when using cloud top properties data from SEVIRI, particularly for studies considering the diurnal cycle of convection. </p...|$|R
