5|$|Certain {{species such}} as Gnathamitermes tubiformans have {{seasonal}} food habits.

50|$|The most {{significant}} impact from this war was the settling {{of large numbers}} of Loyalist refugees in the region, especially in Shelburne and Parrtown (Saint John). Following the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Loyalist settlers in what would become New Brunswick persuaded British administrators to split the <b>Colony</b> <b>of</b> Nova Scotia to create the new <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> New Brunswick in 1784. At the same time, another part <b>of</b> the <b>Colony</b> <b>of</b> Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, was split off to become the <b>Colony</b> <b>of</b> Cape Breton Island.The <b>Colony</b> <b>of</b> St. John's Island was renamed to Prince Edward Island on November 29, 1798.|$|R

5|$|Corals are marine {{invertebrates}} {{in the class}} Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria. They typically live in compact <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> many identical individual polyps.

5|$|Frigatebirds {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> up to 5000 birds.

The <b>Colony</b> <b>of</b> the Queen Charlotte Islands and most of the Stikine Territory were merged into the <b>Colony</b> <b>of</b> British Columbia in 1863 (the remainder, north of the 60th Parallel, became part of the North-Western Territory).|$|R
5|$|In 1753 the French began {{expanding}} their military control into the Ohio Country, a territory already {{claimed by the}} British <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> Virginia and Pennsylvania.

5|$|In June 2014 a {{study by}} the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{concluded}} that emperor penguins are at risk from global warming, which is melting the sea ice. This study predicted that by 2100 all 45 <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> emperor penguins will be declining in numbers, mostly due to loss of habitat. Loss of ice reduces the supply of krill, which is a primary food for emperor penguins.|$|E
5|$|In <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> {{the paper}} wasp, Polistes chinensis antennalis, workers can lay up to {{a quarter of}} the male eggs in the colony. The number of eggs that survived to hatching, however, was minimal {{compared}} to the number produced by the queen.
