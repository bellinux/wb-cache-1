5|$|The {{first two}} rows of this table are straightforward. The {{homotopy}} groups πi(S0) of the 0-dimensional sphere are trivial for i > 0, because any base point preserving map from an i-sphere to a 0-sphere is a one-point mapping. Similarly, the homotopy groups πi(S1) of the 1-sphere are trivial for i > 1, because the universal covering space, R, which has the same higher homotopy groups, is <b>contractible.</b>|$|E
5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is <b>contractible</b> (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E

In the spring of 1974 Curtiss thought Genie may have acquired use of the <b>contractible</b> auxiliary you, but wrote that she only used it in sentences that were mostly imitative. In January 1974 the scientists noted the first copulas in her spontaneous sentences, but she never used a <b>contractible</b> copula.

2500|$|By {{construction}} the Outer space Xn is a finite-dimensional {{simplicial complex}} {{equipped with a}} natural action of Out(F'n) which is properly discontinuous and has finite simplex stabilizers. The main result of Culler–Vogtmann 1986 paper, obtained via Morse-theoretic methods, was that the Outer space Xn is <b>contractible.</b> Thus the quotient space Xn /Out(F'n) is [...] "almost" [...] a classifying space for Out(F'n) {{and it can be}} thought of as a classifying space over Q. Moreover, Out(F'n) is known to be virtually torsion-free, so for any torsion-free subgroup H of Out(F'n) the action of H on Xn is discrete and free, so that Xn/H is a classifying space for H. For these reasons the Outer space is a particularly useful object in obtaining homological and cohomological information about Out(F'n). In particular, Culler and Vogtmann proved that Out(F'n) has virtual cohomological dimension 2n−3.|$|E

When it is of the form M × Rn, then the tangent bundle is said to be trivial. Trivial tangent bundles usually occur for manifolds equipped with a 'compatible group structure'; for instance, in the case where the manifold is a Lie group. The tangent bundle of the unit circle is trivial because it is a Lie group (under multiplication and its natural differential structure). It is not true however that all spaces with trivial tangent bundles are Lie groups; manifolds which have a trivial tangent bundle are called parallelizable. Just as manifolds are locally modelled on Euclidean space, tangent bundles are locally modelled on U × Rn, where U is an open subset of Euclidean space.|$|E
