50|$|Pengam was the {{location}} of the Austin Junior Car Factory set up by Leonard Lord, managing Director of the Austin Motor Company, to employ disabled Welsh miners making children’s pedal cars. More than 30,000 J40 pedal cars were built between 1949 and 1962. Apart from a few managers and trainers from Longbridge, the factory was considered unique in the world at the time for having a workforce that was 100% disabled - 60% of whom suffered from <b>Complicated</b> <b>Pneumoconiosis.</b>|$|E

Serum {{iron and}} iron {{kinetics}} in coalworkers with <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> Twenty-three patients with <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> were studied, and compared with 16 patients of similar age with chronic non-specific lung disease. In seropositive cases (Rose Waaler titre higher than 1 : 32) the serum iron, total iron binding capacity (T. I. B. C.), and the serum iron/T. I. B. C. % were all significantly decreased.

40|$|Twenty-five {{histocompatibility}} antigens {{have been}} measured in 100 coal miners with pneumoconiosis attending a pneumoconiosis medical panel {{and the results}} compared with a panel of 200 normal volunteers not exposed to dust. Chest radiographs were read independently by three readers according to the ILO U/C classification. On a combined score, 40 men were thought to have simple pneumoconiosis and 60 men <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> The number of antigens tested and associations between antigens caused difficulties in assessing the statistical significance of differences in prevalence of antigens between groups of men. Using stringent criteria for statistical significance, {{no significant differences were}} found in antigen prevalences between miners and controls, or miners with simple or <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> When a less stringent statistical approach was applied, three antigens appeared to have abnormal prevalences in these 100 miners by comparison with the normal volunteers. More detailed examination of these antigen prevalences in relation to radiographic category of pneumoconiosis did not provide any supportive evidence that these slight associations were of statistical or clinical significance. Reports on histocompatibility antigens in miners with pneumoconiosis are reviewed briefly and the results compared. There is no good evidence that any of the histocompatibility antigens so far tested are associated with a clinically important altered risk of simple or <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> when dust is inhaled...|$|E
40|$|The {{correlations}} between {{progressive massive fibrosis}} (PMF), emphysema, and impairment of ventilation were studied in 108 dead coalminers, {{all of whom had}} suffered with <b>complicated</b> coalworkers' <b>pneumoconiosis</b> (radiological category B or C) during life. The findings indicated that both factors were contributing to impairment of ventilation in proportion to their size or extent, but these contributions were in the main independent of one another. A joint opinion on the types of emphysema found to be present in a random 50 out of the 108 cases was given by two pulmonary pathologists. They found that most of the emphysema was of the centrilobular variety, which appeared to be unrelated to the PMF. The distribution of the PMF throughout the lungs both radiologically and anatomically is shown...|$|R
50|$|Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, severe state, {{develops}} {{after the}} initial, milder {{form of the}} disease known as anthracosis (anthrac — coal, carbon). This is often asymptomatic and is found to at least some extent in all urban dwellers due to air pollution. Prolonged exposure to large amounts of coal dust can result in more serious forms of the disease, simple coal workers' <b>pneumoconiosis</b> and <b>complicated</b> coal workers' <b>pneumoconiosis</b> (or progressive massive fibrosis, or PMF). More commonly, workers exposed to coal dust develop industrial bronchitis, clinically defined as chronic bronchitis (i.e. productive cough for 3 months per year for at least 2 years) associated with workplace dust exposure. The incidence of industrial bronchitis varies with age, job, exposure, and smoking. In nonsmokers (who are less prone to develop bronchitis than smokers), studies of coal miners have shown a 16% to 17% incidence of industrial bronchitis.|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been suggested that the inhalation of coal {{in the absence of}} <b>complicated</b> coal workers' <b>pneumoconiosis</b> (CWP) or smoking can lead to disabling airways obstruction. The cause of such obstruction has been variously attributed to emphysema or bronchitis. The frequency of significant airways obstruction in a group of United States coal miners seeking compensation for occupationally induced pulmonary impairment was therefore determined. In a sample of 611 "Black Lung" claimants there was only one subject who was a non-smoker and who in the absence of other non-occupationally related diseases, [...] for example, asthma and bronchiectasis [...] had sufficient airways obstruction to render it difficult for him to carry out hard labour. An alternative explanation for his reduced ventilatory capacity other than coal dust or smoking may be available. If the inhalation of coal dust in the absence of smoking and complicated CWP ever induces sufficient ventilatory impairment to preclude a miner from working, it is indeed rare...|$|R
40|$|Correlation {{has been}} {{established}} between {{the size of the}} main pulmonary arteries, as seen on the postero-anterior radiograph, and the pulmonary artery pressure. In this study the distance between the bifurcations of the right and left pulmonary arteries, referred to as the transpulmonary artery distance (TPD), {{has been used as a}} measure of the size of these vessels. In 293 patients with simple pneumoconiosis TPD was significantly correlated with height but not with stem-height, age, weight or forced expiratory volume. The mean TPD of patients with simple pneumoconiosis with or without chronic bronchitis was similar. Among 367 patients with <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> those with early fibrosis (A shadows) had a mean TPD similar to that found in simple pneumoconiosis, but those patients with extensive fibrosis (B or C shadows) had significantly greater values. The pathological changes of pulmonary hypertension in <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> are reflected in these measurements...|$|E
40|$|Four {{patients}} {{are described in}} whom pneumoconiosis was diagnosed {{towards the end of}} a lifetime's work in shale mines. All developed <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> diagnosed in two cases at necropsy, in one by lobectomy, and in one radiologically. Two of the patients were found at necropsy also to have peripheral squamous lung cancer. The clinical and histological features of the disease resembled the pneumoconioses of coalminers and kaolin workers and the lungs of three of the patients were shown to contain dust composed predominantly of kaolinite, mica, and silica. Shale miners' <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> has not previously been described. Although the British shale industry is now defunct, oil production from shale is expanding in other countries, notably the USA. It is suggested that control should be exercised over dust exposure levels in this industry and that epidemiological studies should be carried out to quantify the risks of both pneumoconiosis and bronchial carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{trial in}} coalminers {{under the age}} of 50 in South Wales with sputum-negative, early <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> was used to compare three regimes: (1) chemotherapy (rest in hospital and 1 g. streptomycin, 200 mg. INH, 10 g. PAS, for 3 months; then 200 mg. INH, 10 g. PAS for 9 months); (2) rest (in hospital for 3 months); and (3) a working group. The initial and three-year radiographs were assessed by two methods in 173 (96 %) of the 180 men entering the trial. No beneficial effect of chemotherapy was demonstrated and this factor was not related to the completeness of the chemotherapy. The variation between individuals in the rate of progression and in the development of new shadows was unrelated to chest symptoms, smoking habits, initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or special features in the initial radiographs, so these did not provide any useful predictive characteristics. Those with an initial negative Mantoux (1 T. U.) showed significantly less progression than those with a positive Mantoux. The lack of benefit and the short- and long-term complications of chemotherapy (weight gain, reduction in ventilatory capacity, dyspepsia, and streptomycin toxicity) show that this treatment is contra-indicated in miners with early <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> without a positive sputum. That new shadows develop during chemotherapy adds to the evidence from other sources that tuberculosis is unlikely to be {{a major factor in the}} pathogenesis of <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> in this area. Mycobacterium peregrinum (Runyon group IV) was isolated in three cases...|$|E
40|$|Background: Diseases {{associated}} with coal mine dust continue to affect coal miners. Elucidation of initial pathological changes as a precursor of coal dust-related diffuse fibrosis and emphysema, {{may have a}} role in treatment and prevention. Objective: To identify the precursor of dust-related diffuse fibrosis and emphysema. Methods: Birefringent silica/silicate particles were counted by standard microscope under polarized light in the alveolar macrophages and fibrous tissue in 25 consecutive autopsy cases of <b>complicated</b> coal worker's <b>pneumoconiosis</b> and in 21 patients with tobacco-related respiratory bronchiolitis. Results: Coal miners had 331 birefringent particles/high power field while smokers had 4 (p< 0. 001). Every coal miner had intra-alveolar macrophages with silica/silicate particles and interstitial fibrosis ranging from minimal to extreme. All coal miners, including those who never smoked, had emphysema. Fibrotic septa of centrilobular emphysema contained numerous silica/silicate particles while only a few were present in adjacent normal lung tissue. In coal miners who smoked, tobacco-associated interstitial fibrosis was replaced by fibrosis caused by silica/silicate particles. Conclusion: The presence of silica/silicate particles and anthracotic pigment-laden macrophages inside the alveoli with various degrees of interstitial fibrosis indicated a new disease: coal mine dust desquamative chronic interstitial pneumonia, a precursor of both dust-related diffuse fibrosis and emphysema. In studied coal miners, fibrosis caused by smoking is insignificant in comparison with fibrosis caused by silica/silicate particles. Counting birefringent particles in the macrophages from bronchioalveolar lavage may help detect coal mine dust desquamative chronic interstitial pneumonia, and may initiate early therapy and preventive measures...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} personal factors in pneumoconiosis, several acute phase proteins were studied in 62 coal miners without acute illnesses and classified as having no pneumoconiosis (n = 19), simple pneumoconiosis (n = 23), or <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> with progressive massive fibrosis (n = 20). Groups were similar for age, years of work at high risk jobs, chronic bronchitis, and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). C-reactive protein concentration was significantly higher in the simple and <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> groups {{in comparison with the}} no pneumoconiosis group. The C-reactive protein concentration was above the upper normal value in 12 (27. 9 %) out of 43 cases with simple and <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> On the other hand only one case of no pneumoconiosis was above the upper normal range (5. 3 %), a significant difference taking into account a stratified analysis for chronic bronchitis. Fibrinogen concentration was significantly increased in the simple pneumoconiosis group compared with the no pneumoconiosis group. The value of fibrinogen was above the upper normal limit in 17 out of the 43 cases with pneumoconiosis (39. 5 %) by contrast with two cases in the no pneumoconiosis group (10. 5 %). No significant differences in alpha 1 -antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were found between groups. In conclusion, an alteration in some acute phase proteins related to pneumoconiosis was found in miners. This {{could be used as a}} marker of disease activity and personal response against the pathogenic agent...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} lungs were studied in two groups of coal miners. The first group consisted of miners with either simple or no pneumoconiosis and was divided into two subgroups (1 A and 1 B). The former (1 A) consisted of 62 miners most of whom had simple pneumoconiosis {{but a few of}} whom had clear films. Although their spirometry was normal, all claimed to have respiratory symptoms. The other subgroup (1 B) consisted of 25 working miners with definite radiographic evidence of simple pneumoconiosis but normal spirometric findings.

40|$|In a {{study of}} slate workers in four areas in North Wales 725 workers and ex-workers who {{had been exposed to}} slate and to no other dust were seen, {{together}} with 530 men from the same area who had never been exposed to any dust. Evidence of pneumoconiosis was found in one-third of the slate workers, and 10 % had degrees of pneumoconiosis that would attract compensation (category 2 or higher). The prevalence of respiratory symptoms was high, and there was evidence of an effect of both simple and <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> on lung function additional to that of age. There was a high prevalence (40 - 50 %) of radiological lesions suggestive of healed tuberculosis in men aged over 55.

40|$|A {{total of}} 124 coal workers and ex-coal workers {{receiving}} disability benefit for coal worker's pneumoconiosis and routinely reattending the Cardiff Pneumoconiosis Medical Panel during a 10 -week period were studied. Those with <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> were excluded. Their current chest radiographs and their chest radiographs {{at the time}} of certification were read in random order by three readers using the 1980 ILO Classification of Radiographs. An irregularity score was derived from the readings. The x-ray findings were examined for changes since certification and for relationships with age, smoking, and underground coal work exposure. One-fifth of the current radiographs showed mainly irregular opacities, whereas nearly all of those from the time of certification showed mainly irregular opacities, whereas nearly all of those from the time of certification showed mainly rounded opacities. Irregular opacities were related to age, smoking, and underground exposure. The exposure effect remained after excluding the older men. The findings suggest that radiological irregular opacities, and their associated pathology and lung function changes, commonly develop in coal workers with pneumoconiosis and should be considered part of the condition...|$|E
40|$|To aid in {{diagnostic}} chest film {{interpretation of}} coal workers' pneumoconiosis, a composite profile of common radiologic patterns {{was developed in}} 98 Appalachian former coal miners who were diagnosed as having coal miner's pneumoconiosis and who applied for black lung benefits. The mean age was 61 years, with a lifetime coal mine dust exposure of 18. 7 years. Results showed that chest radiographs of coal workers' simple pneumoconiosis contained small irregular linear opacities more frequently (47 %) than small rounded opacities. Sparse profusion of all small opacities was the rule. Small opacities involved two out of six lung zones simultaneously 39 % of the time while other combinations occurred less frequently. Lower zones were involved more frequently than upper ones. Thickened pleura occurred in 18 % of radiographs. Other frequent radiographic abnormalities were parenchymal calcifications (19 %), marked emphysema (12 %), and inactive tuberculosis (12 %). Calcification of the aortic knob, a degenerative process reflecting age, occurred in 9 %. Only one instance of complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (progressive massive fibrosis) was encountered (0. 7 %). Many of the descriptive features of coal workers' pneumoconiosis noted in the literature were not observed in this study. Only one instance of <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> was encountered...|$|E
40|$|Dust dose and {{composition}} {{do not appear}} to account wholly for changes in the prevalence of coal workers ' pneumoconiosis in Europe. In certain coal pits high progression evidently occurred with relatively low dust exposure or vice versa, whereas progression in relation to dust levels might be variable. Exceptionally high quartz concentrations occur in coal mine dust when pneumoconiosis may progress with unusual rapidity. Under such circumstances lesions resembling silicotic nodules may be found, but with the customarily lower levels of quartz the pathological features assume the form characteristic of coal workers. Morphological changes in relation to dust content of human and animal lungs, as well as cellular behavior, have not accounted completely for the epidemiological findings. Considering all the pathological evidence helps explain the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis and vagaries of progression. The origin of progressive massive fibrosis cannot be explained simply in tenns of dust burden or immunological features, and the role of an infective factor cannot be dismissed. Moreover, lipid secretion by alveolar epithelium introduces a new element that could affect the development of simple and <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> In vitro, cytotoxicity appeared to be too variable for predictive purposes, though direct assay of fibrogenicity using the macrophage fibrogenic factor suggested that dust dose was more important than dust composition. Assessing individual susceptibility presents serious obstacles...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between the macroscopic pathology of the lungs of coal-workers and the radio-logical category of pneumoconiosis on a chest film taken not {{more than two years}} before death has been investigated in 238 coal-miners in South Wales. Large lung sections were shown to provide more accurate and convenient material than wet lungs for this comparison and were used to assess the number and character of dust foci and the degree of emphysema. The profusion of dust foci was classified into four grades-very sparse, sparse, moderate, and numerous-using standard lung sections. Emphysema was graded slight, moderate, and severe. The chest radiographs were categorized according to the I. L. O. Classification, 1953. The comparison shows that there is a fairly good cor{{relation between}} the radiological category and the number and character of dust foci in the lungs at necropsy. The higher the radiological category the greater the likelihood that the lungs will show a large number of dust foci and particularly a higher proportion of fibrotic nodules, and vice versa. Only about 10 % of the films read as category 1 showed sparse fibrotic nodules on the lung section, and none showed more than this. Fibrotic nodules occurred more frequently when early <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> (category A) was also present. There was no evidence that emphysema was obscuring the recognitio...|$|E
40|$|A {{radiological}} survey of men {{employed in the}} china clay industry in Cornwall {{was carried out in}} 1977. Each man completed a short questionnaire on respiratory symptoms and smoking habits, his occupational history was determined, and his forced expiratory volume and vital capacity were measured. The radiographs were read independently by three observers, using the 1980 ILO classification. Of the 1728 men in the study, 23 had had dust exposure elsewhere, mostly in tin mining, and were excluded. Readings of the radiographs were available for 1676 men: 77. 4 % were within category 0, 17. 9 % in category 1, and 4. 7 % in categories 2 and 3. In 19 men (1. 1 %) one or more readers recorded the presence of a large shadow and read it as <b>complicated</b> <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> but in only four men were the readers unanimous. Every job recognised as dusty contributed significantly to the amount of simple pneumoconiosis, and in two jobs the conditions were such that the average worker would reach category 2 in a working lifetime. Smoking appeared unrelated to the radiographic appearance. Vital capacity showed a significant reduction with increasing amount of pneumoconiosis, but not, when this was allowed for, on the duration of exposure in any of the job categories. In addition it depended, as would be expected, on smoking. The effect of one category increase in pneumoconiosis was equivalent to 4. 1 years of age in smokers, 3. 9 years of age in ex-smokers, and 5. 4 years of age in non-smoker. Forced expiratory volume did not decline significantly with amount of pneumoconiosis, so that FEV% VC showed an increase, though not to a significant extent. No extent. No relationship between symptoms and past exposure was detected...|$|E
