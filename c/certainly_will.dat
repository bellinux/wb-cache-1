He won 3games and lost 4 before being sent back to the minor leagues with the Syracuse Chiefs for most of the season when the Reds {{recalled}} him in September. The following year on June 11, 1938, Vander Meer pitched a no hitter against the Boston Braves. Four days later against the Brooklyn Dodgers in what was the first night game ever held at Ebbets Field, he threw another no hitter, becoming the only player in major league history to throw two consecutive no-hitters, an historic record that has never been tied and almost <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> never be beaten.|$|E

By 1957, the 1951 bond issue had been almost entirely used for other projects, and the New York Times despaired of the line's ever being built.

On September 21, 1944, Feklisov reported to Moscow: [...] "They are young, intelligent, capable, and politically developed people, strongly believing {{in the cause of}} communism and wishing to do their best to help our country as much as possible.

While it <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> be vastly superior to the current ecosystem, it will not completely match the pre-drainage system. This is not possible, in light of the irreversible physical changes that have made (sic) to the ecosystem. It will be an Everglades that is smaller and somewhat differently arranged than the historic ecosystem. But it will be a successfully restored Everglades, because it will have recovered those hydrological and biological patterns which defined the [...] original Everglades, and which made it unique among the world’s wetland systems. It will become a place that kindles the wildness and richness of the former Everglades.|$|E
500|$|P.T.s ceaselessly looping hallway {{has been}} a source of {{critical}} discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced [...] "mild claustrophobia" [...] and [...] "a familiarity with your surroundings". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as [...] "the conduit for everything that it builds", along with saying that [...] "it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how things might, and almost <b>certainly</b> <b>will,</b> escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before." [...] Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working [...] "within the realm of psychology". Polygon quoted a game player who said that [...] "P.T.s greatest asset is its looping hallway", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also [...] "curiosity, or a desire to know what will happen next". Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.|$|E

[...] "It was {{a work of}} genius and passion, {{the creation of a}} young man, and is as fresh and vital to-day as when it was written."

This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> be saved.
