5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E
5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "K" [...] type engine had 2-valve <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> and ran at 600-680 rpm. The Mark I [...] "RK" [...] and [...] "V" [...] types had 2-valve <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads.</b> The Mark II [...] "RK" [...] and [...] "V" [...] types had 4-valve <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads.</b> They ran at 750-900 rpm, {{and were}} {{available}} with turbochargers and intercoolers.|$|R
50|$|Ford Motor Company {{wanted a}} new engine with {{high-rise}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> {{to compete with}} the Hemi and threatened to pull out if Bill France Sr. didn't allow it. NASCAR's new rules, however, banned both Hemi engines and high-rise <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 3, 1902, en route to The Dalles, about five miles upriver from Vancouver, a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> blew out on Metlako, seriously (or {{slightly}} injuring a passenger.|$|E

2500|$|The J-3 is {{distinguished}} from its successors {{by having a}} cowl that exposes its engine's <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> — the exposed cylinders of any J-3's engine were usually fitted with sheet metal [...] "eyebrow" [...] air scoops to direct air over the cylinder's fins for more effective engine cooling in flight. Very few other examples exist of [...] "flat" [...] aircraft engine installations (as opposed to radial engines) in which the <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> are exposed. From the PA-11 on through the present Super Cub models, the cowling surrounds the <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
25|$|The second RK.25 (registered D-1701) {{was fitted}} with a Cirrus III engine, the {{improved}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> cooling of which required a slightly wider and raised cowling. It also had raised cockpit sides.|$|E
25|$|The first {{locomotive}} {{was delivered}} in June 1989 {{and sent to}} Derby for testing, which revealed a number of teething problems. Parts requiring modifications included the axle box suspension and the Mirlees engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{engine block}} and <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> were cast in one unit. Grinding {{of the engine}} valves was a regular {{maintenance}} requirement, and removing the engine valves for grinding required removing and disassembling the large cast iron engine.|$|E

25|$|All Swifts (export models) got a {{redesigned}} {{front and}} rear fascia {{as well as a}} new dashboard. GS sedans received power steering and new hub caps. The 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine received a new <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> assembly: the engine of the previous generation used the same block and corresponding components but featured a head with valves in a V-formation straddling a single camshaft with rocker arms on shafts, whereas now the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> assumed a much slimmer profile, owing to the valves now being in a vertical, inline configuration, actuated by inverted buckets also serving as hydraulic valve lash adjusters, all underneath a single overhead camshaft.|$|E
25|$|After {{filling a}} {{cylinder}}, a seal is welded onto the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> The cylinder is then washed. After being inspected for external contamination, the steel cylinder is stored, usually in an underground repository. In this form, the waste products {{are expected to}} be immobilized for thousands of years.|$|E
25|$|The local factory AYMESA {{produced}} {{a version of}} the Chevette starting in 1978. This version was called the AYMESA Cóndor. It had a glass fibre (fibreglass or glass reinforced plastic) body and a 1,500 cc engine with the higher compression <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> from GM Brazil to compensate for the Andean altitudes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> {{were held}} on with three studs and barrels slipped over the pistons. No Cylinder-head gasket was used, {{and since the}} wings unbolted in a few minutes, it was {{possible}} to remove the <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> and barrels, change the pistons or piston-rings and reassemble the top end very quickly, using only a few tools.|$|R

25|$|In 1964, M.C. Flemmings used {{unbonded}} sand for the process. The first North American foundry to use evaporative-pattern casting was the Robinson Foundry at Alexander City, Alabama. General Motors' {{first product}} using these processes was the 4.3 L, V-6 diesel <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> which {{were made in}} 1981 at Massena, New York.|$|E
25|$|The {{air flow}} bench {{can give a}} wealth of data about the {{characteristics}} of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> or whatever part is tested. The result of main interest is bulk flow. It is the volume of air that flows through the port in a given time. Expressed in cubic feet per minute or cubic meters per second/minute.|$|E
25|$|A two-speed, {{two-stage}} supercharger and intercooler {{were used}} to compress then cool the air-fuel mixture, following Griffon and Merlin practice. Starting was by Coffman starter. An auxiliary shaft driven by the lower crankshaft operated the main coolant pump, intercooler coolant pump, pressure and scavenge oil pumps and a fuel injection pump. Piston ring failures and <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> sealing problems were experienced during early flight testing.|$|E

25|$|The C11 used a C10 motor {{fitted with}} an {{overhead}} valve <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> The C11 frame was almost unchanged until 1951 when BSA added plunger rear suspension. Early gearboxes were weak and unreliable. The C11G was available with a three ratio gearbox and rigid frame or a four ratio gearbox and a plunger frame. Both models had better front brakes than earlier models. This model {{was a common}} commuter motorcycle, and many survive today.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{location}} of the camshaft, the cam operates the valves either directly or through a linkage of pushrods and rockers. Direct operation involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires the camshaft to be positioned {{at the top of the}} cylinders. In the past when engines were not as reliable as today this was seen as too much trouble, but in modern gasoline engines the overhead cam system, where the camshaft is on top of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> is quite common.|$|E
25|$|At {{the price}} of {{increased}} complication for a high pressure diesel type injection system, fuel consumption in the same range as small pre-chamber automotive and industrial diesels has been demonstrated with Curtiss-Wright's stratified charge multi-fuel engines, while preserving Wankel rotary advantages Unlike a piston and overhead valve engine, there are no valves which can float at higher rpm causing loss of performance. The Wankel is a more effective design at high revolutions with no reciprocating parts, far fewer moving parts and no <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
