This paper reviewed comparative studies on <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> {{family relationships}} in Latin America published between 2001 and 2015. These studies used data from different countries. The contents analyzed in these investigations were divided in five main themes: (a) family size, structure <b>and</b> diversity; (b) <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> family internal dynamics, including <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> family formation and dissolution, gender and social roles, social care <b>and</b> protection, <b>and</b> <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> family violence; (c) <b>couple,</b> family <b>and</b> health; (d) <b>couple,</b> family <b>and</b> education; <b>and,</b> (e) <b>couple,</b> family <b>and</b> economy. Although comparative studies in Latin America are based mainly on data from national censuses and have a demographic approach, the comparative perspective is proposed as an important mean for the integration of diverse disciplines and the development of international cooperation in studies about <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> family in Latin America. Macro and micro perspectives, as well as quantitative and qualitative data, may complement each other and contribute to a more integrated knowledge about <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> family relationships in the region. <b>Couple</b> <b>and</b> family internal structure and dynamics are related to Latin American society and culture in diverse ways.

System 1 had 34 classes, System 2 had 318 classes, System 3 383 classes, System 4 1055 classes, and System 5 1460 classes.

LCOM was used as cohesion variable; CBO, RFC, CA as coupling variables; WMC, NPM, NOC as size variables and DIT as inheritance variable. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were used to analyze the results. Tests of hypotheses were carried out to examine if there were significant relationships between cohesion and couplingvariables, cohesion and size variables, cohesion <b>and</b> inheritance variables, <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> inheritance variables, <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size variables, inheritance and size variables. The results of the study showed that in System 1, there were strong significant relationships between cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> (CBO, RFC), cohesion <b>and</b> size (WMC,NPM), <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size variables (WMC, NPM), and a weak relationship between Affarent <b>coupling</b> CA <b>and</b> inheritance (DIT).
