25|$|The {{formation}} of small particles of a substance {{with a narrow}} size distribution is an important process in the pharmaceutical and other industries. Supercritical fluids provide {{a number of ways}} of achieving this by rapidly exceeding the saturation point of a solute by dilution, depressurization or a combination of these. These processes occur faster in supercritical fluids than in liquids, promoting nucleation or spinodal decomposition over <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> yielding very small and regularly sized particles. Recent supercritical fluids have shown the capability to reduce particles up to a range of 5-2000nm.|$|E
25|$|Sc0.83–xB10.0–yC0.17+ySi0.083–z (x = 0.030, y = 0.36 and z = 0.026) has a {{cubic crystal}} {{structure}} with space group F3m (No. 216) and lattice constant a = 2.03085(5) nm.
