500|$|... "Venus" [...] is a synthpop and dance-pop {{song with}} four hooks, and {{references}} Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus. Gaga {{worked on the}} song with Madeon and {{was inspired by a}} number of things, chief among them were: Venus, the Roman goddess of love, the eponymous planet, as well as having sexual intercourse. Lyrically it also name-checks the planets in the solar system. Three accompanying artworks were designed for the single by Steven Klein, including one with a scorpion attached to Gaga's head, a picture of a dead bat, and a third showing her standing naked with an open <b>clam</b> <b>shell</b> superimposed above her shoulder and covering her lower face. A music video was initially conceived for the song, but never materialized. The track was later used during a sequence in the music video for Artpops third single, [...] "G.U.Y." [...] instead.|$|E

5000|$|Rinay is a malacological {{museum of}} natural history in Baku (Azerbaijan). It is also the first private museum in the country. It {{exhibits}} approximately 5,000 <b>clam</b> <b>shells</b> (the shells of bivalve molluscs) from 86 genera worldwide. The museum also displays hundreds of fossil <b>clam</b> <b>shells.</b> Some of these were obtained by exchange from the Austrian, Canadian, Argentine, Spanish, German, Ukrainian, Russian, Turkish and Indonesian paleontological university museums.|$|R

2500|$|The Haida {{people live}} in British Columbia. [...] To The Haida, Raven was the Bringer of Light and before Raven the world {{was nothing more than}} a {{gigantic}} flood. [...] Raven was the Maker of Things, as well as the Transformer, Magician and Healer. [...] Raven was bored of the world being nothing but water and decided to fly as the waters receded. [...] Once Raven became hungry, land was formed so he could land and find food. [...] It was at this point he noticed strange sounds coming from a gigantic <b>clam</b> <b>shell.</b> [...] Confused as to the sound, Raven decided he would begin singing to the <b>clam</b> <b>shell</b> in response to its sound, hoping to calm it with his pleasant sounds. [...] Raven did this because he was a beautiful singer. [...] Finally, a small creature emerged from the <b>clam</b> <b>shell.</b> [...] It had long black hair, a round head, brown smooth skin and two legs like Raven but no feathers. [...] This was the first of the First People.|$|E
2500|$|Station wagons {{now used}} a unique [...] {{wheelbase}} and were larger than ever before. Station wagons {{continued to use}} unique model names. The Kingswood Estate wagon {{was considered to be}} equivalent to the Chevrolet Caprice being the top level wagon. Unlike previous years, station wagons used unique rear suspension using a solid axle with leaf springs as opposed to coil springs and trailing arms on sedans and coupes. Also new was the [...] "Glide-Away" [...] <b>clam</b> <b>shell</b> style disappearing tailgate. This design had the glass upper portion of the tailgate slide into the roof, and the lower steel portion slide into a compartment under the floor, providing a completely open space with no tailgate in sight.|$|E
2500|$|The AMPA {{receptor}} (AMPAR) is {{the engine}} that drives excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). [...] While {{some forms of}} the AMPAR can conduct calcium, most AMPARs found in the neocortex do not. [...] The AMPAR, upon binding two glutamate molecules, undergoes a conformational change that resembles {{the opening of a}} <b>clam</b> <b>shell.</b> [...] This conformational change opens an ion channel within the AMPAR protein structure that allows sodium ions to flow into the cell and potassium ions to flow out (i.e. it is a mixed cation-conducting channel). [...] The Na+ and K+ permeabilities of the AMPAR channel are roughly equal, so when this channel is open the resulting change in membrane potential tends towards zero (a bit more than halfway between the equilibrium potentials EK and ENa). [...] This balance point is reached at around 0 mV (i.e. the reversal potential of the EPSP current is roughly 0 mV). [...] However, the postsynaptic membrane potential will not change by more than a few millivolts from resting potential with a single presynaptic release of glutamate, because not many AMPAR channels open. [...] The lifetime of the glutamate in the synaptic cleft is too short to allow more than a brief opening of the AMPAR channel, thus causing only a small depolarization. The open AMPAR channel is often considered to be non-calcium permeable, but this is only an approximation as AMPARs with certain subunit compositions will allow calcium through, albeit at different levels and frequency to NMDARs.|$|E

A colored hina-arare, bite-sized crackers flavored with sugar or soy sauce depending on the region, and hishimochi, a diamond-shaped colored rice cake, are served. Chirashizushi (sushi rice flavored with sugar, vinegar, topped with raw fish {{and a variety of}} ingredients) is often eaten. A salt-based soup called ushiojiru containing clams still in the shell is also served. <b>Clam</b> <b>shells</b> in food are deemed the symbol of a united and peaceful couple, because a pair of <b>clam</b> <b>shells</b> fits perfectly, and no pair but the original pair can do so.|$|R

40|$|Clams of {{the species}} Meretrix casta and Paphia malabarica are popular in Mulki estuary mainly for edible purpose, {{targeting}} domestic markets of Mulki and Mangalore.

Large-scale exploitation of these <b>clam</b> <b>shells</b> was observed from the estuary mainly for lime industry. This has generated income for fishers engaged in estuarine fishing activities and they have resorted to organized shell collection.

40|$|The Chilean methane seepage area (CMSA) is {{characterized}} by patchy islands of chemosynthetic communities embedded in carbonate outcrops or plain sediment areas.
