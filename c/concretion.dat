25|$|Iron sulfide concretions, {{such as the}} Kansas Pop rocks, {{consisting}} of either pyrite and marcasite, are nonmagnetic (Hobbs and Hafner 1999). On the other hand, iron sulfide concretions, which either are composed of or contain either pyrrhotite or smythite, will be magnetic to varying degrees (Hoffmann, 1993). Prolonged heating of either a pyrite or marcasite <b>concretion</b> will convert portions of either mineral into pyrrhotite causing the <b>concretion</b> to become slightly magnetic.|$|E

25|$|Depending on the {{environmental}} conditions present {{at the time of}} their formation, concretions can be created by either concentric or pervasive growth (Mozley, 1996; Raiswell and Fisher, 2000). In concentric growth, the <b>concretion</b> grows as successive layers of mineral precipitate around a central core. This process results in roughly spherical concretions that grow with time. In the case of pervasive growth, cementation of the host sediments, by infilling of its pore space by precipitated minerals, occurs simultaneously throughout the volume of the area, which in time becomes a <b>concretion.</b> Concretions are often exposed at the surface by subsequent erosion that removes the weaker, uncemented material.|$|E
2500|$|Similar boulder-size <b>concretions,</b> {{known as}} Katiki Boulders, {{are also found}} on the north-facing shore of Shag Point some [...] south of where the Moeraki Boulders are found. These <b>concretions</b> occur as both spherical {{cannonball}} <b>concretions</b> and flat, disk-shaped or oval <b>concretions.</b> Unlike the Moeraki boulders, some of these <b>concretions</b> contain the bones of mosasaurs and plesiosaurs.|$|R
50|$|These {{boulders}} {{consist of}} well-sorted, medium-grained sandstone, which is tightly cemented by calcite. The sandstone consists {{of more than}} 95 percent quartz sand. About 20 percent of the original sandstone, mostly feldspar grains, {{has been replaced by}} the calcite. Pyrite, which is now oxidized to goethite, occurs within the calcite cement of these <b>concretions</b> as microscopic crystals and very small, knobby <b>concretions.</b> The pyrite <b>concretions</b> typically are about 30 cm (1 foot) in diameter. Also, included within these calcite <b>concretions</b> are smaller calcite <b>concretions,</b> which have been engulfed by the growth of the larger <b>concretions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Rare earth element {{concentrations}} in ferromanganese <b>concretions</b> sampled from Slupsk Furrow in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone {{are similar to}} those of <b>concretions</b> from the Gulf of Bothnia. The lack of positive Ce anomalies in the <b>concretions</b> from Slupsk Furrow indicates that they are formed under less oxidizing conditions than spheroidal <b>concretions</b> from the Gulf of Bothnia. Mossbauer studies indicate that poorly crystalline lepidocrosite is the principal iron oxyhydroxide mineral present in these <b>concretions...</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>concretion</b> is a hard, compact mass {{of matter}} {{formed by the}} {{precipitation}} of mineral cement within the spaces between particles, and is found in sedimentary rock or soil. Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape, although irregular shapes also occur. The word 'concretion' {{is derived from the}} Latin con meaning 'together' and crescere meaning 'to grow'. Concretions form within layers of sedimentary strata that have already been deposited. They usually form early in the burial history of the sediment, before the rest of the sediment is hardened into rock. This concretionary cement often makes the <b>concretion</b> harder and more resistant to weathering than the host stratum.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} free-swimming and/or {{free-floating}} habits, ammonites often happened to live directly above seafloor waters so poor in oxygen as {{to prevent the}} establishment of animal life on the seafloor. When upon death the ammonites fell to this seafloor and were gradually buried in accumulating sediment, bacterial decomposition of these corpses often tipped the delicate balance of local redox conditions sufficiently to lower the local solubility of minerals dissolved in the seawater, notably phosphates and carbonates. The resulting spontaneous concentric precipitation of minerals around a fossil, a <b>concretion,</b> {{is responsible for the}} outstanding preservation of many ammonite fossils.|$|E
25|$|The {{process that}} created the septaria that {{characterize}} septarian concretions remains unclear. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, including the dehydration of clay-rich, gel-rich, or organic-rich cores; shrinkage of the concretion's center; expansion of gases produced by the decay of organic matter; or brittle fracturing or shrinkage of the <b>concretion</b> interior by either earthquakes or compaction (Pratt 2001; McBride et al. 2003). Septaria usually contain crystals, often calcite, that precipitated from circulating solutions. Siderite or pyrite coatings are also occasionally observed {{on the wall of}} the cavities present in the septaria, giving rise respectively to a panoply of bright reddish and golden colors.|$|E
30|$|Twenty-seven samples {{selected}} from the “Nanhai I” shipwreck were analyzed.

50|$|The {{iron oxide}} <b>concretions</b> {{found in the}} Navajo Sandstone exhibit {{a wide variety of}} sizes and shapes. Their shape ranges from spheres to discs; buttons; spiked balls; {{cylindrical}} hollow pipe-like forms; and other odd shapes. Although many of these <b>concretions</b> are fused together like soap bubbles, many more also occur as isolated <b>concretions,</b> which range in diameter from the size of peas to baseballs. The surface of these spherical <b>concretions</b> can range from being very rough to quite smooth. Some of the <b>concretions</b> are grooved spheres with ridges around their circumference.|$|R
30|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, many {{researchers}} were already {{devoted to the}} preservation of ancient shipwrecks and their cargo [4 – 8]. In 1980 s, with the discoveries and excavations of numerous ancient shipwrecks in China, more and more Chinese scientists started to work on the preservation of ancient artifacts from shipwrecks. Yang Heng and Tian Xingling in Institute of Cultural Relic Research and Archaeology of China applied XRF, XRD and SEM–EDS to analyze the corrosion of brown artifacts in the “Nan’ao I” shipwreck and found that the corrosion products mainly contained CaCO 3, CaSiO 3 and Ca 2 SiO 4. Based on the analyses, mechanical tools were chosen to remove the <b>concretions</b> [9, 10]. In 2013, Liu Wei and Zhang Zhiguo analyzed <b>concretions</b> of iron wares from three shipwrecks including “Nanhai I”, “Nan’ao I” and “Huaguangjiao I” with using multiple scientific techniques. They found that <b>concretions</b> from the “Huaguangjiao I” and “Nan’ao I” mainly contained iron (Fe 3 O 4, α-FeOOH, γ-FeOOH, Fe 2 O 3 and some Fe 8 (OOH) 16 Cl 1.3), and calcareous <b>concretions</b> (aragonite and calcite), while <b>concretions</b> from the “Nanhai I” shipwreck contained calcareous and siliceous <b>concretions.</b> After that, the forming mechanism of <b>concretions</b> was discussed [11]. Moreover, some scholars also applied chemical methods to remove the <b>concretions.</b> For instance, Ma Yanru in the National Museum of China detected the chemical composition of the <b>concretions</b> from the “Huaguangjiao” shipwreck. Based on her analyses, chemical resolution was chosen to remove the <b>concretions.</b> A combination of 3 % citric acid and 5 % EDTA- 2 Na was adopted to soften the <b>concretions</b> [12, 13]. In addition, Bao Chunlei of Hainan Provincial Museum also analyzed different types of iron <b>concretions</b> from the “Huaguangjiao I” shipwreck and chose EDTA- 2 Na (in order to dissolve calcareous <b>concretions</b> without harming the iron products) with 10 % sodium thioglycolate or 5 % oxalic acid (to dissolve the brown rust) to remove the <b>concretions</b> [14].|$|R
25|$|Detailed studies (i.e., Boles et al., 1985; Thyne and Boles, 1989; Scotchman, 1991; Mozley and Burns, 1993; McBride et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2005; Mozley and Davis, 2005) {{published}} in peer-reviewed journals {{have demonstrated that}} concretions form after sediments are buried but before the sediment is fully lithified during diagenesis. They typically form when a mineral precipitates and cements sediment around a nucleus, which is often organic, such as a leaf, tooth, piece of shell or fossil. For this reason, fossil collectors commonly break open concretions {{in their search for}} fossil animal and plant specimens. Some of the most unusual <b>concretion</b> nuclei, as documented by Al-Agha et al. (1995), are World War II military shells, bombs, and shrapnel, which are found inside siderite concretions found in an English coastal salt marsh.|$|E
500|$|Their {{conclusions}} {{have been}} disputed; {{soon after the}} initial description, other researchers published a paper where they asserted that the heart is really a <b>concretion.</b> As they noted, the anatomy given for the object is incorrect (for example, the [...] "aorta" [...] narrows coming into the [...] "heart" [...] and lacks arteries coming from it), it partially engulfs one of the ribs and has an internal structure of concentric layers in some places, and another <b>concretion</b> is preserved behind the right leg. The original authors defended their position; they {{agreed that it was}} a type of <b>concretion,</b> but one that had formed around and partially preserved the more muscular portions of the heart and aorta.|$|E
500|$|A coal ball {{is a type}} of <b>concretion,</b> varying {{in shape}} from an {{imperfect}} sphere to a flat-lying, irregular slab. Coal balls were formed in Carboniferous Period swamps and mires, when peat was prevented from being [...] by the high amount of calcite surrounding the peat; the calcite caused it to be turned into stone instead. As such, despite not actually being made of coal, the coal ball owes its name to its similar origins as well as its similar shape with actual coal.|$|E
5000|$|Both Cairncross and Heinrich {{argue that}} the grooves {{exhibited}} by these <b>concretions</b> are natural in origin. As proposed by Cairncross, the grooves represent fine-grained laminations within which the <b>concretions</b> grew. The growth of the <b>concretions</b> within {{the plane of the}} finer-grained laminations was inhibited because of the lesser permeability and porosity of finer-grained sediments relative to the surrounding sediments. Faint internal lamina, which corresponds to exterior groove, can be seen in cut specimens. A similar process in coarser-grained sediments created the latitudinal ridges and grooves exhibited by innumerable iron oxide <b>concretions</b> found within the Navajo Sandstone of southern Utah called [...] "Moqui marbles". Latitudinal grooves are also found on carbonate <b>concretions</b> found in Schoharie County, New York. The latitudinal ridges and grooves of the Moqui marbles are more pronounced and irregular than seen in the Klerksdorp (Ottosdal) <b>concretions</b> because they formed in sand that was more permeable than the fine-grained volcanic material in which the Klerksdorp (Ottosdal) <b>concretions</b> grew.|$|R
5000|$|Very similar <b>concretions</b> {{have been}} found within strata, as old as 2.7 to 2.8 billion years, {{comprising}} part of the Hamersley Group of Australia.

40|$|Ferromanganese <b>concretions</b> {{from ten}} {{stations}} in the Barents Sea have been analysed for 24 elements.

The <b>concretions</b> are compositionally similar to Baltic <b>concretions</b> but differ considerably from deep-ocean nodules, particularly in Cu, Ni and Co contents. Statistical analyses reveal distinct correlations between Mn, Na, Ba, Ni and Cu; the Mn-rich coatings showed enrichment of Mo, Zn and possibly Co in a Mn-phase. The iron phase holds high <b>concretions</b> of P and As. Two iron-rich <b>concretions</b> with high contents of P, Ca, Sr, Y, Yb and La were found east and northeast of Spitsbergen Banken, probably indicating upwelling of nutrient-rich, cold polar water along the Svalbard shelf...|$|R
500|$|Present-day {{knowledge}} of the original materials and methods used in construction of this particular Arab dhow stems largely from the shipwreck itself. The Jewel of Muscat reconstruction, a replica made as an exact copy of the wreck, {{has shown that the}} ship resembles a baitl qarib, a type of ship still found in Oman today. Amongst the hull of the shipwreck were large lumps of <b>concretion</b> containing artefacts from the ship's cargo dated to the Tang dynasty of China around 800 AD, and from where the wreck gets its other names, the [...] "Tang shipwreck" [...] or [...] "Tang treasure ship".|$|E
500|$|On {{the fifth}} day of fieldwork, Ryszard Gradziński, the {{geologist}} of the expedition, found a <b>concretion</b> of well-preserved bones which promised {{to belong to a}} fairly complete skeleton. Excavation started on the next day, revealing a nearly complete skeleton lacking only the head and neck. Until today, this specimen remains by far the most complete find of this dinosaur. The transport of the specimen out of rough terrain caused major technical problems. Stone blocks containing the fossils had to be moved some 580 m on improvised metal sledges made out of petrol drums before they could be loaded onto trucks. Because the skeleton was embedded in very hard sandstone layers, several blocks weighed over a ton. On the 9th of July, the packing of the skeleton into 35 crates started for transportation to Dalanzadgad; together, the crates weighed about 12 tons.|$|E
500|$|A study {{published}} in 2011 applied multiple lines of inquiry {{to the question of}} the object's identity, including more advanced CT scanning, histology, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. From these methods, the authors found the following: the object's internal structure does not include chambers but is made up of three unconnected areas of lower density material, and is not comparable to the structure of an ostrich's heart; the [...] "walls" [...] are composed of sedimentary minerals not known to be produced in biological systems, such as goethite, feldspar minerals, quartz, and gypsum, as well as some plant fragments; carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, chemical elements important to life, were lacking in their samples; and cardiac cellular structures were absent. There was one possible patch with animal cellular structures. The authors found their data supported identification as a <b>concretion</b> of sand from the burial environment, not the heart, with the possibility that isolated areas of tissues were preserved.|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} discovered Fezouata Biota, from the Early Ordovician (late Tremadocian to late Floian) of Morocco, preserves a diverse soft-bodied fauna.

500|$|The {{skeleton}} {{was collected}} {{on a farm}} named [...] "Pocho Sastre" [...] near Bajada Moreno in the Telsen Department of Chubut Province, Argentina. Because it was embedded in a large hematite <b>concretion,</b> a very hard kind of rock, preparation was complicated and progressed slowly. In 1985, Bonaparte published a note presenting Carnotaurus sastrei as a new genus and species and briefly describing the skull and lower jaw. The generic name (Latin carno [...] – [...] "flesh" [...] and taurus – [...] "bull") refers to the bull-like horns, while the specific name sastrei honors Angel Sastre, {{the owner of the}} ranch where the skeleton was found. A comprehensive description of the whole skeleton followed in 1990. After Abelisaurus, Carnotaurus was the second member of the family Abelisauridae that was discovered. For years, it was by far the best-understood member of its family, and also the best-understood theropod from the Southern Hemisphere. It was not until the 21st century that similar well-preserved abelisaurids were described, including Aucasaurus, Majungasaurus and Skorpiovenator, allowing scientists to re-evaluate certain aspects of the anatomy of Carnotaurus. The holotype skeleton is displayed in the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences, Bernardino Rivadavia; replicas can be seen in this and other museums around the world. Sculptors Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas manufactured a life-sized sculpture of Carnotaurus that is now on display in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This sculpture, ordered by the museum during the mid-1980s, is probably the first life restoration of a theropod showing accurate skin.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDolomite <b>concretions</b> from Paleoproterozoic organic-rich sediments of the Franceville Basin (Francevillian) {{in southeastern}} Gabon are studied.

The <b>concretions</b> often show a central pyrite-rich layer. The decrease in the carbonate content from the centre to the edges, and the carbon isotopic signal of carbonate within the <b>concretions</b> indicate a concentric growth of the <b>concretions</b> prior to compaction and precipitation of carbonate associated with the degradation of organic matter during early diagenesis. From its geochemical signature and texture, dolomite was not recrystallized. Moreover, the interior of the <b>concretions</b> shows well-preserved accumulations of microbial mats.

25|$|Secondary {{structures}} {{can also}} form by diagenesis or {{the formation of}} a soil (pedogenesis) when a sediment is exposed above the water level. An example of a diagenetic structure common in carbonate rocks is a stylolite. Stylolites are irregular planes where material was dissolved into the pore fluids in the rock. This can result in the precipitation of a certain chemical species producing colouring and staining of the rock, or the formation of <b>concretions.</b> <b>Concretions</b> are roughly concentric bodies with a different composition from the host rock. Their formation can be the result of localized precipitation due to small differences in composition or porosity of the host rock, such as around fossils, inside burrows or around plant roots.
