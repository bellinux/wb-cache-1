50|$|Starting {{at the end}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, well before the advent of {{electronic}} computers, data processing was performed using electromechanical machines called unit record equipment, electric accounting machines (EAM) or tabulating machines.Unit record machines came to be as ubiquitous in industry and government in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century as computers became in the last third. They allowed large volume, sophisticated data-processing tasks to be accomplished before electronic computers were invented and while they were still in their infancy. This data processing was accomplished by processing punched cards through various unit record machines in a carefully choreographed progression. This progression, or flow, from machine to machine was often planned and documented with detailed flowcharts that used standardized symbols for documents and the various machine functions. All but the earliest machines had high-speed mechanical feeders to process cards at rates from around 100 to 2,000 per minute, sensing punched holes with mechanical, electrical, or, later, optical sensors. The operation of many machines was directed by the use of a removable plugboard, control panel, or <b>connection</b> <b>box.</b> Initially all machines were manual or electromechanical. The first use of an electronic component was in 1940 when a gas triode vacuum tube replaced a relay in an IBM card sorter. Electronic components were used on other machines beginning in the late 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{the line}} cord and handset cord were secured by {{screw-down}} terminals at both ends, with a strain relief anchor.

Starting in 1955, all sets, except dark blue were equipped with color-matched cords as dyes and manufacturing methods became stable. By 1973, line cords were changed to a neutral gray color and from a round to a flat cross-section. As a customer option, telephone sets could be ordered for portability with four-prong plugs, but most sets were hard-wired to wall <b>connection</b> <b>boxes.</b> In the 1970s, much smaller modular connectors were introduced for {{both ends of the}} line cord as well as the handset cord to facilitate standard connection methods for third-party equipment within the FCC registration system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present the Collaborative Routing Architecture (CRA), a routing {{architecture}} specially designed to achieve high efficiency in hardware and competitive delay performance for a FPGA. This {{is done by}} enabling routing resource sharing between different types: (1) Long interconnects can be constructed with short bypass interconnects without sacrificing delay performance. (2) Switch <b>boxes</b> and <b>connection</b> <b>boxes</b> both are embedded in the switching core of the routing modules. Therefore routing resources such as MUXs can be shared between them on a per-mapping basis. (3) The switching core in CRA can dynamically extend its switching capability, whereas in a conventional switch box, switch matrix is predetermined and therefore static. These architectural features demonstrate significant performance improvements. Using the same logic placement, the CRA yields about 25 % reduction in the minimum routing channel width, 20 % improvement in overall delay performance for 20 largest MCNC benchmark circuits, when compared with a virtex-II style baseline FPGA.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the possibilities for shore side electricity in the ports of Västerås and Köping. A technical solution to connect the vessels to the local grid is suggested and the investigation is also aiming at {{an understanding of how}} the environment is affected by the use of shore side electricity. Furthermore, the costs of shore side electricity are considered. The maximum power demand of a vessel visiting the ports today is relatively small, but the ships visiting the ports in the future might have a larger power demand. The suggested dimension for the system is 5 MW and the result shows that the shore side electricity requires the power distribution to the ports to be expanded. The most useful solution in the ports is to connect the ships with 12 kV from a <b>connection</b> <b>box</b> in a pit at the quay. The investigation of the costs shows that it is cheaper for the ships to use electricity compared to the marine fuel. Without a frequency converter the installation costs for shoreside electricity is less expensive since the frequency converter corresponds to approximately 70 % of all the installation costs. By connecting only a few vessels with long visiting time in port tons of pollution can be reduced when the shoreside electricity is generated from renewable sources. Even with electricity generated partly from fossil fuel over 90 % of the pollutions can be reduced by using shoreside electricity...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid 90 's {{computer}} communication {{has become}} more and more common in cars and other auto mobiles. CAN based networks with sensors transmitting small data packets are utilized in the automotive industry to operate and supervise vehicles' functionality. To ease communication several higher layer protocols for CAN based networks have been developed. In some applications it is necessary to exchange information between networks using different protocols, and by connecting the two networks to a gateway, the information is translated and forwarded and intercommunication is enabled. This master thesis is conducted at Torqeedo GmbH, Munich. Theme of the thesis was “Designing and Development of a Data Logging and Monitoring Tool”. Term “data logging” refers to the gathering or collection of specific data over a period of time. Monitoring means evaluate the data we are logging. Tools for data logging and monitoring are used in variant application these days. In medical, in-vehicle data logging and environment monitoring. This data could be voltage, current temperature, Time stump, heartbeat of the patient, vehicle fuel level etc. To capture and log data various communication channels used.

40|$|Background. In recent years, {{superficial}} {{chest wall}} recurrence {{from breast cancer}} can be effectively treated by means of electrochemotherapy, {{with the majority of}} patients achieving response to treatment. Nevertheless, tumor spread along superficial lymphatic vessels makes this peculiar type of tumor recurrence prone to involve large skin areas and difficult to treat. In these cases, electroporation with standard, small size needle electrodes can be time-consuming and produce an inhomogeneous coverage of the target area, ultimately resulting in patient under treatment. Materials and methods. Authors designed and developed a prototype of a flexible grid electrode aimed at the treatment of large skin surfaces and manufactured a <b>connection</b> <b>box</b> to link the pulse applicator to a voltage pulse generator. Laboratory tests on potato tissue were performed in order to evaluate the electroporation effect, which was evaluated by observing color change of treated tissue. Results. A device has been designed in order to treat chest wall recurrences from breast cancer. According to preliminary tests, the new flexible support of the electrode allows the adaptability to the surface to be treated. Moreover, the designed devices can be useful to treat a larger surface in 2 - 5 minutes. Conclusions. Authors developed the prototype of a new pulse applicator aimed at the treatment of widespread superficial tumors. This flexible grid needle electrode was successfully tested on potato tissue and produced an electroporation effect. From a clinical point of view, the development of this device may shorten electrochemotherapy procedure thus allowing clinicians to administer electric pulses at the time of maximum tumor exposure to drugs. Moreover, since the treatment time is 2 - 5 min long, it could also reduce the time of anesthesia, thus improving patient recovery...|$|E
