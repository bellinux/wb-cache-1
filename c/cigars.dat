5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban <b>cigars</b> and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for <b>cigars</b> in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cigars</b> of the Pharaoh {{was adapted}} into a 1991 episode of The Adventures of Tintin {{television}} series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, Thierry Wermuth voiced {{the character of}} Tintin. In 2010, the television channel Arte filmed an episode of its documentary series, Sur les traces de Tintin (On the traces of Tintin), in Egypt exploring the inspiration and setting of the <b>Cigars</b> of the Pharaoh.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such <b>cigars</b> are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding <b>cigars</b> is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cigar</b> {{smoking is}} rapidly increasing. Studies have exposed {{the move to}} <b>cigar</b> smoking by smokers who do not {{necessarily}} believe <b>cigar</b> smoking is risky behav-ior. However, <b>cigar</b> smoking poses significant risk that leads to well-documented morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is a dearth of primary prevention efforts related to <b>cigar</b> smoking. Furthermore, the literature is lacking in program, prac-tice, and theory development {{as well as in}} the planning, execution, and evaluation of programs targeting <b>cigar</b> smoking cessation. A clear need exists to promote early prevention of <b>cigar</b> smoking, and to incorporate <b>cigar</b> smoking cessation into other tobacco cessation projects.

Visitors can walk through a 1920s-era <b>cigar</b> store and <b>cigar</b> factory; explore topics such as immigration, politics, and culture; and view <b>cigar</b> manufacturing and label printing artifacts, original furniture, and a model of a West Tampa <b>cigar</b> factory.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} <b>cigars</b> were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding <b>cigars</b> were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Tintin in America, Hergé had been keen to produce a mystery story, and had been inspired by the tabloid speculation surrounding an alleged Curse of the Pharaohs following the 1922 discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. <b>Cigars</b> of the Pharaoh proved a commercial success in Belgium, and Hergé followed it with The Blue Lotus, a story which continues many of the plot elements that began in <b>Cigars.</b> The series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1955, <b>Cigars</b> of the Pharaoh was re-drawn and coloured in Hergé's distinctive ligne-claire style by the cartoonist and his Studios Hergé team; during this process a number of minor plot elements were changed. The comic was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin. Critical reception of the story has been positive, with analysis being focused on its innovative narrative and stylistic choices, {{as well as its}} introduction of three recurring characters, the detectives Thomson and Thompson and Rastapopoulos, who in this album appears to be a friendly, but in the continuing album The Blue Lotus is revealed as a villain.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came to {{assemble}} and publish the story in book form, Hergé decided to divide it into two volumes and to give them each a new title; the first half, which is set in Egypt, Arabia, and India, he titled <b>Cigars</b> of the Pharaoh, while the second half, set in China, became The Blue Lotus. <b>Cigars</b> {{was the first of the}} Adventures published by Casterman, with whom Hergé had signed a contract in late 1933, although much to his annoyance, they delayed publication until the autumn of 1934, after the culmination of the summer holidays. In 1936, they successfully requested that he produce several colour plates to be inserted into the reprint of the book.|$|E

The Consolidated <b>Cigar</b> Corp. later became part of Altadis, formed in 1999 by a merger of the French and Spanish state tobacco monopolies.

5000|$|The [...] "head" [...] of the <b>cigar</b> {{is usually}} the end closest to the <b>cigar</b> band. The {{opposite}} end of the <b>cigar</b> is called the [...] "foot". The band identifies the type of the <b>cigar</b> and may be removed or left on. The smoker cuts the cap from the head of the <b>cigar</b> and ignites the foot of the <b>cigar.</b> The smoker draws smoke from the head of the <b>cigar</b> with the mouth and lips, usually not inhaling into the lungs.|$|R
5|$|Hergé took {{influence}} from the published works of French adventurer and gunrunner Henry de Monfreid, particularly his books Secrets of the Red Sea and The Hashish Cruise. Having {{lived through the}} First World War, Hergé disliked arms dealers, and used Monfreid {{as the basis for}} the gunrunner character in <b>Cigars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, {{exploding}} <b>cigars</b> {{used as a}} means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well represented as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the CIA of the US in the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding cigar purportedly given by Ulysses S. Grant to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and Ernest Hemingway after he pranked one of them with an exploding cigar.|$|E

5|$|However, Brazil's {{champion}} {{in the fight for}} the abolition of slavery was dying. While in Europe, the first symptoms of mouth cancer appeared. Rio Branco was a heavy smoker, and he would daily smoke up to thirty Cuban <b>cigars</b> specially imported for him from Havana. Until July 1880, he was still making appearances in Parliament to deliver speeches, but after that date he no longer attended. Rio Branco still kept a close watch on political developments, however, and continued to appear at meetings of the Council of State. He had already retired from teaching in 1877.|$|E
5|$|In July 1952, Kesselring was {{diagnosed}} with a cancerous growth in the throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty <b>cigars</b> per day but he quit smoking in 1925. Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, they were concerned that he might die in prison like Mälzer, which would be a public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.|$|E
50|$|The factory {{building}} located at 707 North 4th Street was built between 1898 and 1900, {{for the purpose}} of <b>cigar</b> production. The New York-based Bondy and Lederer <b>Cigar</b> Company were notable tobacco merchants and <b>cigar</b> manufacturers that employed 600 <b>cigar</b> rollers at their New York City headquarters in the late 19th century. They chose Allentown for their business expansion because of the area’s reputation for its high-quality tobacco production and <b>cigar</b> manufacturing. In 1913-1914, there were nearly 60 <b>cigar</b> manufacturing companies operating and contributing toward federal revenue of $482,505 made as a result of Allentown’s <b>cigar</b> production.|$|R
50|$|For decades <b>cigar</b> {{consumption}} {{among adolescents}} remained relatively constant; however, since the 1990s <b>cigar</b> use has surged in adolescent populations.

5|$|It {{was during}} the {{serialisation}} of <b>Cigars</b> that Wallez was embroiled in a scandal after {{he was accused of}} defaming the Bureau of Public Works. The accusation resulted in a legal case being brought against the newspaper, and in response its owners demanded Wallez's resignation, which was tended in August 1933. Without Wallez, Hergé became despondent, and in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 and 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Gygax was {{diagnosed}} with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came to believe that he would likely die on the operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to <b>cigars.</b>|$|E
5|$|As with Hergé's two {{previous}} stories, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, The Seven Crystal Balls {{was designed as}} part of a twofold story arc, to be concluded with the then yet unnamed Prisoners of the Sun. Hergé planned for the former story to outline a mystery, while the latter would see his characters undertake an expedition to solve it. His use of an ancient mummy's curse around which the narrative revolved was inspired by tales of a curse of the pharaohs which had been unearthed during the archaeologist Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb. This {{was not the first time}} that Hergé had been inspired by this tabloid story, having previously done so when authoring <b>Cigars</b> of the Pharaoh.|$|E

5|$|Both prank and {{intentionally}} deadly exploding <b>cigars</b> {{have been}} featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the exploding cigar in literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his death wish by eagerly smoking a cigar he knows {{to be of the}} prank explosive variety. Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an exploding cigar to Uncle Sam, and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding cigar.|$|E
5|$|Edward habitually smoked twenty {{cigarettes}} and twelve <b>cigars</b> a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, {{a type of}} cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with radium. Towards {{the end of his}} life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{was noted}} for his {{patronage}} of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself. Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch <b>cigars,</b> and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler. As {{a member of}} the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. Field Marshal Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund. For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted Collar of Annunziata. The award reduced him to tears.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cigar</b> Aficionado's book <b>Cigar</b> Companion {{suggests}} {{two sets}} of rules: one when among non-smokers, and another when among <b>cigar</b> smokers. One should never smoke except where smoking is appreciated, and care {{should be taken to}} minimize criticism from non-smokers from the smell of smoke in one's home or on one's clothes. Among other <b>cigar</b> smokers, it suggests rules governing sharing, cutting, lighting, humidors, women <b>cigar</b> smokers, and gifts. It concludes with one ironclad rule: never give a prank exploding <b>cigar,</b> and do not associate with anyone who does.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cigar</b> smoke, {{which is}} not {{typically}} inhaled, tastes of tobacco with nuances of other tastes. Many different things affect the scent of <b>cigar</b> smoke: tobacco type, quality of the <b>cigar,</b> added flavors, age and humidity, production method (handmade vs. machine-made), and more. A fine <b>cigar</b> can taste completely different from inhaled cigarette smoke. When smoke is inhaled, as is usual with cigarettes, the tobacco flavor is less noticeable than the sensation from the smoke. Some <b>cigar</b> enthusiasts use a vocabulary {{similar to that of}} wine-tasters to describe the overtones and undertones observed while smoking a <b>cigar.</b> Journals are available for recording personal ratings, description of flavors observed, sizes, brands, etc. <b>Cigar</b> smoking is in such respects similar to wine-tasting.|$|R
