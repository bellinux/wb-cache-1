5000|$|The {{building}} {{featured a}} glimmering 24-story blue-green heat-resistant glass {{and stainless steel}} <b>curtain-wall.</b> The <b>curtain-wall</b> was designed {{to reduce the cost}} of operating and maintaining the property. Its <b>curtain-wall</b> is completely sealed with no operating windows. This meant that much less dirt from the city would get into the building. The heat resistant nature of the glass also helped to keep air conditioning costs down. Additionally, [...] "the company draped a $50,000 'window-washing gondola' from the roof, a publicity stunt that used Lever-brand Surf soap to scrub the windows clean every six days." [...] The curtain wall was fabricated and installed by General Bronze Corp, the same facade contractor that had recently finished the Secretariat Building curtain wall at the United Nations Headquarters.|$|R
5000|$|The Scaliger castle (13th century). This {{is a rare}} {{example of}} medieval port fortification, which {{was used by the}} Scaliger fleet. The {{building}} of this complex started in 1277 by Mastino della Scala. It presents the typical Ghibelline swallowtail merlons and the <b>curtain-walls</b> (with three corner towers) in pebbles alternating with two horizontal bands of brick courses. The walls on the inside were finished with plaster with graffiti, simulating blocks of stone. The castle stands at a strategic place {{at the entrance to the}} peninsula. It is surrounded by a moat and it can only be entered by two drawbridges. The castle was established mainly as a protection against enemies, but also against the locals. The main room houses a small museum with local finds from the Roman era and a few medieval artifacts.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, there have been intense {{developments}} {{in the application of}} energy savings in buildings and high technology glass invented in all over the regions of the world. The complexity of curtain-glass used in buildings is always crucial related to energy savings and climatic nature in every region of the world. More specifically this paper will observe the direct and global solar radiation behaviours that have impacts on building envelopes in every orientation, horizontal and slope surfaces. Because of the limited data of the solar radiation behaviours in every region in Indonesia, public (building or residence owners) and solar hot water supplier actually do not know the accurate orientations and tilt angles for gaining maximum solar heat radiation. Moreover, the local or foreign building consultants often act in different ways for designing building façades-mostly by applying curtain-glasses instead of <b>curtain-walls</b> on the building without concerning the tropical hot humid climate of Surabaya. This paper will try to give an outline of the failures of the curtain-glass building facades built and some post-modern buildings outlook in fashions which cause energy wasting. Obviously, the sustainability of the curtain-glass building is wasting energy in term of applying air condition buildings in Surabaya...|$|E
40|$|Malaysian {{architect}} kenneth yeang has devleoped a 'bioclimatic' highrise offices design {{strategy that}} seeks to minimise energy use while not sacrificing thermal comfort expectations in tropical working environments. The design integrates sky courts, the peripheral positioning of service cores as solar buffers {{and the use of}} natural ventilation in transitional areas - such as the lift and ground floor lobbies. these 'biocliamtic' forms also use vertical landscaping vegetation and vertical sun shading to minimise heat gain and integrate roof forms for future photovoltaic electricity generation, a field study of two of Yeang's 'bioclimatic' highrises - Mesinaiga and UMNO revealed that there was inadequate shading on the estern curvature of the UMNO building while an occupant survey revealed that due to the impact of afternoon sun of the western facades of the Mseiniaga, both thermal and visual comfort levels were unsatisfactory. in both highrise offices, undesirable glazed openings had to be provided in the western facades for visual amenity and scenic views to site conditions, this paper investigates the compromise involved in regional 'typolog' of bioclimatic' deisgn and the 'ideal' climatic configuration. CONCLUSIONS the results showed energy savings can be achieved by yeang's bioclimatic models when compared to Yeang's typical modern sealed homogenous highrise models, in particular the UMNO tower which is partially naturally ventialted, but more significant savings can be achieved by adopting the improved 'bioclimatic' model. An overall energy reduction of 73 % in the ideal UMNO building when daylight control and photovoltaic panels are included is feasible. Yeang's deign is derived in the context of generating a regionalist 'typology' for tall buildings in a tropical climate. Such design attempts {{to move away from the}} monolithic block in order to develop a 'tropical Far Eastern hybrid form'. Yeang's philosophy sees the building envelope not only acts as a climatic sieving enclosure, but also its overall form is an abstaction from the traditional cultural context. Mesiniaga has since gained international recognition (awarded the Aga Khan award) due to its 'symbolic cultural contribution and architectural response to a rapidly developing environment in the East (Abel 1997), also its organitech' form due to the itnegration of its 'organic' spiralling balconies and advanced-technology. The current study highlights the level of compromise involved in responding to such a 'cultural' context, indicative of the difference between energy performance of Yeang's bioclimatic design and the more ideal cliamtic configuration. in a rapidly devleoping world, the necessity of In cultural' forms becomes a priority due to the increasing pre-dominance of 'western-type' forms of glass, <b>curtain-walls</b> and homogenous deigns in corporate office buildings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Automation in {{construction}} {{is one of}} the important issues in the field of robotics, but is distinct from factory automation (FA). Because of variations in materials and management, the role of automation {{in construction}} is often limited. A curtain wall is a large, heavy breakable object and requires precision installation, making it a better candidate for automated installation. A <b>curtain-wall</b> installation robot was built and tested at a real construction site and results were analyzed to refine the new concept of <b>curtain-wall</b> installation automation...|$|R

50|$|The {{choice of}} Portland Stone cladding, and bronze framed {{individual}} upright windows were denounced by Modern Movement critics, and the Centre's buildings {{have generally been}} regarded as dull. However, the extremely traditional cladding has meant that the buildings have weathered better than most of their contemporaries with concrete or aggregate-faced façades or <b>curtain-wall</b> glazing.|$|R
25|$|The 1292 treaty {{specified}} {{that the king}} could construct a fortress at {{the western end of}} the bridge. By 1302, a two-storey fortified tower had been completed.

50|$|Crabtree {{worked in}} {{collaboration}} with Slater & Moberly, with Professor Sir Charles Herbert Reilly (1874−1948), Crabtree's former mentor at Liverpool University, as a consultant. It {{was one of the}} first 20th century uses of the glass <b>curtain-wall</b> in England, and was influenced by the work of Erich Mendelsohn, the Prussian architect, who lectured twice at Liverpool University. Reilly and Crabtree also collaborated on the John Lewis Department Store in Oxford Street, London.|$|R
50|$|In April 2005, {{the press}} {{reported}} that a glass panel two-thirds up the tower had fallen to the plaza beneath. The plaza was sealed off, but the building remained open. A temporary covered walkway, extending across the plaza to the building's reception, was erected to protect visitors. Engineers examined the other 744 glass panels on the building. The cost of repair was covered by main contractor Skanska and <b>curtain-wall</b> supplier Schmidlin (now called Schmidlin-TSK AG).|$|R
50|$|<b>Curtain-wall</b> {{systems are}} {{typically}} designed with extruded aluminum members, although the first curtain walls {{were made of}} steel. The aluminium frame is typically infilled with glass, which provides an architecturally pleasing building, as well as benefits such as daylighting. However, parameters related to solar gain control such as thermal comfort and visual comfort {{are more difficult to}} control when using highly glazed curtain walls. Other common infills include: stone veneer, metal panels, louvres, and operable windows or vents.|$|R
50|$|The Dan Stowers Office Building is a {{historic}} commercial building at 1516 West 3rd Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a single-story masonry structure, with an International style design by architect Dan Stowers, Sr. It was built in 1961, and served as the office of Stowers and his son, Dan Jr., until 2013. The building is notable for its Mid-Century Modern design, featuring <b>curtain-wall</b> windows, porcelain enamel panels, and blocks of haydite in its construction.|$|R
60|$|Before his {{attention}} had long strayed over the incident which romanticized that utilitarian structure, {{he became aware}} that he was not the only person who was looking from the terrace towards that point of the compass.

It was not until Schliemann exposed the contents of the graves which lay just inside the gate, that scholars recognized the advanced stage of art to which prehistoric dwellers in the Mycenaean citadel had attained.|$|R
50|$|Bayons Manor, Tealby, Lincolnshire. Built between 1836 and 1842 for Charles Tennyson D'eyncourt, to designs by William Nicholson {{and with}} {{contributions}} made by Anthony Salvin. It consisted of castellated mansion with a moat, machicolated and embattled towers, <b>curtain-wall</b> and great hall with a hammer-beam roof. It was situated on rising ground {{to provide a}} picturesque scene and to give the widest views. The house was occupied by troops during the Second World War, and was sold in 1944. After many years of neglect it was blown up in 1964.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s {{began the}} {{widespread}} use of aluminium extrusions for mullions. Aluminum offers the unique advantage of being able to be easily extruded into nearly any shape required for design and aesthetic purposes. Today, the design complexity and shapes available are nearly limitless. Custom shapes can be designed and manufactured with relative ease. The Omni San Diego Hotel curtain wall in California (developed by JMI Realty, designed by architectural firm Hornberger and Worstell, and constructed by AGA), {{is an example of a}} unitized <b>curtain-wall</b> system with integrated sunshades.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has an unusual geometric shape where not one panel {{is parallel to}} any grid. The east façade bulges out slightly from its base, reaching its maximum width at the top floors. The curved and twisted shape of east façade is aimed to correspond spatially with Sydney Opera House and to represent the sublime marine environment of the harbour. The exterior glass <b>curtain-wall</b> extends beyond the main frame, creating an illusion of its independence. The steel spire attached to the north facade is 75 m in length.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{was then}} slowly {{abandoned}} by the aristocracy. In the early sixteenth century, the former great hall of the 14th century along the northern <b>curtain-wall,</b> was destroyed. The castle was then confiscated by the French crown under King Francis I who offered {{it to one of}} his mistresses. In 1795, Suscinio was temporarily occupied by the royalists coming from Quiberon and heading {{to the north of the}} department. Written off in the 17th and 18th centuries, the castle was used off-and-on as a stone quarry until the Revolution.|$|R
50|$|The Federal Building of Little Rock, Arkansas {{is located}} at 700 West Capitol Avenue, {{adjacent}} to the Richard Sheppard Arnold United States Post Office and Courthouse. It is a large seven-story Modern structure, occupying an entire city block, built in 1962 to the designs of the local firms of Swaim & Allen & Associates and Ginocchio, Cromwell & Associates. Utilizing modern <b>curtain-wall</b> construction, its exterior (on all four sides) is dominated on the upper floors by a narrow windows separated by limestone spandrels. The south-facing main entrance is recessed, consisting of several pairs of double doors, with flanking gold-colored grillwork.|$|R
50|$|Like another Umayyad desert castle, Qasr Mshatta, Qasr Tuba {{was built}} using a {{combination}} of limestone and bricks. Its plan consists of an oblong enclosure measuring 140 m by 72 m, almost a double square, or 2 symmetrical enclosures joined through a long central corridor. The enclosure walls are supported by semi-round towers, except on the north side where the two gateways are flanked by two square rooms. The northwestern section is nearly intact and several lengths of <b>curtain-wall</b> exist on the western side. The rest of the building, which was never completed, is not preserved.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Victorian college {{building was}} extended by Sir Edward Maufe in 1937. The Victorian building {{was destroyed in}} the Blitz in 1940 but Maufe's 1930s extension survived. The remains of the Victorian building were cleared and a new college building designed by Charles Cowles-Voysey and Brandon Jones was completed in 1958 and opened by Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother. It was decorated by fabulous murals by Edward Bawden, John Piper and Martin Froy. A further bronze <b>curtain-wall</b> extension followed in 1973 designed by John Winter, and another in 1982 clad in corrugates Corten-steel, {{on the eastern side}} of King Edward's Walk.|$|R
25|$|The ancient Wery Wall was {{identified}} in 1950 {{as the north}} wall of the 4th-century fort, which constituted a drastic remodelling of the 3rd-century one, while retaining the same orientation. Exceptionally the later fort is the only example in north-west Britain of a 4th-century type, with massive <b>curtain-wall</b> and projecting bastions typical of the Saxon Shore or in Wales. The extension of this technique {{as far north as}} Lancaster shows that the coast between Cumberland and North Wales was not left defenceless after the attacks on the west coast and the disaster in the Carausian Revolt of AD 296, following on from those under Albinus in AD 197.|$|R
