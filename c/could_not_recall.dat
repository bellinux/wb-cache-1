5|$|A {{nurse at}} Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed {{years after the}} patient's release from the asylum that the woman had {{told her she was}} another {{daughter}} of the Tsar, Anastasia, in the autumn of 1921. However, the patient herself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> the incident. Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim, or weave it into their narrative.|$|E
5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused because he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> the instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton would also {{have been accused of}} recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached its destination at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners. Wilson repeated {{that he was going}} to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning. Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> Wilson, as to do so would be to lose Lobengula for sure.|$|E

5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later said that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist {{in one of the}} images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E
5|$|In August, Breckinridge {{traveled}} to Virginia's Sweet Springs {{to improve his}} health. He visited family and friends while there, but the exact dates and locations he visited are not known. At some point, he obtained a draft of resolutions written by Vice President Thomas Jefferson denouncing the recently-enacted Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson wished to keep his authorship secret, and Breckinridge accepted credit for them during his life. In 1814, John Taylor revealed Jefferson's authorship; Breckinridge's grandson, John C. Breckinridge, wrote Jefferson for confirmation of Taylor's claims. Cautioning that {{the passage of time}} and his failing memory might cause him to inaccurately recount the details, Jefferson responded that he, Breckinridge, Wilson Nicholas, and possibly James Madison met at Monticello, at a date Jefferson <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall,</b> to discuss the need for resolutions denouncing the Alien and Sedition Acts. They decided that Jefferson would pen the resolutions and that Breckinridge would introduce them in the Kentucky legislature upon his return to that state.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{afterwards}} the man {{and child}} reached the cave referred to. On entering, they were surprised to find Young himself there before them. He was reading the Bible, and Adams <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help <b>recalling</b> his previous visit, when he had found poor Fletcher Christian similarly occupied.|$|R
50|$|These {{observations}} led Freud to theorize {{that the}} problems faced by hysterical patients could be associated to painful childhood experiences that <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>recalled.</b> The influence of these lost memories shaped the feelings, thoughts and behaviours of patients. These studies contributed {{to the development of}} the psychoanalytic theory.|$|R
60|$|Having thus unburdened {{her mind}} {{the old woman}} relapsed into the {{previous}} century, from which she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>recalled.</b> May, therefore, made a diligent search for the letter, and found it at last under a cracked teapot on the mantelpiece, where Mrs Flint had told Miss Lillycrop to place it for safety.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{successful}} realisation of the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey on screen in The Deadly Assassin, producer Graham Williams wanted another Gallifrey story. Script editor Anthony Read approached David Weir {{with whom he}} had worked before. Weir's script, a six-part story, was planned as the final story of Season 15 and was commissioned on 18 July 1977. Weir's script had elements drawn from Asian cultures, and included a race of cat-people with links to Gallifrey. Scenes included a gladiatorial duel in a stadium filled with cat-people. Read and director Gerald Blake, upon reading the finished script, determined that the story would be impossible to shoot on Doctor Whos budget and the story was abandoned mid-August 1977. With only two weeks to spare before filming, Read and Williams quickly co-wrote a replacement script in the form of The Invasion of Time. When asked about Weir's story at a fan convention years later, Williams <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> its title and made up the name The Killer Cats of Geng Singh, by which title the story became widely known in fan circles.|$|E
5|$|Maylam {{concluded}} {{that at the}} time, {{there was only one}} hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians – one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina – and a man named Robert Laming who lead the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.|$|E
25|$|In August 2006, {{on the eve}} of Pakistan's Twenty20 {{international}} against England in Bristol, Bob Woolmer {{was forced}} to defend his reputation when it was claimed Pakistani players lifted the seam of the ball when {{he was in charge of}} the team. Former International Cricket Council match referee Barry Jarman alleged that during the 1997 triangular one-day tournament involving South Africa, Zimbabwe and India, a match ball, still in Jarman’s possession, that was confiscated after just 16 overs showed evidence of tampering by Woolmer’s team. Woolmer <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> any such incident and he denied advocating ball-tampering. He also indicated that he contacted the match officials from that game who also <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> any such incident.|$|E
6000|$|Tarzan {{heard the}} catch click {{as it was}} {{released}} from the inside.

5000|$|Virginia went to Hollywood at a {{young age}} to pursue a career in acting after winning a beauty pageant. Some members of her family {{maintained}} that she took a stage name because she felt that her given name was too [...] "old-fashioned" [...] and that she was reaching for her paternal grandmother's maiden name, Cravens, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> quite <b>recall</b> it properly.|$|R
60|$|As {{we entered}} them I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help <b>recalling</b> Lumley's {{remarks about the}} risks we ran in {{descending}} rapids; but no thought of actual danger occurred to me until I saw Blondin, who was our bowman, draw in his oar, grasp a long pole with which he had provided himself, and stand up in the bow, the better to look out inquiringly ahead.|$|R
25|$|In October 2009, {{the courts}} ruled in CREW's favor and the US Justice Department was {{required}} to release a transcript of Cheney's testimony to the FBI regarding the Plame affair. According to Cheney’s testimony, Cheney <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> information 72 times.|$|E
25|$|Government {{officials}} {{today have}} {{no record of}} any such Naval Investigative Service report, although they suggest {{that it could have}} been lost or destroyed. Lewy later said that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> if he had actually seen the alleged report or simply been told of its contents.|$|E
25|$|Music {{has been}} shown to improve memory in several situations. In one study of musical effects on memory, visual cues (filmed events) were paired with {{background}} music. Later, participants who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> details of the scene were presented with the background music as a cue and recovered the inaccessible scene information.|$|E
60|$|He sighed, {{folded his}} arms, his chin dropped on his breast, {{and it was}} a long time before he started forward from that pose, with the {{recollection}} that he had made up his mind to do something important that day. What it was he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> immediately <b>recall,</b> yet he made no effort of memory, for he was uneasily certain that he would remember presently.|$|R

6000|$|Why he said that, Coventry <b>could</b> <b>not</b> tell, but {{the words}} passed his lips hastily and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>recalled.</b> Jean Muir took the {{announcement}} oddly enough. She shrugged her shoulders {{with an air of}} extreme annoyance, and said almost rudely, [...] "Then you should be; you will be soon. But that is nothing to me. Miss Beaufort wishes me gone, and I am too proud to remain and become the cause of disunion in a happy family. No, I will go, and go at once." ...|$|R
25|$|During the trial, Thomson <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> {{the lyrics}} to the songs that she {{allegedly}} wrote, nor the structures of the libretto she claimed to have created. The judge ruled against her and gave the Jonathan Larson Estate full credit and right to Rent. A federal appellate court upheld the original ruling on appeal. In August 1998, the case was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.|$|E
25|$|He told detectives in December 2003 that {{he lived}} {{most of his life}} in a fog and that he had blacked out {{memories}} of murdering most of his victims. He said he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> how many of them there were or why he had chosen them. In some cases, Cullen adamantly denied committing any murders at a given facility. But after reviewing medical records, he admitted that he was involved in patient deaths.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} about Genie's early life, but available records indicate {{that for her}} first months she displayed relatively normal development. Genie's mother later recalled that Genie was not a cuddly baby, did not babble much, and resisted solid food. At times she said that at some unspecified point Genie spoke individual words, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> them, but at other times she said that Genie had never produced speech of any kind. Researchers never determined which was the truth.|$|E

As Sebastian lay there, a marble figure, with his keen eyes closed and his pinched, thin face whiter and serener than ever, I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help gazing at him with some pangs of recollection. I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> avoid <b>recalling</b> the time when his very name was to me a word of power, and when the thought of him roused on my cheek a red flush of enthusiasm.

5000|$|In October 2014, {{during the}} final stage of debate of the Bill in the Commons, opponents of the recall process pressed for assurances that voters <b>could</b> <b>not</b> begin <b>recall</b> {{petitions}} on the basis of views held or speeches made, with Labour MP Geraint Davies calling misuse of the process would be an [...] "intrinsic corruption of our democracy". Labour MP Frank Dobson opposed recall as a threat to [...] "hinder social progress" [...] by [...] "vested interests".|$|R

25|$|His {{tenure at}} Harvard almost ended before it began, {{when he was}} injured in an {{automobile}} accident. Boring fractured his skull and {{had to stay in}} the hospital for six weeks. Also, the accident resulted in temporary retroactive and progressive amnesia. The experience caused Boring to question {{what it means to be}} conscious. If a person <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> what the person had said moments afterward, could he really be considered conscious? Such questions become a lifelong endeavor for Boring to try to answer.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} year of the investigation, seven coins were seized or voluntarily turned in to the Secret Service and were {{subsequently}} destroyed at the Mint; an eighth coin was recovered the following year and met the same fate. In 1945, the investigation identified the alleged thief and his accomplice, Switt, who admitted to selling the nine (located) coins, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> how he obtained them. The Justice Department tried to prosecute them, but the statute of limitations had passed. A tenth coin was recovered and destroyed in 1952.|$|E
25|$|The pages {{purport to}} be three {{computer}} printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the afternoon Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session, was In and out/sat around and laid down a ref, shorthand for a reference vocal, {{the equivalent of a}} first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, {{said in an interview that}} he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We would have heard about it, Mr. Alfred said.|$|E
60|$|Afterwards, in {{the course}} of the morning, we had a short visit from Ignosi, on whose brows the royal diadem was now bound.

25|$|Secret {{negotiations}} with Yasser Arafat's PLO organization {{led to the}} Oslo Accords, which won Peres, Rabin and Arafat the Nobel Peace Prize. But in 2002, members of the Norwegian committee that awards the annual Nobel Peace Prize stated they regretted that Mr Peres' prize <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>recalled.</b> Because he had not acted to prevent Israel's re-occupation of Palestinian territory, he had not {{lived up to the}} ideals he expressed when he accepted the prize, and he was involved in human rights abuses.|$|R
50|$|Most looted {{documents}} and books, {{sent to the}} Soviet Union by Gosfond, were stored haphazardly, seldom catalogued often destroyed by neglect and inattention. Items of scientific value were piled up in smaller public libraries and agricultural stations, where the books were never catalogued and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>recalled</b> for any useful activities. The origins of foreign acquisitions including the 1946 Gosfond delivery of 1,857 crates of books to libraries in Moscow were carefully concealed from librarians {{as well as the}} general public.|$|R
