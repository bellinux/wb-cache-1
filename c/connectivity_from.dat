25|$|The {{only means}} of {{connectivity}} for the village is by road. The Vijayawada–Amaravathi Road connects the village with city of Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh capital city areas of Undavalli, Penumaka, Rayapudi. While, the Guntur–Amaravathi Road connects it with the district headquarters, Guntur. It also has road <b>connectivity</b> <b>from</b> Sattenapalle, Mangalagiri and Krosuru. APSRTC operates buses from major bus stations like, NTR bus station of Guntur and Pandit Nehru bus station of Vijayawada. The village has no rail connectivity.|$|E
25|$|The Circle Line {{was first}} named as the Marina Line in May 1998, {{initially}} planned as a 12-station underground line, starting from Chinatown and Dhoby Ghaut via the National Stadium to either Kallang or Paya Lebar station. However, the Chinatown leg was later truncated and {{was reduced to}} 6 stations up to Stadium station. On the other hand, a further extension towards Upper Paya Lebar was added in the year 2000. The Marina Line was also merged with an LRT line that goes from Paya Lebar to Buona Vista via Serangoon and Bishan to form Circle Line Stage 3 and 4 in 2001. Circle Line Stage 5 was finalised in February 2002 when Stage 4 was extended from Buona Vista to World Trade Centre to close up the link and to provide <b>connectivity</b> <b>from</b> the west to Sentosa, and it became the full Circle Line in the end. Stations in Circle Line that {{were a part of}} the original Marina Line plans include Dhoby Ghaut, Bras Basah, Esplanade, Promenade, Nicoll Highway and Stadium. The part of the previously planned Marina Line from Chinatown to Promenade is now part of the Downtown Line.|$|E
