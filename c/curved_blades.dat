5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and <b>curved</b> <b>blades,</b> with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E

Early in the 1960s, Chicago Black Hawks teammates Stan Mikita and Bobby Hull began experimenting with <b>curved</b> <b>blades,</b> noticing that different bends made shots more unpredictable for goaltenders.

40|$|Present work {{compares the}} mass {{transfer}} coefficient (kLa) and power draw capability of stirred tank employed with Rushton and <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) techniques in single and double impeller cases. Comparative analysis for different boundary conditions and mass transfer model {{has been done to}} assess their suitability. The predicted local kLa has been found higher in <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller than the Rushton impeller, whereas stirred tank with double impeller does not show variation due to low superficial gas velocity. The global kLa predicted has been found higher in <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller than the Rushton impeller in double and single cases. <b>Curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller also exhibits higher power draw capability than the Rushton impeller. Overall, stirred tank with <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller gives higher efficiency in both single and double cases than the Rushton turbin...|$|R

2500|$|Giromill: A subtype of Darrieus turbine with straight, {{as opposed}} to <b>curved,</b> <b>blades.</b> The cycloturbine variety has {{variable}} pitch to reduce the torque pulsation and is self-starting. The advantages of variable pitch are: high starting torque; a wide, relatively flat torque curve; [...] a higher coefficient of performance; more efficient operation in turbulent winds; and a lower blade speed ratio which lowers blade bending stresses. Straight, V, or <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> may be used.|$|E
2500|$|Twist-locking {{connectors}} {{were first}} invented by Harvey Hubbell III in 1938 and [...] "Twist-Lock" [...] remains a registered trademark of Hubbell Incorporated, although {{the term is}} used generically to refer to NEMA locking connectors manufactured by any company. Locking connectors use <b>curved</b> <b>blades.</b> Once pushed into the receptacle, the plug is twisted and its now-rotated blades latch into the receptacle. To unlatch the plug, the rotation is reversed. The locking coupling makes for a more reliable connection in commercial and industrial settings, where vibration or incidental impact could disconnect a non-locking connector.|$|E
50|$|Though <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> are {{as old as}} {{the sword}} itself, they did not become {{widespread}} in Asia and the Middle East until after the dominance of the Mongol Empire.
