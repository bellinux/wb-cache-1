40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} recent interest in studying consumer behavior in sponsored search environments. Sponsored search {{is the fastest}} growing form of advertising on the Internet. A number of factors have contributed to this growth. The ads tend to be highly targeted and offer a higher return on investment for advertisers compared to other marketing methods. In addition the large audience it offers {{has led to a}} wide-spread adoption of search engine advertising. When a user issues a query on the search engine, sponsored results are displayed alongside organic search results. The organic search results are links relevant to the query and are ranked in order of their relevance. The sponsored results are ads submitted by advertisers. The advertisers submit bids for keywords that are relevant to them, along with these ads. When a user enters a query, the search engine identifies the advertisers bidding on keywords closely related to the query and uses data on bids and ad quality/performance to rank order the ads that appear in the list of sponsored results. The most widely used pricing model is the pay <b>per</b> <b>click</b> model, in which the advertiser pays only when a user clicks on his ad. The advertiserâ€™s <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>click</b> or <b>cpc</b> is determined using a generalized second price auction, i. e. whenever a user clicks on an ad in position, the advertiser pays an amount equal to the minimum bid needed to secure that position. One of the attractive features of sponsored search {{is that it is a}} highly measurable form of advertising. Data on consumer click and purchase patterns have been used to study consumer behavior and advertiser strategies. Several researchers have built random utility models to study the effect of ad position, keyword length, presence or absence of brand name, etc. on the clickthrough rate (ctr) of the ad.

50|$|Pay per click (PPC) and <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>click</b> (<b>CPC)</b> {{are both}} forms of CPA (cost per action) with the action being a click.

50|$|Pay per click {{marketing}} can be {{done through}} ad networks such as Google Adwords or by paying for placement on a specific site.
