Other masqueraders there were, of a less marked description. Men were disguised as women, and women as men--children wore the dress of aged people, and tottered with <b>crutch-sticks</b> in their hands, furred gowns on their little backs, and caps on their round heads--while grandsires assumed the infantine tone as well as the dress of children. Besides these, many had their faces painted, and wore their shirts over the rest of their dress; while coloured pasteboard and ribbons furnished out decorations for others. Those who wanted all these properties, blacked their faces, and turned their jackets inside out; and thus the transmutation of the whole assembly into a set of mad grotesque mummers, was at once completed.|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{severely}} deforming {{rheumatoid arthritis}} and impaired {{function of the}} upper extremity are often unable to use conventional walking aids. This report describes 42 such patients who were equipped with altogether 75 individually manufactured, lightweight walking aids (12 crutches, 12 forearm-crutches, 39 <b>crutch-sticks</b> and 12 sticks). A plaster cast of the patient's grip as well as analysis of the integrated function of the shoulder-elbow-wrist was used when preparing the walking aid. It was thereby possible to produce suitable walking aids for all but one patient. At follow-up after 12 - 18 months, of use, most patients belonging to functional classes II and III were satisfied with their walking aid(s) and 22 considered it/them indispensable. However, in 4 patients, progressive disease with increased disease activity/deteriorating hand function and in 3 patients increasing shoulder pain reduced their usability. Lack of motivation was one reason for low use intensity. Follow-up demonstrated that most patients {{were able to use}} these walking aids without detectable negative effects on the upper extremity. The durability of the walking aid was satisfactory. Thus an individually moulded handle on an adapted lightweight walking aid is important helping patients with severely deforming arthritis to maintain independent ambulation, and should be made more widely obtainable...|$|E
60|$|With this admonition, {{she blew}} her work candles out, leaving {{him to the}} light of the fire, and, taking her big door-key in her pocket and her <b>crutch-stick</b> in her hand, marched off.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few moments}} the black bonnet and the <b>crutch-stick</b> were on duty, the good Jew was left in {{possession}} of the house, and the dolls' dressmaker, {{side by side in}} a chaise with Mortimer Lightwood, was posting out of town.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{had an idea}} among us, I think,' said Alice, with {{a melancholy}} smile, 'we four, that Miss Grimmer {{would prove to be}} the wicked fairy, and would come in at the christening with her <b>crutch-stick,</b> and give the child a bad gift. Was there {{anything}} of that sort? Answer, William.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{could make}} you,' said Sloppy, {{surveying}} the room, 'I {{could make you}} a handy set of nests to lay the dolls in. Or I could make you a handy little set of drawers, to keep your silks and threads and scraps in. Or I could turn you a rare handle for that <b>crutch-stick,</b> if it belongs to him you call your father.' ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} Miss Abbey's eyes had possessed {{themselves}} of the small figure of Miss Jenny Wren. For the closer observation of which, Miss Abbey laid aside her newspaper, rose, and looked over the half-door of the bar. The <b>crutch-stick</b> seemed to entreat for its owner leave {{to come in and}} rest by the fire; so, Miss Abbey opened the half-door, and said, as though replying to the crutch-stick: ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Wren {{expected}} him. He {{could see}} her through the window {{by the light of}} her low fire--carefully banked up with damp cinders that it might last the longer and waste the less when she was out--sitting waiting for him in her bonnet. His tap at the glass roused her from the musing solitude in which she sat, and she came to the door to open it; aiding her steps with a little <b>crutch-stick.</b>|$|R
60|$|Set {{down by the}} omnibus at {{the corner}} of Saint Mary Axe, and trusting to her feet and her <b>crutch-stick</b> within its precincts, the dolls' {{dressmaker}} proceeded to the place of business of Pubsey and Co. All there was sunny and quiet externally, and shady and quiet internally. Hiding herself in the entry outside the glass door, she could see from that post of observation the old man in his spectacles sitting writing at his desk.|$|R
6000|$|The {{three pieces}} of stick were three broken and frayed {{fragments}} of a stout lithe cane. Miss Jenny taking them wonderingly, and the gentleman repeating with a grin, 'Mr Alfred Lammle, if you'll be so good. Compliments, on leaving England,' the lady and gentleman walked away quite deliberately, and Miss Jenny and her <b>crutch-stick</b> went up stairs. 'Lammle, Lammle, Lammle?' Miss Jenny repeated as she panted from stair to stair, 'where have I heard that name? Lammle, Lammle? I know! Saint Mary Axe!' ...|$|R
60|$|There {{might have}} been a touch of {{impertinence}} in the last words; on the other hand, it {{might have been}} but the native grace of Mr Fledgeby's manner. Mr Fledgeby sat on a stool with a foot on the rail of another stool, and his hat on. Mr Twemlow had uncovered on looking in at the door, and remained so. Now the conscientious Twemlow, knowing what he had done to thwart the gracious Fledgeby, was particularly disconcerted by this encounter. He was as ill at ease as a gentleman well could be. He felt himself bound to conduct himself stiffly towards Fledgeby, and he made him a distant bow. Fledgeby made his small eyes smaller in taking special note of his manner. The dolls' dressmaker sat in her corner behind the door, with her eyes on the ground and her hands folded on her basket, holding her <b>crutch-stick</b> between them, and appearing to take no heed of anything.|$|R
