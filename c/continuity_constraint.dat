5000|$|Routing is a {{key control}} and {{operational}} aspect of optical mesh networks. In transparent or all-optical networks, routing of connections is tightly linked to the wavelength selection and assignment process (so-called Routing and Wavelength Assignment, or [...] "RWA"). This {{is due to the}} fact that the connection remains on the same wavelength from end-to-end throughout the network (sometimes referred to as wavelength <b>continuity</b> <b>constraint,</b> in the absence of devices that can translate between wavelengths in the optical domain). In an opaque network, the routing problem is one of finding a primary path for a connection and if protection is needed, a backup path diverse from the primary path. Wavelengths are used on each link independently of each other's. Several algorithms can be used and combined to determine a primary path and a diverse backup path (with or without sharing of resource along the backup path) for a connection or service, such as: shortest path, including Dijkstra's algorithm; k-shortest path, such as Yen's algorithm; edge and node-diverse or disjoint routing, including Suurballe's algorithm; and numerous heuristics. In general, however, the problems of optimal routing for Dedicated Backup Path Protection with arbitrary Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs), and for Shared Backup Path Protection are NP-complete.|$|E

40|$|Rerouting for a {{circuit-switched}} wavelength-division-multiplexed {{all-optical network}} is considered in this paper. Due to the wavelength <b>continuity</b> <b>constraint,</b> a new connection may be blocked even if bandwidth is available between {{the origin and}} the destination. Rerouting can make the available bandwidth wavelength-continuous by changing the routes of certain existing connections to accommodate the new connection. To avoid disruptions of existing connections, Move-To-Vacant Wavelength-Retuning (MTV_WR) is proposed as the basic operation of circuit migration, in which a circuit is moved to a vacant wavelength on the same path, and the Parallel MTV_WR rerouting scheme is considered to reroute multiple circuits on disjoint sets of links. We design the optimal algorithm which minimizes the weighted number of rerouted circuits with the Parallel MTV_WR rerouting scheme. Numerical results using simulation show that rerouting can effectively reduce the blocking probability due to the wavelength <b>continuity</b> <b>constraint</b> while minimizing the incurred disruptions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{adaptive}} spatial fuzzy c-means clustering algo-rithm {{is presented}} in this paper for the segmentation of three-di-mensional (3 -D) magnetic resonance (MR) images. The input im-ages may be corrupted by noise and intensity nonuniformity (INU) artifact. The proposed algorithm takes into account the spatial con-tinuity constraints by using a dissimilarity index that allows spa-tial interactions between image voxels. The local spatial <b>continuity</b> <b>constraint</b> reduces the noise effect and the classification ambiguity. The INU artifact is formulated as a multiplicative bias field af-fecting the true MR imaging signal. By modeling the log bias field as a stack of smoothing-spline surfaces, with continuity enforced across slices, the computation of the 3 -D bias field reduces to that of finding the-spline coefficients, which can be obtained using a computationally efficient two-stage algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by extensive segmentation ex-periments using both simulated and real MR images and by com-parison with other published algorithms.
