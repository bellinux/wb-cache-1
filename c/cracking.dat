5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to <b>cracking,</b> but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to <b>cracking,</b> especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause <b>cracking</b> as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E

In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that fatigue <b>crack</b> growth is retarded after an overload, {{which has been}} explained either by plasticity-induced <b>crack</b> closure or near-tip residual stress. However, any interpretation of overload effect is insufficient if strain evolution in front of <b>crack</b> tip is not properly considered. The current understanding of overload-induced retardation lacks the clarification {{of the relationship between}} <b>crack</b> closure at <b>crack</b> wake and strain evolution at <b>crack</b> tip. In this work, a material with low work hardening coefficient was used to study the effect of overload on <b>crack</b> tip strain evolution and <b>crack</b> closure by in-situ SEM observation and digital image correlation technique. <b>Crack</b> opening displacement (COD) and <b>crack</b> tip strain were measured before and after the overload.

With the observation from the measurements, four types of <b>crack</b> patterns initiate wing <b>crack,</b> anti-wing <b>crack</b> (opposite direction of wing <b>crack),</b> petal <b>crack</b> and compressive <b>crack.</b> The strain values of anti-wing <b>cracks</b> are larger 1 to 2 times than that of wing <b>crack.</b> The AE energy release from anti-wing <b>crack</b> is higher 2. 5 times than that of wing <b>crack,</b> while the energy release form wing <b>crack</b> is the least but the compressive <b>crack</b> is the highest. Thus, the appearance of initiation and propagation of the anti-wing <b>crack</b> and compressive <b>crack</b> are very actively than that of the wing <b>crack.</b> The strain and AE measurement is not only to provide a clear concept on the mechanisms of <b>crack</b> growth form a 3 -D surface flaw but also to provide useful knowledge on the AE property of the <b>crack</b> patterns...|$|R
40|$|Chloride-induced {{corrosion}} {{of steel}} rebar {{is one of}} the primary durability problems for reinforced concrete structures in marine environment. Furthermore, if the surfaces of concrete structures have <b>cracks,</b> additional chloride can penetrate into concrete through <b>cracked</b> zone. For chloride ingression into <b>cracked</b> concrete, former researches mainly focus on influence of <b>crack</b> width on chloride diffusion coefficients. Other <b>crack</b> characteristics, such as chloride depth, <b>crack</b> shape (equal-width <b>crack</b> or tapered <b>crack),</b> <b>crack</b> density, and spacing, are not studied in detail. To fill this gap, this paper presents a numerical procedure to simulate chloride ingression into <b>cracked</b> concrete with different <b>crack</b> geometry characteristics. <b>Cracked</b> concrete is divided into two parts, sound zone and <b>cracked</b> zone. For stress-free concrete, the diffusion coefficient of sound zone is approximately assumed to be the same as sound concrete, and the diffusion coefficient of <b>cracked</b> zone is expressed as a piecewise function of <b>crack</b> width. Two-dimensional finite element method is used to determine chloride concentration. It is found that, with the increasing of <b>crack</b> width, <b>crack</b> depth, and <b>crack</b> amount, chloride ingression will aggravate. The analysis results generally agree with experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The {{corrosion}} fatigue <b>crack</b> growth characteristics of small surface and corner <b>cracks</b> in aluminum alloy 2024 is established. The damaging effect of salt {{water on the}} early stages of small <b>crack</b> growth is characterized by <b>crack</b> initiation at constituent particle pits, intergranular microcracking for a less than 100 micrometers, and transgranular small <b>crack</b> growth for a micrometer. In aqueous 1 percent NaCl and at a constant anodic potential of - 700 mV(sub SCE), small <b>cracks</b> exhibit a factor of three increase in fatigue <b>crack</b> growth rates compared to laboratory air. Small <b>cracks</b> exhibit accelerated {{corrosion fatigue}} <b>crack</b> growth rates at low levels of delta-K (less than 1 MPa square root of m) below long <b>crack</b> delta-K (sub th).

40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with the testing of short <b>cracks</b> for the fracture characterization of a coarse grained alumina. In the literature, the clear R-curve behavior of the examined alumina has been confirmed, that is, the <b>crack</b> resistance increases with increasing <b>crack</b> length. To investigate the <b>crack</b> initiation and <b>crack</b> growth, the indentation method was used. With indentation <b>cracks</b> and complementary <b>crack</b> opening tests, it was possible to achieve a consistent fracture mechanics result. At room temperature a constant <b>crack</b> resistance of K_R#approx# 4 MPam" 1 "/" 2 was measured in air and K_R#approx# 5. 5 MPam" 1 "/" 2 in vacuum. At 1000 C in air a <b>crack</b> resistance of K_R#approx# 3. 3 MPam" 1 "/" 2 was determined. The results are in qualitative agreement with the reduction of <b>crack</b> resistance due to environmental effects (for example, humidity) and thermally activated <b>crack</b> growth. It was interesting that only constant <b>crack</b> resistance values for controlled, stable <b>crack</b> extension of the indentation <b>cracks</b> were measured for the alumina, in spite of the known R-curve behavior. This result clearly contradicts the published literature, both for the indentation <b>cracks</b> and for the long <b>cracks.</b> It must, however, be regarded as correct because of the accurate analysis of the internal stresses, which are responsible for the propagation of the identation <b>cracks.</b> An attempt was made to investigate the observed difference in <b>crack</b> resistance of indentation <b>cracks</b> and long <b>cracks</b> using <b>crack</b> opening tests. It was indeed found that the ratio of <b>crack</b> opening to <b>crack</b> length was significantly higher for indentation <b>cracks</b> than for long <b>cracks.</b> Obviously the toughening mechanisms that are the basis for R-curve behavior are almost saturated in the case of indentation <b>cracks.</b> In addition, <b>crack</b> propagation experiments with indentation <b>cracks</b> are required in order to confirm generally these considerations for ceramics that show R-curve behavior.
