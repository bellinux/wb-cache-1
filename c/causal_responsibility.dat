25|$|Reichenbach {{suggests}} that the theories of karma are an ethical theory. This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent. In ethics, one's intentions, attitudes and desires matter {{in the evaluation of}} one's action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> may be the same regardless. A karma theory considers not only the action, but also actor's intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory.|$|E
50|$|Self-blame is {{a process}} to explain the {{situational}} meaning of an event by assigning <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility.</b> This attribution might accomplish coping by reducing {{the discrepancy between the}} preexisting global meaning and the situational meaning. Park and colleagues (2008) define a process of assimilation by which new situations are incorporated into global meaning. For self-blame, for example, a global meaning that the world is orderly could be threatened by an unexpected event. Self-blame is a way to assimilate the new situation; by blaming characteristics or behaviors of the self, the individual can continue to believe that the world operates in a sensible way. Alternately, the individual might blame him- or herself in order not perceive others as threatening or aggressive; self-blame has been shown to correlate with benign attributions made by victims of catcalling, for example.|$|E

40|$|The aim {{of study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of attribution style on overt-covert narcissism and forgiveness. Even though covert narcissists exhibit high degrees of psychological symptoms, the literature on the relationship between forgiveness and narcissism had almost exclusively focused on overt narcissism. Many previous studies suggested that both <b>causal</b> and <b>responsibility</b> attributions are robust predictors of forgiveness as well as important variable for narcissism. Therefore, it was hypothesized that overt-covert narcissism show different patterns in the relation of forgiveness, and that the association between overt-covert narcissism and forgiveness will be mediated by <b>causal</b> and <b>responsibility</b> attribution. Participants were 286 undergraduate students who completed self-report measurement assessing overt-covert narcissism (NPI, CNS), <b>causal</b> attribution (ASQ), <b>responsibility</b> attribution (RAM), and state forgiveness (EFI-K). The findings of this study demonstrated that only covert narcissism is associated with forgiveness, which indicates that covert narcissists are less forgivable than overt narcissists. Besides, this study provides evidence that causal attribution plays a mediating role in association between covert narcissism and forgiveness, while responsibility attribution mediates the relationship between genuine factor of covert narcissism and forgiveness. This study has the significance {{in the sense that it}} explores a possible mechanism between covert narcissism and forgiveness...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{evaluating}} the compatibility of coercive climate policies with liberal neutrality. More precisely, {{it focuses on}} the doctrine of state neutrality as associated with the "harm principle". It argues that given the difficulty of attributing <b>causal</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for climate harms to individuals, the harm principle doesn't work in this case, at least if one endorses a liberal atomistic ontology. Furthermore, the definition of what constitutes climate harms implies making moral assumptions, which {{makes it impossible to}} justify climate policies in a neutral way. Finally, the paper shows another consequence of applying neutrality to the case of climate change, that is the risk of a shift from political forms of decision-making to technocracy. Focusing too much on liberty of choice may (paradoxically) be to the detriment of political freedom. The paper concludes that climate change is an intrinsically moral issue and that it should be the occasion of a political debate about our current values and lifestyles. It should not be reduced to a mere question of carbon metric...|$|R

The Audiologic Couple Attribution Measure (ACAM) was developed for this study, and its reliability and validity assessed.

Fifteen patients were male and four were female. Following an audiologic assessment. Following the assessment of the patients, couples completed three questionnaires: a background information survey, the ACAM, and the Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scales (KMS). Several weeks later, following either hearing aid dispensing or rejection of amplification by the patient, hearing aid use or nonuse was determined The ACAM was administered a second time to 17 subjects to establish reliability. ^ The test-retest reliability correlations for items on the ACAM ranged from -. 31 to. 86 for patients, and -. 23 to 1. 00 for spouses, with three significant correlations.

50|$|Theories on {{counterfactual}} thinking {{could explain}} the confusing evidence regarding self-blame and psychological adjustment. Counterfactual thinking involves the consideration of alternative possibilities that could have occurred, like how a stressful event or loss could have been avoided. Self-blame involves assessment of <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> to certain variables, so it involves counterfactual thinking about what changes could have avoided the incident. Theories on counterfactual thinking have proposed that {{the direction of the}} counterfactual determines the psychological effect of the thinking. Upward counterfactuals, thinking about ways in which things have gone better but did not, are linked with negative affect and regret. Downward counterfactuals, thinking about ways in which things could have gone worse, are linked with positive affect. Self-blame that assesses how a negative event could be avoided would be upward counterfactual thinking, so this theory hypothesizes that self-blame results in negative affect and poor adjustment. A study of counterfactual thinking found that it was associated with self-blame, which was negatively associated with psychological well-being in turn, but did not distinguish between types of self-blame.|$|E
50|$|Research on {{perceived}} {{control as}} a mediator {{of the relationship between}} self-blame, non-self-blame coping strategies, and well-being outcomes has shown mixed results. A study of abusive relationship victims found that CSB or BSB had no relationship with perceived control. BSB had a negative relationship with perceived control in another study; additionally, BSB correlated with problem avoidance and social withdrawal, while perceived control correlated with adaptive forms of coping like cognitive restructuring. Why does BSB not seem to have an effect to increase perceived control? After all, BSB involves blaming controllable actions for outcomes, suggesting that events are within the realm of control. In bereaved parents, attributions of self-blame declined over time after bereavement, but attribution of events to chance remained stable. These findings suggest that attributions of responsibility are not zero-sum quantities. Blaming oneself does not necessarily exclude acknowledgement of the power of other individuals and chance. In this way, self-blame seems less likely to result in perceived control; even when an individual self-attributes <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility,</b> they may yet believe that other factors could interfere with their control. These data suggest that self-blame is maladaptive across the board.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} the interplay among attachment orientations, {{the formation of}} negative <b>causal</b> and <b>responsibility</b> attributions toward relationship partners, and behavioural responses to conflict {{in the context of}} romantic relationships. A total of 345 participants, all in couple relationships, completed an online questionnaire after reading a vignette depicting a conflict situation in which the partner behaved in an angry, blaming manner that potentially threatened the relationship. The questionnaire included measures of attachment orientations (avoidance and anxiety), <b>causal</b> and <b>responsibility</b> attributions, and communication behaviours in response to the conflict (verbal attack, conflict avoidance, problem-solving). It was hypothesised that maladaptive attributions would mediate positive associations between attachment anxiety and verbal attack, and attachment avoidance and conflict avoidance, and would also mediate negative associations between both attachment dimensions and problem-solving. Bootstrapping analyses revealed that maladaptive attributions partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and attack, but did not act as a mediator between attachment avoidance and conflict avoidance. Nor did the results support negative associations between attachment orientations and problem-solving. The findings suggest that cognitive appraisals of a partner’s negative behaviour offer one explanation for the tendency of anxiously attached individuals to engage in hostile, aggressive behaviours, yet the same process does not explain why avoidantly attached individuals tend to avoid conflict discussions. Future research should employ longitudinal designs to address issues of causality, and could also address whether the type of conflict situation (e. g., partner-fault versus self-fault) moderates these processes...|$|R

Thirty-three late adolescent couples completed self-report measures of insecure attachment, negative relationship attributions, and relationship satisfaction. In addition, they participated in a 10 -minute Problem Resolution task that was videotaped. More anxious attachment predicted more negative communication behaviors of males. More avoidant attachment was linked to more negative causal attributions. More negative attributions of both types predicted less relationship quality across measures. The effects of anxious attachment on negative communication behaviors became nonsignificant after controlling for negative responsibility attributions. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{probability}} discounting (or probability weighting), one multiplies {{the value}} of an outcome by one's subjective probability that the outcome will obtain in decision-making. The broader import of defending probability discounting is to help justify cost-benefit analyses in contexts such as climate change. This chapter defends probability discounting under risk both negatively, from arguments by Simon Caney (2008, 2009), and with a new positive argument. First, in responding to Caney, I argue that small costs and benefits need to be evaluated, and that viewing practices at the social level is too coarse-grained. Second, I argue for probability discounting, using a distinction between <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> and moral responsibility. Moral responsibility can be cashed out in terms of blameworthiness and praiseworthiness, while <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> obtains in full for any effect which is part of a causal chain linked to one's act. With this distinction in hand, unlike <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility,</b> moral responsibility can be seen as coming in degrees. My argument is, given that we can limit our deliberation and consideration to that which we are morally responsible for and that our moral responsibility for outcomes is limited by our subjective probabilities, our subjective probabilities can ground probability discounting...|$|E
40|$|In six studies (N[*]=[*] 1045) {{conducted}} in three European countries, we demonstrate distinctions between <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility,</b> group-based guilt, and moral responsibility. We propose that <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> is an antecedent of group-based guilt linking the ingroup to previous transgressions against the victim group. In contrast, moral responsibility {{is a consequence}} of group-based guilt and is conceptualized as a sociomoral norm to respond to the consequences of the ingroup's transgressions and the current needs of the victim group. As such, moral responsibility can be stimulated by group-based guilt and directly predicts individual action intentions. Studies 1 and 2 focus on the conceptual distinctions among the three constructs. Study 3 tests the indirect effect of <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> on moral responsibility via group-based guilt. The remaining studies explore the mediating role of moral responsibility in associations between group-based guilt and compensatory action tendencies, that is, financial compensation (study 4), approach and avoidance tendencies (study 5) and public apology (study 6). Together these studies show that causal and moral responsibility are psychologically distinct concepts from group-based guilt and that moral responsibility {{plays an important role in}} shaping the effects of group-based guilt on behavioral intention...|$|E

An important aspect of this analysis is the problem of deleting a minimum number of tuples from the input tables to make a given Boolean query false. We refer to this problem as "the resilience of a query" and show its connections to the well-studied problems of deletion propagation and <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility.</b> In this paper, we study the complexity of resilience for self-join-free conjunctive queries, and also make several contributions to previous known results for the problems of deletion propagation with source side-effects and causal responsibility: (1) We define the notion of resilience and provide a complete dichotomy for the class of self-join-free conjunctive queries with arbitrary functional dependencies; this dichotomy also extends and generalizes previous tractability results on deletion propagation with source side-effects. (2) We formalize the connection between resilience and <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility,</b> and show that resilience has a larger class of tractable queries than responsibility. (3) We identify a mistake in a previous dichotomy for the problem of <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> and offer a revised characterization based on new, simpler, and more intuitive notions. (4) Finally, we extend the dichotomy for <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> in two ways: (a) we treat cases where the input tables contain functional dependencies, and (b) we compute responsibility for a set of tuples specified via wildcards.

30|$|This {{context is}} {{necessary}} as a background to understand Feinberg’s {{usage of the}} accordion effect.

A lot of discussion about the legitimacy of such redescriptions followed the initial publication of Feinberg’s paperc. I call this the constructive or forward usage of the effect. It must be said, that in his wording and his examples, Feinberg mentions that the accordion can be used in this way. Yet what Feinberg wanted to achieve was not to create redescriptions of actions, but to show that ascriptions of agency are ascriptions of responsibility. The name of his second way already suggests, what will do the trick: causal agency. Feinberg is trying to show that in many cases causality is hidden in agency. “Ascriptions of <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility,</b> then, are often precisely equivalent to ascriptions of the second type, which I have called ascriptions of causal agency” (Feinberg, 134). He goes on to explain that <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> and causal agency “both say something about causation, the one quite explicitly, the other in the language of agency or authorship.” According to Feinberg, A did X is often just an implicit form of saying A caused X which is agreed to be ascriptive.|$|E

Using the example of an analysis of six cases that were reported to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) as cases of false certification in the last 3 years, this paper demonstrates that self-regulation allows moral integrity to be sacrificed {{at the expense of}} economic imperatives, and individual judgements to be preferenced over fair process and procedure. Five of the six cases presented in this paper were upheld by the professional body and the sixth was dismissed and went through the British legal system instead. Narrative analysis of the case reports reveals a lack of consistency in the professional body's analysis of motive, <b>causal</b> connections, <b>responsibility</b> regarding implications and their role as either purveyor of standards or mentor to the profession, which has resulted in anomalies that leave the profession in disarray. By failing to act 'professionally' itself, this paper argues that the RCVS itself has undermined five of its own ten guiding principles, and hence can no longer regulate its own membership. The need for professional regulation beyond those provided by the professions themselves is presented if only by the inclusion of laY'people in professional diSCiplinary hearings...|$|R

40|$|Although {{understanding}} causation is {{an essential}} part of nearly every problem domain, it has resisted formal treatment in the languages of logic, probability, and even statistics. Autonomous artificially intelligent agents need to be able to reason about cause and effect. One approach is to provide the agent with formal, computational notions of causality that enable the agent to deduce cause and effect relationships from observations. During the 1990 s, formal notions of causality were pursued within the AI community by many researchers, notably by Judea Pearl. Pearl developed the formal language of structural models for reasoning about causation. Among the problems he addressed in this formalism was a problem common to both AI and law, the attribution of <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> or actual causation. Pearl and then Halpern and Pearl developed formal definitions of actual causation in the language of structural models. Within the law, the traditional test for attributing <b>causal</b> <b>responsibility</b> is the counterfactual "but-for" test, which asks whether, but for the defendant's wrongful act, the injury complained of would have occurred. This definition conforms to common intuitions regarding causation in most cases, but gives non-intuitive results in more complex situations where two or more potential causes are present. To handle such situations, Richard Wright defined the NESS Test. Pearl claims that the structural language is an appropriate language to capture the intuitions that motivate the NESS test. While Pearl's structural language is adequate to formalize the NESS test, a recent result of Hopkins and Pearl shows that the Halpern and Pearl definition fails to do so, and this thesis develops an alternative structural definition to formalize the NESS test...|$|E

40|$|Guided by {{attachment}} theory, {{this study}} investigated the mediating role of attributions in the association between attachment orientations and coping strategies used in response to couple conflict. Additionally, it examined whether relationship quality and relationship length moderate the associations between attachment insecurity (as assessed by the dimensions of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) and coping strategies. Adults involved in romantic relationships (N = 349) completed an online survey that included a series of selfreport questionnaires, {{some of which were}} answered in relation to a standardised vignette portraying a hypothetical partner transgression. These questionnaires assessed participants’ attachment orientations; attributions (<b>responsibility</b> and <b>causal)</b> for the hypothetical behaviour; global perceptions of relationship quality; and coping behaviours (hyperactivation, deactivation and constructive coping). Hypotheses relating to the proposed mediation models were partially supported. Regression analyses revealed that attachment anxiety positively predicted both <b>causal</b> and <b>responsibility</b> attributions, but attachment avoidance did not. Further, attachment anxiety positively predicted hyperactivation; whereas attachment avoidance was associated positively with deactivation, and negatively with constructive coping. After controlling for the mediators in all the proposed models, there was only one instance of partial mediation; specifically, an indirect effect of attachment anxiety on hyperactivation via causal attributions. Contrary to predictions, relationship quality did not moderate the association between attachment insecurities and coping, but relationship length did. Finally, attachment anxiety was a more consistent predictor of maladaptive conflict behaviours than attachment avoidance.
