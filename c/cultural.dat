5|$|Croatia and Hungary {{have agreed}} to the <b>Cultural</b> Cooperation Programme, which defines {{cooperation}} and <b>cultural</b> exchange {{in the fields of}} music, theatre and dance, and with respect to the arts, museums, galleries, literature, publishing, libraries, archives, film and cultural-heritage protection. The programme was agreed to on 7 November 2011 in Budapest by secretaries of the Croatian Ministry of Culture and the Hungarian Ministry of National Resources. The programme pertains to the 20122014 period and represents a continuation of <b>cultural</b> cooperation through <b>cultural</b> exchange, outside the framework of formal agreements. <b>Cultural,</b> educational and scientific cooperation between the two countries is covered by a treaty of 16 March 1994, with additional treaties regulating diploma recognitions since 16 June 1997 and additional treaties and protocols on scientific and technological cooperation signed in 2002 and 2009. The scientific and educational cooperation entails the awarding of scholarships and bilateral research projects.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from the different sites. They found the different orangutan populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested the differences were cultural: first, {{the extent of the}} differences increased with distance, suggesting <b>cultural</b> diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' <b>cultural</b> repertoire increased according to the amount of social contact present within the group. Social contact facilitates <b>cultural</b> transmission.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of natural sites, ascertained dangers include the serious decline in the {{population}} of an endangered or other valuable species or the deterioration of natural beauty or scientific value of a property caused by human activities such as logging, pollution, settlement, mining, agriculture and major public works. Ascertained dangers for <b>cultural</b> properties include serious deterioration of materials, structure, ornaments or architectural coherence {{and the loss of}} historical authenticity or <b>cultural</b> significance. Potential dangers for both <b>cultural</b> and natural sites include development projects, armed conflicts, insufficient management systems or changes in the legal protective status of the properties. In {{the case of}} <b>cultural</b> sites, gradual changes due to geology, climate or environment can also be potential dangers.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul was {{historically}} {{known as}} a <b>cultural</b> hub, but its <b>cultural</b> scene stagnated after the Turkish Republic shifted its focus toward Ankara. The new national government established programs that served to orient Turks toward musical traditions, especially those originating in Europe, but musical institutions and visits by foreign classical artists were primarily centered in the new capital. Much of Turkey's <b>cultural</b> scene had its roots in Istanbul, and by the 1980s and 1990s Istanbul reemerged globally as a city whose <b>cultural</b> significance is not solely based on its past glory.|$|E
5|$|It {{served as}} {{the capital city of}} the Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries from 1399 until 1956. The Kingdom was ruled by the Wadiyar dynasty, with a brief period of interregnum in the 1760s and 70s when Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were in power. The Wodeyars were patrons of art and culture and contributed {{significantly}} to the <b>cultural</b> growth {{of the city and the}} state. The <b>cultural</b> ambiance and achievements of Mysore earned it the sobriquet <b>Cultural</b> Capital of Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|Jorge Godoy Rojas, {{architect}} of the University of Chile, suggested in an January 2007 article he wrote for the online newspaper El Cachapoal that a semi-autonomous legal entity be {{set up for the}} management of the <b>cultural</b> center. Such a legal entity had also been suggested to the authorities previously by local <b>cultural</b> organizations for several years, but they had been largely ignored. On 20 November 2008, fourteen local organizations, including the Tourism Chamber of Pichilemu, the Agrupación Ciudadana por un Pichilemu Limpio (Citizens Group for a Clean Pichilemu), and Canal 3 Pichilemu, {{sent a letter to the}} Pichilemu City Council requesting the creation of the Corporación <b>Cultural</b> de Pichilemu (Pichilemu <b>Cultural</b> Corporation) for the third time.|$|E
5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} <b>cultural</b> and {{community}} centres. They {{play an active}} role in the <b>cultural</b> life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday <b>cultural</b> activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and <b>cultural</b> centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken. Apart from this large main library, some neighbourhoods in Aarhus have a local library engaged in similar <b>cultural</b> and educational activities, but on a more local scale.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{underground}} {{organizations and}} individuals – {{in particular the}} Polish Underground State – saved much of Poland's most valuable <b>cultural</b> treasures, and worked to salvage as many <b>cultural</b> institutions and artifacts as possible. The Catholic Church and wealthy individuals contributed {{to the survival of}} some artists and their works. Despite severe retribution by the Nazis and Soviets, Polish underground <b>cultural</b> activities, including publications, concerts, live theater, education, and academic research, continued throughout the war.|$|E

5|$|The CHA classifies <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} {{into five}} major categories (state-designated heritage, city and province-designated heritage, <b>cultural</b> heritage material, registered <b>cultural</b> heritage, undesignated <b>cultural</b> heritage) {{and these are}} divided further into subcategories. Besides tangible <b>cultural</b> heritage, South Korea aims to preserve its intangible <b>cultural</b> heritage as well, including folk customs, music, dance and handicraft. The program also includes Living National Treasures, persons who possess {{the knowledge and skills}} important to pass down intangible <b>cultural</b> heritage to new generations. South Korea has founded several educational centers throughout the country and established a university, specifically dedicated to heritage preservation.|$|E

5|$|The Council of Indigenous Peoples {{consider}} several limited {{factors in}} a successful formal petition. The determining factors include collecting member genealogies, group histories {{and evidence of}} a continued linguistic and <b>cultural</b> identity. The lack of documentation and the extinction of many indigenous languages {{as the result of}} colonial <b>cultural</b> and language policies have made the prospect of official recognition of many ethnicities a remote possibility. Current trends in ethno-tourism have led many former Plains Aborigines to continue to seek <b>cultural</b> revival.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of another key social fact: the culture. Groups, when interacting, {{create their own}} culture and attach powerful emotions to it. He {{was one of the}} first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely.

To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent <b>cultural</b> diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized <b>cultural</b> system, and the law.|$|E
