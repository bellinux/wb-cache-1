5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary <b>care</b> <b>can</b> also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E

40|$|For a {{significant}} number of electronic systems used in safety-critical applications circuit testing is performed periodically. For these systems, power dissipation due to Built-In Self Test (BIST) can represent {{a significant}} percentage of the overall power dissipation.

Moreover, a key observation is that test patterns are in general expected to exhibit don't <b>cares,</b> which <b>can</b> naturally be exploited during test pattern sequence reordering.

Identifying and treating alcoholism early, before it has interfered with patients' relationships and work, may increase the likelihood of prolonged recovery.

Selecting an appropriate treatment program for each alcoholic patient is important, and referral to a specialist to assist in matching patients to treatments is often necessary.
