40|$|The {{trade-off}} between {{interest rate}} variability and {{the width of}} an exchange rate target zone is examined, using the regulated Brownian motion model of target zones. It is shown that for narrow exchange <b>rate</b> <b>bands,</b> and for reasonable parameter values, the interest rate differential's asymptotic variability is increasing in {{the width of the}} exchange rate band; whereas for wide exchange <b>rate</b> <b>bands</b> it is slowly decreasing in the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>band.</b> The interest <b>rate</b> differential's instantaneous variability is decreasing in the width of the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>band.</b> A narrow target zone differs from a completely fixed exchange rate regime in that the interest rate differential's instantaneous stadard deviation is high and even increases when the zone narrows. The model is extended to include a realignment/devaluation risk, as well as an endogenous exchange rate risk premium. The risk premium is small for reasonable parameter values and does not matter much...|$|R

Each regime can be characterized by {{the degree to which}} price shocks are accommodated and the width of the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>band.</b> Special cases of monetary accommodation are a peg, a clean float and a PPP exchange rate rule.

40|$|Interest rates play a {{significant}} role of intermediation between savers and potential borrowers. High deposit rates acts as incentives to attract savings while high lending rates discourage credit demand from potential borrowers. The margin between deposit rate and lending rate at a given time period forms an interest <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> which has implications on borrowing and deposit mobilization in the economy. In Kenya, the interest <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> has persistently remained wide despite the efforts to narrow it down. Several factors have been established that influence this wide interest <b>rate</b> <b>band.</b> However, this was before the financial reform period when commercial banks dominated the financial sector. This study was designed to evaluate the factors that influence a wide interest <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> in Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) is new developments in the financial sector due to financial reforms in the year 2004. MFI sub sector has contributed to the competitive environment in the credit market. Factors that influence interest <b>rate</b> <b>bands</b> for these Institutions have not been documented. Purposive sampling was used to select a sample of 27 MFIs that are registered members of Association of Micro Finance Institutions (AMFI) Kenya and carry out retail Micro Finance activities. A cause effect research design was applied. Secondary data was extracted from financial statements using a data collection sheet and a questionnaire used to collect primary data.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} channel estimation error on the achievable <b>common</b> <b>rate</b> and error performance of amplify and forward (AF) multi-way relay networks (MWRNs). Assuming lattice codes with large dimensions, we provide the analytical expressions for the end-to-end SNR at the users and obtain upper bounds on the achievable <b>common</b> <b>rate</b> for an AF MWRN. Moreover, considering binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation as the simplest case of lattice codes, we obtain the average bit error rate (BER) for a user in an AF MWRN. The analysis shows that the average BER is a linearly increasing function and the achievable <b>common</b> <b>rate</b> is a linearly decreasing function of the channel estimation error. On the other hand, the average BER decreases and the achievable <b>common</b> <b>rate</b> increases with increasing correlation between the true and the estimated channel. Also, we observe that the AFprotocol is robust against increasing number of users in terms of error performance. We show that when the decoding user has better channel conditions compared to other users, AF relaying gives a better error performance and <b>common</b> <b>rate.</b> Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the validity of our analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recommender systems play an {{important}} role in supporting people getting items they like. One type of recommender systems is userbased collaborative filtering. The fundamental assumption of user-based collaborative filtering is that people who share similar preferences for common items behave similar in the future. The similarity of user preferences is computed globally on <b>common</b> <b>rated</b> items such that partial preference similarities might be missed. Consequently, valuable ratings of partially similar users are ignored. Furthermore, two users may even have similar preferences but the set of <b>common</b> <b>rated</b> items is too small to infer preference similarity. We propose first, an approach that computes user preference similarities based on learned user preference models and second, we propose a method to compute partial user preference similarities based on partial user model similarities. For users with few <b>common</b> <b>rated</b> items, we show that user similarity based on preferences significantly outperforms user similarity based on <b>common</b> <b>rated</b> items. ...|$|R
