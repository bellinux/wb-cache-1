40|$|Abstract: The {{aerodynamics}} of transonic fans {{is discussed}} {{with emphasis on}} the use of three-dimensional design techniques, such as blade sweep and lean, to improve their performance. In order to study the interaction of these 3 D features with the shock pattern a series of five different designs is produced and analysed by CFD. It is found that the 3 D features have remarkably little effect on the shock pattern near the tip where the shock must remain perpendicular to the <b>casing.</b> <b>Lower</b> down the blade significant shock sweep, and hence reduced shock loss, can be induced by 3 D design but this is usually at the expense of reduced stall margin and increased loss elsewhere along the blade span. Overall, very little change in efficiency is produced by blade sweep or lean. However, forwards lean of the rotor does produce a small increase in mass flow. Radial migration of the boundary fluid on the suction surface behind the shock is shown to play a large part in the aerodynamics near the blade tip...|$|E
30|$|Oxy-combustion of {{methanol}} {{liquid fuel}} in a concentric parallel tube oxygen transport reactor (OTR) using BSCF ion transport membrane for oxygen separation {{has been investigated}} {{with the aid of}} a developed computational model. Validation of the model is performed against the available experimental results. The effect of feed flow rate and sweep flow rate on oxygen permeation has been evaluated. Subsequently, the effects of feed and sweep flow rates on temperature and reaction characteristics are presented. Increasing the feed flow rates beyond certain limits do not significantly affect the oxygen permeation characteristics, however, increases the convective and advective heat losses from the membrane <b>casing</b> <b>lower</b> performance of the OTR. It is also observed that increasing the sweep flow rates results in higher oxygen fluxes but with leaner flames. The optimal flow rates of 0.001  kg/s for air/feed flow rate and sweep flow rates in the range of 7 e− 5 to 1 e− 4  kg/s under the assumptions given herein for the present geometry model are suggested. The feasibility of using liquid fuels as potential fuel to be used in near future in oxygen transport reactors has been presented.|$|E
40|$|Main Body- The {{techniques}} {{used in the}} design of gas lift equipment have faced many challenges over the years. Designs of production wells for lifting oil using low casing pressure lead to cold flow of the extracted fluid. This is because the wells need lower rates of gas lift. It is recommended to use gas lifting pressure in the range of 1120 to 1200 Psi [1]. Producers, who produce lower volumes of oil, require small amounts of gas in order to lift the fluid. They fit gas chokes for controlling the volume of gas lift in gas lift wells. Lower oil production gas volume is small and this leads to a falling in pressure which eventually lowers the temperature of the injected gas that flows down the casing. The reduction in temperature of the casing surfaces results in the cooling of the temperature of the gases in the <b>casing</b> <b>lower</b> than the deeper depths. The low gas temperatures on the surface casing also cool down the temperature of the lifted oil, sometimes to temperatures below the pour point temperature of the surface. This low temperature of the produced crude oil leads to the formation of wax in the production string. The condition is worse in the winter season when the country experiences extreme weather conditions. The condition may exceedingly limit the flow of oil or even plug the oil tubing entirely [2]. As a remedy to this problem, high pressure gas with the potential of raising the temperature in the well need to be introduced. This can be done through the design of wells whereby the oils are lifted at pressures higher than the pour point pressures to prevent wax formation. Chemical treatment may also be adopted. In the chemical treatment procedure, wax inhibitors are injected down the casing together with gas to keep the tubing clean. Another method that {{can be used as a}} remedy is the wire line tools. They are used t...|$|E

2500|$|When the diver {{starts to}} inhale, {{the removal of}} gas from the <b>casing</b> <b>lowers</b> the {{pressure}} inside the chamber, and the external water pressure moves the diaphragm inwards operating a lever. This lifts the valve off its seat, releasing gas into the chamber. The inter-stage gas, at about [...] over ambient pressure, expands through the valve orifice as its pressure is reduced to ambient and supplies the diver with more gas to breathe. When the diver stops inhaling the chamber fills until the external pressure is balanced, the diaphragm returns to its rest position and the lever releases the valve to be closed by the valve spring and gas flow stops.|$|R

50|$|Flow-through tests {{typically}} come in {{the form}} of cassettes divided into four parts: an upper casing, a reactive membrane panel, an absorbent panel, and a <b>lower</b> <b>casing.</b> To perform a test, a diluted sample is applied to the reactive membrane panel and flows through to the absorbent pad, with the target analyte being captured in the membrane. The membrane is then washed to remove unbound, non-target molecules, washed again with a solution containing a signal reagent, and washed again to remove unbound signal reagent. If the analyte was present in the original sample, then by the end of this process it should be bound to the membrane, with the signal reagent bound to it, revealing (usually visually) the presence of the analyte on the membrane.|$|R

40|$|Intelligent well {{systems are}} {{installed}} in production or injection wells, to increase {{the total amount of}} produced hydrocarbons. An intelligent well system has the advantages of being able to set different choke openings, using hydraulic operated sleeves to regulate the flow of produced or injected fluids. The procedure of operating the choke from surface without the use of any intervention work, is both economical and less time consuming. Combining the efficiency of intelligent well systems and down hole monitoring systems, such as pressure and temperature gauges, allows for production optimisation. If the down hole monitoring system also is fitted with a multiphase flow meter, surface test separators could be unnecessary. Multilateral wells are used to reach several pay zones, either within the same reservoir or in different smaller reservoirs. A multilateral well is a single bore well, at the surface, with one or several branches going out from the main bore. This method of drilling is economical and less time consuming. The equipment costs are lower, due to the need for only one wellhead, less <b>casing</b> costs, <b>lower</b> rig charge etc. Seeing as one only have to drill one main bore, as opposed to drilling separate wells where all wells must be drilled from the seabed, the method is also time saving. Combining these two solutions, the well will produce from several zones in different reservoirs into one main bore. The production can be controlled and regulated for each zone continuously. This thesis will describe the equipment used in a combined intelligent well and multilateral solution...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out at Sandvik Coromant in Sandviken. The {{objective}} was to investigate how the machining dynamics was influences by the workpiece and different positions of the fixtures. The project consisted of two parts: investigation of one simple beam model to gain {{knowledge and understanding of}} the problem and secondly: study of alternative clamping positions for a jet engine turbine exhaust case. For both cases natural frequencies, mode shapes, frequency response functions and machining stability was investigated. For the beam model the natural frequency changes resulting from machining were found to have specific patterns which were dependent on the boundary conditions. The changing natural frequencies were reflected on to the stability lobes. In order to maximize the production rate the spindle speed should be altered to natural frequencies changes. The natural frequencies can change considerably when the beam cross section is machined down. The mode shapes of the beam is however fairly unchanged. This makes it possible to choose a good position of an additional support based on knowledge of the original beam. A position of an additional support at a node point for a particular mode maximizes the natural frequency for the mode one number lower. A position of the support near the middle of the beam minimizes the highest flexibility that occurs and also maximizes the first natural frequency for a prismatic beam. For the jet engine <b>casing</b> six <b>lower</b> and six upper clamping sections with a 30 degree phase shift was found to have both the highest first natural frequencies and the highest machining stability limits of the investigates cases. Locking the casing in three symmetrically positioned sections of its lower flange gives the lowest first natural frequencies, of the investigated cases, followed by six sections and twelve sections.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a device able to quantitatively characterise tissue viscoelastic properties. One {{of the key}} indicators of tissue health is its physical properties. The proposed device is a dual spring-mass resonator system driven by a piezoelectric actuator, designed for use in an invivo setting. This device aims to measure tissue viscoelastic properties by assessing the change in natural frequency and the bandwidth of {{the system as a}} result of tissue contact. Initially the device was modelled using the lumped mass method of analysis, assuming friction and damping negligible. Using this model, the natural frequencies were predicted as 44 Hz and 151 Hz. Once manufactured, the system was tested. By obtaining the frequency response plot of the system without the <b>casing,</b> the <b>lower</b> and upper longitudinal natural frequencies were found to be 7. 4 % and 6. 3 % lower than predicted, respectively. With the casing in place, friction dominated the system, considerably reducing the response displacement amplitude. The upper and lower longitudinal natural frequencies became 114. 75 Hz and 269. 5 Hz, 161 % and 78 % higher than predicted by the model, respectively. Whilst the model was able to accurately predict the system response without the casing, the model broke down when this was in place. To confirm the principles of operation, the system was tested on an ox kidney without the casing. As a result of tissue contact, the lower natural frequency increased by 9. 5 %, and bandwidth by 0. 068. Furthermore, the upper natural frequency increased by 0. 4 %, and damping ratio increased by 0. 022. The fully assembled device was then tested on the same ox kidney. As a result of tissue contact, the lower natural frequency increased by 0. 9 %, and damping ratio increased by 0. 015. Whilst the magnitude of this change was much less with, than without the casing, the modified frequency response as a result of tissue contact confirms the ability of the system to assess tissue viscoelastic properties...|$|R

40|$|Time-resolved PIV and time-resolved stereo PIV {{measurements}} {{are carried out}} in the tip leakage vortex of a single non-rotating airfoil placed in the potential core of a flanged rectangular jet in free field conditions. The experiment is based on the improvement of an existing rig: a cambered airfoil (NACA 5510) now mounted with a 16. 5 ° ± 0. 5 ° angle of attack between two horizontal plates, a 10 mm gap being maintained between the airfoil tip and the <b>lower</b> (<b>casing)</b> plate. The mean flow velocity is 70 m/s, which corresponds to a 0. 2 Mach number and a chord-based Reynolds number of 933, 000. Unlike in the former experiment carried out with this rig, the boundary layer thickness is now smaller than the gap, which significantly reduces the interaction between the upstream turbulence and the airfoil leading edge as well as the resulting interaction noise. The measurements described here include the far field. The upstream flow is characterised with hotwire anemometry. LDV profiles are also obtained in the tip leakage region and compared to the PIV measurements. The experiment is also designed to provide validation data for unsteady CFD computations of the same configuration as shown in a companion paper...|$|R

This paper describes the optimisation of electric are spray parameters for Fe- 0. 06 wt. %C that will subsequently be used as a self-lubricating coating matrix. The effect of electric are spray parameters on the microstructure of a Fe- 0. 06 wt. %C matrix has been characterised in terms of deposition rate, temperature during manufacture, porosity and microhardness. It has been shown that the local coating temperature during directly affects the final coating porosity, grain size, grain morphology and microhardness. The most effective parameter in controlling coating temperature was the coating deposition rate. The Fe 0. 06 wt. %C coating microstructure was primary equiaxed ferrite with a dispersion of spherodised Fe 3 C particles formed from the in-situ tempering of the as-sprayed martensite or bainite during spraying. A fuller analytical treatment of these phenomena is given elsewhere ((13)). Fe- 0. 06 wt. %C powder particles microstructure was primarily bainitic or martensitic.

30|$|The {{following}} conclusions {{were presented}} at a 2013 conference {{sponsored by the}} Society of Petroleum Geophysicists, India (Jamkhindikar et al. 2013): (1) Oil bearing zones are interpreted in 6 wells {{in the area in}} Deccan Trap based on oil shows during drilling/interpretation of log motifs; (2) one well has produced commercial quantity of oil during initial production testing after <b>lowering</b> <b>casing</b> and perforating a 4  m zone in fractured basalt near top of Deccan Trap; (3) one nearby well in Unawa area is producing oil from Deccan Trap for the last 24  years which conclusively proves prospectivity of Deccan Traps {{in this part of the}} basin; (4) Deccan Traps can be identified from well logs and Micro-resistivity borehole images; (5) it is sometimes difficult to distinguish Deccan Traps from overlying Olpad formation from drill cuttings as highly altered basalt results in clays, so cuttings of Deccan Trap are described as trap derivatives/clay. The top of Deccan Traps could be successfully traced on 2 D and 3 D seismic lines, particularly in shallower part of the block; (6) integration of micro-resistivity borehole images and formation pressure test results point toward existence of primary (vesicular) porosity and secondary (fracture) porosity in Deccan Traps. Also, presence of mega-vesicles seen on borehole images of some wells and resistivity logs showing good invasion profile indicates that vesicular zones can be good reservoirs; (7) fracture characterization based on micro-resistivity borehole images has brought out preferred fracture orientation at each well location. The fractures are generally related to faults as stress relieving antithetic fractures. These fractures can provide conduits for hydrocarbon charging through faults; and (8) the study of fault pattern in the area coupled with occurrence of oil bearing zones in the Deccan Trap suggests that the N–S and NE–SW trending faults are the main migratory pathways for oil. Thus, areas of local highs near these faults could be the main targets for exploration of Deccan Trap in northern part of Cambay Basin.|$|R
40|$|For the {{geothermal}} wells of the Delft Aardwarmte Project it {{has been}} chosen to drill with glass-reinforced epoxy (GRE) composite casing in a drilling-with-casing setup. This MSc thesis report describes the results of experimental work to assess the stress-strain behaviour of GRE casing, in particular under axial, torsional and combined axial-torsional loading. These properties have subsequently been {{used to assess the}} effects of using GRE casing on standard drilling properties such as the stretch and twist of the drilling tubulars, and the effect on torsional vibrations. The following conclusions can be drawn: 1. For axial loads (in tension) up to 33 % of the expected maximum drilling loads: a. No evidence was found of non-linear behavior. b. The measured elasticity modulus is 1. 91 * 1010 N/m², which corresponds closely to the manufacturer’s data. c. The maximum expected elongation of a GRE casing string of 3300 m used for drilling-with-casing is 1. 66 m, which is 0. 06 m more than that of a steel drill pipe under similar drilling conditions [...] 2. For torsional loads up to 98 % of the expected maximum drilling loads: a. The stress-strain behaviour in the tangential direction remains linear. b. The shear modulus measured is deemed incorrect due to the mechanical properties of the test bench. The shear modulus as reported by the manufacturer is 6. 78 * 109 N/m 2. c. The maximum expected twist in a GRE casing string of 3300 m used for drilling-with-casing is 9. 25 turns which is 6. 3 turns more than that of a steel drill pipe under similar drilling conditions. d. The natural frequency in torsional vibration of a GRE <b>casing</b> is much <b>lower</b> than that of a steel casing in a comparable drilling setup due to its much lower torsional stiffness. However the large diameter of casing, as compared to conventional drill pipe, results in an increase in torsional stiffness. The combined effect is an increased natural frequency of GRE casing compared to steel drill pipe. e. As a result, the critical rotary speed, i. e the rotary speed below which one can expect the occurrence of stick-slip torsional vibrations, is <b>lower</b> for GRE <b>casing</b> than for steel drilling pipe under similar drilling conditions, i. e. the effect is beneficial. 3. Under increasing axial tension the torsional stress-strain behaviour displays an increasing hysteresis. a. The torsional dampening, expressed as energy loss per loading/unloading cycle ranges from xx% to xx%. This is much higher than the typical internal torsional damping in steel drill pipe. b. The typical external torsional dampening caused by fluid drag and borehole friction while drilling is in the order of 50 %. The effect of internal damping caused by hysteresis during torsional loading of GRE casing is therefore noticeable, and results in a further beneficial decrease in the critical rotary speed for stick-slip torsional vibrations.
