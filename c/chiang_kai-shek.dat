5|$|As {{a result}} of the typhoon, travel to the Mid-Autumn Festival dropped by 20%. As a precaution, flights to Taiwan's two main airports, the <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> Airport in {{suburban}} Taipei and Kaohsiung International Airport in the southern portion of the country, were diverted elsewhere, but the airports re-opened 12hours after the cyclone passed.|$|E
5|$|On October 31, 2000, {{the crew}} of Singapore Airlines Flight 006 mistakenly used a closed runway for {{departure}} from <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> International Airport, Taipei.

5|$|Among those Chinese who {{did manage}} to escape Nanking were <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> and his wife Soong Mei-ling, who had flown out of Nanking on a private plane just before {{the crack of dawn}} on December 7. The mayor of Nanking and most of the {{municipal}} government left the same day, entrusting management of the city to the Nanking Garrison Force.|$|E

This relatively small but high quality collection was kept in storage until 1965, when it again became public, as the core of the National Palace Museum in Taipei.|$|E
5|$|A {{large dam}} across the Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a dam capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek,</b> began preliminary work on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E
5|$|Sun Tzu's Art of War has {{influenced}} many notable figures. Sima Qian recounted that China's first historical emperor, Qin's Shi Huangdi, considered the book invaluable in ending {{the time of}} the Warring States. In the 20th century, the Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong partially credited his 1949 victory over <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> and the Kuomintang to The Art of War. The work strongly influenced Mao's writings about guerrilla warfare, which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.|$|E

5|$|After a spell in {{civilian}} life following the war, Malley joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1925, serving with No.3 Squadron. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and {{worked closely with}} Madame <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek,</b> Soong Mei-ling, from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the Sino-Japanese War at first hand, though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.|$|E
5|$|German {{operations}} in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign. In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran. The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma Campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army {{defeated}} Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly {{created an}} alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-Shek</b> made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly {{what they wanted to}} hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism.|$|E

5|$|In February 1938, on {{the advice}} of his newly {{appointed}} foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan. Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army. In retaliation, Chinese General <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.|$|E
5|$|In October 1933 <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> took {{command of}} nearly 800,000 soldiers, leading the Fifth Encirclement Campaign against the Red Army's force of 150,000 men. By September 1934 the Fifth Encirclement Campaign was largely successful, and Peng's own units {{suffered}} heavy casualties defending the Soviet, shrinking from 35,000 to around 20,000 men. On October 20, 1934 the communists {{broke out of}} Chiang's encirclement and began the Long March. Of the 18,000 men under Peng's command when the March began, only about 3,000 remained when Peng's forces reached their eventual destination in Shaanxi on October 20, 1935.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} prior to his death, Ople, a {{longtime}} chain smoker, had suffered from ill health and often attended international conferences in a wheelchair. On the night of December 13, 2003, Ople had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness while aboard a Japan Asia Airways flight from Bangkok to Tokyo. The flight was diverted to <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> International Airport in Taoyuan County, Taiwan (now Taoyuan City), and Ople was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was initially pronounced dead on arrival, but given medical treatment nonetheless. Efforts to revive him were futile, and his death on Sunday, December 14, 2003 was announced by his family.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Japanese surrender, the Second United Front between the KMT and the Communists broke apart and the Chinese Civil War resumed. Hu Lanqi again worked under Li Jishen, persuading various KMT commanders to defect to the Communist side. At that time, the Sichuan general Yang Sen was serving as Governor of Guizhou Province, who hired her as Chief Editor of the Guizhou Daily. She urged Yang Sen {{to abandon his}} support for <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek,</b> but Yang had {{commanded}} attacks against the Communists {{in the past and}} did not believe they would forgive him. He eventually retreated to Taiwan with Chiang in 1949.|$|E
5|$|John Service, {{while under}} Stilwell's command, {{served as a}} {{diplomatic}} observer for both Stilwell and the American Embassy in Chungking. Over the next three months, he sent {{a series of reports}} to Chungking, and sparked controversy immediately. Service praised the CPC and compared them to European socialists, rather than the feared U.S.S.R. Service credited the CPC for a clean and superior society {{in stark contrast to the}} corruption and chaos he saw in the Nationalist areas controlled by <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek.</b> He was found bias. After visiting Yan'an, Service advocated that the United States should work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists, such as the Communists, though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang. This opinion was shared by John Paton Davies, and this position ruined both careers.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, {{near the}} end of the Battle of Shanghai, <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Commission's Supreme National Defense Council to {{undertake}} strategic planning, including a decision on what to do in case of a Japanese attack on Nanking. Here Chiang insisted fervently on mounting a sustained defense of Nanking. Chiang argued, just as he had during the Battle of Shanghai, that China would be more likely to receive aid from the great powers, possibly at the ongoing Nine Power Treaty Conference, if it could prove on the battlefield its will and capacity to resist the Japanese. He also noted that holding onto Nanking would strengthen China's hand in peace talks which he wanted the German ambassador Oskar Trautmann to mediate.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Santikhiri {{community}} {{go back to the}} end of the Chinese Civil War. In October 1949, after Mao Zedong's communist party victory in China, the defeated Kuomintang (KMT) armies led by Generalissimo <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek</b> retreated to Taiwan, except for the 3rd and 5th Regiments of the 93rd Division, which refused to surrender. Fighting between the communist and KMT troops continued in some remote parts of China, including Yunnan in the south-west. When the communists marched into the provincial capital of Kunming in January 1950, 12,000 troops from the 3rd and 5th Regiments, commanded respectively by Generals Lee Wen-huan (Li Wenhuan) and Tuan Shi-wen, fought their way out of Yunnan and escaped into Burma's jungles.|$|E
5|$|As Chief of the Intelligence Division, Matsui was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek,</b> who was attempting to end the civil war in China and unify the country under his leadership. Matsui hoped that Chiang would succeed and form a strong partnership with Japan to resist both Western influence in Asia and communism. However, Matsui's tenure in office was punctuated by a series of crises. Against Matsui's advice the Japanese government sent troops to the Chinese city of Jinan in 1928 to protect Japanese property and civilians, but they ended up clashing with the Chinese Army. Matsui headed to Jinan to help settle the affair, but while he was still there Japanese army officers assassinated Zhang Zuolin, the warlord leader of Manchuria. Matsui, who had been a supporter of Zhang, immediately left for Manchuria to find out what had happened. He demanded that the officers responsible for the assassination be punished.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Hergé {{also contributed}} to L'Ouest (The West), a {{newspaper}} run by his friend Raymond De Becker. L'Ouest urged Belgium to remain neutral in World War II, a stance Hergé supported, creating the Mr Bellum strip to argue this position. Hergé was invited to visit China by Chinese Nationalist leader <b>Chiang</b> <b>Kai-shek,</b> who had enjoyed The Blue Lotus, although due to the political situation in Europe, this was not possible. He was re-mobilized in December, and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for military service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium. Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down, part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold.|$|E
