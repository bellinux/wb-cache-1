The size of the rotating cylinder is of 0. 5 D, where D is the diameter of the cyclone body, and is {{the same size as the}} outlet tube. The dust collection efficiency as well as the pressure loss has been measured when the inlet flow speed is 9 ~ 21 m/s and the rotating speed of the cylinder is 37 ~ 63 m/s. The velocity and pressure distributions were also measured. It is found that the collection efficiency decreases and the pressure loss increases as the rotating speed increases. It is also shown that both the inward radial velocity and the upward vertical velocity become large as the rotating cylinder increases its speed. As a whole, the rotation of the internal cylinder makes worse performance of the <b>cyclone</b> <b>dust</b> <b>collector...</b>|$|E

30|$|The dust {{catchers}} {{that are}} used in underground coal mines can be classified, {{on the basis of the}} dedusting mechanisms that they employ, as filtering, centrifugal separation and comprehensive systems (Colinet et al. 2005; Black et al. 2007; Shorokhov et al. 2009; Koo et al. 2010; Faschingleitner and Hoflinger 2011; Torano et al. 2011; Konorev and Nesterenko 2012; Li et al. 2013). In Germany, fibre bag precipitators are usually adopted in underground coal mines because of their high dust collection efficiency. However, they are very bulky. In Poland, <b>cyclone</b> <b>dust</b> <b>collectors</b> have a large share of the market. They bear advantages of a collection efficiency of up to 99.3  % and a dewatering efficiency of up to 98  %. Their disadvantages lie in an operating resistance of over 2, 300  Pa and an even greater bulk than fibre bag precipitators.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{analysis for the}} chemical treatment of OBM (Oil Based Mud) used in the drilling process in {{the oil and gas}} industry. The analysis is based on OBM stored at ENI (Italian National Energy) gas fields at Bhit mount district Jamshoro since the last ten years that has been chemically and physically deteriorated. Characterization of various OBM samples was performed and these samples were processed in order to evaluate the best characteristics of the OBM for optimum treatment results. The OBM treatment process involves the separation of hazardous fluid (such as diesel or mineral oil) from solids Due to the lean quality of the OBM, the dust separation process in the cyclone caused blockage in the cyclone. This paper suggests a remedial way by means of installation of a hammer stick in the <b>cyclone</b> <b>dust</b> <b>collector</b> to overcome cyclone blockage. The analysis is performed to compare the pressure drop and the dust collection efficiency in the cyclone with and without the hammer stick. The post-installation experimental results showed that hammer stick can improve the cyclone dust collection efficiency without blockage of the cyclone...|$|E
3000|$|It {{was known}} that {{overexposure}} to airborne respirable dust will cause disabling or fatal respiratory disease, and health problems of coal dust {{have been an}} ongoing occupational health concern. As far as Chinese coal mines, {{it was reported that}} there was over 2.65 million workers exposure to dust and the pneumoconiosis detection percentage was up to 7.2  %, and the number of accumulated pneumoconiosis patients had been over 57, 000 (Zheng 2011). The risks of occupational health of workers, who exposure to coal dust cloud, are directly related to coal metamorphic degree, coal dust concentration, cumulatively exposure time et al. (Naidoo et al. 2005; Belle and Phillips 2009; Onder and Yigit 2009; Qin and Liu 2009; Zhang et al. 2013). For examples, the statistical data from NIOSH (The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) indicated that: for USA underground coal mines, the pneumoconiosis detection percentage of workers exposure to coal dust had arisen from 4  % to 9  %, from 1999 to 2007, as the mining intensity increased (Hall 2008). If the pneumoconiosis detection percentage of coal workers can be kept or decreased, the key may be dust isolated and removal in working/heading face, where there usually is the highest concentration of coal dust. In terms of the problem of coal dust pollutant in two faces, the most effective method of pollutant removal may be the dust isolated (or removal) by ventilation and collection by dust catchers (Reed et al. 2004; Guo 2007; Li et al. 2007; Wei 2008; Liu et al. 2009; Liu 2011; Kuznetsov et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012; [...] Liu et al. 2012). The dust catchers employed in underground coal mines, can be classified as filtering, centrifugal separation and comprehensive system (Colinet et al. 2005; Black et al. 2007; Shorokhov et al. 2009; Koo et al., 2010; Faschingleitner and Hoflinger 2011; Torano et al. 2011; Konorev and Nesterenko 2012; Li et al. 2013). For examples, the dust catcher usually applied in German underground coal mines, is usually a fiber bag precipitator, its dust collection efficiency is high and the bulk is also large. In Poland, the main dust catcher is a <b>cyclone</b> <b>dust</b> <b>collector,</b> and its collection efficiency is up to 99.3  %, and the dewatering efficiency is also up to 98  %, but the operating resistance is over 2, 300 Pa. The collection efficiencies of the above two dust precipitators are usually higher than 95  %, but they may be not suitable for application in Chinese underground mines. Why is so? In the view of economy to technique ratio and engineering geology, the cross sectional area of heading/mining faces is usually not larger than 15  m 2, and the most part is lower than 10  m 2, especially underground coal mines in central southern and southwestern China such as Hunan, Guizhou, Yunan, etc. Therefore, the advanced dust precipitators, which are employed in Germany, Poland et al., are in too large bulk or too high operating resistance for the majority of Chinese underground coal mines. Comprehensively analyzing research progress at home and abroad, as far as Chinese underground coal mines, the shortcoming of the existing dust collector is that: (1) the efficiency of dust removal is low (about 80  %), or (2) the dewatering rate is low (lower than 85  %), or (3) the operating resistance is high (more than 2, 200  Pa), or (4) the length/width is long/wide (more than 10  m/ 2.5  m), or (5) the bulks are large.|$|E

This {{study was conducted to}} characterize the particle size distribution (PSD) of dust generated during handling of wheat and shelled corn in the research elevator of the USDA Grain Marketing and Production Research Center and determine the effects of grain lot, repeated transfer, and grain types on the PSD. Dust samples were collected on glass fiber filters with high volume samplers from the lower and upper ducts upstream of the <b>cyclone</b> <b>dust</b> <b>collectors.</b> A laser diffraction analyzer was used to measure the PSD of the collected dust. For wheat, the size distribution of dust from the upper and lower ducts showed similar trends among grain lots but differed between the two ducts. The percentages of particulate matter (PM) ‐ 2. 5, PM‐ 4, and PM‐ 10 were 5. 19 %, 9. 81 %, and 34. 1 % of the total wheat dust, respectively. The total dust mass flow rate was 0. 94 g/s (equivalent to 64. 6 g/t of wheat handled). For shelled corn, the size distributions of the dust samples from the upper and lower ducts also showed similar trends among transfers but differed between the two ducts. The percentages of PM‐ 2. 5, PM‐ 4, and PM‐ 10 were 7. 45 %, 9. 98 %, and 28. 8 % of the total shelled corn dust, respectively. The total dust mass flow rate was 2. 91 g/s (equivalent to 185. 1 g/t of corn handled).
