40|$|The {{valuation}} of services {{linked to the}} coastal environment can provide useful information for decision-makers and, therefore, contribute to <b>costal</b> <b>management</b> strategies. By focussing on services in terms of uses, this case study particularly aims at evaluating the socio-economic activities along the French Mediterranean coast and the corresponding sensitivity to a major pollution event. The assessment comprises a large spectrum of coastal activities (market and non market) that are directly or indirectly linked to seawater quality. To estimate their values (monetary and nonmonetary), quantitative and semi-quantitative measures were used. These values, translated into indexes and presented in their geographical context, allow a socio-economic sensitivity map-ping of the French Mediterranean coastal zones {{as a tool for}} spatial planning for decision-makers. The resulting maps help to identify and characterize coastal zones that are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic impacts such as marine pollution...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} a project convened by the University of Genoa and Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM), in {{collaboration}} with Local Authorities, concerning the development of tools for beach management in the Riviera del Beigua (Liguria Region, Italy). The aim of {{the first step of}} the project is to assess the environmental state of resort beaches examining them interdisciplinary, through a data analysis based on a sound understanding of the components of the physical and the human system. The following step will be the treatment of the data, through the use of various instruments, which use a synthesis analysis, such as the traditional SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis, and the use of a set of environmental and socio-economic indicators. Finally, our ultimate target is to propose guidelines, which will supply an instrument to back up policies concerning beach planning and management. <b>Costal</b> <b>management,</b> Sustainable tourist, Integrated assessment, Indicators...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlong Mediterranean coastlines, beach tourism {{represents}} one of the main economic resources of coastal regions. In the context of increase of coastal hazards, large management projects are currently undertaken and the evaluation of beach use is an important parameter coastal managers {{have to take into account}} in their strategies to reduce risk and maintain the recreational capacity of the beach. This contribution proposes an automatic tool to evaluate beach attendance and beach users behavior. After validating the results, an analysis of the beach attendance at the Lido of Sete Beach, on the French Mediterranean coast, is performed. Both temporal and spatial patterns are obtained and analyzed together with environmental, meteorological, social parameters of the site. Results indicate that beach attendance and beach user locations are mostly driven by meteorological conditions, while the density indicates that most of the beach users are locals or excursionists, rather than tourists. The results of the total beach attendance during the year 2012 clearly evidence an important increase of the frequentation since the large <b>costal</b> <b>management</b> project that was implemented during the last years. Given the large number of images and video available at many coastlines, the developed methodology and tool would be useful in many coastal management applications around the world...|$|E

40|$|Seagrass {{distribution}} {{is a very}} important index for <b>costal</b> <b>management</b> and protection. Seagrass distribution changes can be used as indexes to analyze the reasons for the changes. In this paper, in situ hyperspectral observation and satellite images of QuickBird, CBERS (China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite data) and Landsat data were used to retrieve bio-optical models and seagrass (Enhalus acoroides, Thalassia hemperichii) distribution in Xincun Bay, Hainan province, and seagrass distribution changes from 1991 to 2006 were analyzed. Hyperspectral results showed that the spectral bands at 555, 635, 650 and 675 nm are sensitive to leaf area index (LAI). Seagrass detection with QuickBird was more accurate than that with Landsat TM and CBERS; five classes could be classified clearly and used as correction for seagrass remote sensing data from Landsat TM and CBERS. In order to better describe seagrass distribution changes, the seagrass distribution area was divided as three regions: region A connected with region B in 1991, however it separated in 1999 and was wholly separated in 2001; seagrass in region C shrank gradually and could not be detected in 2006. Analysis of the reasons for seagrass reduction indicated it was mainly affected by aquaculture and typhoons and in recent years, by land use changes...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the efforts to bring about a greater degree of local community participation in the use and management of Sri Lanka's coastal land and natural resources. Through the application of the Special Area Management (SAM) strategy in geographically distinct areas along the coast, the aim is to create collaborative arrangements - partnerships - that will enable coastal communities and local governments to work together with the Sri Lankan state and share responsibility and authority over the management of coastal land and natural resources. Using a political-geographical perspective that highlights the political and spatial dimensions of this shift in forms for governing the coast, the thesis seeks to identify and discuss factors that can have a bearing on the participatory dimension of collaborative coastal management in Sri Lanka. The thesis focuses particularly on factors influencing the role played by the local communities {{and the degree to which}} they actually come to share authority with respect to the use and management of coastal natural resources as envisioned in the SAM strategy. The thesis illustrates that, despite an ambition to bring about a sharing of authority and control in <b>costal</b> <b>management,</b> this has not quite worked out in practice. Due to circumstances relating both to the SAM strategy itself and to the context in which it is implemented, the degree to which coastal communities have gained any degree of influence with respect to the management of coastal land and resources remains questionable. The study is carried out prior to the tsunami that hit the Sri Lankan shores in December 2004. However, given the major reconstruction of Sri Lanka's coast that currently is ongoing and the controversy that surrounds it, the issues raised in this thesis are highly relevant...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a policy {{framework}} and guidelines for improving a national approach to the management of Irish coastal regions and associated resources one first {{needs to be able}} to define what is meant by ‘a coastal region’ in an Irish context and secondly to know how the socio-economic characteristics of Irish coastal populations differ from the national perspective. This paper contains a range of official socio-economic statistics, from a range of existing statistical domains, compiled for the first time in terms of Irish coastal regions. These coastal regions are defined at a number of alternative levels of spatial aggregation. The compilation of such data is important when one considers the recommendations of the European Council and Parliament concerning the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management and the requirements of policies such as Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union and the EU Marine Framework Strategy Directive.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the Maltese economy is the founding result of its geographic location and limited natural resources, {{one of which is}} the agricultural area. Agriculture is a major land user and despite its limited economic size, Malta’s agriculture provide significant basis of the national consumption pattern. Different authorities and institutional bodies perceived the importance of agriculture, as these have developed policies by which the agricultural sector could be safeguarded from urban development and in encouraging in the reduction of land abandonment. The aim {{of this article is to}} analyse past and present policies being the PA structure plan (Land use and development control), CAMP (Integrated <b>Costal</b> Area <b>Management),</b> the Rural Development Plan and the Maltese Code of Good Agricultural Practice. However, it recommends a Sustainable Rural Development Program, which gives an evaluation of the policy needed for the future. Such policy could address the ecological integrity, which should minimize and mitigate adverse environmental impacts, ensuring a sustainable use of agriculture as a resource and conserve and protects the rural landscape and land speculation, amongst others. Finally, this paper concludes by questioning if there should be a more consistent, rationalised, streamlined approach to rural land use management. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Past {{conservation}} {{policies have}} often foundered due to conflict between those seeking to defend resources and those excluded from their usage. The concept of sustainability {{was introduced in}} the 1980 s with a world conservation strategy arguing that natural biological populations produce a surplus which can be harvested in a sustainable manner. This policy moved considerably in the 1990 s with the recognition that most uses are detrimental and a sustainable harvest is difficult to calculate or achieve. Apart from problems in the determination of environmental and biological factors governing sustainability, it was also recognized that social and economic forces play a major role. Thus, the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992 was founded upon conservation, sustainable use and an equitable sharing of the benefits from resources. Integrated Marine and Coastal Area Management (IMCAM) also known as Integrated <b>Costal</b> Zone <b>Management</b> has been suggested to be the most suitable strategy to manage human impacts on marine and coastal biodiversity and to promote conservation and sustainable use of biological resources. IMCAM involves all users or stakeholders including decision makers in the public and private sectors, resource owners, managers, users, non governmental organizations and the general public. The use of this approach to conservation is described by reference to the recent UNOPS/GEF/UNDP-sponsored marine zoning plan for the conservation and sustainable use of the biodiversity and natural resources of the Socotra Archipelago, Yemen.

40|$|This article aims {{to develop}} a {{conceptual}} framework for the identification of dunes ecosystem services (ES), it´s main pressure sources, the beneficiaries of those services and management responses based {{on the use of}} a framework developed by the Integrated Coastal Management Laboratory of UFSC. It refers to a case study on three protected areas with dunes systems located on Santa Catarina Island, Brazil. The methodologies used were Ecosystem Based Management and Knowledge, developed by the Integrated <b>Costal</b> <b>Management</b> Lab/UFSC as a tool for services identification and classification, and Threats Classification Scheme, from the IUCN, for the identification and evaluation of dune system threats degrees. Santa Catarina Island has 18 environmental systems supplying around 50 environmental and social needs. For dunes systems, nine prevailing services were identified, classified as: habitat support; freshwater and mineral resources supply; aquifer regulation and recharge; sediment flow; erosion control; nutrients cycling and filtering; and cultural, related to the landscape. The main beneficiaries and the actors most affected by the use and diminishing offer and quality of those ES are local communities and the whole touristic sector. As for the threats upon the dunes, 18 pressure vectors were highlighted. The classified as “very high” were: subterranean water catchment and sewage discharge. Classified as “high” are touristic and recreational activities, housing and commercial infrastructure, and roads/pathways. n the face of these results, the challenge is to develop public policies to encourage knowledge gathering on the coastal zone ES as they are central to reaching an effective management of its natural resources. The use of EBM enables the identification of pressure vectors, framing a technical and scientific information base as a way to subsidize decision making and popular knowledge aimed at diminishing impacts on ecosystem services and processes while maintaining human wellbeing for present and future generations. ...|$|E
30|$|However, {{considering}} the implications on coastal ecological health, problems germane {{to the area}} were analyzed by a mix-scale approach using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (Merem et al. 2011, 2012 a, b). In the process, GIS applications use under a mix approach had not only been identified as decision support tool in coastal zone management, but serves a vital purpose for policy makers in tracking the emerging liabilities from coastal hazards and the associated factors in Louisiana. This came {{in the face of}} growing impacts of changing agricultural land landscape and the threats of climate change (Merem 2013). In related studies on the vulnerability of coastal Mississippi and Louisiana to climate change, spatial analysis revealed the gradual dispersion of risk patterns and the pathways of tropical storms over a period and the looming dangers of sea level rise and damages inflicted onto fragile environments comprising of open spaces and barrier islands during Hurricane Katrina (Merem et al. 2012 a; Merem 2012). This is further compounded by the exposure of South Mississippi’s costal ecosystem to stressors induced by human activities. Seeing the benefits of coastal zone management analysis in that fashion, Merem et al. (2012 b) used GIS to monitor the risks from various stressors such as toxic releases, carcinogenic toxins and hazardous air and stream pollutants triggered by industrial activities and urbanization in the counties of South Mississippi (Merem et al. 2011, 2012 b). While {{in the context of the}} study area, these themes are essential as Mississippi searches for the right tools necessary in the containment of coastal hazards in vulnerable communities, this research will contribute to the literature by coupling GIS and Remote Sensing techniques for <b>costal</b> disaster <b>management</b> in the Southern Mississippi area for effective management.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the actual}} {{ecological}} state is of vital importance for <b>costal</b> zone <b>management.</b> Due to the optical complexity of coastal waters compared to the open ocean, more sophisticated instruments and algorithms are necessary to meet the challenge. Satellite remote sensing technology allows the assessment of various physical, biological and ecological parameters of water bodies on global and regional scales. Based on an existing automated precursor processing chain for MOS–data, an operational remote sensing interpretation algorithm specifically adapted to {{the properties of the}} Baltic Sea has been developed. It allows in near real time the computation of concentration maps of phytoplankton, sediment and yellow substance. The used models and inversion method will be reviewed and demonstrated on the investigation of a time series of available MERIS data from 2003 / 2004. A time series of pigment concentrations of the area will be demonstrated and put a first statistical analysis. Recent results from the validation process confirm good accuracy. In this context it is evident, that automation and standardization of value added product derivation is an important basis to support near real-time request from the users side. The BMBF funded “MERIS Application and Regional Products Project” (MAPP), which is linked to the ENVISAT-AO ID 1413 Generation of MERIS level 3 products for European Multidisciplinary Regional applications (GEMEL 3) will be discussed as key research activities to develop and promote operational use of satellite data for monitoring and understanding processes in the Baltic Sea. Based on these results future activities and perspectives for contributions to operational monitoring systems including user support will be presented. Therefore, future work aims at the automation of the calculation within the scope of a fully automated processing chain. Corresponding modules are currently developed at the Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF) and German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD). ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests {{that some of the}} underlying assumptions about Pacific sardine biology and productivity may need re-evaluation. Specifically, the relationship between FMSY and temperature- the Fraction (exploitation rate) component of the harvest control rule (HCR) - may no longer be meaningful for management purposes (McClatchie et al. 2010; McClatchie 2012). In November 2011, based in large part on such new information, the Council tasked Council staff with convening a timely workshop to review the sardine HCR and its key parameters. The <b>Costal</b> Pelagic Species <b>Management</b> Team (CPSMT) supports such a workshop focused primarily on the appropriateness of the temperature-recruitment relationship, as well as evaluation of other potential environment-recruit covariates. A re-assessment of the environment-recruit relationship could suggest a change in FMSY and Fraction terms in the present HCR. Participants would be expected to come into the workshop with proposals or information that could inform the environment-recruit relationship. The meeting could, for example, focus on identifying possible oceanographic conditions or indices {{that could be used to}} predict sardine spawning/recruitment processes. Further, if a new ocean predictor/index can be identified, it may facilitate a thorough evaluation of the current rules with the “new ” index. In any case, the CPSMT notes that the current Pacific sardine Overfishing Limit, Acceptable Biological Catch, and Harvest Guideline control rules have been very effective at providing yield (commercial harvest), while at the same time maintaining a sustainable spawning stock biomass and addressing ecosystem needs. The CPSMT also recognizes the value of a formal management strategy evaluation (MSE), as proposed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) Coastal Pelagic Species Subcommittee. However, the need for a full MSE should first be examined, and an MSE should only occur after the results of the initial workshop on the environment-recruit relationship have been produced and considered. The CPSMT also suggests that if a full MSE is to be conducted, it should consider all Coastal Pelagic Species currently in the Coastal Pelagic Species Fisher...|$|R
40|$|Sri Lanka has a fully {{operative}} Coastal lone Management Plan (ClMP), {{which is}} periodically updated. The 2003 Coastal lone Management Plan has followed and built upon the 1997 Coastal lone Management Plan with additional components introduced {{to address the}} current requirements. However, some areas have not been addressed in great detail even in ClMP 2003. The <b>Costal</b> Erosion <b>Management</b> Plan does not include green engineering measures and the Conservation Plan {{does not include the}} Estuary and Lagoon management in depth. It has been emphasized that a national recommendation regarding policy design is inappropriate and site specific policy design is required. Fisheries concerns, which were not addressed earlier, are included in ClMP 2003. Extending the SAM process. to all areas requiring site specific and integrated sustainable resource management are key objectives in the ClMP 2003. Sea level rise {{is one of the more}} certain responses to global warming and presents a major challenge to human kind. The average global sea level rise estimated by IPCC is at 31 em to II 0 cm by the year 2100 with a best estimate of 66 cm. The land loss estimated using the simple drowning concept on the southwest coast is 6. 0 to 11. 5 km 2 when the low and high scenarios of sea level rise are concerned respectively. In assessing the vulnerability to sea level rise the new techniques such as GIS, Remote Sensing and Aerial Video Tape assisted analysis should be used. Brunn Rule is another very widely used technique to assess the land loss. It has been estimated that the Coastline of Sri Lanka will recede by as much as 50 to 500 mwithin the next century purely due to rise in sea level. Therefore, it is extremely important to pay attention to sea level rise in the future in the design, planning and implementation stages of coastal development, coastal protection and coastal management activities. The estuary management plans should be consistent with the tenets of total catchment management and ecologically sustainable development. It is important to realize that basic methods to understand the distribution of pollutants in estuaries can be a management tool and an aid in decision-making but nothing more. The recommended ratios of nutrients in estuaries are given by Redfield Ratios, however, a review of the literature indicates that optimum N: P ratio can vary between seven and eighty-seven. The greatest uncertainty with estuary nitrogen budgets concerns the contribution of atmospheric deposition. The principal management objective identified for Sri Lanka is conserving lagoons and estuaries to sustain and enhance environmental functions of and promote socio-economic activities connected with them. Three budgets were created for Negombo estuarine system using CABARET. The one layer I box budget indicates that the system is net heterotrophic and denitrification is dominant. The 2 box I layer budget indicates that the estuary is net heterotrophic in the wet season. In the dry season the system box I is net autotrophic while system box 2 is net heterotrophic. In 2 box I layer system too denitrification is dominant in the estuary both in wet and dry seasons. In the 3 box 1 layer model there are some regions in the estuary, which are autotrophic while rest of the regions, are heterotrophic. And in some region nitrogen fixation is the dominant process. Therefore, it is more suitable to use a multiple box model to understand the nutrient pollution problems and biogeochemical processes in the estuary. From the types of management programmes, which have been adopted globally, the use of an effective Integrated Coastal Zone Management Framework is most relevant to the management of Coastal zone of Sri Lanka. When compared to applications of management frameworks from different countries, legal, institutional and organizational requirements are not a serious problem in Sri Lanka. Community based approach which is already in use should be extended and management tools such as GIS and Vulnerability Assessments should be incorporated into the ICMF...|$|R
