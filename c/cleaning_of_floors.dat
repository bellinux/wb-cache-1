40|$|Attempts to {{eliminate}} Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis {{were made in}} 2 naturally infested sow herds, by intramuscular (IM) injection of doramectin (Dectomax ®, Pfizer, New York, USA). A single injection strategy was used. In one of the herds, the environment was treated with an acaricide following dry <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>floors,</b> walls and equipment. In the second herd, no environmental treatment was performed. Results were measured by skin lesion scoring, ear scrapings to show Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis, and calculating rubbing index throughout the observation period of 20 months following treatment. Skin lesion scores decreased and stayed low following treatment for the entire observation period. Live Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis mites were isolated prior to treatment from both herds, but not following treatment. Rubbing index decreased following treatment, but was occasionally at or above 0. 4. The results of these studies indicate that elimination of Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis from 2 naturally infested herds was successful, using doramectin in a single injection strategy. Precautions {{must be taken to}} ensure adequate dosing of every pig, and to avoid reinfestation due to poor biosecurity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Overview: Regardless {{of whether}} a {{pathogen}} is viral, bacterial, parasitic, fungal or an emerging unknown, the mainstay of infectious disease control is hygiene, and the cornerstone of good hygiene is effective disinfection. Challenges and current choices: Certain pathogens present a challenge to kill effectively: parvovirus, protozoal oocysts, mycobacteria, bacterial spores and prions resist most disinfectants but can be eliminated through heat, especially steam, which will kill protozoal oocysts. Heat is the safest and most effective disinfectant, but cannot be universally applied. Temperatures in washing machines and dishwashers {{should be at least}} 60 °C to eliminate pathogenic spores and resistant viruses. Enveloped viruses are susceptible to most disinfectants; of the non-enveloped viruses, parvovirus is recognised as being the most difficult to eradicate. Sodium hypochlorite is recommended for many applications: <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>floors,</b> laundry, food preparation surfaces and utensils. Skin scrubs and rubs containing alcohols are more effective than those containing chlorhexidine, and less subject to contamination. Disinfectants to avoid: Deficiency of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase renders the cat susceptible to the toxic effects of phenol-based disinfectants (including many essential oils), so these should be avoided in feline environments. Quaternary ammonium compounds (eg, benzalkonium chloride) are also probably best avoided. The future: Veterinary disinfection approaches in the future may include use of ultraviolet radiation and, increasingly, silver...|$|E

40|$|Mercury (Hg) is a {{naturally}} occurring element and its toxicity, especially in certain forms, {{has been known}} for many years. Exposure to Hg can occur in occu-pational and environmental settings. The toxicity of Hg compounds in dentistry has been an issue of increasing concern. Dental personnel are occupationally exposed to Hg vapor in their working environment and this exposure constitutes a potential risk to people in the dental surgery, mainly from the inhalation of Hg vapor and fine particles of amalgam. In this study, the urinary Hg excretion levels of 20 dentists and nine control subjects, matched for age, were determined by cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometer (CV-AAS). The levels of Hg in the urine samples of the dentists was about three times higher than the control subjects (6. 2 + 3. 5 and 1. 97 + 0. 9 pg/L, respectively) (P < 0. 001). Some 90 % of dentists wore both gloves and masks. Standards of hygiene (use of mask, glove and gown) may contribute to the degree of exposure. Attention to important hygiene measures, such as the avoidance of spills of Hg, <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>floors</b> after such spills, ventilation and the installation of ventilation, depending on technology, should be taken into consideration. Age and smoking habits did not influence the urinary Hg excretion. Our results showed that dentists had significant exposure to Hg vapor compared to control subjects and therefore might be subject to possible adverse effects due. to Hg toxicity.

40|$|The {{enhancement}} of wood waste is a promising {{solution for the}} production of energy from renewable resources. Nevertheless, wood waste often needs a preliminary treatment step to remove pollutants present in the material. The thermal <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> wood laminated <b>flooring</b> (WLF) waste is studied through thermogravimetric and FTIR analyses. As a first step, it has been shown, through non iso-thermal tests, that degradation temperature ranges for wood and additives (aminoplast resins) are different, making it possible to proceed to a thermal cleaning through a low temperature pyrolysis. It has also been highlighted that chemical linkages between the different components of WLF waste influence their own thermal behaviour making it difficult to predict the thermal behaviour of the whole material. Fourier transform infra-red spectrometry analyses reveal that NH 3 and HNCO are the main nitrogen-containing gases produced during pyrolysis, which highlights the pyrolysis efficiency in terms of nitrogen (i. e., resin) removing. Lastly, thermal degradation of wood and WLF has been modelled to provide information for reactor designing...|$|R
40|$|Since {{more and}} more dairy cattle is housed in zero grazing {{production}} systems, claw health is today more than ever an area of concern. In particular, digital dermatitis (DD) or Mortellaro disease is considered {{a major cause of}} epidemic lameness. In literature, several risk factors associated with DD are mentioned. A digital survey was conducted among Flemish dairy farmers (420 completed questionnaires) to provide an overview of the prevalence of DD in Flemish dairy herds and the associated risk factors. Associations between the DD prevalence and possible risk factors are the result of a chi-squared test. A large herd with a number of lactating cows was positively associated with a high prevalence of DD (P = 0. 0031). More than 67 % of the respondents used a claw bath or sprayer. The use of a claw bath was positively associated with a higher prevalence of DD (P 20 %) was mentioned by 34. 5 % of the respondents with cubicle housing, it is used in most farms (more than 85 % of the respondents used cubicle housing). <b>Cleaning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>floors</b> by manure scrapers and robots was associated with a high prevalence of DD (P= 0. 0001).

Weekly bacteriological monitoring of surfaces was carried out at random (N = 1356 samples). In the S wing (control), we used detergent/disinfectant for daily <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>floors</b> and furniture. In the N wing we began by using a detergent for floors and furniture; after four weeks the results suggested changing to a rotation of detergent, dust attracting disposable dry mops and disinfectant. During this period the furniture was cleaned with an active oxygen-based compound. The average differences in contamination before and after cleaning floors were (mean reduction in bacterial counts and 95 % confidence intervals; CI 95) : disposable mops: 92. 7 cfu/ 24 cm 2 (CI 95; 74 - 112), active oxygen based compound 111. 1 (90 - 133), and quaternary ammonium compound - 0. 6 (- 27 - 26). Use of detergent alone {{was associated with a}} significant increase in bacterial colony counts: on average by 103. 6 cfu (CI 95 73 - 134). The quaternary ammonium compound was inadequate for disinfecting bathrooms and toilets but the active oxygen based compound was satisfactory. For furniture, there was a significant reduction in bacterial counts with both the methods using disinfectants. As the detergent was contaminated, by using it alone for cleaning, we were actually seeding surfaces with bacteria. A total of 1117 patients was studied and we observed no change in the incidence of nosocomial infections during the four months of the trial. In conclusion, uncontrolled routine disinfection of environmental surfaces does not necessarily make it safe for the patient and could seed the environment with potential pathogens...|$|R
