40|$|We {{investigate}} model theoretic characterisations of {{the expressive}} power of modal logics {{in terms of}} bisimulation invariance. The paradigmatic result of this kind is van Benthem’s theorem which says that a first-order formula is invariant under bisimulation if, and only if, it is equivalent to a formula of basic modal logic. The present investigation primarily concerns ramifications for specific classes of structures. We study in particular model classes defined through conditions on the underlying frames, {{with a focus on}} frame classes that {{play a major role in}} modal correspondence theory and often correspond to typical application domains of modal logics. Classical model theoretic arguments do not apply to many of the most interesting classes – for instance, rooted <b>connected</b> <b>frames,</b> well-founded <b>frames,</b> finite rooted <b>connected</b> <b>frames,</b> finite transitive frames, finite equivalence frames – as these are not elementary. Instead we develop and extend the game-based analysis (first-order Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé versus bisimulation games) over such classes and provide bisimulation preserving model constructions within these classes. 1...|$|R

40|$|During recent years, {{researchers}} have focused {{their attention on}} the actual behaviour of beam-to-column joints. In general, structural analysis of frames are performed either for rigid joints or pin-ended connections. Nevertheless in practice, no joints are either fully rigid or actually pinned. A presumed rigid joint always allows for a relative rotation or presumed pin-ended connections are never proper hinges. Therefore all joints {{should be treated as}} semi-rigid.

In this study, we analyse the fragmentation and connection of frames in collaborative water governance projects in the Paute catchment and its sub-catchment Tabacay in the Southern Andes of Ecuador. We rely on frame analysis of project documents, interviews and meeting recordings to analyse {{the initial stages of}} these projects. We discuss (1) the different roles of problem domain framing and issue framing in frame fragmentation; (2) the significance of scale framing to problem domain and issue framing; (3) the challenge of <b>connecting</b> expert <b>frames</b> with frames of other actors; and (4) the importance of face-to-face dialogue for <b>connecting</b> <b>frames.</b> Points for practitioners Professionals in public management and administration {{all over the world are}} increasingly involved in governance processes where they have to deal with a multitude of actors and perspectives. If their task involves setting up collaborative projects with other governmental agencies, civil society organizations and/or business actors, there is much to gain by paying close attention to how they themselves and other actors are framing both the problem domain and the issues involved. In processes of collaborative water governance, additional attention is required for how projects are framed with respect to water system scales and administrative scales, and for how technical framing of the issues <b>connects</b> to the <b>frames</b> and experiences of other actors.

40|$|Good {{comfort for}} the driver of a {{construction}} machine is crucial. Gearshift comfort {{is an important part}} of the total comfort. Volvo Construction Equipment Components has a simulation environment of the powertrain, SimPow, which is implemented in Matlab/Simulink. SimPow is mostly used for simulation of control strategies and performance. In order to be able to study gearshifting comfort, Volvo has an interest in developing new models for SimPow. The purpose of this thesis work is to build complementing models for SimPow, and evaluate what modifications are needed in order to be able to study gearshifting comfort. The work is limited to study only movement in the longitudinal direction and for one vehicle - the Wheel Loader L 150 E. The models are implemented in Simulink. The complementing models are of two kinds: – Models of the vehicle. The bodies, vehicle frame and cabin are considered as rigid bodies. Elements consisting of springs and dampers, insulators, are <b>connecting</b> <b>frame</b> and cabin. Driving forces from the wheels results in acceleration (longitudinal, vertical and rotational) and jerk for the center of gravity of the vehicle frame. The acceleration of the frame gives rise to forces in the insulators, <b>connecting</b> <b>frame</b> and cabin. These forces accelerates the cabin and the driver. – Longitudinal models of the wheels. Torque from the powertrain gives rise to a longitudinal force, driving force, in the contact patch between ground and tire. The conclusion from the evaluation shows that a longitudinal model of the wheels is needed. Further, it is considered sufficient to study and measure the longitudinal acceleration of the frame. Therefore, the models of the vehicle are not needed...|$|R

In the thermodynamic level, our analysis shows the two frames are equivalent. In that process, we identify the entropy, the energy and the temperature for the thermodynamic description, and we find these quantities are conformally invariant even without any prior assumption. The same conclusion is reached from the gravitational action as well as from the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term, establishing the result in a more convincing manner.

40|$|I. Subject of the paper: There {{are perfect}} and {{imperfect}} elastic media. Many {{of the media}} of imperfect elasticity are at least what we call of "differential elasticity," i. e., they behave like media of perfect elasticity if {{they are subject to}} sufficiently small variations of stress. Elastic waves are transmitted through media of differential elasticity without perceptible loss of energy and without leaving changes of state in the medium. In the present paper, a special class of media of differential elasticity is dealt with, namely the porous media. Such a porous medium consists of a solid phase with a liquid or gaseous filling of the pores. The solid phase may be either a <b>connected</b> <b>frame</b> or an unsolidified aggregate of grains. II.

It became the area's most fashionable resort, growing in size until it was a village unto itself.

40|$|Timber joints {{are one of}} {{the major}} factors that affect the {{structural}} behaviour of timber construction. Research on timber joints has attracted more attention recently in Taiwan. Several types of timber joints were investigated during the past two years, however, the go-dou and stepped dovetail connections, which are usually used to <b>connect</b> <b>frames</b> together and provide out-of-plane stiffness to timber frames, have not yet been studied. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the structural behaviour of these types of timber joints. First, 30 full-scale specimens were tested to study the rotational stiffness of the timber joints. Second, prediction models for rotational stiffness and the ultimate moment capacity of these two types of joints were established based upon a statistical approach. Last, stiffness degradation with cyclic loading was discussed. The results of this paper show that stepped dovetail connections have better performance than did go-dou connections in both ultimate moment capacity and stiffness degradation. In addition, for joints with a deep beam, the rotational stiffness of stepped dovetail connections was higher than that of go-dou connections...|$|R
