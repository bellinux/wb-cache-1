In this study, tensile and creep behaviour of modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> have been investigated. Microstructure of the normalized and tempered steel consisted of tempered lath martensite with precipitates at the prior austenite grain boundaries and sub-boundaries. Tensile tests on the <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> were carried out at a strain rate of 3 x 10 - 3 s- 1 over the temperature range of 300 - 923 K. The variations of 0. 2 % yield stress, ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the steel with temperature have been studied. Yield stress and ultimate strength of the <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> exhibited plateau in the intermediate temperature range of 523 - 673 K, where the elongation exhibited a broad minimum. The tensile strength and ductility of the steel <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> were comparable with those reported for different products forms of the steel. Creep properties of modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> were studied at 823 K at various stress levels. Creep curves of the steel generally consisted of primary and tertiary stages with no secondary stage of deformation. The variation of minimum creep rate with stress obeyed a power law. The stress exponent ‘n’ was around 25, which is the characteristic of precipitation hardened alloys. Rupture life was found to decrease with increase in stress. The Monkman-Grant relationship relating minimum creep rate with rupture life was found to be obeyed by the steel. Creep rupture strength of the modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> was in accordance with the reported values for other product forms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{squaring}} {{process to}} shape a circular tube into a symmetric square <b>clad</b> <b>tube</b> is examined by a three-dimensional incremental elastic-plastic finite-element method based on an updated Lagrangian formulation. The effects of various parameters, such as geometric ratio R/t, strain hardening exponent n, friction coefficient µ, {{and the length of}} tube L, on the occurrence of collapse in the squaring process are discussed and interpreted in a theoretical manner. The findings show that geometric ratio is the major factor in the process of squaring circular tubes. When R/t= 25, serious collapse is likely to appear. Aiming at circular tubes with geometric ratio R/t= 25, this study proposes six analysis configurations for <b>clad</b> <b>tubes</b> to discuss the possibility of <b>clad</b> <b>tubes</b> avoiding collapse.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the segmented expanding mandrel (SEM) test for material characterization and structural integrity assessment of nuclear fuel claddings. The loading is induced by expanding segments, which are placed inside a <b>cladding</b> <b>tube,</b> radially to simulate cracked fuel that expands thermally. Experimental results are presented for zircaloy- 2 cladding tubes for different number of segments. The tests are analysed with semi-analytical models and two-dimensional finite element models. A complex stress field with stress concentrations occurs {{at the edge of the}} segments, which simulates pellet cladding interaction. The variation of the stresses and the strength of the stress and strain concentrations increases with fewer segments and increases strongly with higher friction coefficient between segments and the <b>cladding</b> <b>tube.</b> By increasing the number of segments and ensuring a low friction coefficient, the deformation is close to axi-symmetric and the SEM can be used to determine qualitatively the material properties such as fracture criteria and stress¿strain curves, but the test is more appropriate for assessment of how defects and microstructure affect ductility. For simulation of mechanical pellet-cladding interaction it is important that the friction coefficient is representative. The resulting stress concentrations promote failure at lower loads and need to be taken into account for the integrity assessment. The SEM test can then be used as a relatively simple test for assessment of pellet fuel cladding interaction. JRC. DDG. F. 5 -Safety of present nuclear reactor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Thermal {{behavior}} of fuel channel under {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) {{is a major}} concern for nuclear reactor safety. LOCA along with failure of emergency cooling water system (ECC) may leads to mechanical deformations like sagging and ballooning. In order to understand the phenomenon an experiment has been carried out using 19 pin fuel element simulator. Main purpose of the experiment was to trace temperature profiles over the pressure tube, calandria <b>tube</b> and <b>clad</b> <b>tubes</b> of Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (IPHWR) under symmetrical and asymmetrical heat-up conditions. For simulating the fully voided scenario, symmetrical heating of pressure was carried out by injecting 13. 2 KW (2 % of nominal power) to all the 19 pins and the temperatures of pressure tube, calandria <b>tube</b> and <b>clad</b> <b>tubes</b> were measured. During symmetrical heating the sagging of fuel channel was initiated at 460 oC and the highest temperature attained by PT was 650 oC. The decay heat from <b>clad</b> <b>tubes</b> was dissipated to moderator mainly by radiation and natural convection. The highest temperature of 680 oC was observed over the outer ring of <b>clad</b> <b>tubes</b> of fuel simulator. Again, to simulate partially voided condition, asymmetrical heating of pressure was carried out by supplying 8. 0 kW power to upper 8 pins of fuel simulator and temperature profiles were measured.

40|$|Natural {{convection}} heat transfer in fluid-saturated porous media has {{in recent years}} gained considerable attention especially in high-temperature reactors. It is proposed {{in this study that}} light water reactors (LWRs) can be made safer by redesigning the fuel in the fuel assembly. The proposed design is aimed at increasing the safety level in LWRs by the use of fuel in the form of loose coated particles in a helium environment inside the nuclear fuel cladding tubes of the fuel elements. The coated particle fuel being a heat source forms a bed in the <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> closed at both ends, the heat from the particles is transferred to the gas in the tube, and the gas movement is due to natural convection. In this study, we investigate the heat transfer characteristics inside a <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> containing packed beds of spherical particles by simulating a porous region whose medium properties are defined; that is, the geometrical model representing the packed bed is specified as a porous region. The finite volume method was used in solving the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation while the heat transfer coefficient h and the dimensionless numbers such as Ra f(Gr, Pr) and Nu are used in analyzing the results. Simulated results from this investigation were validated with experimental results. The discrepancy in the results may be due to uncertainties, experimental errors, numerical errors, and the consequence of the lump parameter effect in the porous region modeling approach. This approach may be considered a unique means of estimating heat transfer characteristics in porous media.

However, the corrosion of Zr-based <b>cladding</b> <b>tubes</b> {{is one of the}} factors limiting the burn-off rate in PWRs. It is commonly accepted that the corrosion kinetics involves a periodic succession of growth where the oxide thickness varies parabolically with time. As the oxide thickens, a cracking structure forms. The oxide appears striated with periodic layers of cracks running parallel to the metal/oxide interface. This cracking structure has been experimentally related to the periodicity of the oxide growth. In the present work, a finite-element study is used to investigate the development of stresses in the oxide under the combined influence of molar volume expansion during oxide formation, metal/oxide interface geometry and metallic substrate creep.

The Advanced LWR Nuclear Fuel Development Pathway in the LWRS program encompasses strategic research focused on improving reactor core economics and safety margins through the development of an advanced fuel cladding system. Recent investigations of potential options for “accident tolerant” nuclear fuel systems point to the potential benefits of silicon carbide (SiC) cladding. One of the proposed SiC-based fuel cladding designs being investigated incorporates a SiC ceramic matrix composite (CMC) as a structural material supplementing an internal Zircaloy- 4 (Zr- 4) liner tube, referred to as the hybrid clad design. Characterization of the advanced cladding designs will include a number of out-of-pile (nonnuclear) tests, followed by in-pile irradiation testing of the most promising designs. One of the out-of-pile characterization tests provides measurement of the mechanical properties of the <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> using four point bend testing. Although the material properties of the different subsystems (materials) will be determined separately, in this paper we present results of 4 -point bending tests performed on fully assembled hybrid <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> mock-ups, an assembled Zr- 4 <b>cladding</b> <b>tube</b> mock-up as a standard and initial testing results on bare SiC-CMC sleeves to assist in defining design parameters. The hybrid mock-up samples incorporated SiC-CMC sleeves fabricated with 7 polymer impregnation and pyrolysis (PIP) cycles. To provide comparative information; both 1 - and 2 -ply braided SiC-CMC sleeves were used in this development study. Preliminary stress simulations were performed using the BISON nuclear fuel performance code to show the stress distribution differences for varying lengths between loading points and clad configurations. The 2 -ply sleeve samples show a higher bend momentum compared to those of the 1 -ply sleeve samples. This is applicable to both the hybrid mock-up and bare SiC-CMC sleeve samples. Comparatively both the 1 - and 2 -ply hybrid mock-up samples showed a higher bend stiffness and strength compared with the standard Zr- 4 mock-up sample. The characterization of the hybrid mock-up samples showed signs of distress and preliminary signs of fraying at the protective Zr- 4 sleeve areas for the 1 -ply SiC-CMC sleeve. In addition, the microstructure of the SiC matrix near the cracks at the region of highest compressive bending strain shows significant cracking and flaking. The 2 -ply SiC-CMC sleeve samples showed a more bonded, cohesive SiC matrix structure. This cracking and fraying causes concern for increased fretting during the actual use of the design.

40|$|Hydride {{reorientation}} {{behaviors of}} PWR <b>cladding</b> <b>tubes</b> under typical interim dry storage conditions were investigated {{with the use}} of as-received 250 and 485 ppm hydrogen-charged Zr-Nb alloy <b>cladding</b> <b>tubes.</b> In order to evaluate the effect of typical cool-down processes on the radial hydride precipitation, two terminal heat-up temperatures of 300 and 400 °C, as well as two terminal cool-down temperatures of 200 and 300 °C, were considered. In addition, two cooling rates of 2. 5 and 8. 0 °C/min during the cool-down processes were taken into account along with zero stress or a tensile hoop stress of 150 MPa. It was found that the 250 ppm hydrogen-charged specimen experiencing the higher terminal heat-up temperature and the lower terminal cool-down temperature generated the highest number of radial hydrides during the cool-down process under 150 MPa hoop tensile stress, which may be explained by terminal solid hydrogen solubilities for precipitation, and dissolution and remaining circumferential hydrides at the terminal heat-up temperatures. In addition, the slower cool-down rate generates the larger number of radial hydrides due to a cooling rate-dependent, longer residence time at a relatively high temperature that can accelerate the radial hydride nucleation and growth...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of radioactive waste geological disposal, the long term evolution of the nuclear wastes packages {{and the release of}} the radionuclides from the wastes have to be studied. Regarding compacted wastes (<b>cladding</b> <b>tubes)</b> coming from reprocessing of spent fuel, the Zircaloy- 4 (zirconium alloy) <b>cladding</b> <b>tubes</b> have been activated and oxidized in reactors. In the disposal, the radioactive waste is exposed to humid air in a first phase and to water after the resaturation phase. In order to better assess the degradation process of these nuclear waste package, the influence of wet air proton radiolysis on the behavior of surface oxidized Zircaloy- 4 has been investigated. Radiolysis experiments were performed using an irradiation cell which is associated to an extracted beam. Samples are exposed to wet air, under and without radiolysis, during 12 and 24 h. The water partial pressure has been fixed at 6 and 50 mbar in order to have, respectively, localized adsorbed water molecules and a thin film of adsorbed water. Before and after each treatment, sample surfaces were characterized by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) in order to identify the elements at the topmost surface of the solid...|$|R
