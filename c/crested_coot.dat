50|$|The {{red-knobbed coot}} or <b>crested</b> <b>coot,</b> (Fulica cristata), {{is a member}} of the rail and crake bird family, the Rallidae.|$|E
50|$|Various aquatic species {{exist in}} the lagoons such as eels, grey mullet, fresh water shrimp and above all the Spanish toothcarp which is endemic to the Spanish Mediterranean region. But without any doubt the parks best known feature is the bird life. The most notable of the many species present in the park are the marbled duck and the white-headed duck with the park {{containing}} two of the largest worldwide populations. A large number of herons are present during the breeding season particularly the purple heron, the night heron and the squacco heron. It is also possible to find other species such as the avocet, the black-winged stilt, the collared pratincole, the <b>crested</b> <b>coot,</b> the European penduline tit and the moustached warbler. Birds of prey include osprey, marsh harrier and (in winter) greater spotted eagle. An Estonia-born greater spotted eagle wearing a transmitter has been hibernating {{in the park and}} its surroundings each winter since 2008/2009.|$|E
50|$|Commons birds {{include the}} Canada goose, mute swan, mallard, great <b>crested</b> grebe, <b>coot,</b> goldeneye, gull, herring gull, black-headed gull, and reed bunting. In the summer common {{visitors}} include osprey, grey heron and great cormorant.|$|R
40|$|Reintroduction of captive-reared animals {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular in recent decades as a conservation technique, but little is known of how demographic factors affect the success of reintroductions. We believe whether the increase in population persistence associated with reintroduction is sufficient to warrant the cost of rearing and relocating individuals {{should be considered as}} well. We examined the trade-off between population persistence and financial cost of a reintroduction program for <b>Crested</b> <b>Coots</b> (Fulica cristata). This species was nearly extirpated from southern Europe due to unsustainable levels of hunting and reduction in amount and quality of habitat. We used a stochastic, stage-based, single-sex, metapopulation model with site-specific parameters to examine the demographic effects of releasing juveniles or adults in each population for a range of durations. We parameterized the model with data from an unsuccessful reintroduction program in which juvenile captive-bred <b>Crested</b> <b>Coots</b> were released between 2000 and 2009. Using economic data from the captive-breeding program, we also determined whether the strategy that maximized abundance coincided with the least expensive strategy. Releasing adults resulted in slightly larger final abundance than the release of nonreproductive juveniles. Both strategies were equally poor in achieving a viable metapopulation, but releasing adults was 2 - 4 times more expensive than releasing juveniles. To obtain a metapopulation that would be viable for 30 years, fecundity in the wild would need to increase to the values observed in captivity and juvenile survival would need to increase to almost unity. We suggest that the most likely way to increase these vital rates is by increasing habitat quality at release sites. © 2011 Society for Conservation Biology.

40|$|Information on the {{effectiveness}} of wildlife management actions is scarce, despite the great relevance of this type of information for maximizing conservation goals while minimizing resource expenditure. Here we assess the management effectiveness of a four-year hunting moratorium, addressed to protecting a declining waterbird game species: common coot Fulica atra. We also studied the indirect benefits that this management action could have had on a non-target endangered species (<b>crested</b> <b>coot</b> Fulica cristata), currently being reintroduced in the study region (Comunidad Valenciana, eastern Spain). We found that wintering common coots interrupted their marked negative trend coinciding with the hunting moratorium, and Before-After-Control-Impact modelling confirmed this fact. However breeding common coots continued their negative trend in numbers. We also found that crested coots increased their wintering numbers during the hunting moratorium years but not during breeding. We detected a strong and time variant cost of release on survival probability of crested coots, but annual survival probability was found to be constant and low for experienced birds, with no clear effects of the hunting moratorium on survival probability. We conclude that the moratorium had some positive effect on both species, but we suggest that lack of enforcement during a traditional hunting practice {{at the end of each}} hunting season, most likely precluded the moratorium having a long-lasting effect on the breeding numbers and probably on survival, of both species. Hence, when fully-enforced hunting moratoria are difficult to implement, we recommend the creation of hunting preserves of high habitat quality to attract coots during the winter, allowing its subsequent reproduction during the breeding season. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Once {{simply a}} mill pond built to power Carr’s Mill, this was hugely {{expanded}} in the 1750s to provide {{water to the}} Sankey Navigation, (Sankey Canal), about a mile away. The lake is a firm favourite, busy with anglers and water sports enthusiasts. It {{is also a great}} place for birdwatchers—herons, great <b>crested</b> grebes, <b>coots</b> and various species of duck and gull can be found here.|$|R
50|$|Non-native geese {{that can}} be seen include Canada geese, Egyptian geese and bar-headed geese, and ducks include the {{familiar}} native mallard, plus introduced Mandarin duck and wood duck. Other water birds to be found on the Thames include the great <b>crested</b> grebe, <b>coot,</b> moorhen, heron and kingfisher. Many types of British birds also live alongside the river, although they are not specific to the river habitat.|$|R

50|$|From {{the walking}} trail {{on the top}} of the cliffs on the Streckelsberg a wide variety of water birds may be seen including: Mallard, black-headed gull, common gull, herring gull, great black-backed gull, great <b>crested</b> grebe, <b>coot,</b> {{cormorant}} and mute swan. Regular migrants from their breeding grounds north of Usedom that may be seen in shallow water are the tufted duck, scaup, eider duck, goldeneye, long-tailed duck, red-breasted merganser and common merganser.|$|R
50|$|The {{island of}} Beuchel is an {{important}} breeding ground for many bird species, such as ducks, geese, swans, mergansers, waders, gulls and common and Sandwich terns. The Neuendorfer Wiek protects the island from disturbance and is also of great importance as {{a breeding ground for}} other species such as great <b>crested</b> grebe, <b>coot,</b> pochard, marsh harrier, reed warbler, bearded and penduline tit. In the autumn and spring, thousands of individual migratory birds use the area as a resting, roosting and feeding area. White-tailed eagle, crane and otter also occur in the area. The nature reserve is used by fish as a spawning ground.|$|R
40|$|Translocations {{have become}} one of the most {{commonly}} used tools for biodiversity restoration worldwide, however one out of three re-introduction plans fails to create a viable population or to successfully reinforce the existing one. We used results from the analysis of individual-based information on the re-introduction of a threatened waterfowl species, the <b>crested</b> <b>coots</b> Fulica cristata, to provide guidelines to maximise re-introduction success. We found that about a third of the post-release mortality took place within the first month after release. This immediate 'cost of release' in terms of local survival or 'release risk factor' seems to be a common feature of re-introduction projects, and it is likely due to the inexperience of captive-born individuals to face the new environment. This hypothesis was supported by the positive association between survival and time spent in the wild Results suggested that coots released between February and May have a slightly higher survival. A joint measure of survival and breeding probabilities indicated that birds released in late winter (February-March) had a higher chance to survive and reproduce compared to birds released later in the year. From an applied perspective our results can be used within an adaptive management framework to determine the optimum period of release, providing substantial support for future decision-making in the management of waterfowl, and other long-term projects of re-introduction of threatened vertebrate species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The valley has a {{huge range}} of plants varying from orchids, sedges, bracken and {{cranberry}} to trees such as juniper and beech (notably ‘’asperulo-fagetum). Common animals in the upper valley include the wild boar, red deer and wild cat, but it’s also home to rarer creatures, four types of bat and four kinds of damselfly, including the Coenagrion mercuriale, not found anywhere else in France. Many wildfowl winter in the valley, such as the little grebe, the great <b>crested</b> grebe and <b>coots.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, {{a gravel}} works was built. First, only gravel {{from the old}} fish ponds on Schlüpker Weg was extracted, but later the {{operation}} was continually expanded towards Eschede. By autumn 2007, large-scale gravel extraction was under way. In 1986 a holiday home development of 32 small houses was established {{on the site of}} the first gravel pits to be exploited and subsequently abandoned. 400 houses had initially been planned, but were not approved. The gravel mines created large areas of water (the flooded gravel pits) which after a very short time provided a haven for many, sometimes rare, birds. The great <b>crested</b> grebe, <b>coot</b> and greylag goose breed here. Woodlark, goldeneye, little ringed plover, redwing, marsh harrier, reed bunting, reed warbler, teal, shoveler, pintail, wigeon and tufted duck can all be observed here; on rare occasions, osprey may be seen. Sand martins have created nesting holes in the banks.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is home to}} six {{species of}} fish, as well as white-clawed crayfish, great <b>crested</b> grebes, moorhens, <b>coots,</b> tufted ducks and teal. A number of waders such as redshanks, curlews, lapwings and oystercatchers breed in the {{surrounding}} area. Two rare benthic copepods, Bryocamptus rhaeticus and Motatia mrazeki, {{are found in the}} lake, along with 22 species of molluscs—nine of which are found at their highest altitude in Britain. The lake also contains a number of submerged aquatic plants, while the surrounding area is home to a diverse number of plants including wild cranberry, bearberry, crowberry, dark-leaved willow and purple moor grass. Last seen fifty years ago, captive-bred water voles (Arvicola amphibius) were reintroduced in August 2016. This is the highest reintroduction of water vole in the UK.|$|R
