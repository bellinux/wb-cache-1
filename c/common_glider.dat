50|$|Military gliders (an {{offshoot}} of <b>common</b> <b>gliders)</b> {{have been used}} by the military of various countries for carrying troops (glider infantry) and heavy equipment to a combat zone, mainly during the Second World War. These engineless aircraft were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes, e.g., C-47 Skytrain or Dakota, or bombers relegated to secondary activities, e.g., Short Stirling. Military gliders do not soar. Once released from the tow craft near the front, they were to land on any convenient open terrain close to target, hopefully with as little damage to the cargo and crew as possible as most landing zones (LZ) were far from ideal. The one-way nature of the missions meant that they were treated as disposable leading to construction from common and inexpensive materials such as wood.|$|R
50|$|Tramea loewii, the <b>common</b> <b>glider,</b> is {{a species}} of {{dragonfly}} in the Libellulidae family.It {{is found in the}} Cocos Islands, Moluccas, Lesser Sunda Islands, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Australia and the western Pacific. Since 2005, Tramea loewii has also been recorded in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Cymothoe caenis, the <b>common</b> <b>glider,</b> is {{a species}} of {{butterfly}} of the family Nymphalidae. It is found in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, southern Nigeria, Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia. The habitat consists of forests and heavy woodland. It is a migratory species.|$|E
50|$|The Blaník entered {{production}} in 1958 and quickly gained popularity as an inexpensive, rugged and durable type, which {{was easy to}} fly and operate. It was widely adopted in the Soviet bloc and was exported in large numbers to Western Europe and North America. Total production was in excess of 2650, or more than 3000 if variants are included. More {{than half a century}} after its first flight it is still the most <b>common</b> <b>glider</b> in the world.|$|E
50|$|Cymothoe egesta, the <b>common</b> yellow <b>glider,</b> is a {{butterfly}} in the Nymphalidae family. It {{is found in}} Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Tanzania. The habitat consists of lowland to sub-montane forests, including secondary growth.|$|R
5000|$|Gliders {{required}} a relatively smooth landing area free from obstructions. A <b>common</b> countermeasure against <b>gliders</b> was to sow posts and other obstructions in likely landing areas.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} the IBA include sugar <b>gliders,</b> <b>common</b> brushtail possums, eastern grey kangaroos, bush rats and little red flying foxes. Over 20 species of {{reptiles}} have been recorded, including eastern long-necked turtles and eastern blue-tongued lizards. Green and golden bell frogs are present.|$|R
50|$|Erik Addyman {{designed}} and built the single-seat Zephyr, his first design, in 1933. It {{was intended as a}} light wind sailplane, combining a wing of modest aspect ratio with a nacelle cockpit and an open truss girder fuselage of the kind more <b>common</b> on primary <b>gliders.</b> It was a wooden-structured, largely fabric-covered aircraft.|$|R
5|$|The Mount Washington Cog Railway ascends {{the western}} {{slope of the}} {{mountain}}, and the Mount Washington Auto Road climbs to the summit from the east. The mountain is popular with hikers (the Appalachian Trail crosses the summit). Other <b>common</b> activities include <b>glider</b> flying, and annual cycle and running races such as the Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb and Road Race.|$|R
50|$|Pilots come to Omarama to {{experience}} strong lee wave conditions, ridge soaring and thermal flying. It is <b>common</b> for Omarama-based <b>gliders</b> to soar hundreds of kilometers along the Southern Alps each day. In ideal conditions, {{it is possible}} for gliders to reach distances in excess of 1000 km. Several national and world gliding records have been achieved from Omarama, and the prevailing conditions have attracted record seekers such as Steve Fossett.|$|R
50|$|Approval for a 53 {{kilometre}} {{extension to}} Injune Creek was granted in November 1916. There are various theories {{on the origin}} of the name Injune, but perhaps the most plausible is that it derives from Ingon a possible aboriginal name for the flying squirrel or sugar <b>glider</b> <b>common</b> to the area. In any event, when the railway reached the region the railhead was called Injune. Intervening sidings beyond Orallo were named Hunteton, Alicker, Bymount, Gunnewin, Okoro, Komine, Bongwara, Kooragan and Blue Lagoon. There were then 53 bridges along its entire path.|$|R
40|$|Gliding is an energetically {{efficient}} mode of locomotion {{that has}} evolved independently, {{and in different}} ways, in several tetrapod groups. Here, we report on an acrodontan lizard from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Group of China showing an array of morphological traits associated with gliding. It represents the only known occurrence of this specialization in a fossil lizard and provides evidence of an Early Cretaceous ecological diversification into an aerial niche by crown-group squamates. The lizard has a dorsal-rib-supported patagium, a structure independently evolved in the Late Triassic basal lepidosauromorph kuehneosaurs and the extant agamid lizard Draco, revealing a surprising case of convergent evolution among lepidosauromorphans. A patagial character combination of much longer bilaterally than anteroposteriorly, significantly thicker along the leading edge than along the trailing edge, tapered laterally to form a wing tip, and secondarily supported by an array of linear collagen fibers is not <b>common</b> in <b>gliders</b> and enriches our knowledge of gliding adaptations among tetrapods...|$|R
40|$|Petauroides volans (Kerr, 1792) is a pseudocherid {{marsupial}} {{with the}} <b>common</b> name greater <b>glider.</b> It {{is the largest}} and most conspicuous of the gliding possums and is 1 of the most numerous arboreal marsupials in the eucalypt forests of eastern Australia. Its gliding membranes are large and its thick, shaggy coat obscures the basic body form, making the animal appear much larger than it actually is. P. volans is nocturnal, arboreal, solitary, and folivorous and is dependent on large tree hollows for shelter. In Australia, P. volans has received particular attention because it is highly sensitive to the removal of old hollow-bearing trees during forestry practices such as clear-cutting...|$|R
2500|$|The Fafnir was not {{the first}} glider with a {{cantilever}} wing, for the Darmstadt Konsul had been built seven years earlier but a cantilever wing with an aspect ratio of almost 20 was exceptional. The single wing spar had to be deep for strength and Lippisch accommodated this by using the Göttingen 652 airfoil which is thick and strongly cambered, additionally providing lift at low speeds. [...] The wing root was faired into the upper fuselage. The wing was straight tapered in plan to elliptical tips and the profile changed along the span through the less cambered, more widely used Göttingen 535 to the familiar Clarke Y profile with washout at the tips to prevent tip stalling. It was plywood covered ahead of the spar, with fabric covering aft. [...] Laterally stabilising dihedral was not <b>common</b> on <b>gliders</b> in 1929 but Lippisch applied it to about 40% of the inner span [...] on the Fafnir, producing a gull wing. Many later gliders followed this form, though it is harder to build and has no solid aerodynamic justification. [...] The trailing edges of the outer part of the wing carried broad and constant chord ailerons.|$|R
5000|$|Gliders are heavier-than-air {{aircraft}} {{that do not}} employ propulsion once airborne. Take-off may be by launching forward and downward from a high location, or by pulling into the air on a tow-line, either by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or by a powered [...] "tug" [...] aircraft. For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift, it must descend {{in relation to the}} air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Many gliders can 'soar' - gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents. The first practical, controllable example was designed and built by the British scientist and pioneer George Cayley, whom many recognise as the first aeronautical engineer. <b>Common</b> examples of <b>gliders</b> are sailplanes, hang gliders and paragliders.|$|R
5000|$|The A.W.52 was {{intended}} for high speeds and was an all-metal turbojet-powered aircraft, with a retractable undercarriage; aerodynamically it had much in <b>common</b> with the <b>glider.</b> Both aircraft were moderately-swept flying wings with a centre section having a straight trailing edge. The wing tips carried small (not full chord) end-plate fin and rudders, which operated differentially, with a greater angle on the outer one. Roll and pitch were controlled with elevons that extended inward from the wing tips over most (in {{the case of the}} A.W.52 about three-quarters) of the outer, swept part of the trailing edge. The elevons moved together as elevators and differentially as ailerons. They were quite complicated surfaces - which included trim tabs - and hinged not from the wing but from [...] "correctors", which were wing-mounted; the correctors provided pitch trim. To delay tip stall, air was sucked out of a slot {{just in front of the}} elevons, by pumps powered by undercarriage-mounted fans on the glider and directly from the engine in the A.W.52. The inner centre section wing carried Fowler flaps and the upper surface of the outer section carried spoilers.|$|R
