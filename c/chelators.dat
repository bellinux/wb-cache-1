Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include <b>chelators</b> N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP.

5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali <b>chelators</b> based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|E

30|$|Aim: Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{have been}} widely exploited for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. For antibody radiolabeling with Cu- 64, a bifunctional <b>chelator</b> is required which can seize the radio metal quite robustly into its cavity. Thus development of cross-bridged <b>chelator</b> is in need. Unlike the other biomolecules (e.g., peptide, aptamer), antibody radiolabeling condition is tricky and needs sophisticated and mild labelling conditions which limits the application of cross-bridged <b>chelator</b> in immuoPET. We report {{a new kind of}} cross-bridged macrocyclic <b>chelator</b> (PCB-TE 2 A-alkyne), which can be converted to any copper free clickable moiety or any functional group for antibody conjugation (Fig. 1). It thus enables a general platform for antibody tagging with Cu- 64.|$|R

25|$|Iron {{overload}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of chronic transfusion therapy, necessary {{for patients with}} beta thalassemia. Iron chelation is a medical therapy that avoids the complications of iron overload. The iron overload can be removed by Deferasirox, an oral iron chelator, which has a dose- dependent effect on iron burden. Every unit of transfused blood contains 200–250mg of iron and the body has no natural mechanism to remove excess iron Deferasirox is a vital part in the patients health after blood transfusions. During normal iron homeostasis the circulating iron is bound to transferrin, but with an iron overload, the ability for transferrin to bind iron is exceeded and non-transferrin bound iron is formed. It represents a potentially toxic iron form due to its high propensity to induce oxygen species and is responsible for cellular damage. The prevention of iron overload protects patients from morbidity and mortality. The primary aim is to bind to and remove iron from the body and a rate equal to the rate of transfusional iron input or greater than iron input. During clinical trails patients that received Deferasirox experienced no drug-related neutropenia or agranulocytosis, which was present with other iron <b>chelators.</b> Its long half life requires it to be taken once daily and provides constant chelation. Cardiac failure is a main cause of illness from transfusional iron overload but deferasirox demonstrated the ability to remove iron from iron-loaded myocardial cells protecting beta thalassemia patients from effects of required blood transfusions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe role of thiols as oxidant {{scavengers}} during inactivation of bovine glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase by metal-catalyzed oxidation {{systems has}} been studied in vitro. Partial inactivation of the enzyme was achieved by the metal-catalyzed oxidation systems Fe(II) /H 2 O 2 /EDTA or Fe(II) / H 2 O 2 /ADP under specific conditions. When EDTA as <b>chelator</b> was present in the oxidation system, both cysteine and N-acetylcysteine at low concentrations (0. 1 – 1 mM) drastically enhanced inactivation, while cysteinyl-glycine and glutathione did not. The thiol-mediated inactivation was inhibitable by superoxide dismutase. Depletion of enzyme activity by cysteine was paralleled by an increase of the carbonyl content, which indicates oxidative injury. However, when EDTA as <b>chelator</b> {{was replaced by the}} natural <b>chelator</b> ADP, all thiols studied acted as antioxidants.

In solution, DNA-protein complex formation is demonstrated for the wild type and fusion protein. Substantial questions of these studies are whether protein function is affected after adsorption to lipid layers and whether a specific docking via histidine tag to the <b>chelator</b> lipid leads to functional immobilization. Using lipid mixtures that allow a lateral organization of <b>chelator</b> lipids within the lipid film, specific binding and unspecific adsorption can be distinguished by pattern formation of DNA-protein complexes.
