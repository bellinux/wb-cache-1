Rape stem weevil is present in middle and west European countries and <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> is present in almost all European countries. The most important morphological difference between adults is colour of their legs. Biological and ecological characteristics of these two pests are similar, stem mining weevils are observed as pest complex. Differences in biology cause different approach in pest control.

40|$|Douglas Warner, Leslie John Allen Williams, Andrew Ferguson, Ingrid Williams, ???Spatial {{relationships}} between carabids and pest larvae in a winter oilseed rape crop???, {{paper presented at}} the International Symposium on Integrated Pest Management in Oilseed Rape, Goettingen, Germany, 3 - 5 April, 2006. Studies in the EU MASTER project show that carabid beetles can feed on larvae of oilseed rape pests (e. g. Piper & Williams, 2004), but to identify them as potential biocontrol agents it must be shown that significant numbers encounter the prey in the field. In this two-year study, the spatio-temporal {{relationships between}} carabids and cabbage stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala) have already been reported (Warner et al., 2003). Now, we compare carabid distributions with those of pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (stem weevil) (Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus) and cabbage seed weevil (seed weevil) (Ceutorhynchus assimilis) larvae dropping to the soil to pupate...|$|E

The distributions of Collembola were recorded as potential alternative prey. Insect distributions were analysed and compared using Spatial Analysis by Distance Indices. 2 :???Mature larvae of the pests dropped from the crop canopy to the soil for pupation in temporal succession from May to early July. Their distributions within the crop were irregular and differed with species. 3 :???Adults of seven species or genera of carabid were abundant and active within the crop during May and June: Nebria brevicollis (Fabricius), Anchomenus dorsalis (Pontoppidan), Loricera pilicornis (Fabricius), Amara similata (Gyllenhal), Asaphidion spp., Pterostichus madidus (Fabricius) and Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger). 4 :???During May, N. brevicollis was spatially associated with peak numbers of M. aeneus larvae and with Collembola. Anchomenus dorsalis was spatially associated with Ceutorhynchus spp. larvae during two peaks in the abundance of the latter in early and late June. Nebria brevicollis and A. dorsalis coincided in both time and space with larvae of the three coleopterous pests when they were most vulnerable to predation by epigeal predators and are therefore good candidates for conservation biocontrol. 5 :???The importance of carabid beeetles in the natural enemy complex in winter oilseed rape and their potential for biocontrol of spring and summer pests are discussed in relation to husbandry practices for the crop and its adjacent areas which could be manipulated to promote carabid survival for integrated pest management...|$|E
40|$|Many organic farmers {{hesitate}} to grow winter oilseed rape (WOSR), despite its usefulness for crop rotations and animal fodder, {{because it is}} attacked by many insects, which are difficult to control without chemical treatments. In a geographically broad network of farmer’s fields, we analysed the effect of various crop management factors and of the surrounding field environment on a large range of insects known to damage WOSR: root maggot (Delia radicum L.), <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala L.), rape <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Ceuthorhynchus napi Gyl) and pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.). Our results confirm the effect of sowing date, plant density and soil tillage regime on root maggot attacks and <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle larva infestation. Early sowing tended to increase root maggot damage whereas it {{was associated with a}} lower level of attack of <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle. High plant density tended to decrease the damage or the attack of all insects. We show that nitrogen availability in the soil affect <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle, <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> levels and pollen beetle damage: the negative effect of soil nitrogen content on pollen beetle damage {{may be related to the}} significant effect of nitrogen on plant vigour and, therefore, to the compensation of pollen beetle damage on new racemes. If all insects were considered together, the proportion of land under WOSR in the region and the surrounding environment had a significant effect on pest occurrence. In regions with a high proportion of land under WOSR, the proportion of plants attacked by root maggot and pollen beetle tended to increase. Conversely, regions with high proportions of land under WOSR tended to have a smaller proportion of plants with <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle larvae or damage, whatever the environment surrounding the field. For almost all the pests considered, the fields displaying the most severe pest attacks in regions with more than 1. 2 % WOSR were bounded by trees, hedges and bushes. Conversely, in regions with a lower percentage of land under WOSR, woodland around the field reduced the occurrence of pest attack...|$|R

40|$|The {{literary}} part of {{the thesis}} describes biology, economic importance and methods of chemical protection against pollen beetle, cabbage seed <b>weevil</b> and <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle. The resistance of these pests against zoocides in the Czech republic and {{in some parts of}} neighbour European countries is decribed and principles of antiresistance strategies are outlined. Each group of insecticides is describd and their active components are rated in the practical {{part of the}} thesis. Findings about pest resistance are summarized - resistance types and mechanisms in particular. Then monitoring of resistent populations of plant pests are described. New findings concerning the resistance of three oilseed rape pests were acquired using biological methods. For cabage seed weevil six areas were evaluated, for pollen beetle seven and for <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle two areas were evaluated. All the evaluated areas are in the Czech republic. The adult-vial test number 11, nr. 25, nr. 27 accordinng to IRAC methodology and topical aplication test were used to rate the resistance. The efficiency of five pyrethroids (deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, esfenvalerate, etofenprox, tau-fluvalinate, cypermethrin), one organophosphate (chlorpyrifos - <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle only) and one oxadiazin (indoxacarb) in different concentrations were rated. The mortality of the pests was rated 24 hours after active component functioning for pollen beetle and cabbage seed weevil and after 48 hours for cabage stem flea beetle. Then lethal concentration LC 50 and LC 95 values were assessed. For ppollen beetle, the resistance against pyrethroids was confirmed with the exception, the effect of neonicotinoids was variable, acetamiprid and thiacloprid showed reduced efficiency in populations of some areas.

40|$|Mixing {{plant species}} in agroecosystems is {{highlighted}} as an agroecological solution to reduce pesticides and fertilizers while maintaining profitability. In the French context, intercropping frost-sensitive legume crops with winter oilseed rape is potentially interesting {{and began to}} be implemented by farmers. In this study we aimed at measuring the services and disservices of this intercrop with three different legume mixtures, in terms of growth and yield for rapeseed, ground cover of weeds in autumn and damage caused by rape winter <b>stem</b> <b>weevil.</b> The experiment was carried out at four sites from 2011 to 2014. We showed higher total aerial dry weights and total aerial nitrogen contents in the intercrops compared to sole winter oilseed rape in November. The companion plants contributed to the control of weeds and the mitigation of rape winter <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> damage, notably through {{the increase in the}} total aerial weight. In spring, after destruction of the companion plants, the intercrops had partially compensated a reduction in the N fertilization rate (- 30 kg per hectare) in terms of aerial nitrogen content in rapeseed, with no consequences on the yield which was maintained or even increased. There were probably other interactions such as an improvement in rapeseed root exploration. The consequences were an increase in the nitrogen use efficiency in intercrops. The intercrop with faba bean and lentil showed the best results in terms of autumn growth, weed control, reduction in rape winter <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> damage, and rapeseed N content in spring and yield. Intercropping frost-sensitive legume crops with winter oilseed rape is thus a promising way to reconcile yield and reduction in pesticides and fertilizer use and perhaps to benefit more widely to the cropping system...|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) {{has banned}} {{the use of}} three pesticides: clothianidin, {{thiamethoxam}} and imidacloprid in bee attractive crops. These pesticides all belong to a pesticide group called neonicotinoids, and they {{are believed to be}} a contributing factor in the declining bee population. The ban was enforced in EU the 1 st of December 2013. Neonicotinoids (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) {{are an important part of}} the control of pests in oilseed rape production in Danish agriculture. The neonicotinoids are generally used as a seed treatment in oilseed rape. The coatings of the rape seeds prevent young plants from pest attack. The seed treatment of oilseed rape helps controlling <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala). The lack of seed treatment in oilseed rape could result in extra treatments with pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, Gamma cyhalothrin and Cypermethrin). 	 This project aims to identify if the banning of the three neonicotinoids (clothianidin, thamethoxam and imidacloprid), seems to result in a farming practice that puts more or less pressure on the Danish environment, with special emphasis on honey bees. In Denmark there has not been reported poisoning of honey bees from either pyrethroids or neonicotinoids. Pesticides are among the Danish apiculturist not seen as a major concern, which indicates little identified negative effect of the neonicotinoids on honey bees. When treatment with neonicotinoids in oilseed rape is substituted with a treatment with pyrethroids, the time of application should pose no threat to honey bees, as the crop are not flowering and the application period will be in the autumn, where few flowers are present in the Danish environment. 	The change in oilseed farming practice does not necessarily increase the load on the Danish environment (based on calculation of Area Load). If the Danish farmers substitute the neonicotinoids seed treatment with an extra treatment of the pyrethroid with the least Area Load (Karate WG (Lambda-cyhalothrin)). If Danish farmers based on the higher taxation, in the future solely will use Karate WG in oilseed rape, the Area Load can actually decrease compared to before the ban of neonicotinoids even with three applications. Findings of resistance in <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle in Germany towards pyrethroids makes a plausible scenario being breakdown of control of this pest in oilseed rape. Previously the control of <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle has been based on neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, which have different modes of action in <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle. Resistance among <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle towards pyrethroids would result in the need of stronger doses and more applications, which would give rise to higher load on the environment including bees (increase in AL). A worst case scenario could be the need to abandon cultivation of rape in Denmark...|$|R
50|$|The Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> is {{native to}} South America where it is present in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia and Chile.

40|$|The Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil,</b> Listronotus bonariensis (Kuschel) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is {{the most}} {{important}} pest species in New Zealand, costing the pastoral industry an estimated NZ$ 78 - 251 m per year (Prestidge et al., 1991). The parasitoid wasp Microctonus hyperodae Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was released in New Zealand in 1991 as a potential biological control agent of the weevil (Goldson et al., 1994). As M. hyperodae is a pro-ovigenic species, its lifetime complement of eggs is set at adult emergence (Phillips, 1998). Adult wasp fitness is likely to be affected by host nutrition, as resources carried over from immature stages to the adult stage of parasitoids can vary with the size and nutritional quality of the host (Jervis et al., 2001). The fecundity of Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> can increase after the addition of pollen to its diet (Evans. and Barratt, 1995). Conversely, a decrease in gonad development (i. e., vitellarium development and percentage of females with oocyte resorption) can occur after consumption of ryegrass containing endophyte (Barker and Addison, 1996). This research investigates tri-trophic-Ievel interactions on parasitoid fitness (i. e., egg load and body size) by assessing field-collected adult weevils, and by providing bee-collected pollen, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench cv. Katowase) pollen, ryegrass-only (Lolium multiflorum L. cv. Tama), or ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lambrechtsen cv. Aries) containing endophyte (Neotyphodium lolii (Latch, Christensen and Samuels) Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin in the host diet in the laboratory. A survey was conducted in the Lincoln area to what extent pollen was part of the diet of field collected Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevils.</b> The frequency and types of pollen grains consumed were analysed. Also, gut fullness (in terms of ryegrass particle content), parasitoid larval presence, weevil gender and weevil gonad development were also assessed. Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> adults fed on pollen in the field, although a low proportion of them contained pollen in their gut. Gonad development was positively correlated with the extent of pollen consumption (i. e., number of individuals with sexually mature gonads). A cage experiment was conducted in the laboratory. Potentially parasitised adult Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevils</b> were collected from ryegrass on roadsides in the Lincoln area during 2004. They were randomly allocated to four treatments: ryegrass-only (control), ryegrass plus bee collected pollen, ryegrass plus buckwheat pollen, and ryegrass with endophyte, each replicated four times. Water was provided in every treatment. The parasitoids that emerged were assessed for size (i. e., hind leg tibial length) and potential fecundity (i. e., egg load) (see Phillips and Baird, 2001). Despite the fact that the addition of bee-collected or buckwheat pollen to the host diet had no significant effect on the number of adult parasitoids emerged, their body size or egg load (P > 0. 05), some factors that could have affected a potentially positive correlation between parasitoid fitness and pollen consumption are discussed. Similarly, the addition of ryegrass with endophyte had no significant effect on the number of adult parasitoids emerged, their body size or egg load (P > 0. 05). This leads to the suggestion that biological control (i. e., M. hyperodae) and plant resistance (i. e., endophyte) strategies can work in a complementary way in integrated pest management programmes. The concept of benefiting the third trophic level with 'resource subsidies' made available selectively to the second level has the potential to lead to the suggestion of a new mechanism for enhancing parasitoid fitness, that is 'indirect' conservation biocontrol...|$|R
40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{presence}} of systemic endophytic fungi in agriculturally important New Zealand grasses were studied in relation to plant breeding. Seedling resistance to adult Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding in perennial ryegrass, Italian ryegrass and tall fescue was found {{to be related to the}} presence of their respective Acremonium endophytes in the seed rather than to plant genetic resistance. In addition a study of perennial ryegrass revealed that this resistance was independent of endophyte viability. The seedling resistance conferred by the endophyte of Italian ryegrass was found to be beneficial for field establishment. This endophyte differs from that in perennial ryegrass and tall fescue in that it does not confer resistance to Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> on mature plants, but only on seedlings. The extent of plant genetic seedling tolerance to adult Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding was limited to broad inter-specific differences, with tall fescue more tolerant than perennial ryegrass and both of these more tolerant than Italian ryegrass. This ranking corresponds with previous observations on feeding preference on mature plants. A study of factors affecting the concentration of endophyte mycelia in infected seed of perennial ryegrass revealed that plant genetic factors had little effect. The major factors studied were: 1) the endophyte concentration in the maternal parent plant directly influenced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 2) nitrogen fertilizer applications to a seed crop reduced the concentration of mycelia in the seed, with earlier applications having a greater effect. 3) application of the fungicide propiconazole (Tilt) to a seed crop reduced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 4) the endophyte concentration in the seed was found to directly influence the endophyte concentration in seedlings, six month old plants and that of seed harvested from a first year seed crop. As there have been no previous reports of tetraploid perennial ryegrass cultivars with endophyte an experiment was conducted to determine if these could be developed by the standard procedure of colchicine treatment.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was planned and undertaken to obtain further {{evidence on the}} association of the Loliumendophyte (a fungus parasitic in some perennial ryegrass) with the occurrence of ryegrass staggers in sheep (Fletcher & Harvey, 1981). In the experiment, 39 sheep grazing four plots established with perennial rye-grass seed (Lolium perenne) highly (> 90 %) infected with the endophyte all developed clinical ryegrass staggers over a 26 day grazing period. The same number of sheep grazing plots established from seed found to have negligible (< 3 X) endophyte infec-t ion showed no evidence of ryegrass staggers. The results clearly confirm that Lo/&m-endophvte infested ryegrass pastures are {{closely associated with the}} occurrence of ryegrass staggers in sheep. Observations made during regrowth of the ryegrass plots {{at the end of the}} grazing period showed that there was a 3 to 4 -fold greater production of dry matter from the high endophyte plots than from the low endophyte plots. The poor regrowth and low production recorded in low endophyte plots was found to be largely due to pasture predation by the Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Lisfronotus bonariensis). There is a firm indication that Lolium-endophyte infection of ryegrass confers resistance to <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> predations.

40|$|Loss in seed {{yield and}} {{therefore}} decrease in plant fitness due to simultaneous attacks by multiple herbivores {{is not necessarily}} additive, as demonstrated in evolutionary studies on wild plants. However, {{it is not clear}} how this transfers to crop plants that grow in very different conditions compared to wild plants. Nevertheless, loss in crop seed yield caused by any single pest is most often studied in isolation although crop plants are attacked by many pests that can cause substantial yield losses. This is especially important for crops able to compensate and even overcompensate for the damage. We investigated the interactive impacts on crop yield of four insect pests attacking different plant parts at different times during the cropping season. In 15 oilseed rape fields in Sweden, we estimated the damage caused by seed and <b>stem</b> <b>weevils,</b> pollen beetles, and pod midges. Pest pressure varied drastically among fields with very low correlation among pests, allowing us to explore interactive impacts on yield from attacks by multiple species. The plant damage caused by each pest species individually had, as expected, either no, or a negative impact on seed yield and the strongest negative effect was caused by pollen beetles. However, seed yield increased when plant damage caused by both seed and <b>stem</b> <b>weevils</b> was high, presumably due to the joint plant compensatory reaction to insect attack leading to overcompensation. Hence, attacks by several pests can change the impact on yield of individual pest species. Economic thresholds based on single species, on which pest management decisions currently rely, may therefore result in economically suboptimal choices being made and unnecessary excessive use of insecticides...|$|R

The biological efficacy of different tested active ingredients (lambda-cyhalothrin, bifenthrin, aplha-cypermethrin, DE- 225 and combination chlorpyrifos + cypermethrin) on poppy weevil (Stenocarus ruficornis S.) was evaluated in comparison with reference active ingredient (carbofuran) used as a standard treatment. The active ingredients were applied against the mentioned pest once in the season and were used in doses which were similar to those used against <b>stem</b> <b>weevils</b> in winter oil seed rape. Reference active ingredient was used in the dose which was authorised in the Czech Republic as standard ones against the poppy weevil. All active ingredients revealed efficacy which was measured (as a size of injuries) both on leaves and roots. Two trials were performed in 2001 – 2002 in which efficacy and selectivity were assessed...|$|R
50|$|Perennial {{ryegrass}} staggers {{is caused}} by the ingestion of grass that is infected by the endophyte fungus Epichloë festucae var lolli, and this fungus produces a variety of toxins such as peramine, a pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, and lolitrem B, an indole-diterpene compound. There is no external sign when perennial ryegrass is infected by this fungus. The Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Listronotus bonariensis) feeds on perennial ryegrass. When the grass on which they are feeding is infected by the fungus, the larvae of the weevil fail to develop fully. In an effort to breed perennial ryegrass that was resistant to the weevil, researchers in New Zealand inadvertently selected strains that were susceptible to the fungus. In fact the endophytic fungus forms a mutualistic association with the grass which grows more vigorously as a result and produces more tillers. With greater use of these susceptible cultivars, the fungus which is present in the seed, spread more widely with a consequent increase in perennial ryegrass staggers.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that most of the {{specialized}} rape pests prefer turnip rape over oilseed rape. In our studies two trap crop strategies were tested under field conditions in central Germany. In the first trial a turnip rape (Brassica rapa var. silvestris) strip was sown along the edges of the oilseed rape (Brassica napus) main crop. In the second trial a seed mixture of 95 % oilseed rape and 5 % turnip rape was sown and was compared to oilseed rape in pure crop. In both experiments the turnip rape trap crop was more attractive to <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala) and pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus) than the oilseed rape. Neither the border strip nor the intercropping was able to reduce the level of infestation of the oilseed rape crop and the damage caused by these pests. Both strategies were inapplicable to increase the grain yield of oilseed rape...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> {{flea beetle}} (CSFB), Psylliodes chrysocephala L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomeli-dae) {{is a major}} early season pest of oilseed rape {{throughout}} Europe. Pyrethroids {{have been used for}} controlling this pest by foliar application, but in recent years control failures have occurred, particularly in Germany due to the evolution of knock-down resistance (kdr). The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the incidence and spread of pyrethroid resis-tance in CSFB collected in Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom during 2014. The level of pyrethroid resistance was measured in adult vial tests and linked to the presence of kdr genotypes. Results Although kdr (L 1014 F) genotypes are present in all three countries, marked differences in pyrethroid efficacy were found in adult vial tests. Whereas Danish CSFB samples were in general susceptible to recommended label rates, those collected in the UK mostly resist such rates to some extent. Moderately resistant and susceptible samples were found i...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 56 th New Zealand Grassland Association Conference, 17 - 20 October 1994, Hanmer Springs. Endophytes in perennial ryegrass protect their hosts against attack by Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> but cause adverse affects, including heat stress, in grazing animals. Ten lambs were grazed on Grasslands Nui ryegrass without endophyte or with its wildtype or a high ergovaline-producing endophyte (196). Five lambs from the 196 treatment were swapped for 5 on the endophyte-free treatment after 20 days. Rectal temperatures and respiration rates were measured daily; on one day they were measured every 2 - 4 hours. There {{was a significant difference}} in respiration rate and body temperature between lambs grazing endophyte and endophyte free treatments but not between the two endophyte treatments. There was no interaction with ambient temperature within the range 12 - 30 °C. When lambs where transferred from toxic to non-toxic treatments there was no significant decrease in body temperature or respiration rate witbin 14 days. Ergovaline, even at low concentrations, affects thermo-regulation in lambs and is undesirable in perennial ryegrass endophyte associations...|$|R
