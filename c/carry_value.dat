5000|$|The Manchester carry {{chain is}} a {{variation}} of the carry-lookahead adder [...] that uses shared logic to lower the transistor count. As can be seen above in the implementation section, the logic for generating each carry contains all of the logic used to generate the previous carries. A Manchester carry chain generates the intermediate carries by tapping off nodes in the gate that calculates the most significant <b>carry</b> <b>value.</b> Not all logic families have these internal nodes however, CMOS being a major example. Dynamic logic can support shared logic, as can transmission gate logic. One of the major downsides of the Manchester carry chain is that the capacitive load of all of these outputs, together with the resistance of the transistors causes the propagation delay to increase much more quickly than a regular carry lookahead. A Manchester-carry-chain section generally won't exceed 4 bits.|$|E

Earlier in [5] it has been proved that sum of two non-negative integers is equal to the sum of their CVT and XOR values in any base system. In the present study, this phenomenon is extended to perform CVT and XOR operations for many non-negative integers in any base system. To achieve that both the definition of CVT and XOR are modified over the set of multiple integers instead of two. Also some important properties of these operations have been studied. With the help of cellular automata the adder circuit designed in [14] on using CVT-XOR recurrence formula is used to design a parallel adder circuit for multiple numbers in binary number system.

It is shown that CVT can be used for the production of periodic as well as chaotic patterns. Also, the analytical and algebraic properties of CVT are discussed. The definition of CVT in two-dimension is slightly modified and its mathematical properties are highlighted. Finally, the extension of CVT and modified CVT (MCVT) are done in higher dimensions.

40|$|Thesis (M. Th.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2005. The study {{examines}} the role religious institutions play {{in responding to}} health crises in the community with particular focus on HIV/AIDS. The thesis argues {{for the importance of}} focusing on health outcomes rather than the traditional "economic" models for assessing health sector in time of AIDS crisis. Health outcomes measures: good practice, increases accountability of services, quantifies the values of interventions where traditional research data may be impractical or lacking. It even assists in determining resource allocations and help to monitor and improve standards of care. This opens the door to focus on religious institutions, where selecting and measuring outcomes could be deeply connected to a community's or institution's mission and be able to describe a specific desirable result or quality of institution's services. The role of religious institutions has not been well recognized in dealing with health issues, and in particular within the religious community itself. Religious communities have not recognized their enormous assets, which they could mobilize in an effort to create good health conditions while facing the challenges of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other diseases. The {{study examines}} the involvement of a local Anglican Church, St Paul's in health in the urban context of Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal. The asset-based approach guides the study in capturing the basic notion that assets <b>carry</b> <b>value</b> and may be used to create greater value. The research findings show that the worshippers of St Paul's Anglican Church seem to have little understanding of their religious asset portfolio, which can be used effectively to improve the health conditions and health prospects of those in need in order to build healthy communities. The study argues that religious congregations and other faith-based organizations can {{play a vital role in}} local public health systems and community-based health improvements initiatives. In addition, faith communities can act as conveners and mobilizers of community residents and other faith-based groups around issues of health policy and interventions for health promotion and disease prevention (e. g. nutrition, care, VCT, etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{make many}} {{important}} decisions in social environments. Social judgements of interaction partners {{based on the}} cues they send likely influence those decisions, by shaping expectations about the utility or subjective desirability of interacting with those partners. Here I examine how subtle differences in social utility judgements shape the influence social cues have on the decision-making process, {{in a series of}} three broad questions. The first of these relates to the intrinsic value of specific social cues. Anecdotally, cues such as smiles <b>carry</b> <b>value</b> as social rewards. Using a novel application of expected utility theory in an economic game, I show that relative to polite smiles, participants value genuine smiles {{to the extent that they}} are willing to forgo the chance to win money for the chance to see these social rewards. This suggests that genuine smiles have value as social cues and increase the utility of the interaction partners who display them. In social interaction, people receive many different types of social cues. These include, static appearance-based cues such as facial trustworthiness, dynamic expressions such as smiles, and the social decisions an interaction partner makes. These cues sometimes conflict-for example, when an untrustworthy face smiles genuinely. My second question addresses how these cues interact during social decision-making. I investigated how conflicting cues modulate social utility in an investor-trustee game. Surprisingly, unfavourable appearance-based judgements biased investment behaviour long after people had learned the value of a face based on behaviour. Interestingly, a smile present at the time of feedback eliminated this bias. This suggests when more stable cues (appearance and behaviour) conflict, dynamic cues (expressions) are powerful modulators of social utility. My final question considered one mechanism for understanding how social cues shape decision-making. Specifically, social cues may bias the allocation of attention during social interactions, thereby shaping the social information people acquire. I examined how appearance- and behaviour-based judgements altered the allocation of attention to social stimuli. Strong appearance-based judgements (positive and negative) enhanced stimulus 10 / recognition but only positive behaviour-based judgements altered involuntary allocation of attention to stimuli. This suggests that behaviour-based social utility judgements alter pre-attentive processing, and consequently bias attention distribution. Taken together, these findings suggest that appearance, facial expression and behaviour cues all contribute to social utility, and this utility guides decision-making in social environments. 11 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 : Momentum Effects: G 10 Currency Return Survivals The chapter {{analyses}} momentum {{effects in}} G 10 currencies. For {{each of the}} currency crosses within the G 10 universe the chapter models the “survival” probabilities of trading signals obtained from a wide set of dual crossover moving average combinations. The application of statistical tools that stem from survival time analysis sheds light {{on the subject of}} market efficiency within the currency market. Empirical momentum signals from shorter-term trading rules outlive respective benchmark signals, while longer-term moving average crossover signals have lower life expectancy than theory would suggest. Furthermore, a trading strategy constructed from a subset of short-term moving average signals exhibits clear outperformance over a trading strategy that is generically composed from all moving average crossover signals. This outperformance persists over time. Chapter 2 : Momentum Effects: G 10 Currency Return Survivals, Implications for Trading Rules The chapter models survival probabilities of positive and negative momentum signals that are obtained from a wide set of dual crossover moving average combinations for all G 10 cross currency pairs. The results of this survival analysis are used to create trading rule enhancements that aim to outperform generic dual crossover moving average trading signals. The trading rule enhancements are assessed, by applying White’s (1999) “data snooper”. The results suggest that there is scope for trading rule enhancements to outperform generic trading rules. Moreover, results present strong evidence for Lo’s (2004) Adaptive Market Hypothesis. Chapter 3 : Momentum effects: Dissecting Generic G 10 Trading Rule Returns The chapter builds on the work of Pojarliev and Levich (2008, 2010), who dissect the returns of active currency managers by applying a multiple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to currency fund returns. Where the chapter differs is in the specification of the dependent variable, which is {{in the context of the}} present chapter a set of trading rule parameterisations that are applied to a broad range of currency pairs. The results of this chapter suggest that there is some alpha embedded in the returns of technical trading rules. The chapter also establishes a comparatively strong positive, statistically significant link between the risk factors Trend, Momentum, Risk Aversion. The results of the chapter clearly indicate that shorter-term moving averages exhibit less systematic exposure than longer term moving averages. Other factors such as <b>Carry,</b> <b>Value</b> and Volatility have a considerably less pronounced relationship; only few factor sensitivities are statistically significant. Moreover, the results also indicate that systematic risk exposures of trend following trading strategies change with small adjustments in the design of trading rules...|$|E
