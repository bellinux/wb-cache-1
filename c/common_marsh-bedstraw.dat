5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow (Salix). Precise favoured species are unclear; {{at least one of}} the tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) or the dark-leaved willow (S.myrsinifolia) is a possible symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the bay willow (S.pentandra), the grey willow (S.cinnerea), the grey alder (Alnus incana) and species of birch (Betula). I.saliceticola is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (Sphagnum squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), the <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw</b> (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I.acuta and I.laceravar.helobia.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the floods}} are less {{frequent}} the hardwoods themselves are absent, {{giving way to}} open country. The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog. The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by calamagrostides blanchâtres, by purple moor grass, bogbean, yellow loosestrife, swamp cinquefoil, lesser spearwort, <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw,</b> kingcup, purple loosestrife and violettes, the last being an endangered species in the country. In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly bog myrtle, bog-rosemary, common cottongrass and species of Carex. The soil is often covered in peat mosses and other mosses.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{constant}} {{species are}} found in this community, Grey Willow (Salix cinerea) and <b>Common</b> <b>Marsh-bedstraw</b> (Galium palustre).|$|E
50|$|The area to {{the south}} of the central {{embankment}} is marshland, damp and water-logged. Rushes are abundant, and plants include Marsh-marigold, Cuckooflower, Meadow-sweet, Ragged-robin, Lesser Spearwort and <b>Common</b> <b>Marsh-bedstraw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Soft rush (Juncus effusus), sharp-flowered rush (Juncus acutiflorus), oval sedge (Carex leporina), common yellow-sedge (Carex demissa), {{carnation}} sedge (Carex panicea), <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw</b> (Galium palustre), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), ragged-robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi), greater birds-foot-trefoil (Lotus uliginosus), bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella) and bristle clubrush (Isolepis setacea).|$|E
50|$|Marsh {{varieties}} of plants include marsh pennywort, lesser spearwort, marsh speedwell, <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw,</b> floating sweet-grass and {{various types of}} sedge. Where there are drier areas {{at the edge of}} the water, purple moor-grass, common bent, tufted hair-grass and various rushes flourish. Uncommon bog asphodel is present and is recorded as an increasing population.|$|E
50|$|The {{total area}} of {{permanent}} standing water is 5.5 ha, though {{the area is}} subject to periodic flooding, when standing water can temporarily cover the entire site and fresh sediment is deposited. Part of Marston Lake, {{the largest of the}} three permanent lakes, is fringed with tall fen vegetation, characterised by Bulrush, Typha latifolia, Meadowsweet, Filipendula ulmaria, and <b>Common</b> <b>Marsh-bedstraw,</b> Galium palustre.|$|E
5000|$|Much of the {{grassland}} {{is dominated}} by perennial rye-grass, with a good diversity of common wild flowers, {{and there are also}} areas of dry acid grassland. Several damp hollows, probably former ponds, contain tussocky grassland with uncommon wild flowers such as great burnet, bog stitchwort and <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw.</b> A map of the 1840s shows fourteen ponds, but only Laurel Farm Pond survives. This is frequented by large numbers of geese and mallards. Trees include pedunculate oak, beech and horse chestnut.|$|E
50|$|The {{trees along}} the canal include pedunculate oak, ash, crack willow and field maple. The area is colonised with common reed, reed sweet-grass and the more open areas support marsh-marigold, yellow water-lily, water dock and gipsywort. Meadowsweet and great willowherb flourish. There is also common valerian, purple-loosestrife, <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw,</b> yellow iris, ragged robin and marsh woundwort. Woodland flowers such as primrose, bluebell, yellow {{archangel}} and bugle thrive in a small wood near the tunnel entrance and under the towpath hedgerows. This wetland area supports a variety of fungi, liverworts and mosses.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the park}} {{does not have}} the vast marshes and lakes {{characteristic}} {{of the rest of the}} region, water is nevertheless present everywhere. The humid zones are rich with a great diversity of flora and fauna. The stratification of vegetation is just as valid in the humid zones. In the montane region, the humid soils are covered with flowers such as the northern Labrador tea, cottonsedge, the Goldilocks buttercup, St Olaf's candlestick, common selfheal and <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw.</b> In the subalpine zone, the humid prairies mainly have mats of Globe-flower, kingcup and twoflower violet. In the alpine region there are many subalpine plants as well as the Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum, and the vegetation decreases as the altitude increases.|$|E
50|$|The hamlet {{is located}} on the B6270 between Thwaite and Keld below Great Shunner Fell and close to a small beck named Skeb Skeugh. The area around this beck, known as Angram Bottoms, has been {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is made of seven fields covering 24.2 acres supporting a diverse habitat of flora. A combination of mire and wet grassland, due to many sinkholes and springs. Plants in the wet grasslands that can be found here include sharp-flowered rush, lesser spearwort, slender tufted-sedge, bottle sedge, <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw,</b> northern marsh-orchid, marsh-marigold and meadowsweet. Other areas of marsh support marsh lousewort, carnation sedge, flea sedge, star sedge, marsh valerian and marsh violet.|$|E
50|$|The large pond is {{populated}} with spiked water-milfoil (Myriophylium spicatum), Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis), yellow-flowered fringed water-lily (Nymphoides peltata), and beds of bulrush (Typha latifolia), common reed (Phragmites australis), sea club-rush (Scirpus maritimus) and grey club-rush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani). The pond provides a habitat and {{breeding ground for}} a variety of waterfowl such as the mute swan, tufted duck, coot and dabchick. Other avians species nesting at the pond include gadwall, water rail, reed warbler, sedge warbler, reed bunting and other passerines. The three smaller ponds are more shallow - one sufficiently so to dry up in times of low rainfall. They host rushes (Juncaceae) and bulrush, water mint (Mentha aquatica), false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum), common fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), gipsywort (Lyccous europaeus), branched bur-reed (Sparganium erectum), <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw</b> (Galium palusrre), and water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica). Two species, parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii) and sea club-rush indicate brackish water.|$|E
50|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow (Salix). Precise favoured species are unclear; {{at least one of}} the tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) or the dark-leaved willow (S. myrsinifolia) is a possible symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the bay willow (S. pentandra), the grey willow (S. cinnerea), the grey alder (Alnus incana) and species of birch (Betula). I. saliceticola is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (Sphagnum squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), the <b>common</b> <b>marsh-bedstraw</b> (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I. acuta and I. lacera var. helobia.|$|E
