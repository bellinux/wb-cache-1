5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> {{important role in}} driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, {{it has also been}} demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{the main}} game, players <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> {{additional}} mode called Flick Rush, which can be played alone or with another player via wireless multiplayer. In this mode, players battle {{with a team of}} three Spirits and pit them against each other. Players fight against their opponent by flicking up cards from the touchscreen. Each card has a number value determining its attack strength, with multiple cards combining to increase the overall value. The player whose attack value is greater than their opponent's gets to attack with their Spirit. A slowly replenishing meter determines how many cards the player can send out at a time, and each Spirit has a limited amount of cards that can be replenished by swapping them out with another Spirit. The first player to eliminate all of their opponent's Spirits wins the game.|$|E

25|$|According to Rimé, if {{the social}} sharing {{experience}} is a pleasant one, it could help to strengthen socio-affective links between the two people. As seen in the diagram, social sharing can result in reciprocal affection between the two people involved, and <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> obvious role in attachment. When the social sharing is done between partners in an intimate relationship, it {{could be seen as}} a reinforcement of their affective bond.|$|E
25|$|Barnacles <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} role in estimating paleo-water depths. The degree of disarticluation of fossils suggests the distance they have been transported, and since many species have narrow ranges of water depths, it can be assumed that the animals lived in shallow water and broke up as they were washed down-slope. The completeness of fossils, and nature of damage, can thus be used to constrain the tectonic history of regions.|$|E
25|$|Although the resource-based view of {{the firm}} recognizes the {{important}} role of knowledge in firms that achieve a competitive advantage, proponents of the knowledge-based view argue that the resource-based perspective does not go far enough. Specifically, the RBV treats knowledge as a generic resource, rather than having special characteristics. It therefore does not distinguish between different types of knowledge-based capabilities. Information technologies <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> important role in the knowledge-based {{view of the}} firm in that information systems can be used to synthesize, enhance, and expedite large-scale intra- and inter-firm knowledge management (Alavi and Leidner 2001).|$|E

25|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} of resources can influence plant community composition, diversity and assembly trajectory. Baer et al. (2005) manipulated soil resource heterogeneity in a tallgrass prairie restoration project. They found increasing resource heterogeneity, which {{on its own}} was insufficient to insure species diversity in situations where one species may dominate across the range of resource levels. Their findings {{were consistent with the}} theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly. The establishment of a single species, best adapted to the physical and biological conditions <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> inordinately important role in determining the community structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of new digital technologies has resulted in an exponential growth in the volume {{of information and knowledge}} available, and made them more readily accessible to greater numbers of people throughout the world. As such, information and communication technologies <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> essential role in the sharing of knowledge and expertise in the service of sustainable development and in a spirit of solidarity. And yet, for many observers, the world is witnessing rising levels of ethnic, cultural and religious intolerance, often using the same communication technologies for ideological and political mobilization to promote exclusivist worldviews. This mobilization often leads to further criminal and political violence and to armed conflict. This also leads to new modes of intolerance such as cyberbullying.|$|E
25|$|In February 2013 a {{study found}} common genetic links between five major {{psychiatric}} disorders: autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Abnormal functioning of neurotransmitter systems has {{been implicated in}} several mental disorders, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and glutamate systems. Differences have also {{been found in the}} size or activity of certain brain regions in some cases. Psychological mechanisms have also been implicated, such as cognitive (e.g. reasoning) biases, emotional influences, personality dynamics, temperament and coping style. Studies have indicated that variation in genes <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> important {{role in the development of}} mental disorders, although the reliable identification of connections between specific genes and specific categories of disorder has proven more difficult. Environmental events surrounding pregnancy and birth have also been implicated. Traumatic brain injury may increase the risk of developing certain mental disorders. There have been some tentative inconsistent links found to certain viral infections, to substance misuse, and to general physical health.|$|E

25|$|Ethnicity <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> {{especially}} {{large part}} in determining health outcomes for impoverished minorities. Poverty can overpower race, but within poverty, race highly contributes to health outcomes. African Americans, even {{in some of}} the wealthiest cities in the United States, have lower life expectancy at birth than people in much poorer countries like China or India. According to studies, black individuals in South Africa suffer worse morbidity and mortality rates due to the limited access to social resources. Poverty is the chief cause of the endemic amounts of disease and hunger and malnutrition among this population. A disproportionate number of cases of the AIDS epidemic in North America are from American minorities, with 72% of women's AIDS cases among Hispanic or African-American women. Farmer says the growing mortality differentials between whites and blacks must be attributed to class differentials- which includes recognizing race within impoverished populations. Recognition of race as a determining factor for poor health without recognizing poverty has misled individuals to believe race is the only factor.|$|E

500|$|While {{international}} trade in greenhouse gas reductions holds substantial promise {{as a source of}} new funding for sustainable development, this market can be largely inaccessible to many smaller-scale projects, remote communities, and least developed localities. [...] To facilitate participation and broaden the benefits, several barriers must be overcome, including: a lack of market awareness among stakeholders and prospective participants; specialized, somewhat complicated participation rules; and the need for simplified participation mechanisms for small projects, without which transaction costs can overwhelm the financial benefits of participation.
