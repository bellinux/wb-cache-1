50|$|Fish {{comprise}} about 80% of {{the diet}} of eagles nesting in the Amur River. Elsewhere, other prey can comprise almost an equally important portion {{of the diet}}. Nonpiscine prey consists largely of water-dwelling birds, including ducks, geese, swans, cranes, herons, and gulls. Along the sea coast and in Kamchatka, water birds {{are the most common}} prey for Steller's sea eagles. Among bird prey, this eagle has shown a strong local preference for slaty-backed gulls (Larus schistisagus). Common and thick-billed murres (Uria aalge and U. lomvia, respectively) dominated the diet around the Sea of Okhotsk, followed by black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), slaty-backed gulls, crested auklets (Aethia cristatella), and pelagic cormorants (Phalacrocorax <b>capillatus).</b> Small chicks of murres and cormorants were sometimes taken alive in Russia and brought back to nests, where they independently fed on remains of fish in the eagles' nests until they were killed themselves. In Russia, upland bird species, black-billed capercaillie (Tetrao parvirostris) and willow and rock ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus & L. muta) can be an important prey species. Grouse are not typically taken by other Haliaeetus species. Other landbirds hunted by Steller's sea eagles have included short-eared owls (Asio flammeus), snowy owl (Bubo scandiaca), carrion crow (Corvus corone) and common raven (Corvus corax), as well as (rarely) smaller passerines. In one case, a Steller's sea eagle was observed feeding on a rare prey item in the Northern Hemisphere, a great albatross (Diomedea), as that genus nests in the sub-Antarctic oceans. This sea eagle may supplement its diet with various mammals (especially hares), crabs, mussels, Nereis worms and squid when given the opportunity.|$|E

From September through November 2011, a total of 207 cattle, 85 sheep, 47 dogs and 16 cats were examined for ectoparasites. Results of morphological identification revealed several species of ectoparasites: Linognathus vituli (L. vituli), Bovicola bovis (B. bovis) and Solenopotes <b>capillatus</b> (S. <b>capillatus)</b> on cattle; B. ovis and Melophagus ovinus (M. ovinus) on sheep; and Heterodoxus spiniger (H. spiniger) on dogs. There was a significantly (p# 0. 0001) higher prevalence of L. vituli observed in cattle than both S. <b>capillatus</b> and B. bovis. Molecular identification of lice using an 18 S rRNA gene analysis confirms the identified lice species by morphological methods. We detected different Acinetobacter species among lice (11. 1 %) and keds (86. 4 %) including A. soli in L. vituli of cattle, A. lowffii in M. ovinus of sheep, A. pittii in H. spiniger of dogs, 1 new Acinetobacter spp. in M. ovinus and 2 new Acinetobacter spp. in H. spiniger of dogs using partial rpoB gene sequence analysis. There was a significantly higher prevalence of Acinetobacter spp. in keds than in lice (p# 0. 00001). Higher percentage of Acinetobacter spp. DNA was detected in H. spiniger than in both B. ovis and L. vituli (p# 0. 00001). Carbapenemase resistance encoding genes for blaOXA- 23, blaOXA- 24, blaOXA- 58, blaNDM- 1 and blaOXA- 51 were not found in any lice and keds.
