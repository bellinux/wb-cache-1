5|$|Beginning in medias res, while Piz (Chris Lowell) and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{are at a}} party, a bloodied Veronica stumbles to Piz’s {{door and}} collapses. The episode flashes back to two days earlier. As the Lilith House celebrates {{the end of the}} Greek system, Logan (Jason Dohring) {{abruptly}} breaks up with Veronica. Weevil helps Dean O’Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) fix his TV. A man comes into the Dean’s office and implicitly threatens to remove his funding if the Greek system stays closed. The Dean tells Keith (Enrico Colantoni) to track his wife, and Veronica sobs in the shower due to her breakup with Logan. The Dean unexpectedly reinstates the Greek system, to the delight of Dick (Ryan Hansen). The Dean and Veronica spot a <b>classified</b> <b>ad</b> that states that a mysterious person will find his next victim at a party.

Veronica enlists Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Piz, and Mac for help in investigating an upcoming Pi Sig party.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Bain first played {{competitive}} {{ice hockey}} when he answered a <b>classified</b> <b>ad</b> {{placed in a}} newspaper by the Winnipeg Victorias, who were looking for new players. Though he played with a broken stick held together by wire, Bain made the team only five minutes into the tryout. Bain quickly became a star centre and leader for the Victorias. This was proven during a February 14, 1896 game against the Montreal Victorias for the Stanley Cup, the trophy for the national hockey championship in Canada. It was a 2–0 victory for Winnipeg that gave them the Cup. This victory {{marked the first time}} a team outside of Quebec had won the trophy. The team was greeted by a huge crowd at the Canadian Pacific Railway station when their train, decorated with hockey sticks and the Union Jack, returned to Winnipeg. They were led to a feast in their honour in a parade of open sleighs, where fans gathered to celebrate the championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Mr. Burns fires Homer for his laziness and incompetence. Looking for work, Homer answers a <b>classified</b> <b>ad</b> {{to become a}} grave digger. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns is nearing the {{completion}} of his giant robotic laborer, which he hopes will eventually replace weak-bodied human workers. The only remaining step is to implant a human brain into the machine's body. Searching a graveyard the following night, Mr. Burns mistakes Homer, snoring in an open grave, for a newly buried corpse and, despite signs that Homer may still be alive, removes Homer's brain with an ice cream scoop and places it in the robot. However, Robo-Homer is just as lazy and incompetent as he was as a human, using his X-ray vision to locate donuts. Mr. Burns declares the experiment a failure and, after restoring the brain to Homer's still-living body, kicks the robot, which topples over and crushes Mr. Burns. Afterward, he tells Smithers to get some surgical tools and ether.|$|E

500|$|When Werbin {{finished}} graduate school, {{he looked}} for business opportunities and decided to use his knowledge of used guitars. He searched for vintage instruments to buy at low prices, particularly those made before World War II; Werbin then sold the instruments after repairing and restoring them. Although he initially tried to open his business in Ann Arbor, Werbin eventually decided to avoid operating there due to {{the high number of}} other musical instrument dealers. In 1972, Werbin and Sharon McInturff, his college friend and business partner, leased retail space in East Lansing, Michigan for $60 a month in a building that also housed the Michigan Youth Politics Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging young adults to vote. With $500 of capital, the two began advertising locally.

2500|$|After Affinity {{played their}} last gig in 1970 Foster decided {{that rather than}} being an over-educated but {{unemployed}} musician he needed to join another band. He placed a <b>classified</b> <b>ad</b> in Melody Maker magazine stating [...] "Bass Guitarist: ex-name group, wishes to join established Family/Colosseum/Traffic type group". He expected no response, but a music producer called Christos Demetriou (i.e. Chris Demetriou) unexpectedly called and offered him a job with ex-Manfred Mann singer Mike d'Abo's band. After touring with the band both in the US and in the UK, Foster's name started to get around.

[...] "I knew nothing about sessions and turned up with a flask and sandwiches because I didn't know how long I'd be there for.

That {{was the beginning of}} a word of mouth situation which gradually mushroomed." [...] The European disco scene was growing and session work was increasing and Mo was hired to play on a lot of the popular hits of the time including Jimmy Helms' [...] "Gonna Make You An Offer You Can't Refuse", Cerrone's hit [...] "Supernature".|$|E
2500|$|Passionate {{about the}} art of winemaking, in 1981 Baron moved to the Bordeaux region of France to gain {{experience}} {{in one of the}} world's finest wine producing regions. He was involved in the production of two vintages in various chateaus, gaining a valuable insight into its history and in cultivating top-notch wines, changing his perception of winemaking. While in France, Daniel was hired at the legendary Chateau Petrus where he met owner Christian Moueix, winemaker Jean-Claude Berrouet, and cellarmaster Jean Veyssiere and his son Francois, who he credits with providing him detailed knowledge into the history of viticulture and the business of winemaking. Baron has said that they [...] "taught me about wine as a part of culture and how history, quality and tradition are intertwined with the practical aspects of winemaking." [...] Moueix {{is considered to be a}} major winemaker of the Bordeaux region of France. After a successful harvest at Chateau Petrus in 1982, Moueix established a new winery, Dominus Estate, in the Napa Valley, and asked Baron to manage the facility; he worked there until 1994. In 1994, Baron met co-founder of Silver Oak Cellars, Justin Meyer, after seeing a quirky <b>classified</b> <b>ad</b> in the newspaper Wine Country. Meyer soon began training Baron as his eventual successor, and Baron was ultimately appointed Silver Oak winemaker in 1994. Baron said of Meyer, [...] "Justin instilled in me both pride in what Silver Oak had accomplished and the humility to realize that there is always room to improve. He constantly searched for ways to raise quality, and that’s become one of our core values at Silver Oak. Baron quickly became successful; Meyer considered the 1995 variety to be the best of the 1990s, and noted wine critic Robert M. Parker was also impressed with Silver Oak’s 1997 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E
