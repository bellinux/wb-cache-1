5|$|Inside Man was {{director}} of photography Matthew Libatique's second film with Lee. Because the filmmakers intended to finish with a digital intermediate (the post-production digital manipulation of color and lighting), Libatique chose to shoot Inside Man in the Super 35 format for a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. He mainly used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 and Vision2 Expression 500T 5229 film stocks. The film was shot with Arricam and Arriflex <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> Cooke S4 lenses.|$|E

5|$|The TSR-2 {{was also}} to be {{equipped}} with a reconnaissance pack in the weapons bay which included an optical linescan unit built by EMI, three <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> a sideways-looking radar (SLR) in order {{to carry out the}} majority of its reconnaissance tasks. Unlike modern linescan units that use infrared imaging, the TSR-2's linescan would use daylight imaging or an artificial light source to illuminate the ground for night reconnaissance.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 Eastman Kodak, whose {{laboratories}} {{had been}} doing all the film processing work, made an approach to purchase the <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> the technology.

25|$|The {{walls of}} the set were on rollers and could silently be {{moved out of the}} way {{to make way for the}} <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> then {{replaced}} when they were to come back into shot. Prop men constantly had to move the furniture and other props out of the way of the large Technicolor <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> then ensure they were replaced in the correct location. A team of soundmen <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> operators kept the <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> microphones in constant motion, as the actors kept to a carefully choreographed set of cues.|$|R
25|$|Filmed in 16mm on {{a shoestring}} budget, the crew {{included}} Paul Josephson on <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> lighting, Craig Reynolds and Jay Cassidy on <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> Jon Duff on sound recording. It was filmed mostly {{in a suburb of}} Detroit, Michigan from 1970 to 1971.|$|R
5|$|The camera's {{resolution}} is two-and-a-half {{times higher than}} the handheld's screens.

5|$|The cyclist seen {{passing in}} the middle of a sword fight during the tuk tuk chase {{sequence}} was in fact a bystander who passed through the shot, oblivious to the filming; his intrusion was captured by two <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> left in the final film.

5|$|The lens is {{equipped}} with a full-frame digital SLR-compatible mount allowing the usage of both APS-C sized <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> formats larger than APS-C – the build in lens hood however visibly restricts the field of view (FOV) on formats larger than APS-C – see example above. The FOV in APS-C sized cameras is further restricted at shorter focal lengths if the front cap adaptor ring is not removed – see example below.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop control {{software}} for a multi-spectral imaging system. The multi-spectral imaging system used by the colour Lab consists of a camera (Alta USB <b>camera)</b> <b>and</b> a filter (VariSpec liquid crystal tuneable filter). The <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> the filter were delivered by two different manufacturers and therefore have two separate stand-alone control programs. The fact that the hardware had {{to be controlled by}} two separate pieces of software meant that the image capturing procedure was very time-consuming and needed an unrealistic amount of user input. The project resulted in a C++ console program with all the required and necessary functionsas those provided by the individual software, <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> filter; and operated both the <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> the filter simultaneously and conveniently. The project was performed at the Norwegian colour Laboratory in Gjøvik University College...|$|R

5|$|A primary {{function}} of the FMPU was the training of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted men. They were trained to {{use a variety of}} photographic equipment and <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> also received combat and weapons training. The cameramen were sent to every army air force base to document all aspects of the base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was trained to load film into their camera under adverse conditions, and if need be, to develop it on location. Most of the aerial motion picture photography shot during World War II was filmed by Fort Roach alumni.|$|E
40|$|Motion Control was {{produced}} with an Arts Council England / BBC Dance for <b>Camera</b> Award <b>and</b> examines the synergy between <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> performer.
