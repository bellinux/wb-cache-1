40|$|A common {{feature of}} systems of {{conservation}} laws of continuum physics {{is that they}} are endowed with natural <b>companion</b> <b>laws</b> which are in such case most often related to the second law of thermodynamics. This observation easily generalizes to any symmetrizable system of conservation laws. They are endowed with nontrivial companion conservation laws, which are immediately satisfied by classical solutions. Not surprisingly, weak solutions may fail to satisfy <b>companion</b> <b>laws,</b> which are then often relaxed from equality to inequality and overtake a role of a physical admissibility condition for weak solutions. We want to answer the question what is a critical regularity of weak solutions to a general system of conservation laws to satisfy an associated companion law as an equality. An archetypal example of such result was derived for the incompressible Euler system by Constantin et al. ([8]) {{in the context of the}} seminal Onsager's conjecture. This general result can serve as a simple criterion to numerous systems of mathematical physics to prescribe the regularity of solutions needed for an appropriate companion law to be satisfied...|$|E
40|$|For a Camelot-era {{piece of}} legislation, the Wire Act {{has a long}} and {{unintended}} shadow. Used haltingly in the 1960 s, when the Wire Act failed to deliver the death blow to organized crime, 1970 ’s Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) became a far better weapon against the mob. Yet starting in the 1990 s, the Wire Act enjoyed a second life, when the Justice Department used to it prosecute operators of online betting Web sites that, headquartered in jurisdictions where such businesses were legal, took bets from American citizens. The legislative history of the Wire Act, however, suggests that it was intended for a much more selective application, and {{that the use of}} the Act to penalize those who provide cross-border betting services to Americans, while perhaps faithful to the broad letter of the Act, is a departure from its spirit. Analyzing the social and political ferment in which the Wire Act and its <b>companion</b> <b>laws</b> were brewed shows that the entire package of ostensibly anti-gambling legislation passed by Congress in the summer of 1961 was actually an anti-organized crime measure that only attacked purveyors of gambling because of their important position in the organized crime chain of command. It was not then intended as a sweeping federal effort to curtail public access to gambling. Further, the fact that the same committee in which the attorney general received his initial education in organized crime proposed, in the following year, an expansion of the Act to cover technologies not specified in the original law, suggests that the Wire Act was intended to cover only a limited range of wire facilities—not the broad spectrum of communications technologies, most of which had not yet been invented in 1961, for which later prosecutors dusted it off...|$|E

50|$|Use of the Swiss Made {{label for}} watches {{is covered by}} an {{ordinance}} of the Federal Council dated 29 December 1971. The Swiss standard is often pejoratively {{referred to as the}} 60% Rule. However, it has its basis in real life economics. Again, the law merely sets forth a minimum standard. The famous or infamous Swiss Made Ordinance has, for a number of years, been subject to many criticisms, particularly inside the industry, because it is considered too lax, but also in legal circles, where the view is that it no longer fully meets the legal mandate specified in the <b>companion</b> <b>law</b> on trademarks (SR 232.11).It is not generally known that quite a few Swiss companies have watches assembled in China for export to North America, Asia and even Europe, where the brand name {{is more important than the}} “Swiss made” label. Such watches may consist of a Chinese case and a Chinese crystal, a Taiwan-made dial and metal bracelet and Japanese hands. If the movement is to be considered Swiss, 51% of its value must be Swiss and at least the last wheel must be added in Switzerland. Swiss watch brands without the “Swiss made” label are usually equipped with a Japanese movement. The “Swiss parts” label means that the movement is assembled in Asia using kits consisting at least partially of Swiss made components.|$|R
