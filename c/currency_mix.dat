Because of the <b>currency</b> <b>mix</b> being more or less equal when comparing the Claims with the held Assets, the risk for currency exchange losses {{are expected to be}} relatively low for the receivership.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model {{to explain how the}} {{currency}} of a country evolves in im-portance as an invoicing currency in trade settlement as the relative size of the country grows. The coalescing e¤ect, which induces individual 8 ̆ 5 rms to choose the similar invoicing <b>currency</b> <b>mix</b> as their competitors so as to limit output volatility, not only facilitates the internationalization of a currency, but also accelerates this process by creating a positive feedback between actions of individual 8 ̆ 5 rms and their competitors. We also show that, as the country grows, its currency {{is more likely to be}} used by small and close trading partners to invoice trade than its larger and less close counterparts. Moreover, wider use of a currency for invoicing in the issuing countrys home market would help spread the use of the currency to other markets. Furthermore, we can explain the tipping phenomenon the non-linear relationship between the international use of a currency and the economic size of the issuing country. The non-linearity arises from an a ¢ nity for the established international currency. We confront our hypotheses with trade invoicing data on euro and dollar of 35 countries (1998 - 2010) and invoicing data on four major international curren-cies for trade between Thailand and 19 countries (2001 - 2008), and 8 ̆ 5 nd that the results are consistent with our theory...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{two aspects}} of firm behavior in emerging markets. Chapters 1 and 3 consider the decision of firms to borrow in domestic or foreign currency {{and the implications of}} this decision on fixed capital and inventory investment. Chapter 2 explores the effects of institutions, via transaction costs, on the variety of intermediate goods used by firms in different economies, and the effects of this choice on productivity levels. Much has been written recently about the problems for emerging markets that might result from a mismatch between foreign currency denominated liabilities and assets (or income flows) denominated in local currency. In particular, several models, developed in the aftermath of financial crises of the late 1990 's, suggest that the expansion in the "peso" value of "dollar" liabilities resulting from a devaluation either aggravated or triggered many of the recent financial crises. However, little evidence has been presented either on the effects of foreign currency debt on investment or the variables that affect firm level debt choice in the first place. Two of the papers in this dissertation (Chapters 1 and 3) attempt to fill this gap using a new database with accounting information (including the currency composition of liabilities) for close to 400 non-financial firms in five Latin American countries. In Chapter 1 (coauthored with Hoyt Bleakley) we estimate, at the firm level, the reduced-form effect on investment of holding foreign currency denominated debt during an exchange rate realignment. We consistently find that this effect is positive, contrary to the predicted sign of the net-worth effect. (cont.) Additionally, we show that the estimated coefficient can be decomposed into competitiveness and net-worth effects, and provide direct evidence that the competitiveness effect dominates the net-worth effect. We argue that the positive response of investment is the result of firms debt choice decisions. If those firms holding dollar debt are also those firms whose current and future incomes benefit most from a devaluation then {{it is not surprising that}} the contractionary balance sheet effects of devaluations are more than offset by expansionary competitiveness effects. In Chapter 3 I explore the issue of debt choice in more detail with the help of a simple model of debt composition. In the model, firms hedge against exchange rate shocks by altering the <b>currency</b> <b>mix</b> of their liabilities. Within a sample of non-financial Latin American firms I find that firms holding dollar debt are those whose income we expect a priori to be more highly correlated with the exchange rate. I also find evidence that firms holding dollar debt are less credit constrained. Finally, I explore variations across countries and over time in the determinants and levels of dollarization. Within the sample of Latin American corporations I find that exchange rate stability has a significant positive effect on the level of dollarization. All three empirical findings are consistent with a model of debt composition in which credit constraints lead to risk averse behavior by firms Although there is growing evidence of the role of institutions in explaining cross country differences in income per capita, there is still little evidence as to the precise mechanisms by which institutions affect economic outcomes [...] . by Kevin Cowan.

40|$|Abstract. We propose Mixcoin, a {{protocol}} to facilitate anonymous payments in Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies. We {{build on the}} emergent phenomenon of <b>currency</b> <b>mixes,</b> adding an accountability mechanism to expose theft. We demonstrate that incentives of mixes and clients can be aligned to ensure that rational mixes will not steal. Our scheme is efficient and fully compatible with Bitcoin. Against a passive attacker, our scheme provides an anonymity set of all other users mixing coins contemporaneously. This is an interesting new property with no clear analog in better-studied communication mixes. Against active attackers our scheme offers similar anonymity to traditional communication mixes. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the impact of the}} introduction of the Euro currency on the market efficiency of 10 of the most developed European stock markets during the period 1988 to 2012. We use an autocorrelation test, a runs test, various formulations of the variance ratio test and the nonlinear BDS test, which are performed on daily data for the full sample period, as well as two subsets dictated by the introduction of the Euro currency. The full sample results are mixed, with the Netherlands accepting market efficiency and Ireland completely rejecting it, with the other markets providing mixed evidence for market efficiency. The subsample period results show that while some markets became more efficient after the introduction of the Euro currency (Spain and Finland) and some markets became more inefficient (France), some were unaffected by the introduction of the Euro (the Netherlands and Italy). Overall our results show that the impact of the Euro <b>currency</b> is <b>mixed,</b> indicating that its introduction was not a decisive factor in the behaviour of stock returns in European markets...|$|R

More advanced counters can identify different bill denominations to provide a total <b>currency</b> value of <b>mixed</b> banknotes, including those that are upside down. Some banknote counters can also detect counterfeit bills either magnetically and/or using blacklight.

Also, the paper used for printing money does not contain any of the brightening agents which make commercially available papers fluoresce under black light. Both features make counterfeit notes both easier to detect and more difficult to successfully produce.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the volatility {{dynamics of the}} financial futures returns. Samuelson (1965) demonstrated theoretically that the conditional variance of changes in futures prices should increase as the time-to-maturity decreases. Interestingly, the empirical evidence on the Samuelson hypothesis is mixed. This essay revisits that issue, applying a unified GARCH framework to a unique data set of daily data, spanning 19 years up to 2000, and eleven types of financial contracts (currencies, S&P 500, Nikkei 225, Eurodollar, Treasury Bills). The conditional variance equation is augmented by time-to-maturity, open interest and trading volume variables. I detect evidence for a role of the time-to-maturity in <b>currency</b> futures, and <b>mixed</b> evidence in equity index and interest rate futures. Lagged trading volume and open interest are positively related to volatility {{in most of these}} financial futures but they do not fully account for the estimated conditional variance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monetary exchange rate model with imperfect capital mobility, slow adjustment of goods {{prices in the}} short-term and currency substitution. As in Dornbusch’s model (1976), it is demonstrated that an exogenous monetary shock can lead to an initial overshooting of the exchange rate. In our model, this phenomenon derives from the presence of currency substitution. This model is illustrated with reference to three developing countries, Ghana, Paraguay and Uruguay, using quarterly data covering the period of independently floating exchange rate regime for each of them. At least one co-integrating vector between the exchange rate and its determinants is identified, lending support to {{the interpretation of the}} monetary exchange rate model as describing a long-run phenomenon. We estimate error-correction models to investigate the adjustment process to the long-run equilibrium. We find without ambiguity an overshooting phenomenon in the short-run in the case of Uruguay. For the two others countries, the results are <b>mixed.</b> <b>Currency</b> Substitution, Monetary model, Nominal exchange rate...|$|R
40|$|The paper investigates {{whether the}} East African Community, {{comprising}} of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, constitutes an {{optimum currency area}} or not. The East African Community has been revived, {{and one of the}} long-term objectives of the Community is to have a common currency. The paper employs the Generalised Purchasing Power Parity method, and various criteria suggested by the theory of Optimum Currency Areas to investigate the optimality of the Community as a currency area. While the various indices that we calculated based on the theory of Optimum <b>Currency</b> Areas gave <b>mixed</b> verdicts, the Generalised Purchasing Power Parity (G-PPP) method supports the formation of a currency union in the region. Using the G-PPP method, we were able to establish cointegration between the real exchange rates in East Africa for the period 1981 to 1998, and even for the period 1990 to 1998. This finding suggests that the three countries tend to be affected by similar shocks. Optimum Currency Area; Cointegration; Purchasing Power Parity; East Africa; Kenya; Tanzania; Uganda. ...|$|R
2500|$|A quick {{thinking}} orator with {{a remarkable}} wit, he {{was committed to}} republicanism and advocated a commercial agrarian society throughout his three decades in Congress. Randolph's conservative stance, displayed in his arguments against debt and {{for the rights of}} the landed gentry, have been attributed to his ties to his family estate and the elitist values of his native Southside Virginia. His belief in the importance of a landed gentry led him to oppose the abolition of entail and primogeniture, [...] "The old families of Virginia will form connections with low people, and sink into the mass of overseers' sons and daughters". Randolph vehemently opposed the War of 1812 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820; he was active in debates about tariffs, manufacturing, and <b>currency.</b> With <b>mixed</b> feelings about slavery, {{he was one of the}} founders of the American Colonization Society in 1816, to send free blacks to a colony in Africa. However, he also believed that slavery was a necessity in Virginia, saying, [...] "The question of slavery, as it is called, is to us a question of life and death ...You will find no instance in history where two distinct races have occupied the soil except in the relation of master and slave." [...] In addition, Randolph remained dependent on hundreds of slaves to work his tobacco plantation. But, he provided for their manumission and resettlement in the free state of Ohio in his will, providing monies for the purchase of land and supplies. They founded Rossville, now part of Piqua, Ohio.|$|R
40|$|Leader-member {{exchange}} (LMX) is {{a theory}} of leadership that specifically focuses {{on the quality of}} the relationship between a manager and his/her subordinates. Previous research has shown the link between LMX quality and employee attitudes and behaviours at work. However, to the authors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, research is yet to specifically investigate the link between LMX quality and employee emotions. Also little understood are the social exchanges that lead to and maintain LMX quality ("currencies of exchange" in LMX theory). We introduce the notion of currency of exchange quality - whether the currency is present to a good enough extent or not (either in absence or excess) - and theoretically link this to employee emotions. A field study was designed and conducted to investigate the links. The study supported the propositions that high LMX relationships with good enough currency quality resulted in more positive employee emotions; low LMX with an absence of currency quality resulted in more negative emotions; and low LMX with an excess of currency quality resulted in mixed emotions. An unexpected finding was that high LMX was also associated with excess <b>currency</b> quality and <b>mixed</b> emotions.

40|$|At Bitcoin’s peak in November 2013, {{there were}} 93, 000 global {{transactions}} {{made in a}} single day. These users purchased everyday items such as personal services, food, and real estate. This alone suggests that Bitcoin is not primarily used as a long-term investment tool, but rather {{is used as a}} currency and a vehicle for global transactions. Congress and the IRS should regulate it accordingly. Representative Stockman’s Virtual Currency Reform Act offered an attempt to negate the IRS decision and officially classify Bitcoin and other virtual currencies as currency instead of property. A tax reclassification would alleviate typical users’ many inconveniences caused by burdensome accounting and tax reporting. A reclassification would also allow and encourage the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies because imposing a sales tax on transactions similar to everyday currencies is a small change that most users would not find prohibitive or restrictive. While it is evident {{that there needs to be}} some form of IRS taxation of virtual currencies, attempting to classify Bitcoin according to existing tax principles is challenging and ineffective. Although this is new technology and subsequently uncharted territory for many doctrines of law, the technology should be embraced and encouraged to prosper. For example, typical sales tax on transactions made on the internet are currently an unsolved dilemma. It gets even trickier trying to throw virtual <b>currencies</b> into the <b>mix.</b> Between complex tax law, jurisdictional issues, and the constant globalization of our economy, challenging legal questions will arise.
