Connections are established and conjectured between <b>compositions</b> constrained by Laplacian minors of leafed cycles of prime length and algebraic/combinatorial properties of reflexive simplices...|$|R

5|$|The Sun {{inherited}} its chemical <b>composition</b> {{from the}} interstellar medium out of which it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the heavier elements were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to {{the interstellar medium}} before {{the formation of the}} Sun. The chemical <b>composition</b> of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the <b>composition</b> of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's <b>composition</b> {{is believed to have been}} 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.|$|E
