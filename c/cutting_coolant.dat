This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to find the}} optimum hydraulic fluids and materials for combating cavitation erosion in hydraulic mining machinery operating,on 5 : 95 oil-in-water emulsions, Controlled cavitation was generated in the laboratory in a vibratory cavitation apparatus employing the stationery specimen system. The influence of separation distance between the drill tip and specimen and of varying medium temperature on cavitation erosion were also investigated but were of secondary importance to the studies on materials and emulsions, The evaluation {{of the influence of}} a number of commercial metal <b>cutting</b> <b>coolants</b> and specific hydraulic emulsions oncavitation erosion,showed that those emulsions with a high mineral oil content suppress erosion the most, This phenomenon is considered to be either the result of a reduction in nucleation of highly damaging surface cavities due to the elimination of surface nuclei by an oil film, or to damping of cavity collapse due to the high dissolved gas content of oil-in-water emulsions, A large number of commercial grade alloys and polymers have been investigated, The alloys ranged from single phase, face centered cubic nickel alloys to complex, multi-phase, cobalt based alloys while the polymeric materials were all linear and crystalline. The modes of erosion and mechanisms of erosion resistance were studied in detail by optical microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The fractographic studies on the alloys revealed, in particular, the role played by second phase particles and other surface features such as protruding grain boundaries and surface steps created by dislocation movement, twinning and phase transformations, Furthermore, X-ray diffractometry coupled with theoretical considerations and the findings of previous investigations indicated the fundamental importance of phase transitions in contributing towards the erosion resistance of alloys, Cobalt based Stellite alloys, nickel based cemented carbides and the intermetallic alloy NiTi have exceptionally high erosion resistance, The Stellites have a high yield stress and also undergo an awe phase transition which results in a high work hardening rate and high strain to fracture, NiTi similarly undergoes a phase transformation which allows absorption of seven per cent reversible strain and also results in a high work hardening rate. The erosion resistance of nickel based tungsten carbides is, in turn, attributable to the very high yield stress of these materials, Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene and nylons have relatively high erosion resistances, Their exceptional performances are due to a high strain to fracture and high yield strength respectively. On the other hand low tensile strength polytetrafluoroethylene has a very poor resistance to erosion. This work has identified various material properties which are required for erosion resistance, These are : (a) a high yield stress, (b) a high work hardening rate and (c) a high strain to fracture...|$|R

40|$|In this master thesis, {{performed}} at AB Sandvik Coromant, wear and tool life of uncoated WC/Co grades {{have been investigated}} during longitudinal turning of the titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Due to titaniumâ€™s poor thermal conductivity and high chemical reactivity towards most metals, high temperature is achieved between the tool and workpiece material, resulting in high tool wear rates. The high temperature initiates crater wear, which rapidly degrades the tool and shortens the tool life. It was found in this work that new WC/Co tools can perform better in this application area than todayâ€™s used grade for turning titanium alloys, H 13 A. An increase in tool life by 45 % respectively 50 % was obtained compared to the reference grade H 13 A at cutting speeds of 70 and 115 m/min. It was also shown that increase of coolant pressure did not enhance the tool life, while usage of a high pressure tool holder instead of a conventional tool holder gave an improved tool life.

40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of workpiece preheating with high frequency induction heating on improvement of machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V during end milling using PVD TiAlN coated inserts. Tool life, cutting force and vibration were investigated during the experiments. Design/methodology/approach: End milling tests were conducted on Vertical Machining Centre (VMC ZPS, Model: MCFV 1060 with quarter immersion cutting. Titanium based alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V bar was used as the work-piece. Machining was performed with a 20 mm diameter end-mill tool holder (R 390 - 020 B 20 - 11 M) fitted with one insert. PVD TiAlN coated carbide inserts (R 390 - 11 T 3 08 E-ML 2030) were used in the experiments. All of the experiments were run at room temperature and preheated conditions. The preheated temperature was maintained at 420 ÂºC and no phase change of the workpiece in preheating was ensured from the phase diagram of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. High frequency induction heating was utilized to run the preheated machining. Findings: Preheating helps in substantially increasing tool life and in lowering down the cutting force value, lowering the amplitude of vibration and dynamic forces. Practical implications: The cost of machining Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is extremely high because of the relatively low machining speed and short tool life. Therefore, improving the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is a research topic of much interest, with a number of approaches reported with varied results, such as, cryogenic <b>cutting,</b> high-pressure <b>coolant,</b> rotary-tool, and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL). Originality/value: A new approach of induction preheating to overcome the difficulties in machining of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is presented in this paper.
