25|$|The {{manipulation}} of the gut microbiota is complex and may cause bacteria-host interactions. Although probiotics are considered safe, when they are used by oral administration {{there is a risk}} of passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs (bacterial translocation) and subsequent bacteremia, which can cause adverse health consequences. Some people, such as those with immune compromise, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, <b>cardiac</b> <b>valve</b> disease and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events.|$|E
25|$|An {{echocardiogram}} can, {{within certain}} limits, produce an accurate {{assessment of the}} direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valve</b> areas and function, abnormal communications between {{the left and right}} side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the cardiac output. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.|$|E

25|$|The {{manipulation}} of the gut microbiota is complex and may cause bacteria-host interactions.

Some people, such as those with immunodeficiency, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, <b>cardiac</b> <b>valve</b> disease and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events. In severely ill people with inflammatory bowel disease there is a risk of the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs (bacterial translocation) as a consequence of bacteremia, which can cause adverse health consequences. Rarely, consumption of probiotics by children with lowered immune system function or who are already critically ill may result in bacteremia or fungemia (i.e., bacteria or fungi in the blood), which can lead to sepsis, a potentially fatal disease.|$|E

2500|$|Anne-Marie, Lady Byrne is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the BBC medical drama Holby City, portrayed by actress Jane Asher. The character first appeared on 10 May 2007 in episode [...] "After the Fall" [...] - series 9, episode 30 of the programme. After several guest appearances {{as the mother of}} established character Joseph Byrne throughout series 9 and 10, Asher signed a three-month contract to become a series regular from May 2008 onwards, for a period of 10 episodes. [...] Her initial storyline saw her son's girlfriend, Jac Naylor, embark on an affair with Anne-Marie's husband and Joseph's father, Lord Byrne - eventually culminating in his death, and leaving the character a widow. Upon her return to the programme, she takes over Lord Byrne's position as Executive Chairman of the Byrne Foundation - a charity committed to research into <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Valve</b> Disease.|$|E
40|$|Hemolytic anemia is a {{relatively}} common complication after the replacement of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves</b> with mechanical prostheses; the prevalence rate varies from 38 % to 85 %, depending on the prosthesis implanted. However, <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves</b> fabricated from biologic material {{are associated with a}} reduced incidence of hemolytic anemia, and to the authors' knowledge this report is the first to document hemolytic anemia in a patient who had the mitral valve replaced with an Ionescu-Shiley valve.

40|$|CLINICAL/METHODICAL ISSUE: Cardiac {{computed}} tomography (CT) is the first-line modality for coronary assessment. In addition valvular morphology and function can be evaluated. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: The method {{of choice for}} the evaluation of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves</b> is echocardiography, followed by magnetic resonance imaging. METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: Recent technical improvements and advances in temporal resolution allow a detailed anatomical and functional evaluation of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves.</b> PERFORMANCE: <b>Cardiac</b> CT provides an excellent image quality of the aortic and mitral valve thus enabling an evaluation of the morphology. In addition, cardiac CT allows an assessment of aortic valve function with respect to the grading of stenosis and regurgitation. ACHIEVEMENTS: Cardiac CT is not considered the first-line modality {{for the evaluation of}} cardiac valves; however, beyond coronary assessment CT provides important information on the morphology and function of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves.</b> PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: <b>Cardiac</b> CT can be a useful imaging alternative for patients in whom other more commonly used methods, such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging fail to provide the necessary information...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} compositional {{changes of}} the <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves</b> with develop-ment, the authors investigated changes of elements in the four <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves</b> of pig with development and the relationships among elements. The four <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves</b> of the aortic, pulmonary, mitral and tricuspid valves {{as well as the}} left and right coronary arteries were resected from 16 pigs, ranging in age from 2 mo to 5 mo. The element content was determined by inductively-coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). It was found that Ca, P, Zn and Fe decreased significantly with development in both the aortic and pulmonary valves, with one exception, but Ca, P, Zn and Fe did not decrease significantly with development in the mitral and tricuspid valves, except for Ca in the mitral valve. In both the left and right coronary arteries, Ca, P, Zn and Fe decreased significantly with development. Regarding the relationships among elements, significant direct correla-tions were found among Ca, P, S, Mg and Zn in both the aortic and pulmonar...|$|R
2500|$|Chronic rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) is {{characterized}} by repeated inflammation with fibrinous repair. [...] The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion, and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. It is caused by an autoimmune reaction to Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) that results in valvular damage. Fibrosis and scarring of valve leaflets, commissures and cusps leads to abnormalities that can result in valve stenosis or regurgitation. The inflammation caused by rheumatic fever, usually during childhood, {{is referred to as}} rheumatic valvulitis. About half of patients with rheumatic fever develop inflammation involving valvular endothelium. The majority of morbidity and mortality associated with rheumatic fever is caused by its destructive effects on <b>cardiac</b> <b>valve</b> tissue. The pathogenesis of RHD is complex and not fully understood, but it is known to involve molecular mimicry and genetic predisposition that lead to autoimmune reactions.|$|E

40|$|The color Doppler {{twinkling}} artifact manifests as {{a rapidly}} changing mixture of red and blue colors behind strongly reflective structures. The twinkling artifact occurs behind diseased <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves,</b> although the phenomenon is not well described. This study sought to determine {{the presence of the}} color Doppler twinkling artifact in calcified <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves</b> in vitro using soft tissue radiography for reference. Seventeen specimens of diseased <b>cardiac</b> <b>valves</b> from patients undergoing valve replacement surgery were studied. The overall sensitivity and specificity for the detection of calcifications using the presence of the twinkling artifact were 66. 7 % and 81. 8 %, respectively. If valves with only microcalcifications or smooth calcifications were eliminated from the analysis, all (100 %) of the three valves with irregular macrocalcifications exhibited the twinkling artifact. It is important to recognize this artifact because it may lead to misdiagnosis of vascular flow in echocardiography.
