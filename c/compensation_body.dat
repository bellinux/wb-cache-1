Ash appeared on the British Soap Awards in May 2006, walking unaided, but still clearly impaired two years after her illness. In January 2007 Ash confirmed she was suing the hospital. Papers lodged at the High Court asserted that Ash would never return to active TV roles. The hospital admitted breach of duty over part of her treatment but denied responsibility for the extent of her injuries and in January 2008 paid out a record £5m compensation payout in an out-of-court settlement. Steve Walker, chief executive of the NHS Litigation Authority, said the payout set a new record for compensation following a hospital-acquired infection. The previous highest amount was £500,000. The high amount was justified by the NHS <b>compensation</b> <b>body</b> as being [...] "because of the amount Leslie was earning at the time she fell ill and takes into account how much she might have earned in the future". Ash now calls for cleaner hospitals {{as a result of her}} experiences and regularly addresses audiences of healthcare officials on the subject.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{operational}} {{area of the}} robots started to extend and new functionalities are planned for them in our daily environments. As the human-robot interaction is being improved, the robots can provide support in elderly care, human assistance, rescue, hospital attendance and many other areas. With this motivation, an intensive research is focused around humanoid robotics {{in the last four}} decades. However, due to the nonlinear dynamics of the robot and high number of degrees of freedom, the robust balance of the bipedal walk is a challenging task. Smooth trajectory generation and online compensation methods are necessary to achieve a stable walk. In this thesis, Cartesian foot position references are generated as periodic functions with respect to a body-fixed coordinate frame. The online adjustment of these parameterized trajectories provides an opportunity in tuning the walking parameters without stopping the robot. The major contribution of this thesis in the context of trajectory generation is the smoothening of the foot trajectories and the introduction of ground push motion in the vertical direction. This pushing motion provided a dramatic improvement in the stability of the walking. Even though smooth foot reference trajectories are generated using the parameter based functions, the realization of a dynamically stable walk and maintenance of the robot balance requires walking control algorithms. This thesis introduces various control techniques to cope with disturbances or unevenness of the walking environment and compensate the mismatches between the planned and the actual walking based on sensory feedback. Moreover, an automatic homing procedure is proposed for the adjustment of the initial posture before the walking experiments. The presented control algorithms include ZMP regulation, foot orientation control, trunk orientation control, foot pitch torque difference <b>compensation,</b> <b>body</b> pitch angle correction, ground impact compensation and early landing modification. The effectiveness of the proposed trajectory generation and walking control algorithms is tested on the humanoid robot SURALP and a stable walk is achieved...|$|E

SVV and OCR were measured simultaneously in various whole-body roll positions [upright, 45 degrees right-ear down (RED), and 75 degrees RED] in six subjects. Gains of OCR were - 0. 18 (45 degrees RED) and - 0. 12 (75 degrees RED), whereas gains of <b>compensation</b> for <b>body</b> roll in the SVV task were - 1. 11 (45 degrees RED) and - 0. 96 (75 degrees RED).

Moreover, a significant correlation (R (2) = 0. 80, slope = 0. 29) between SVV and OCR variabilities was found. Whereas the gain of OCR is different from the gain of SVV, trial-to-trial variability of OCR follows the same roll-dependent modulation observed in SVV variability. We propose that the similarities in variability reflect a common otolith input, which, however, is subject to distinct central processing for determining the gain of SVV and OCR...|$|R

Brain [14 C] 2 -deoxyglucose (2 DG) uptake was measured autoradiographically 3. 5 h to 20 days later and compared to sham-operated controls. In the vestibular nuclei (nn.) of labyrinthectomized subjects, large left-right differences of 2 DG uptake occurred, which decreased over time. The equalization of vestibular nuclear 2 DG uptake paralleled behavioral <b>compensation</b> of <b>body,</b> neck and head postural abnormalities, and known equalization of vestibular nuclear cell firing rates during compensation. There was a small difference of 2 DG uptake in medial and lateral vestibular nn. 20 days after lesions when animals had a residual head tilt and tonic eye deviation. In the oculomotor nn., trochlear nn. and interstitial n. of Cajal, large left-right differences of 2 DG uptake occurred, which did not change over time. The higher 2 DG uptake in these nn. occurred ipsilateral to the labyrinthine lesion and did not correlate with the onset and cessation of nystagmus. The persistent asymmetry did appear to correlate with ipsilateral downward and contralateral upward eye deviation which continued for long periods after the lesion.

40|$|Compensatory growth where animals {{compensate}} for time stress or transient nutritional or thermal stress by accelerating their growth rate is widespread. We know, however, relatively {{little about the}} evolution and ecological correlates of compensatory growth. For this we need studies on congeneric species with known phylogenetic relationships that also focus on the associated largely understudied costs. Here we tested for compensatory growth and associated costs in response to time stress (manipulated by photoperiod) and a transient period of starvation or cooling in larvae of the permanent-pond damselfly Lestes eurinus, and compare the results with former studies on temporary-pond Lestes. Larvae showed full <b>compensation</b> in <b>body</b> mass at emergence for all combinations of time stress and starvation or cooling. Unexpectedly, compensatory growth to starvation or cooling was not stronger under time stress. Instead, males under time stress delayed emergence after these transient stressors. In line with a stronger compensatory growth response to time stress than to the other stressors, physiological costs {{in terms of a}} reduced investment in immune response (measured as phenoloxidase activity) and energy storage (measured as fat content) were detected only under time stress. Compared to temporary-pond Lestes, L. eurinus showed stronger compensatory growth to time stress.

40|$|International audienceRecent studies report {{efficient}} vestibular {{control of}} goal-directed arm movements during body motion. This contribution tested whether this control relies (a) on an updating {{process in which}} vestibular signals are used to update the perceived egocentric position of surrounding objects when body orientation changes, or (b) on a sensorimotor process, i. e. a transfer function between vestibular input and the arm motor output that preserves hand trajectory in space despite body rotation. Both processes were separately and specifically adapted. We then compared the respective influences of the adapted processes on the vestibular control of arm-reaching movements. The rationale was that if a given process underlies a given behavior, any adaptive modification of this process should give rise to observable modification of the behavior. The updating adaptation adapted the matching between vestibular input and perceived body displacement in the surrounding world. The sensorimotor adaptation adapted the matching between vestibular input and the arm motor output necessary to keep the hand fixed in space during body rotation. Only the sensorimotor adaptation significantly altered the vestibular control of arm-reaching movements. Our results therefore suggest that during passive self-motion, the vestibular control of arm-reaching movements essentially derives from a sensorimotor process by which arm motor output is modified on-line to preserve hand trajectory in space despite body displacement. In contrast, the updating process maintaining up-to-date the egocentric representation of visual space seems to contribute little to generating the required arm <b>compensation</b> during <b>body</b> rotations...|$|R
40|$|Alkaline {{phosphatase}} (AP) is {{a potential}} biomarker for phosphorus (P) limitation in zooplankton. However, knowledge about regulation of AP in this group is limited. In a laboratory acclimation experiment, we investigated changes in body AP concentration for Daphnia magna kept for 6  days at 10, 15, 20 and 25 °C and fed algae with 10 different molar C:P ratios (95 – 660). In the same experiment, we also assessed somatic growth of the animals since phosphorus acquisition is linked to growth processes. Overall, non-linear but significant relationships of AP activity with C:P ratio were observed, {{but there was a}} stronger impact of temperature on AP activity than of P limitation. Animals from the lowest temperature treatment had higher normalized AP activity, which suggests the operation of biochemical temperature <b>compensation</b> mechanisms. <b>Body</b> AP activity increased by a factor of 1. 67 for every 10 °C decrease in temperature. These results demonstrate that temperature strongly influences AP expression. Therefore, using AP as a P limitation marker in zooplankton needs to consider possible confounding effects of temperature. Both temperature and diet affected somatic growth. The temperature effect on somatic growth, expressed as the Q 10 value, responded non-linearly with C:P, with Q 10 ranging between 1. 9 for lowest food C:P ratio and 1. 4 for the most P-deficient food.

40|$|The {{first year}} of life {{is one of the main}} {{survival}} bottlenecks for many fish species. Individual traits affecting survival can be morphological, physiological or behavioural. Body size, growth rate and activity have all been found to affect fitness in different organisms. However, the effects of these traits on fitness in natural conditions and for underyearlings are poorly investigated. In this study we attempted to induce compensatory growth in laboratory conditions in natural populations of brown trout fry (Salmo trutta). It was performed by exposing the fry to a period of restricted resources followed by a period of refeeding. Two behavioural trials were conducted on each individual where activity level was scored. All fish were subsequently released in their native stream and recaptured after a month to check for survival. We found that high individual activity level in an open field context increased the probability of survival under natural conditions. The importance of body size for survival decreased over time, and thus, with fish size. Full compensation was detected in body condition, while only partly compensation in weight and no compensation in length were detected during the experimental periods. Our results suggest that a brown trout fry’s individual activity level is repeatable and can be an important trait for selection in nature. The instable interactions between activity and life-history traits indicate environmental effects on these interactions. Furthermore, if body size is not the only trait affecting survival, <b>compensation</b> in <b>body</b> structures may not be a fast response to increase fitness after a period of growth depression...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: It is {{estimated}} that up to 80 % {{of the general population}} will experience at least one significant bout of low back pain in their lifetime. The leading known cause of low back pain is degenerative disc disease (DDD). Many established risk factors for low back pain and DDD are mechanical in nature and are often related to occupational activities, such as poor posture and frequent/heavy lifting. Altered mechanical loading in the spine {{has been shown to be}} a potential stimulus for disc degeneration. However, a link between occupational/environmental factors and intervertebral loading has never been demonstrated in vivo. We hypothesize that intervertebral loading is highly dependent on muscle activation and recruitment. These relationships are significant because they provide a potential connection between everyday activities and low back pain.

40|$|Using {{vestibular}} {{sensors to}} maintain visual stability during changes in head tilt, crucial when panoramic cues are not available, presents a computational challenge. Reliance on the otoliths requires a neural strategy for resolving their tilt/translation ambiguity, such as canal-otolith interaction or frequency segregation. The canal signal {{is subject to}} bandwidth limitations. In this study, we assessed the relative contribution of canal and otolith signals and investigated how they might be processed and combined. The experimental approach was to explore conditions with and without otolith contributions in a frequency range with various degrees of canal activation. We tested the perceptual stability of visual line orientation in six human subjects during passive sinusoidal roll tilt in the dark at frequencies from 0. 05 to 0. 4 Hz (30 degrees peak to peak). Because subjects were constantly monitoring spatial motion of a visual line in the frontal plane, the paradigm required moment-to-moment updating for ongoing ego motion. Their task was to judge the total spatial sway of the line when it rotated sinusoidally at various amplitudes. From the responses we determined how the line had to be rotated {{to be perceived as}} stable in space. Tests were taken both with (subject upright) and without (subject supine) gravity cues. Analysis of these data showed that the <b>compensation</b> for <b>body</b> rotation in the computation of line orientation in space, although always incomplete, depended on vestibular rotation frequency and on the availability of gravity cues. In the supine condition, the compensation for ego motion showed a steep increase with frequency, compatible with an integrated canal signal. The improvement of performance in the upright condition, afforded by graviceptive cues from the otoliths, showed low-pass characteristics. Simulations showed that a linear combination of an integrated canal signal and a gravity-based signal can account for these results...|$|R

RESULTS: Infusion of 30 mL/kg isotonic saline over 25 minutes increased supine TFT from a basal capillary reabsorption of - 106 +/- 24 mL/h (mean+/-SE) to a net filtration of 1, 229 +/- 124 mL/h. One hour after infusion, reabsorption of - 236 +/- 102 mL/h was seen, and control reabsorption levels returned by 3 hours.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note documents {{a method that}} the authors developed for combining a signal to synchronize a patient-monitoring device with a second physiological signal for inclusion into list-mode acquisition. Our specific application requires synchronizing an external patient motion-tracking system with a medical imaging system by multiplexing the tracking input with the ECG input. The authors believe that their methodology can be adapted {{for use in a}} variety of medical imaging modalities including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: The authors insert a unique pulse sequence into a single physiological input channel. This sequence is then recorded in the list-mode acquisition along with the R-wave pulse used for ECG gating. The specific form of our pulse sequence allows for recognition of the time point being synchronized even when portions of the pulse sequence are lost due to collisions with R-wave pulses. This was achieved by altering our software used in binning the list-mode data to recognize even a portion of our pulse sequence. Limitations on heart rates at which our pulse sequence could be reliably detected were investigated by simulating the mixing of the two signals as a function of heart rate and time point during the cardiac cycle at which our pulse sequence is mixed with the cardiac signal. RESULTS: The authors have successfully achieved accurate temporal synchronization of our motion-tracking system with acquisition of SPECT projections used in 17 recent clinical research cases. In our simulation analysis the authors determined that synchronization to enable <b>compensation</b> for <b>body</b> and respiratory motion could be achieved for heart rates up to 125 beats-per-minute (bpm).

Gaze stabilisation serves a number of functions, which include: i) simplifying the estimation of translational self-motion, ii) aligning the head-based sensory systems with the inertial vector which facilitates the transformation of sensory signals into motor commands, iii) supporting the tracking of moving targets, and iv) reducing motion blur in the visual input. This thesis reports studies on species-specific adaptations and general principles underlying multisensory gaze stabilisation {{in a number of different}} Dipteran flies. A variety of stimulation methods were explored, along with their suitability for a linear systems analysis of the gaze stabilisation system across species. Using results obtained from the well-characterised blowfly for comparison, novel experimental work was performed on the gaze stabilisation behaviour of robberflies, hoverflies and horseflies. Species from each family were shown to stabilise their heads in <b>compensation</b> for <b>body</b> rotations around the roll axis. The performance of the reflex was found to be species-specific and dependent on the sensory modalities involved. Experimental evidence suggests that in contrast to the other families, hoverflies appear to make use of the inertia of the head to maintain a level gaze, a novel finding that has previously been reported only for dragonflies. Finally, the integration of signals in the context of gaze stabilisation obtained by the two visual systems in blowflies - the ocelli and compound eyes - were explored in both behavioural and electrophysiological experiments. This research opens new lines of investigation by identifying behaviours that demonstrate different control strategies employed by the nervous systems of flying insects. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Electromyogram (e. m. g.) {{responses}} of lower leg muscles, and corresponding movements were studied following a perturbation of the limb during walking, produced by either (a) a randomly timed, short acceleration or decelerating impulse {{applied to the}} treadmill, or (b) a unilateral triceps surae contraction induced by tibial nerve stimulation. Bilateral e. m. g. responses following the perturbation were specific for the mode of perturbation and depended on the phase of the gait cycle in which the perturbation occurred. Treadmill deceleration evoked a bilateral tibialis anterior activation; acceleration evoked an ipsilateral gastrocnemius and contralateral tibialis anterior activation (latency in either condition and on both sides was 65 - 75 ms, duration about 150 ms). Tibial nerve stimulation {{at the beginning of}} a stance phase, was followed by an ipsilateral tibialis anterior activation; during the swing phase it was followed by an ipsilateral tibialis anterior and contralateral gastrocnemius activation (latency about 90 ms, duration about 100 ms). These patterns differed from the response seen after a unilateral displacement during static standing, which evoked a bilateral tibialis anterior activation. These early responses were in most cases followed by late ipsilateral responses, but the e. m. g. pattern of the next step cycle was usually unchanged, or affected only at its onset. The e. m. g. responses were unaltered by ischaemic nerve blockade of group I afferents, by training effects or by pre-warning of the onset of perturbation (randomly or self-induced). Despite the different e. m. g. responses following a perturbation during gait, the same basic functional mechanism was obviously at work: the early ipsilateral response achieved a repositioning of the displaced foot and leg, while the early contralateral and late ipsilateral responses provided <b>compensation</b> for <b>body</b> displacement. It is suggested that the e. m. g. responses may be mediated predominantly by peripheral information from group II and group III afferents, which modulate the basic motor pattern of spinal interneuronal circuits underlying the respective motor task...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Squash is a {{relatively}} new field in the Polish sports market. Its specification is based primarily on dynamic movements, often taking place {{at the end of its}} scope. This condition is an increased risk of injury as well as numerous <b>compensations</b> throughout the <b>body.</b> Aim: The aim of the study was to examine the impact of squash training on shoulder mobility of active athletes and to identify factors likely to increase trauma among players. Does squash game cause hypermobility in all dimension? Do long-term breaks in squash training increase the frequency of injuries? Does pre-training warm up affect trauma? Material and method: The study consists 110 active players: 19 women (17 %) and 91 men (83 %) age between 17 and 50 years. The research tool was an author’s questionnaire consisting of metrics and closed questions, which examined the problem and testing the mobility of the shoulder girdle using an inclinometer and functional tests. Descriptive statistics were made. The greatest limitation of the range of motion in the shoulder joint is observed in the sagittal plane - flexion. No injury was associated with a prolonged break from training. Conclusion: Squash players did not have hypomobility in the shoulder joint and even had a limited range of motion. Long-term breaks in squash training do not increase the level of trauma...|$|R
40|$|In this research, an {{adaptive}} methodology for monitoring and controlling {{the accuracy of}} CNC machine tools in material removal and on-machine inspection was developed. A reference part based error modeling technique, robust search algorithms, and {{an adaptive}} thermal effect tracking method were proposed to extend the capability of a machine tool to sense and compensate for errors during a sequence of operations. The reference part based error modeling technique involves mathematical models and measurements closely related to real parts and therefore reduces the uncertainty in error estimation and <b>compensation.</b> Rigid <b>body</b> kinematics was used to derive the error models that correlate the resultant errors in the machine tool workspace to the imperfection and misalignment of position elements and workpieces. The derived error models are capable of decoupling the machine tool 2 ̆ 7 s position errors and workpiece misalignment. ^ To improve the robustness and effectiveness of the derived error models, robust search algorithms were developed to identify the appropriate measuring points, {{with respect to the}} designated tolerance, for arbitrary shapes of reference parts. The identified measurement points were least sensitive to measurement uncertainty and variation in load induced errors. The search algorithms utilize computer simulation with limited information abstracted from previous measurements. Thus, the measurement effort involved in error modeling has been significantly reduced. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the algorithms with desired accuracy. ^ An adaptive algorithm was developed to cope with the time-varying thermal effect on position accuracy of machine tools. A state observer was constructed to track and predict the thermal induced errors and continuously modify the coefficients of the error model. The state observer uses the information derived from a partial recalibration process as feedback {{to keep track of the}} machine tool error migration without interfering with the existing fixtures and parts. A full scale recalibration process can be conducted, after a part is finished, to fine tune the state estimation. As the error model coefficients are determined, the model can be used to correct the on-machine probing data or to generate the compensation signal for precision machining. Therefore, an adaptive environment was provided for error monitoring and controlling for precision machining and on-machine inspection. ...|$|R
40|$|Laser range {{scanners}} provide {{rapid and}} accurate non-contact methods for acquiring three-dimensional surface data, offering many advantages over other techniques currently available during surgery. The range scanner {{was incorporated into}} our image-guided surgery system to augment registration and deformation <b>compensation.</b> A rigid <b>body,</b> embedded with infrared diodes, {{was attached to the}} scanner for tracking in physical space with an optical localization system. The relationship between the scanner’s coordinate system and the tracked rigid body was determined using a calibration phantom. Tracking of the scanner using the calibration phantom resulted in an error of 1. 4 ± 0. 8 mm (n= 234). Once tracked, data acquired intraoperatively from the range scanner data is registered with preoperative tomographic volumes using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Sensitivity studies were performed to ensure that this algorithm effectively reached a global minimum. In cases where tissue deformation is significant, rigid registrations can lead to inaccuracy during surgical navigation. Methods of non-rigid compensation may be necessary, and an initial study using a linearly elastic finite element model is presented. Differences between intraoperative and preoperative surfaces after rigid registration are used to formulate boundary conditions, and the resulting displacement field deforms the preoperative image volume. To test this protocol, a phantom was built, consisting of fiducial points and a silicone liver model. Range scan and CT data were captured both before and after deforming the organ. The pre-deformed images...|$|R
