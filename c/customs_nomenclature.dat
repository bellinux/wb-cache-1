Within this context, the League organized a large conference in Brussels in September - October 1920. The goal was to find a solution to monetary problems and facilitate the circulation of goods and funds.Following the conference the League established an Economic and Financial Organisation, including several Committees (Financial, Economic, Fiscal, Statistical).During the following years the League assisted many European countries: Austria, Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria, etc.The Fiscal Committee discussed several general issues related to double taxation and tax evasion.The works of the Economic Committee comprised the treatment of foreign nationals and enterprises, abolition of the prohibition and restrictions on imports and exports, unification of <b>customs</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> bill of exchange, unification of statistical methods, trade policy, veterinary medicines, international industrial agreements, problems of coal, sugar problems, issue of smuggling in general and alcohol, in particular, and indirect protectionism.In October 1929 the Great Depression started in the USA and soon contaminated Europe. In 1933, the LON organized a new Economic Conference in London to find a common solution to the protection of national economies.The conflict between the international political goals of the major powers and their views on economic welfare prevented from any concerted solution.|$|E
40|$|The Nomenclature that {{is governed}} by the Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System Convention, Brussels, 14 June 1983) has {{resulted}} in an adjustment of many nomenclatures used worldwide for statistical and customs classifi cation because nomenclatures {{that are based on}} the HS nomenclature are accepted in more than 200 countries and economic regions 2 ̆ 013 more than 98 percent of world trade is classified according to the HS nomenclature. However, only the first six digits are uniform (HS- 6), and further subdivisions are allowed if the structure of the HS nomenclature is not altered. Basically, most customs tariffs worldwide are uniform and the statistical data are comparable, which is important for economic research and comparability of economic data. However, the European Community (EC) applys a Common Customs Tariff (CCT) that is not uniform, because the EC combined statistical and <b>customs</b> <b>nomenclature</b> (so called Combined Nomenclature 2 ̆ 013 CN) allows a further subdivision of the Integrated Customs Tariff (TARIC, HS- 6 + 4) by an 11 th digit if there is a national purpose in one of the EC Member States.

An alternative approach, based on Software as a Service, was later suggested by Carvalho and Johansson and implemented by SlapOS (previously TioLive LLC) which now provides ERP5 SaaS. Based on a small list of questions, which any CEO of a company can answer to {{in less than an}} hour, a standard ERP5 configuration is generated with preset business processes and <b>custom</b> <b>nomenclatures</b> (so-called categories in ERP5 terminology). This approach is now being automated with data mining and artificial intelligence tools.|$|R

The higher the DE value, the shorter the glucose chains, the higher the sweetness, the higher the solubility, and the lower heat resistance. Above DE 20, the European Union's CN code calls it glucose syrup; at DE 10 or lower the <b>customs</b> CN code <b>nomenclature</b> classifies maltodextrins as dextrins.|$|R

By implementation the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) duties of Romania have seen {{a change in the}} value but at the same time, a change in the tariff regime applied on trading partners. Therefore, the utilization of the EU Common Customs Tariff is a very important opening of the Romanian market which will stimulate demand for imports.

40|$|Estimating {{the size}} of the problem with release, fate, {{exposure}} and effects from the human use of chemical substances of materials and consumer products is daunting More than 100, 000 chemical substances are in commercial use and a reasonable description of their existence in, and release from, plastic polymers, glues, paints, fibres, lubricants etc. comprise a big challenge. In this study, a generic emission model has been developed and applied to estimate emissions of a set of organic chemicals from products. The scope of the estimate is emissions from products containing plastic materials during their average lifetime within the geographical boundaries of Sweden. The <b>customs</b> Combined <b>Nomenclature</b> has been used to divide the products into categories for which the chemical composition, surface area, thickness and accumulated stock in society has been described and estimated using several approaches for approximation in cases where data have been lacking. For this, information from national trade statistics as well as lifecycle assessments and building product declarations was used Anti-oxidants, flame retardants and plasticisers are among the most interesting use categories of additives that are emitted in significant quantities. Thus for anti-oxidants in plastic material in the economy-wide product stock in Sweden as an example, the emissions in the service-life were estimated to be almost 500 tons/year divided on 32 individual chemical organic substances, stemming from a stock of anti-oxidants of 84000 tons, contained in a stock of plastic material of 24 million tons. Until now, the method has only been used to estimate emissions of additives from plastic materials, but it is believed to also be applicable to other materials. However, the uncertainties in the estimations are currently large, which is partly due to model uncertainties but to a large extent also due to uncertainties in the input data...|$|R
40|$|Erwin F. Smith in {{the chapter}} on " Nomenclature and Classifi-cation " in {{the first volume of}} his work on Bacteria in Relation to Plant Diseases (1905), accepts as valid 33 {{different}} names of bacterial genera. In addition he presents a list of 156 generic names which he regards as definitely invalid or inappropriate and to be rejected. In the preparation of material for a course in systematic bacteriology given at Iowa State College for sev-eral years, I have had occasion to use this list, and have added to it. It appears that about 300 generic and pseudogeneric names have been used by bacteriologists. In addition, about 100 names have been used for orders, classes, families, sub-families, tribes, and subtribes. The problem as to which of these names are to be regarded as valid, and which invalid, has been increasingly emphasized as one of considerable importance, and intimately associated with the development of a satisfactory classification of the bacteria. To state that the classification of bacteria is in a chaotic condition is to express a truism. That {{this is due to the}} inherent difficulties in determining bacterial relationships, and to the utter disregard of all rules of nomenclature is likewise generally accepted. Is there any need of action? Of recent years some bacteriologists have apparently taken delight in ignoring the well established <b>customs</b> of biological <b>nomenclature,</b> and in creating special rules to fit occasions.
