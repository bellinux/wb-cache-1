Increased temperature and decreased precipitation are associated with SWE loss in northern California. Trends in SWE can partially be attributed to shifts in Pacific Ocean climate indices. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an expository study of temporal data mining for prediction {{of a future}} response sequence via mining large number of highly correlated <b>concurrent</b> <b>time</b> series. In the study, we investigate a two dimensional search scheme over time domain weighting and feature space selection. The weighting of observation records over time domain is used to exploit the time dependency structure and feature space selection is enforced to avoid the over-fitting issue. For a specific temporal and spatial selection, its area under ROC curve (AUC) is {{used to evaluate the}} prediction performance over the training and testing data. By varying the weighting scheme and feature selection, AUC contour maps on both training and testing data are generated. The contour maps can suggest us to apply the optimal allocations with highest AUC for future responses prediction in training, testing, and possible validation data. Numerical results over two sets of temporal data with different applications have shown that the proposed scheme can improve the prediction performance of conventional data mining methods significantly.

On the other hand, by decreasing the transmission rate, a higher number of transmitters can jointly satisfy the SINR criterion. Thus, {{it is not clear whether}} allowing more <b>concurrent</b> transmissions (less <b>time</b> sharing) at lower rates is preferable to allowing fewer <b>concurrent</b> transmissions (more <b>time</b> sharing) at higher rates.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} realizability of schedules by stochastic <b>concurrent</b> <b>timed</b> systems. Schedules {{are high}} level views of desired executions represented as partial orders decorated with timing constraints, while systems are represented as elementary stochastic time Petri nets. We first consider logical realizability: a schedule is realizable by a net N if it embeds {{in a time}} process of N that satisfies all its constraints. However, with continuous time domains, {{the probability of a}} time process that realizes a schedule is null. We hence consider probabilistic realizability up to α time units, that holds if the probability that N logically realizes S with constraints enlarged by α is strictly positive. Upon a sensible restriction guaranteeing time progress, logical and probabilistic realizability of a schedule can be checked on the finite set of symbolic prefixes extracted from a bounded unfolding of the net. We give a construction technique for these prefixes and show that they represent all time processes of a net occurring up to a given maximal date.

40|$|Abstract—In {{the process}} of testing of <b>concurrent</b> <b>timed</b> systems, input {{generation}} identifies values of temporal parameters that let the Implementation Under Test (IUT) execute selected cases. However, when some parameters are not under control of the driver, test execution may diverge from the selected input and produce an inconclusive behavior. We formulate the problem {{on the basis of}} an abstraction of the IUT which we call partially stochastic Time Petri Net (psTPN), where controllable parameters are modeled as nondeterministic values and noncontrollable parameters as random variables with general (GEN) distribution. With reference to this abstraction, we derive the analytical form of the probability that the IUT runs along a selected behavior as a function of choices taken on controllable parameters. In the applicative perspective of real-time testing, this identifies a theoretical upper limit on the probability of a conclusive result, thus providing a means to plan the number of test repetitions that are necessary to guarantee a given probability of test-case coverage. It also provides a constructive technique for an optimal or suboptimal approach to input generation and a way to characterize the probability of conclusive testing under other suboptimal strategies...|$|R
