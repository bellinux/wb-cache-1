40|$|This note (RE- 279) {{represents}} the Office of Evaluation and Oversight's preliminary {{review of the}} new performance-related allocation criteria used by the Bank. It is confined almost exclusively to a methodological review of the allocative criteria and to a comparative analysis of the approaches used elsewhere for the performance-based allocation of scarce resources. This report discusses the evolution of allocation criteria within the Bank's methodology for allocating <b>concessional</b> <b>resources.</b> The report also analyzes the distributional impact of the new performance-based methodology and compares the Bank's criteria with the most important alternative criteria used to allocate aid: those developed by the International Development Association (IDA), of the World Bank. In addition, a methodological discussion of the Bank's framework is presented along with conclusions and recommendations. ...|$|E
40|$|Scott 1 The {{definition}} of Official Development Assistance (ODA) has for 40 years been the global standard for measuring donor efforts in supporting development co-operation objectives. It {{has provided the}} yardstick for documenting the volume and {{the terms of the}} <b>concessional</b> <b>resources</b> provided, assessing donor performance against their aid pledges and enabling partner countries, civil society and others to hold donors to account. Yet for all its value, the ODA definition has always reflected a compromise between political expediency and statistical reality. It is based on interpretation and consensus and therefore allows for flexibility. It has evolved over the decades, while preserving the original concepts of a definition based on principal developmental motivation, official character and a degree of concessionality. While agreement on the ODA concept was a major achievement, discussion of the appropriateness of this measure has never ended. The paper documents the evolution of the ODA concept and proposes...|$|E
40|$|Microfinance collectively {{refers to}} the supply of loans, savings accounts, and other basic {{financial}} services like insurance, to the poor. About one billion people globally live in households with per capita incomes of one dollar per day (Morduch J. 1999). Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) are special financial institutions. They have both a social nature and a for-profit nature. Their performance has been traditionally measured by means of financial ratios. The objective of the study has been to estimate the efficiency of microfinance institutions in Pakistan. Non parametric Data Envelopment analysis {{has been used to}} analyze the efficiency of these institutions by using data for the year 2003 and 2007 respectively. Both input oriented and output oriented methods have been considered under the assumption of constant return to scale technologies and microfinance should provide services on sustainable basis. A microfinance institution is said to be financially sustainable if it without the use of subsidies, grants, or other <b>concessional</b> <b>resources,</b> it can profitably provide finance to micro enterprises on an acceptable scale. ...|$|E

The budget finished the year with a deficit of just 1 Â½ percent of GDP, compared with 10 percent in 2002. Real GDP grew by an estimated 5 percent in 2003, helped by strong fish, copra, and cocoa production.

40|$|Working paper series, African Development Bank Group, Working paper n° 103 The African Development Bank allocates its <b>concessional</b> <b>resources</b> {{through a}} {{procedure}} which is mainly {{based on the}} quality of the beneficiary countries' economic policy and governance. This allocation procedure relies mainly on the Performance-Based Allocation formula which can be criticized on two grounds. Firstly, the weight on economic policy and governance is viewed as being excessive. Secondly, it lacks transparency and consistency. We consider how to amend that formula so as to take into account certain common characteristics of many African countries. The main proposal is to augment the formula by an economic vulnerability criterion. The numerical simulations show that the introduction of the United Nations economic vulnerability index in the formula gives rise to allocations which not only account for post conflict situations but also inherent fragility. We also consider a lower population weight in order to address the problem of country size. This change helps avoid inconsistencies arising from the application of country allocation ceilings in the various stages of the computation. Finally, a few proposals concerning the African Development Fund's support to regional integration are explored...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Despite years of effort to provide debt relief to the world's poorest countries, these countries' debt problems still have not been resolved. In response to this situation, Congress introduced Senate Bill 2210, the Debt Relief Enhancement Act of 2002, to reduce these countries' debt service payments to manageable levels. The act proposes that no qualified country pay more than 10 percent of its revenue on external debt service or no more than 5 percent if the country suffers a public health crisis. GAO found that the act would immediately lower the debt service of countries that qualify for relief. It would cost $ 2. 7 billion for 26 countries over the next 3 years and {{have no effect on}} long-term debt sustainability. If applied over a 20 -year period, the act's provisions would address the long-term debt sustainability of these countries. However, the cost of the proposal would grow to between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion for those 26 countries. An alternative debt proposal, proposed by the Bush administration, is to convert up to 50 percent of future multilateral concessional loans to grants. This proposal does not address the short-term debt service obligations of these countries. However, it its sustainability improves their prospects of achieving long-term debt sustainability. The cost of implementing this proposal would be $ 9. 7 billion over 40 years and would lower the debt burdens of all 65 countries that are eligible to borrow only from the World Bank's <b>concessional</b> <b>resources.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Based on the Executive Board’s {{guidance}} {{during the}} first stage of the Review of Low Income Countries (LIC) Facilities, this paper suggests a number of refinements to the facilities and instruments that are consistent with the self-sustainability of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The proposals seek to improve the tailoring and flexibility of Fund support. Taken together with those advanced in the parallel paper on PRGT eligibility, they are projected to keep the average annual demand for PRGT resources within a range consistent with the Board’s approved strategy to make the PRGT self-sustaining over the period 2013 – 35. The proposals are as follows. Enhancement of the existing blending policy. Members that are currently presumed to blend would use a somewhat higher share of General Resources Account (GRA) resources, thereby releasing <b>concessional</b> <b>resources</b> for poorer members. Some changes are also proposed to the existing market access criteria for blending. On average the changes are projected to shift demand of some SDR 100 million per year from the PRGT to the GRA over the period 2013 – 35. Access Policy: a decision would be adopted now to halve access norms and limits in relation to quota when the quota increase under the Fourteenth General Review of Quotas comes into effect. The norms and limits were doubled in 2009 and appear broadly appropriate to meet LICs ’ needs. Staff’s proposal would imply unchanged access in SDR terms for most LICs after the new quotas come into effect. Within the self-sustained framework, even a modest nominal access increase now would compress significantly the size of access increases that the PRGT could accommodate in the future, meaning that access as a share of GDP would decline for future users. Modifications to enhance precautionary support and respond more quickly to additional financing needs: For Stand-by Credit Facility (SCF) arrangements treated as precautionary, easing time limitations on use, and allowing more frontloading of access, would make the instrument more helpful to members...|$|E
40|$|Ferdi, Working paper P 97, AprilIn 2006, at a {{time when}} growth had clearly resumed in Africa, the opening speech at the first African Economic Conference {{organized}} by the African Development Bank and AERC was entitled “Economic vulnerability, still a challenge for African growth” (Guillaumont 2007, 2008). Eight years on, including a global recession, food and fuel price spikes, and recent state crises in Africa—although in many countries growth has continued—vulnerability remains an issue to be addressed. Both cross-country econometrics and case studies have documented the impact of external, climatic, and political shocks on Africa’s growth, development, and poverty reduction (Ibid.; see also the chapter by Xubei Luo in this book). Although some progress has been recorded in addressing economic vulnerability in Africa, it remains limited; moreover, the scope of vulnerability itself has been changing with the emergence of new [...] social and environmental—dimensions. Addressing the vulnerability of African economies requires an identification of its sources and determinants, including a conceptual clarification in view of the broadening scope. Section (2) proposes a conceptual framework where structural vulnerability is distinguished from general vulnerability, from physical vulnerability to climate change, and from state fragility as well. Section (3) analyzes the main features and evolution of structural economic vulnerability in Africa on the basis of an economic vulnerability index, highlighting not only higher structural economic vulnerability, but also a slower decline than in other developing economies. It then appears (section 4) that African economic vulnerability is reinforced by higher physical vulnerability to climate change, as shown by a specific index, and that Africa is the continent with the highest proportion of fragile states, suggesting a link between the various forms of vulnerability in Africa. Finally (section 5), measuring the structural vulnerability of African countries provides a useful tool for the international allocation of resources and not just to guide policies aimed at structural transformation and sustainable development. Adequately measured, structural vulnerability, as it is exogenous to current policy, may be a relevant criterion for the international allocation of <b>concessional</b> <b>resources...</b>|$|E
