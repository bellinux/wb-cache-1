The church proper is a simple wood-framed gabled structure covered in asphalt shingles, with a chancel projecting from the back and a brick chimney applied to the south side. The facade features an open pediment in the gable {{and a pair of}} windows flanking the central entrance, with a wooden sign over the door; each side also has three tall, narrow double-hung windows, with a smaller window {{on either side of the}} chancel. The interior is fitted with box pews flanking a center aisle, and a pulpit and altar, also aligned with the center line of the building. The chancel opening has plain casing surmounted by a pediment; the back wall of the altar area is ornamented by <b>column</b> <b>casing</b> supporting a dentil architrave.|$|E

40|$|Steel <b>column</b> <b>casings</b> are {{the most}} common column {{retrofit}} method used in California. They are effective for enhancing shear capacity, confinement, and preventing slipping of lap splices commonly found at the base of columns constructed prior to 1971. Upon completion of the diagnostic analysis of the As-built structure as described in Memo to Designers (MTD) 20 - 4, the engineer must determine if <b>column</b> <b>casings</b> are required and the type to use. There are two types of casings, Type F and Type P/F. The Type F casing provides fixed end conditions, while the Type P/F casing provides a fixed condition {{at the top of the}} column and a pinned condition at the bottom. The pin for the Type P/F casing is detailed by placing polystyrene around the bottom of the column and allowing the lap splice to slip thus forming a pin. For both the Type F and P/F <b>column</b> <b>casings,</b> it is necessary to provide a minimum of 2 -inch clearance between the casing ends and the bent cap soffit and/ or footings. The gap prevents the casing from bearing on the attached member. Bearing would increase the effects of the plastic moment and thus the demand in the footing or bent cap.

40|$|The use of {{high-strength}} concrete (HSC) in seismically active regions poses a {{major concern}} because of the brittle nature of the material.

This paper investigates the use of stay-in-place FRP formwork as concrete confinement reinforcement for HSC columns with square cross sections. Large scale HSC building columns, encased in FRP casings, were tested under simulated seismic loading. The columns had 270 mm square sections and concrete strengths up to 90 MPa. The casings were manufactured from carbon FRP and epoxy resin. The unique aspects of the test program were the introduction of the corner radius as a test parameter, and the presence of internally placed FRP crossties, integrally built with <b>column</b> <b>casings,</b> to improve the effectiveness of concrete confinement. Results indicate that the deformation capacity of HSC columns can be improved significantly by using FRP casings. The results further indicate that the confinement effectiveness of columns is significantly affected by the corner radius of casings. Additionally, the confinement efficiency can be improved with the use of FRP crossties. The columns developed inelastic drift capacities of up to 11 %, demonstrating the usefulness of FRP stay-in-place formwork in improving deformability of HSC columns.

40|$|The use of {{high-strength}} concrete (HSC), with strengths reaching 130 MPa, {{has increased}} in recent years due to its superior performance and strength.

Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite casings offer an attractive alternative to conventional reinforcement to enhance strength and deformability of concrete <b>columns.</b> FRP <b>casings</b> can be designed to increase lateral deformability of earthquake resistant columns significantly, while also providing some enhancement of load-carrying capacity. There is a clear need for a design procedure to compute lateral drift capacities of FRP encased square and circular columns. A design approach was developed that incorporates experimentally observed confinement parameters, while also incorporating axial load and lateral drift as design variables. The approach had evolved from a displacement based design procedure developed for concrete columns confined with conventional steel reinforcement. The expression derived as part of the proposed design procedure had been verified against available experimental data. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) casings, in {{the form}} of stay-in-place formwork, provide an attractive alternative to conventional confinement reinforcement for concrete <b>columns.</b> These <b>casings</b> can fulfill multiple functions of; i) formwork, ii) confinement reinforcement, and iii) protective shell against corrosion, weathering and chemical attacks. This paper investigates the use of stay-in-place FRP formwork as concrete confinement reinforcement for HSC columns with circular and square crosssections. Large-scale specimens with 270 mm cross-sectional dimension and up to 90 MPa concrete strength, were tested under combined axial compression and incrementally increasing lateral deformation reversals. FRP casings were manufactured from carbon fiber sheets and epoxy resin. One of the square columns was provided with internal FRP crossties, a new technique introduced by the authors, to provide welldistributed lateral restraints along the column face, thereby improving the mechanism of confinement. The results indicate that the deformation capacity of HSC columns can be improved significantly by using FRP casings. The results further indicate that the confinement effectiveness of <b>casings</b> of square <b>columns</b> is significantly affected by the corner radius of casings. Confinement efficiency of these casings improves with the use of FRP crossties. T. Ozbakkaloglu and M. Saatcioglu[URL]...|$|R
