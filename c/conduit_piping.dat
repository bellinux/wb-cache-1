5000|$|While {{a variety}} of {{companies}} competed with Fiber Conduit Company, it was by {{far and away the}} largest producer of bitumenized fiber <b>conduit</b> <b>piping</b> throughout the early 20th century and demand for fiber conduit only increased during World War II with the need for electrical conduit for use in new airfields and military bases. In 1948, the name of the Fiber Conduit Company was changed to the Orangeburg Manufacturing Company. As World War II ended and gave rise to the post-war housing boom, the demand for cheap housing materials was at an all-time high and available drainage materials were scarce. Orangeburg Manufacturing produced a thicker-walled, sturdier, round version of fiber conduit, selling it as [...] "Orangeburg pipe" [...] for sewer and drain uses.|$|E

Utility <b>conduits</b> and <b>piping</b> are encased within the final layer of shotcrete in the walls and arch and placed under the concrete floor slab. Reinforced concrete slabs are usually 6 in.

These include <b>conduit,</b> process <b>piping,</b> wiring race ways, and other electrical equipment. The company's goals were to improve its paint line's pretreatment cleaning performance and to reduce operating costs. To achieve this, they successfully implemented ultrafiltration membrane technology, which produced significant environmental reductions and savings.

She threatens to expose him, but Bishop informs the group of a greater danger: The power plant was damaged by the dropship crash and will soon explode {{with the force of}} a 40-megaton thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of <b>piping</b> <b>conduits</b> to reach the colony's transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulacos remaining dropship to the surface.|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of freshwaters as {{key players in}} the global budget of both carbon dioxide and methane has recently been highlighted. In particular, rivers clearly do not act simply as inert <b>conduits</b> merely <b>piping</b> carbon from catchment to coast, but, on the whole, their metabolic activity transforms a considerable fraction of the carbon that they convey. In addition, nitrogen is cycled, sometimes in tight unison with carbon, with appreciable amounts being ‘denitrified’ between catchment and coast. However, shortfalls in our knowledge about the {{significance of}} exchange and interaction between rivers and their catchments, particularly the significance of interactions mediated through hyporheic sediments, are still apparent. From humble beginnings of quantifying the consumption of oxygen by small samples of gravel, to an integrated measurement of reach scale transformations of carbon and nitrogen, our understanding of the cycling of these two macro elements in rivers has improved markedly in the past few decades. However, recent discoveries of novel metabolic pathways in both the nitrogen and carbon cycle across a spectrum of aquatic ecosystems, highlights the need for new directions and a truly multidisciplinary approach to quantifying the flux of carbon and nitrogen through rivers...|$|R
40|$|Virtually all {{engineering}} applications {{involve the}} use of <b>piping,</b> <b>conduits</b> and channels. In the petroleum industry, piping systems are extensively employed in upstream and downstream processes. These piping systems often carry fluids that are corrosive, which leads to wear, cavitation and cracking. The replacement of damaged piping systems can be quite expensive, {{both in terms of}} capital costs, as well as in operational downtime. This motivates the present research on noninvasive healing of cracked piping systems. In this investigation, we propose to develop computational models for characterizing noninvasive repair strategies involving electromagnetically guided particles. The objective is to heal industrial-piping systems noninvasively, from the exterior of the system, during operation, resulting in no downtime, with minimal relative cost. The particle accumulation at a target location is controlled by external electro-magneto-mechanical means. There are two primary effects that play a role for guiding the particles to the solid-fluid interface/wall: mechanical shear due to the fluid flow, and an electrical or magnetic force. In this work we develop and study a relationship that characterizes contributions of both, and ascertain how this relationship scales with characteristic physical parameters. Characteristic non-dimensional parameters that describe system behavior are derived and their role in design is illustrated. A detailed, fully 3 -dimensional discrete element simulation framework is presented, and illustrated using a model problem of magnetically guided particles. The detailed particle behavior is considered to be regulated by three effects: (1) the field strength (2) the mass flow rate and (3) the wall interactions...|$|R
