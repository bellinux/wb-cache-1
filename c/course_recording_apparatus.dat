40|$|Disclosed is {{an image}} <b>recording</b> <b>apparatus</b> (5) for {{automatically}} generating a computed tomographic image of a component (7). The image <b>recording</b> <b>apparatus</b> (5) comprises a radiation source (10) {{which is designed to}} emit electromagnetic radiation (35), wherein the electromagnetic radiation (35) has a radiation path (40) which comprises the component (7) or at least a section of the component (7) and a radiation detector (15). The image <b>recording</b> <b>apparatus</b> (5) further has the radiation detector (15) which is designed to receive the electromagnetic radiation (35) of the radiation source (10) and to detect the image of the component (7) or the image of the section of the component (7) which is in the radiation path (40). The radiation source (10) and the radiation detector (15) are located in a radiation protection cabinet (20) which is designed to shield the electromagnetic radiation (35) inside the radiation protection cabinet (20) from the environment. The image <b>recording</b> <b>apparatus</b> (5) further comprises a robot (25) located outside the radiation protection cabinet (20), wherein a robotic arm (45) of the robot (25) is designed to guide the component (7) into the radiation protection cabinet (20) through an opening (50) in the radiation protection cabinet (20). A radiation escape prevention device (30) is designed to prevent radiation (35) escaping through the opening (50) when the component (7) is guided into the radiation protection cabinet (20) through the opening (50) by the robotic arm (45) ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s an {{effective}} VHF radio link was introduced that enabled the APs to switch-on the <b>recording</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Soon after, advances in electronics {{meant that the}} manual plotting of bearings and some other calculations were replaced by electronic calculators.|$|R
50|$|British {{research}} continued {{between the}} wars {{as it did}} in other nations. It appears that in Britain this led to better microphones and <b>recording</b> <b>apparatus</b> using heat sensitive paper instead of photographic film. Radio link was also developed, although this could only connect the microphones to the <b>recording</b> <b>apparatus,</b> it did not enable the APs to switch on the recorder. Another innovation in the late 1930s was development of the comparator. This was a mechanical computer that calculated first order differential equations, it provided a fast means of comparing the coordinates of the fall of shot located by sound ranging with the coordinates of the target and hence deduction of a correction to the fall of shot.|$|R
