5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective <b>case</b> <b>in</b> most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative <b>case</b> (<b>in</b> the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative <b>case</b> (<b>in</b> the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

Methods:  Endovascular treatment of 53 cases of ruptured intracranial aneurysms,including first ruptured <b>in</b> 42 <b>cases</b> and 11 cases of ruptured twice, were performed using GDC and stent assisted GDC embolization, 29 <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> 2 days and 24 <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> {{more than two}} days after ruptured. And it was divided into the ultra-early group and the non-ultra-early group. The locations of aneurysms were as following: 20 <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> posterior communicating artery, 15 <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> anterior communicating artery, 3 <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> Ophthalmic artery, 4 <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> internal carotid artery, 6 <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> vertebral artery, and 3 <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> posterior inferior cerebellar artery; Hess-Hunt grade was as follows: 9 cases of gradeⅠ, 25 cases of grade Ⅱ, 13 cases of grade Ⅲ, 6 cases of grade Ⅳ. Results:   According to the investigation among 59 aneurysms from 6 months to 60 months after operation, good recovery rate of the ultra-early group and the non-ultra-early group were respectively 96. 55 % and 79. 17 %.
