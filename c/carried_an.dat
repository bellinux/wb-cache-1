5|$|After {{the final}} result, Miller refused to endorse McEwen, though McEwen tried to soothe {{feelings}} by introducing H.R. 5727 in the House {{to name the}} dam and locks on the Ohio River near Gallipolis after Miller. Miller <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> unsuccessful legal challenge to the redistricting to the United States Supreme Court, insisting district lines should be drawn on a politically neutral basis.|$|E

5|$|Connolly {{has argued}} that they were armed as a pike phalanx. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states they carried spears shorter than the Roman triarii and by Daly {{because they could not}} have <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> {{unwieldy}} pike {{at the same time as}} a heavy Roman-style shield.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{releases}} for the DVD. The first, as a 2-DVD set, {{was released on}} 27 May 2002 in limited regions.

5|$|Ava {{was also}} {{underneath}} the NOAA-2 and Nimbus 5 weather satellites. NOAA-2 provided photographs {{that were used}} to estimate Ava's maximum windspeeds. Satellite images were useful throughout the cyclone's existence, as did the wind reports of three ships when Ava was a young tropical storm. Nimbus 5 <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer and Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer. Both were used to study Ava. The main data provided by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions. The observations also provided confirmation that clouds that are not vertically developed very much can produce tropical rainfall.|$|E

Powell <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy and popular gun during the Civil War) and a Bowie knife.|$|E
5|$|Bristol was a {{starting}} place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, {{became the first}} European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At {{the height of the}} Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.|$|E

She was laid down on 25 September 1931, {{launched}} on 7 July 1932 and finally commissioned into the Navy on 31 March 1933. Built as a flotilla leader, she displaced 25 long tons {{more than the}} rest of her class and <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> extra 30 personnel. These personnel formed the staff of the Captain (D) of the flotilla.|$|E
50|$|The Nordlander {{normally}} <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> large single {{square sail}} {{with the largest}} boats <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> topsail. It's {{one of the few}} types of boats that still <b>carries</b> such <b>a</b> sail to the present day.|$|R

5|$|During {{the second}} half Freddie (Froggie) Meiers <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> onside kick over for a touchdown, but it was called back. The Tennessee backs were {{repeatedly}} thrown for no gains or losses all game, and steady improvement by the Commodores was noticed.

According to Nielsen Media Research, the ABC premiere acquired a 1.6 rating in the Kids 2–11 demographic, and a 1.4 rating in Tweens 9–14, as well as a 7% share in both demographics. The premiere was that timeslot's highest-rated broadcast in nearly three months across the block's three key demographics, Kids 2–11, Kids 6–11 and Tweens 9–14. During the ABC Kids broadcasts, the series <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> E/I designation.|$|E

The same surveys showed that only 90trucks are included in that average. In comparison, US41 south of M-67 <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> average of 2,300vehicles and 270trucks. No segment of the trunkline is listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways.|$|E

Selleck is {{a veteran}} soldier (Army National Guard from 1967 to 1973) and a skilled shooter; he {{collects}} firearms. Most of the characters that Selleck has portrayed in television who <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> sidearm have <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> type of Model 1911A1 [...]45 pistol. In the early novels, Stone usually <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> [...]38 Special Smith & Wesson Model 36 snub-nosed revolver; the same firearm which he had used as a homicide detective with the LAPD. (Parker's private detective character Spenser also <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> snub-nosed Smith & Wesson Model 36 [...]38 Special revolver in the first thirteen [...] "Spenser" [...] novels.)

5|$|Nearly {{half of all}} U.S. Apaches were {{deployed}} to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. During Operation Desert Storm on 17 January 1991, eight AH-64As guided by four MH-53 Pave Low IIIs destroyed part of Iraq's radar network in the operation's first attack, allowing the attack aircraft to evade detection. The Apaches each <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> asymmetric load of Hydra 70 flechette rockets, Hellfires, and one auxiliary fuel tank. During the 100-hour ground war a total of 277 AH-64s took part, destroying 278 tanks, numerous armored personnel carriers and other Iraqi vehicles. One AH-64 {{was lost in the}} war, to a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) hit at close range, the Apache crashed but the crew survived.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{found the}} ship to be very stiff in her {{sea-keeping}} qualities. Hansa was very maneuverable and was easily controlled while under sail; under steam the ship remained highly maneuverable but control suffered. The ship's crew numbered 28officers and 371 enlisted men. She carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy. The ship also <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> unknown number of picket boats and barges. Anti-torpedo nets were briefly fitted to the ship from 1885 to 1888.|$|E

5|$|The Kolberg class {{represented}} {{the first major}} improvement in combat power for German light cruisers, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They were armed with the longer-barrel 10.5 cm SK L/45 gun, which had a higher muzzle velocity and thus greater range than the earlier L/40 weapon. In addition, they <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> extra pair of guns, which strengthened their broadside. This was on a displacement of over a thousand tons greater than the preceding Dresden class. All four ships were also powered by turbines, which granted them {{a significant increase in}} speed over the earlier vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier I {{was the first}} planned {{aircraft carrier}} conversion project of the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) during World War I. The Imperial Navy had experimented previously with seaplane carriers, though these earlier conversions were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet and <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> insufficient number of aircraft. I was intended to carry between 23 and 30 aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and torpedo-bombers.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{translated}} into all major languages, and in the United States it became the second best-selling book after the Bible. A number of the early editions <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> introduction by Rev James Sherman, a Congregational minister in London noted for his abolitionist views. Uncle Tom's Cabin sold equally well in Britain, with the first London edition appearing in May 1852 and selling 200,000 copies. In a few years over 1.5 million copies of the book were in circulation in Britain, although most of these were infringing copies (a similar situation occurred in the United States).|$|E
