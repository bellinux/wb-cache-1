Since HRs are rare events, recombinant cells distribute sparsely inside the organ. A detailed measurement throughout the whole tissue is thus not practical. Instead, the site selective two-photon tissue cytometer incorporates a low magnification, wide field, one-photon imaging subsystem that rapidly identifies regions of interest containing recombinant cell clusters. Subsequently, high-resolution three-dimensional assays based on two-photon microscopy can be performed only in these regions of interest. We further show that three-dimensional morphology extraction algorithms can be used to analyse the resultant high-resolution two-photon image stacks providing information not only on the frequency and the distribution of these recombinant cell clusters and their constituent cells, but also on their morphology...|$|R

40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} {{can be seen as}} a large number (hundreds of thousand) of small (a few <b>cubic</b> <b>millimetres)</b> devices, battery powered, with very limited hardware resources. Such a network has been studied specifically in the ad hoc model, where the sensors autonomously set up a network infrastructure. We propose here an extension to the current wireless ad hoc sensor network (WSN) model (in particular the base station model), by introducing a Supervisor which has very few interactions with the network, it is mobile in itself, it could have more powerful hardware and it is asynchronous with respect to the sensors. Nevertheless, the Supervisor has to interact with the sensor network, for example to invoke the command to exclude from the network a selected sensor. We believe such a model is particularly suitable for, but not limited to, military applications. We then propose a distribut ed, cooperative, parallel algorithm for this model that assures the following properties: it enforces both the secure exclusion of a selected compromised sensor from the network and the rekeying of the remaining sensors. It has an overall low overhead both in terms of computation and required transmitted messages. It is scalable, since the algorithm requires only limited, local knowledge of the network topology...|$|R

40|$|In the Western World, {{endometrial cancer}} {{is the most common}} {{malignancy}} of the female genital tract. Endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC or Type I tumour), accounts for approximately 75 % of cases. Type II tumours, of which uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is the most common subtype, are less common. Since classification as EEC or UPSC has therapeutic and prognostic implications, it is important to make the proper diagnosis. UPSC share their aggressive clinical behaviour and their histological appearance with serous carcinoma of the Fallopian tube and ovary. In this thesis genetic and epigenetic modifications in endometrial cancer and related gynaecological malignancies were studied to gain a better insight in its molecular pathogenesis, and to identify possible diagnostic and prognostic markers. A developing solid tumour will outgrow its own vasculature beyond the size of several <b>cubic</b> <b>millimetres,</b> resulting in hypoxia. Hypoxia {{has been found to be}} an important event in carcinogenesis as it renders a more aggressive phenotype. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF- 1) is the key cellular survival protein during hypoxia. HIF- 1 ? expression might be helpful to identify patients who are at risk of developing recurrent disease. Perinecrotic HIF- 1 ? expression (thought to be hypoxia driven) appeared to be an independent indicator of poor prognosis in EEC. More aggressive adjuvant treatment might be necessary to improve the outcome of these patients. To this end, HIF- 1 ? itself can be an attractive therapeutic target. Claudins have recently been identified as a 24 -gene family of structures and functional components of the tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudins show a tissue-specific expression pattern in humans and diversity in the expression patterns between normal tissue and its corresponding tumour. We found aberrant (i. e. not in the membranes) nuclear claudin 3 expression to be a typical feature of UPSC. In 80 % of cases nuclear claudin 3 was seen in UPSC, compared to only 17 % of EEC, 3 % of OVCA and none of FTC. Promoter methylation is an epigenetic event that plays an important role in carcinogenesis by downregulation of tumour suppressor gene (TSG) expression. We show that promoter methylation was more frequent in EEC than in UPSC. Methylation of CDH 13, MLH 1 and TIMP 3 was typical for EEC, while CDKN 2 B and TP 73 methylation characterised UPSC. The correct tumour type could be predicted in almost 90 % of EEC and 70 % of UPSC with this TSG panel. However, this tumour type specific methylation pattern is not yet sufficiently differentiating to be of clinical use. Comparing the methylation status of TSGs in the different serous tumours showed that RASSF 1 (A) methylation was typical for endometrial origin. GSTP 1 on the other hand was more frequently methylated in OVCA and FTC. As UPSC exhibit different genetic- and epigenetic profiles compared to serous ovarian- and Fallopian tube carcinoma, it should be regarded as distinct entity. All in all, especially promoter methylation seems a promising biomarker in endometrial cancer. The identification of such markers is an important step for individualised patient tailored therapy and, ultimately, in improving patient outcomes...|$|R

30|$|Many of the {{uncertainties}} in the acquisition steps are derived directly from inherent {{limitations of the}} fMRI scanner hardware. A comprehensive review of the fMRI hardware, including its limitations, {{is beyond the scope}} of this paper, and interested readers are directed to recent works, e.g. [40 – 42]. fMRI hardware limitations commonly include poor image resolution, both spatially and temporally; low signal-to-noise ratio; head motion artefacts; functional state differences within the slice sequences in a scan that are caused by the difference in time points taken to get through all the slices sequentially [43]; and others such as the ghosting artefact [44] which results in apparent activation through increased intensity of overlapping signals caused principally by inaccurate timing of reads and magnetic field inhomogeneity [1, 12, 33, 42, 44]. As an example of these limitations, scans typically image the brain at a spatial resolution of 1 – 2  mm, depending on the hardware and study, with each volumetric scan in the temporal sequence taking between 1 and 3  s, depending on the spatial resolution chosen, resulting in a total scan duration typically taking between 10 and 60  min [42, 45]. However, each <b>cubic</b> <b>millimetre</b> of brain can contain approximately one hundred thousand cells, and the brain can go through tens of state changes per second [42]. This mean an fMRI can only estimate the micro-level function of the brain, likely containing heterogeneity within a voxel, and is susceptible to imaging different brain states as though they are a single contiguous event. While these limitations are inherent to the hardware, some, such as head motion, may be greatly reduced using later processing steps [46].|$|E

40|$|Networks {{of simple}} spiking neurons provide {{abstract}} models {{for studying the}} dynamics of biological neural tissue. At the expense of cellular-level complexity, they are a frame-work {{in which we can}} gain a clearer understanding of network-level dynamics. Substantial insight can be gained analytically, using methods from stochastic calculus and dynamical systems theory. This can be complemented by data generated from computational simulations of these models, most of which benefit easily from parallelisation. One <b>cubic</b> <b>millimetre</b> of mammalian cortical tissue can contain between fifty and one-hundred thousand neurons and display considerable homogeneity. Mammalian cortical tissue (or grey matter") also displays several distinct firing patterns which are widely and regularly observed in several species. One such state is the "input-free" state of low-rate, stochastic firing. A key objective {{over the past two decades}} of modelling spiking-neuron networks has been to replicate this background activity state using "biologically plausible" parameters. Several models have produced dynamically and statistically reasonable activity (to varying degrees) but almost all of these have relied on some driving component in the network, such as endogenous cells (i. e. cells which spontaneously fire) or wide-spread, randomised external input (put down to background noise from other brain regions). Perhaps it would be preferable to have a model where the system itself is capable of maintaining such a background state? This a functionally important question as it may help us understand how neural activity is generated internally and how memory works. There has also been some contention as to whether driven" models produce statistically realistic results. Recent numerical results show that there are connectivity regimes in which Self-Sustained, Asynchronous, Irregular (SSAI) firing activity can be achieved. In this thesis, I discuss the history and analysis of the key spiking-network models proposed in the progression toward addressing this problem. I also discuss the underlying constructions and mathematical theory from measure theory and the theory of Markov processes which are used in the analysis of these models. I then present a small adjustment to a well known model and provide some original work in analysing the resultant dynamics. I compare this analysis to data generated by simulations. I also discuss how this analysis can be improved and what the broader future is for this line of research...|$|E
