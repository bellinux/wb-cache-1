40|$|Most cryptosystems are {{designed}} and evaluated at a mathematical level. Attackers, however, will always target the physical realisation {{of a system}} {{which is much more}} complicated (see [14] for discussion of this disconnect). Real-world electronic implementations of ciphers will usually leak additional information to attackers in the form of side-channels such as timing, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, heat, noise, and more. In many cases, an attacker can combine side-channel information with the observed input and/or output of a cryptographic algorithm to recover secret information. It is important to draw a distinction between side-channel cryptanalysis and related physical attacks. <b>Compromising</b> <b>Emanation</b> attacks or tempest attacks utilise electromagnetic emanations from computers to recover secret data, for example using electromagnetic radiation from a computer screen to recover the text being displayed [11] (for a survey, see chapter 17 of [1]). Tempest attacks target secret information directly, completely bypassing the cryptographic keys. Invasive or semi-invasive attacks, in contrast, involve physical manipulation of a target system to extract secret information, for example by unpackaging a chip and reading secret data stored in its memory using a micro-probe or a microscope (see [4, 2] for a survey of physical attacks and defences).

40|$|Abstract—This study {{attempts}} {{to characterize the}} radiated <b>compromising</b> <b>emanations</b> from four typical LCD TV sets, in particular the predictability of format and timing parameters. Three were found to emit clear UHF RF signals visually related to the displayed image, from the LVDS link between display controller and LCD panel. Although the input signals to all four products followed the same TV standard, the timing parameters of their emanations differed substantially. Some also frequencymodulate their pixel clock to improve EMI compliance. All digitally rescale the input image to the respective display size. The frame {{rate at which the}} display panel is driven is, if at all, only loosely phase locked to the input signal. These observations have implications for eavesdroppers, for the design of test standards to limit <b>compromising</b> <b>emanations</b> from video displays, and for the practicality of detecting the mere presence of an active television receiver by correlating the emanations of the circuitry driving its display panel with a known broadcast TV input signal.

40|$|This master thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at Sectra Communications AB in Linköping where they manufacture electronic encryption devices. In cryptology {{it is essential}} that an eavesdropper cannot find the plain text. To assure that a system is safe, all devices are thoroughly examined so that they don’t emit any secret information, so called <b>Compromising</b> <b>Emanations</b> (CE). This is done by comparing the secret signal with measured signals on the screen of an oscilloscope, a process that is very time consuming and furthermore, the risk of missing <b>compromising</b> <b>emanations</b> is high. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the possibilities to let a computer do this job. Two methods for comparing the signals have been suggested and implemented; cross covariance and model estimation. In the cross covariance method, the cross covariance is calculated and its highest value determine how well the signals match. In the model estimation method, a number of ARX models are estimated, and if the best model is successful in explaining the output signal, it is assumed that there exists CE. The work shows that both these methods are functional for solving the task, yet with a few limitations. Both methods announce CE for clock signals, which really aren’t compromising. The cross covariance method is limited only to find <b>compromising</b> <b>emanations</b> that look like the secret signal or certain frequently occurring non-linearities of it. The model estimation method is more general and detects CE for all linear systems, along with the known non-linearities. However, this method has a flaw: the time delay in the system must be known approximately. Further, the results show that the model estimation method is considerably more time consuming than the cross covariance method. The measurement is carried out with a computer communicating with oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer via the GPIB interface. The implementation has been done in LabView with calculation modules coded in C++...|$|R

40|$|A new {{eavesdropping}} technique {{can be used}} to read cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays at a distance. The {{intensity of}} the light emitted by a raster-scan screen as a function of time corresponds to the video signal convolved with the impulse response of the phosphors. Experiments with a typical personal computer color monitor show that enough high-frequency content remains in the emitted light to permit the reconstruction of readable text by deconvolving the signal received with a fast photosensor. These optical <b>compromising</b> <b>emanations</b> can be received even after diffuse reflection from a wall. Shot noise from background light is the critical performance factor. In a sufficiently dark environment and with a large enough sensor aperture, practically significant reception distances are possible. This information security risk should be considered in applications with high confidentiality requirements, especially in those that already require "TEMPEST"-shielded equipment designed to minimize radio-frequency emission-security concerns...|$|R
50|$|Known as <b>compromising</b> <b>emanations</b> or TEMPEST radiation, a {{code word}} for a U.S. {{government}} programme aimed at attacking the problem, the electromagnetic broadcast of data {{has been a significant}} concern in sensitive computer applications. Eavesdroppers can reconstruct video screen content from radio frequency emanations. Each (radiated) harmonic of the video signal shows a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal. It is therefore possible to reconstruct the picture displayed on the video display unit from the radiated emission by means of a normal television receiver. If no preventive measures are taken, eavesdropping on a video display unit is possible at distances up to several hundreds of meters, using only a normal black-and-white TV receiver, a directional antenna and an antenna amplifier. It is even possible to pick up information from some types of video display units at a distance of over 1 kilometer. If more sophisticated receiving and decoding equipment is used, the maximum distance can be much greater.|$|R

50|$|Markus Kuhn has {{discovered}} several low-cost techniques {{for reducing the}} chances that emanations from computer displays can be monitored remotely. With CRT displays and analog video cables, filtering out high-frequency components from fonts before rendering them {{on a computer screen}} will attenuate the energy at which text characters are broadcast. With modern flat panel displays, the high-speed digital serial interface (DVI) cables from the graphics controller are a main source of <b>compromising</b> <b>emanations.</b> Adding random noise to the least significant bits of pixel values may render the emanations from flat-panel displays unintelligible to eavesdroppers but is not a secure method. Since DVI uses a certain bit code scheme that tries to transport a balanced signal of 0 bits and 1 bits, there may not be much difference between two pixel colors that differ very much in their color or intensity. The emanations can differ drastically even if only the last bit of a pixel's color is changed. The signal received by the eavesdropper also depends on the frequency where the emanations are detected. The signal can be received on many frequencies at once and each frequency's signal differs in contrast and brightness related to a certain color on the screen. Usually, the technique of smothering the RED signal with noise is not effective unless the power of the noise is sufficient to drive the eavesdropper's receiver into saturation thus overwhelming the receiver input.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{equipment}} can emit unintentional {{signals from}} which eavesdroppers may reconstruct processed data at some distance. This {{has been a}} concern for military hardware for over half a century. The civilian computer-security community {{became aware of the}} risk through the work of van Eck in 1985. Military "Tempest" shielding test standards remain secret and no civilian equivalents are available at present. The topic is still largely neglected in security textbooks {{due to a lack of}} published experimental data. This report documents eavesdropping experiments on contemporary computer displays. It discusses the nature and properties of <b>compromising</b> <b>emanations</b> for both cathode-ray tube and liquid-crystal monitors. The detection equipment used matches the capabilities to be expected from well-funded professional eavesdroppers. All experiments were carried out in a normal unshielded office environment. They therefore focus on emanations from display refresh signals, where periodic averaging can be used to obtain reproducible results in spite of varying environmental noise. Additional experiments described in this report demonstrate how to make information emitted via the video signal more easily receivable, how to recover plaintext from emanations via radio-character recognition, how to estimate remotely precise video-timing parameters, and how to protect displayed text from radio-frequency eavesdroppers by using specialized screen drivers with a carefully selected video card. Furthermore, a proposal for a civilian radio-frequency emission-security standard is outlined, based on path-loss estimates and published data about radio noise levels. Finally, a new optical eavesdropping technique is demonstrated that reads CRT displays at a distance. It observes high-frequency variations of the light emitted, even after diffuse reflection. Experiments with a typical monitor show that enough video signal remains in the light to permit the reconstruction of readable text from signals detected with a fast photosensor. Shot-noise calculations provide an upper bound for this risk...|$|R
