5|$|The filters {{designed}} by Campbell were named wave filters {{because of their}} property of passing some waves and strongly rejecting others. The method by which they were designed was called the image parameter method and filters designed to this method are called image filters. The image method essentially consists of developing the transmission constants of an infinite chain of identical filter sections and then terminating the desired finite number of filter sections in the image impedance. This exactly corresponds {{to the way the}} properties of a finite length of transmission line are derived from the theoretical properties of an infinite line, the image impedance corresponding to the <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedance</b> of the line.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Conjugately characteristic-impedance {{transmission}} lines (CCITLs) implemented by lossless periodic transmission-line struc-tures have found various applications in microwave technology, and the T-chart {{was developed to}} perform the analysis and design of CC-ITLs effectively. Originally, the normalization factor used in defin-ing normalized impedances of the T-chart is the geometric mean of <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedances</b> of CCITLs, which is not only one possible choice. By using other normalization factors based on <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedances,</b> different graphical representations can be obtained; i. e., T-charts for CCITLs with passive <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedances</b> are not unique, and {{it depends on the}} associated normalization factor. In this study, three more possible normalization factors related to char-acteristic impedances of CCITLs are investigated. It is found that all T-charts for each normalization factor are strongly dependent on the argument of <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedances</b> of CCITLs in a complicated fashion. The original T-chart based on the geometric mean of char-acteristic impedances is found to be the most convenient graphical representation for solving CCITL problems...|$|R

5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedance</b> in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedance</b> of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

In {{the present}} paper, the {{relationship}} between <b>characteristic</b> wave <b>impedance</b> and compositions was mainly investigated {{in order to find}} a suitable theoretical model for predicting the impedance value of Ti-Mo system composites and FGM.

25|$|The {{availability}} of a continuous, high-fidelity, calibrated blood pressure waveform opened up the perspective of beat-to-beat computation of integrated haemodynamics, based on two notions: pressure and flow are inter-related at each site in the arterial system by their so-called <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedance.</b> At the proximal aortic site, the 3-element Windkessel model of this impedance can be modelled with sufficient accuracy in an individual patient with known age, gender, height and weight.

25|$|The {{result is}} a {{frequency}} compensated probe for modest frequencies that presents a load of about 10megohms shunted by 12pF. Although such a probe is an improvement, {{it does not work}} when the time scale shrinks to several cable transit times (transit time is typically 5ns). In that time frame, the cable looks like its <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedance,</b> and there will be reflections from the transmission line mismatch at the scope input and the probe that causes ringing. The modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission lines and sophisticated frequency shaping networks to make the 10X probe perform well at several hundred megahertz. Consequently, there are other adjustments for completing the compensation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{electrical}} properties of networks of components (inductors, capacitors, resistors) may be expressed using S-parameters, such as gain, return loss, voltage {{standing wave ratio}} (VSWR), reflection coefficient and amplifier stability. The term 'scattering' is more common to optical engineering than RF engineering, referring to the effect observed when a plane electromagnetic wave is incident on an obstruction or passes across dissimilar dielectric media. In the context of S-parameters, scattering refers {{to the way in}} which the traveling currents and voltages in a transmission line are affected when they meet a discontinuity caused by the insertion of a network into the transmission line. This is equivalent to the wave meeting an impedance differing from the line's <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{drawback}} of microstrip {{is that it}} is {{more limited}} than other formats in the range of <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedances</b> that it can achieve. Some circuit designs require <b>characteristic</b> <b>impedances</b> of 150 Ω or more. Microstrip is not usually capable of going that high so either those circuits are not available to the designer or a transition to another format has to be provided for the component requiring the high impedance.The tendency of microstrip to radiate is generally a disadvantage to the format, {{but when it comes to}} creating antennae it is a positive advantage. It is very easy to make a patch antenna in microstrip, and a variant of the patch, the planar inverted-F antenna, is the most widely used antenna in mobile devices.|$|R
