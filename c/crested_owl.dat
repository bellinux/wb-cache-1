50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>owl</b> (Lophostrix cristata) is {{a species}} of owl in the family Strigidae. It is the only species (monotypic), in the genus Lophostrix.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>owl</b> {{is found}} in Central America and {{northern}} South America, where it occurs in Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It {{is found in}} the Amazon Basin except in the north-west basin region with western Guyana, Venezuela, and central-eastern Colombia. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles, {{black-and-white}} hawk-eagles, black hawk-eagles, and slaty-backed forest falcons. Although {{these are}} the main predators, two species of <b>owls,</b> <b>crested</b> <b>owls</b> and spectacled owls, are also predators. Felines such as the jaguar, puma, and ocelot can also be predators, along with snakes such as the bird snake, tree boas, boa constrictor, tiger rat snake, and fer-de-lance.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{forest structure}} affects the occurrence and abundance of three owl species: the <b>crested</b> <b>owl</b> Lophostrix cristata Daudin, 1800, the Amazon pygmy owl Glaucidium hardyi Vielliard, 1990, and the tawny-bellied screech owl Megascops watsonii Cassin, 1849. We surveyed the owls mostly between 07 : 00 and 11 : 00 pm from July 2001 to April 2002, in eighteen 8 km transects along trails at the Ducke Reserve, Manaus, Central Amazon, Brazil. We staked out 50 x 50 m plots where {{the presence and}} absence of the owls were recorded. We compared some components of the forest structure between plots where owls were present and plots where they were absent. The spatial variation in these components {{were related to the}} occurrence and abundance of the owls using models of multiple logistic and multiple linear regressions analysis, respectively. Lophostrix cristata is rare in many other areas of the Amazon forest, but it was the most abundant in our study area. Lophostrix cristata and G. hardyi were more concentrated along the uplands (central plateau), which divide the reserve into two drainage water-basins. Megascops watsonii was distributed mainly in the southeastern part of the reserve. Glaucidium hardyi was more often found in areas with larger canopy openness. In areas with higher abundance of snags, there was significantly higher occurrence of L. cristata and M. watsonii. Megascops watsonii was also more abundant in areas with higher abundance of forest trees and in areas bearing shallower leaf litter on the forest floor. This study is the first to analyze at large spatial scale the effects of forest structure on neotropical forest top predator nocturnal birds. The results indicate that forest structure can affect the occurrence and abundance of owls in the Amazon forest...|$|E

5000|$|All owls {{are listed}} in Appendix II of the {{international}} CITES treaty (the Convention on Illegal Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). Although owls have long been hunted, a 2008 news story from Malaysia indicates that the magnitude of owl poaching {{may be on the}} rise. In November 2008, TRAFFIC reported the seizure of 900 plucked and [...] "oven-ready" [...] owls in Peninsular Malaysia. Said Chris Shepherd, Senior Programme Officer for TRAFFIC's Southeast Asia office, [...] "This {{is the first time we}} know of where 'ready-prepared' owls have been seized in Malaysia, and it may mark the start of a new trend in wild meat from the region. We will be monitoring developments closely." [...] TRAFFIC commended the Department of Wildlife and National Parks in Malaysia for the raid that exposed the huge haul of owls. Included in the seizure were dead and plucked barn owls, spotted wood <b>owls,</b> <b>crested</b> serpent eagles, barred eagles, and brown wood owls, as well as 7,000 live lizards.|$|R
