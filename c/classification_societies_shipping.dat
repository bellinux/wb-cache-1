Hence, {{a limited number of}} weldments are specified by rules of <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> to be inspected on a sampling basis. There is a variation between the rules and guidelines used by different <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> in terms of both philosophy and implementation which results in significant discrepancy in the prescribed checkpoints, numbers, and their locations. In this article, relevant sections of the rules of mainstream International Association of <b>Classification</b> <b>Societies</b> members are studied and potential ways of improving them are discussed.

In ship’s hull production, surface preparation is a demanding technological work operation which begins with primary surface preparation (preparation of plates and sections for dyeing workshop with protective coating) and continues with the preparation of steel before painting of sub-assembled sections and blocks according to ISO 8501 - 3 grade P 2. The surface preparation or additional surface preparation work, according to the above mentioned standards, require some additional technological time, a new human resources which in the end can significantly affect the ship's hull building time and the final price of the vessel in its entirety. Shipyard has to apply 1 control process over surface preparation during the process of drafting and construction of hull and provide in this way the impact on production costs, reduce them to a minimum at each stage of the production process, respecting the norms and criteria for processing, quality control and hull building schedule.

40|$|In {{the day-to-day}} ship operations, {{structural}} and machinery failures {{may lead to}} major accidents, endangering crew and passengers lives onboard, posing {{a threat to the}} environment and having a great impact in terms of ship performance and business losses. The ship onboard measurement methodology aims in addressing which systems should be monitored, when the scheduling of monitoring should occur, who will carry out the measurements and how. Information is acquired from data for machinery and structures collected from sources such as <b>Classification</b> <b>Societies,</b> <b>ship</b> structural drawings, planned maintenance systems, dry-dock reports and real time monitoring data. Through the examination of the above, the specifications of the various ship system parameters to be measured are conducted alongside the number of sensors to be installed. Different scenarios for monitoring the condition and performance of systems either on a day-to-day basis or periodically using either permanent sensors installed onboard the ship or portable equipment or also a combination of them is evaluated. Moreover, parameter measurements are concentrated on various systems temperatures, pressures and monitoring techniques such as vibration monitoring. The onboard measurement outcome will be further utilised for input in tools capable of calculating and assessing the performance and reliability of the ship, thus ensuring safe and efficient vessel operation. The deployment of the developed onboard system will be studied under realistic operational conditions for three different ship types, i. e. tanker, bulk carrier and container ship...|$|R
40|$|It {{is highly}} {{desirable}} that ships operate safely 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. To achieve this, <b>ship</b> <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> supply <b>ship</b> owners and operators with suites of IT-supported services, increasingly web-based and highly personalized.

40|$|AbstractMarine {{transport}} {{has been}} essential for international trade. Concern for its environmental impact was growing among regulators, <b>classification</b> <b>societies,</b> <b>ship</b> operators, ship owners, and other stakeholders. By applying life cycle assessment, this article aimed {{to assess the}} impact of a new-build hybrid system (i. e. an electric power system which incorporated lithium ion batteries, photovoltaic systems and cold-ironing) designed for Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ships. The study was carried out based on a bottom-up integrated system approach using the optimised operational profile and background information for manufacturing processes, mass breakdown and end of life management plans. Resources such as metallic and non-metallic materials and energy required for manufacture, operation, maintenance, dismantling and scrap handling were estimated. During operation, 1. 76 × 108 kg of marine diesel oil was burned, releasing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide which ranged 5 – 8 orders of magnitude. The operation of diesel gensets was the primary cause of impact categories that were relevant to particulate matter or respiratory inorganic health issues, photochemical ozone creation, eutrophication, acidification, global warming and human toxicity. Disposing metallic scrap was accountable for the most significant impact category, ecotoxicity potential. The environmental benefits of the hybrid power system in most impact categories were verified in comparison with a conventional power system onboard cargo ships. The estimated results for individual impact categories were verified using scenario analysis. The study concluded that the life cycle of a new-build hybrid power system would result in significant impact on the environment, human beings and natural reserves, and therefore proper management of such a system was imperative...|$|R
50|$|The Coast Guard {{developed}} a boarding priority matrix in the 1990s. This matrix is still used today to prioritize ships for port state control inspections {{based on their}} relative risk. The matrix was constructed around the past performance of each <b>ship's</b> Flag State, <b>classification</b> <b>society,</b> operating company, <b>ship</b> type, and the ship's prior compliance history. Whenever a substandard ship is detained, the Coast Guard reports the action via an internet based system to alert shippers to potential risks associated with shipping on the substandard vessel. To ensure global alignment against substandard vessels, detailed information on detentions is also reported to an international database shared by PSC regimes around the world.|$|R
40|$|Abstract__ Current {{methods in}} the {{shipping}} industry to evaluate performance do {{not account for}} differences in fleet profiles of registries such as age, size or ship type and not for bad luck. This can lead to unfair evaluation of enforcement efforts of the international standards. Furthermore, incentives to improve performance are concentrated on decreasing detentions rather than incidents. This article proposes a new method to a longstanding problem to evaluate performance that rectifies shortcomings of the method currently used. The proposed method measures the enforcement effort by means of proxy variables and introduces incentives for improvement that go beyond the currently used ‘detention’. The aim {{is to provide a}} fair and transparent way. The proposed method is applied and results are compared with methods currently used to demonstrate how the rankings change. The method can be adapted to other areas of the shipping industry such as <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> or <b>ship</b> management companies...|$|R
40|$|With the {{ratification}} of IMO’s resolution MSC. 99 (73) on 1 st July 2002, in many <b>classification</b> <b>societies,</b> fire <b>ship</b> codes are shifting from prescriptive (rules in SOLAS) to performance-based (as long as an adequate level of safety is maintained) for technical, {{economic and social}} reasons. This change is made possible by progress in fire safety technologies, including the development of engineering tools that are required to implement performance codes. The performance-based design is a design activity that is based, on the analysis of a “phenomenon”, developed in case of fire event, and on the verification of adopted providences. The success of performance-based codes depends {{on the ability to}} establish performance criteria that will be verifiable and enforceable. The performance criteria should be such that designers can easily demonstrate, using engineering tools, that their designs meet them and that the <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> can enforce them. This paper firstly presents and discusses the fire models for ships, deriving from those ones of buildings, which can be utilized to simulate the development of a fire event in a compartment or groups of compartments. Successively a study on the performance criteria, which can be currently used by fire protection engineers in designing fire safety in ships, is carried out. This includes deterministic and probabilistic design criteria as well as safety factors. The deterministic criteria relate mainly to life safety levels, fire growth and spread levels, fire exposure and structural performance. The probabilistic criteria focus on the incident severity and incident likelihood. Additionally, the inclusion of safety factors permits a conservative design and allows for a smaller margin of error due to uncertainty in the models and the input data. Finally, two examples demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed performance criteria and their practical engineering relevance...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of ice requires specially constructed ships. The biggest challenge in this aspect is ice loads on ship’s hull: processes of deformation and fracture of ice {{are not fully}} understood and ice geometry and mechanical characteristics can vary dramatically over a few meters. Regardless of which ice-strengthening requirements that are chosen {{as the basis for}} hull structural design, engineers make assumptions about the ship-ice interaction scenario, but ship-ice interaction scenarios outside rules requirements can be fatal for both operators and the environment. Concerning safe design, {{there is a need for}} better understanding the ice loads in conjunction with the models for assessing capacity of structural elements. This paper contributes to highlighting the current differences between guidelines of the International Association of <b>Classification</b> <b>Societies</b> for Polar <b>Ships</b> (IACS, 2011) and of the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RMRS, 2014) for ice loads and plate thickness requirements.
