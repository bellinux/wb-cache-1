50|$|The {{breeding}} season in India is January to March. In Zambia, the {{breeding season}} begins in August. Pairs may indulge in courtship feeding {{in which the}} female feeds the male, an unusual behaviour that has also been noted in captivity. This falcon often reuses the old tree nests of corvids, or lays its 3-5 eggs in a nest that it builds on the fork of a tall tree or in the crown of a palm tree. In Africa, they {{have been known to}} reuse the nests of pied crows (<b>Corvus</b> <b>albus),</b> African fish eagles (Halieaetus vocifer) on Acacia apart from building their own nest in Borassus palms. In India, the nest is often placed in a large mango tree (Mangifera indica) and concealed inside foliage. The nest territory is well-guarded and crows and kites driven away. This falcon has been documented to nests in trees amidst dense human population. The clutch consists of two to four eggs which are incubated only by the female which begins after the last egg of the clutch is laid. The eggs hatch after about 32 to 34 days and the newly hatched young are covered in white down and are brooded by the female for a week. The male brings food which is torn by the female and fed to the chicks. The young fledge in about 35 to 37 days in Africa and up to 48 days in India.|$|E
50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) to the 1235 g silvery-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (<b>Corvus</b> <b>albus)</b> are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E
40|$|Scavenging {{birds are}} very {{conspicuous}} in Kampala {{and a number}} of counts have been made of their numbers since the 1970 s. Between the 1970 s and mid- 2000 s the breeding population of Marabou Storks Leptoptilos crumeniferus increased from about 100 pairs to nearly a thousand, whilst roost counts of Black Kites Milvus migrans also showed large increases. Numbers of Pied Crows <b>Corvus</b> <b>albus</b> and Hooded Vultures Necrosyrtes monachus, also counted as they came into communal roosts, showed lower rates of increase; from mid to late 2000 s however, Hooded Vultures seem to be decreasing. These increases perhaps reflect the four-fold increase in the human population over the same period, considerably adding to the refuse upon which these birds mainly feed. In view of alarming declines of scavengers elsewhere, especially vultures, we plan to continue monitoring these Kampala birds...|$|E
40|$|Despite major {{declines in}} the {{population}} of vultures around the world, noticeable increases were reported in the populations of Hooded Vultures Necrosyrtes monachus {{over the past decade}} in Accra—an important vulture habitat in Ghana. In recent times, however, there is a growing concern that the vulture numbers are decreasing even though scientific data to support this is nonexisting. As a vital zoogeographical and conservation tool, {{it is important to keep}} an up-to-date knowledge about urban bird populations amidst rapid urbanization and associated changes. Using a combination of field data, literature review, and stakeholder consultations, it was indicative that severe decline might have indeed occurred in the populations of Hooded Vultures in Accra. Evidence suggests the killing of vultures for consumption, traditional medicine, and black magic in an undercover trade with possible transboundary connections as important underlying factor. Additional factors suspected to underlie the declines include changes in management of urban facilities and destruction of roosting and nesting trees. The implications of interspecific competition with Pied Crows <b>Corvus</b> <b>albus</b> on Hooded Vultures however remain unclear. There is an urgent need for conservation campaign and education to save the Hooded Vulture in Ghana...|$|E
40|$|Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID), kills vultures (Gyps spp.) that consume tainted carcasses. As a result, vulture {{populations in}} India, Nepal, and Pakistan have been devastated. Studies on meloxicam and ketoprofen {{demonstrated that the}} toxicity of the NSAIDs is unpredictable, thereby necessitating individual testing of all available NSAIDs. Because {{it is no longer}} practical to use vultures for toxicity testing, we evaluated the Pied Crow (<b>Corvus</b> <b>albus)</b> as a model. Pied Crows (n 56) were exposed to a dose of 0. 8 and 10 mg/kg of diclofenac, with no signs of toxicity, and a rapid half-life of elimination. Using primary renal cell and hepatocyte cultures, a high tolerance was demonstrated at the cellular level. Meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic data for the Domestic Chicken (Gallus gallus) and the African White-backed (Gyps africanus), Cape Griffon (Gyps coprotheres), and Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura) showed a trend toward toxicity when the half-life of elimination increased. We conclude that the crow is not susceptible to diclofenac and, more important, that toxicity in the Gyps species is probably related to zero-order metabolism. The study was partially funded by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the National Research Foundation’s (NRF). Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Nest {{predation}} {{is one of}} {{the principle}} constraints on bird breeding success, accounting for 20 to 80 % of all nest failures. It can be exacerbated by anthropogenic factors and the resultant increased predation pressure has caused the decline of numerous bird species worldwide. Identifying management strategies to reduce nest predation is consequently a priority for biodiversity conservation. Many lethal and non-lethal methods of predator control can be ineffective, unethical, time-consuming and expensive to implement. An alternative is the use of Conditioned Food Aversion (CFA), a method by which animals are deliberately induced to avoid nests following consumption of eggs treated with an illness-inducing toxin. Previous studies suggest that this technique is effective but many have been subject to several methodological flaws that limit their applicability. Here I employ an improved experimental design that uses both spatial and temporal controls and incorporates quantification of predator identity and abundance. By so doing the resultant effects can be attributed to CFA treatment with higher certainty. In the Berg River Estuary, South Africa, nest losses of the Kittlitz's Plover (Charadrius pecuarius) are high due to Pied Crow (<b>Corvus</b> <b>albus)</b> nest predation. I used this common plover as a model species to test whether CFA {{can be used as a}} conservation management tool to reduce nest predation. I used a field experiment to assess whether provisioning quail eggs treated with carbachol, an illness-inducing chemical, resulted in reduced nest predation. To assess the effects of treatment, nest survival data for both artificial plover nests containing quail eggs and natural Kittlitz's plover nests, as well as predator abundance were compared across three experimental phases (pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment) and according to treatment type (carbachol versus water) ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{species in}} a wide variety of taxonomic groups have shown shifts in their {{distribution}} ranges in recent decades. Rapidly changing distributions may lead to novel biotic interactions between species that have not historically interacted. As generalist predators, corvids are a potential threat to other species in areas where they have recently colonized or where their numbers have increased. Tortoise species appear to be one taxonomic group that may potentially suffer serious negative effects from increased corvid abundance. One species of corvid which has shown a significant range increase in the last two decades in western South Africa is the Pied Crow (<b>Corvus</b> <b>albus).</b> In conjunction with this expansion have come observed accounts of large numbers of tortoises being found depredated under Pied Crow nests, raising concerns over their impact on tortoises in these areas. Southern Africa has the richest biodiversity of tortoises in the world and a high rate of endemism. The endemic species are mainly restricted to the Cape region, where the genera Chersina, Homopus and Psammobates have their evolutionary centre. In this thesis, I explore how widespread tortoise predation by Pied Crows was during the crow's breeding season. I aimed to quantify the proportion of Pied Crow pairs that provision tortoise to their chicks and the numbers being depredated, as well as the species of tortoises involved. During the 2016 breeding season, I monitored 125 active Pied Crow nests in western South Africa. For the majority of these nests (n= 93) there was no evidence for any tortoise predation. For the 32 pairs, where predation was recorded, I found that 15 pairs depredated ≤ 1 tortoise – week, five pairs depredated depredated between 1 and 2 tortoise–week, and 12 pairs depredated > 2 tortoises–week. The tortoises prey remains found depredated depredated under Pied Crow nests had an average straight carapace length of 5. 57 cm (range 3. 5 cm - 9. 8 cm) and 91 % of them were Angulate Tortoises. Crows favour smaller tortoises with impacts for smaller species, or younger age classes. I also explored whether any environmental variables explained probability of tortoise predation or predation rates. Environmental variables examined included weather variables, land cover types, distances to roads and primary productivity values, and for a subset of nests the abundance of tortoises counted from transects. Although predation rate showed spatial variation among the study areas with most predation occurring in arid areas with high mean temperatures and low rainfall, no single environmental variable successfully predicted the variation in spatial predation...|$|E
40|$|The Indian House Crow (Corvus splendens) is an Asiatic bird species, {{that was}} {{introduced}} to the coast of East Africa in the 1890 s (Lewis & Pomeroy, 1989). From Zanzibar, where colonial authorities introduced the species to act as an urban scavenger, the species has spread into coastal areas of Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. After being recorded {{for the first time in}} Kenya in 1947 in Mombasa, this omnivorous scavenger is now very common in and around Mombasa city and island, and has spread along the north and south coast, and also expanded its distribution inland, largely following the main Mombasa-Nairobi road and rail links (Lewis & Pomeroy, 1989). Perhaps the best example that demonstrates the remarkable adaptive behaviour of this bird species to human environments, is that of the preferred use by the crows of metallic wire for nest building, instead of plant twigs and branches, as reported from large cities in India (Altevogt & Davis, 1979). In and around Mombasa, the breeding season is well defined, from September to January, with a marked peak in October (Brown & Britton, 1980). The success of the Indian House Crow is considered to be the cause of the decline of some other bird species in the coastal area around Mombasa, such as Pied Crow (<b>Corvus</b> <b>albus),</b> Speckled Mousebird (Colius striatus), Mornincr Thrush (Cichladusa arauata) and Golden PalmWeaver (Ploceus bojeri) (Lewis and Pomeroy, 1993). The species is also causing harassment to people at some of the hotels along the Kenyan coast, and reportedly may cause economy losses by inflicting damage to crops and poultry (Yousuf, 1982; Dhindsa et al., 1991). In addition, the species has been reported to be a possible carrier and transmitter of diseases such as cholera and dysenteria (Munguti, 1984; » Anonymous, 1995). In and around Mombasa, this crow has become a pest species, and attempts for its eradication and/or control l have been on-going since 1984. Control efforts have focused on the use of traps, poisoned bait, shooting of adult birds and destroying of nests, eggs and chicks. The problems caused by the crows at the coast have even lead to the formation of a House Crow Control Committee to coordinate the control and eradication programme. It is virtually impossible to monitor the success of control or eradication programmes without any basic data on the distribution and numbers of the crows. At present, no reliable data are available on the number of crows around Mombasa. As recommended in the minutes of the last House Crow Control Committee meeting, there is need for more research into the Indian House Crow. The aims of the present study were: (1) to count the total number of crows that roost on Mombasa island; (3) to assess which areas these crows mainly come from; (3) to study the group size and behavior at their arrival...|$|E
