A key factor of obtaining detailed vision, however, is inhibition. This is mediated by neurons such as the amacrine and horizontal cells, which functionally render the spread or convergence of signals inactive. This tendency to one-to-one shuttle of signals is powered by brightening of the center and its surroundings, which triggers the inhibition leading to a one-to-one wiring. This scenario, however, is rare, as cones may connect to both midget and flat (diffuse) bipolars, and amacrine and horizontal cells can merge messages just as easily as inhibit them.|$|E

40|$|Two piezocones, with {{cross-sectional}} {{areas of}} 1 cm 2 and 5 cm 2 {{and a variety}} of pore pressure filters, were driven at the standard rate 20 mm/s into models of thinly layered soil, and pore pressure dissipation tests were also performed. The models consisted of alternating layers of pre-consolidated kaolin clay and more permeable layers of silt or fine sand, enclosed in a 400 mm diameter cell with either a rigid or a flexible lateral boundary. Control tests were performed on a clay model without any sand or silt layers. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using miniature piezocones to detect individual permeable layers as thin as 2 mm in normally and lightly overconsolidated clay deposits, provided their vertical spacing is at least two <b>cone</b> <b>diameters</b> and a sufficiently fast data recording rate is used. However, the lateral extent of a permeable layer cannot be gauged from a single piezocone probe. Pore pressure dissipation tests in clay layers are not significantly affected by neighbouring permeable layers provided they are more than two <b>cone</b> <b>diameters</b> above or below the filter element. On the basis of the experimental results, it is suggested that miniature piezocones could be used to improve the investigation of thinly layered ground, as might be found in alluvial and estuarine areas...|$|R

50|$|During World War II, the {{precision}} of the charge's construction and its detonation mode were both inferior to modern warheads. This lower precision caused the jet to curve and to break up at an earlier time and hence at a shorter distance. The resulting dispersion decreased the penetration depth for a given <b>cone</b> <b>diameter</b> and also shortened the optimum standoff distance. Since the charges were less effective at larger standoffs, side and turret skirts (known as Schürzen) fitted to some German tanks to protect against ordinary anti-tank rifles were fortuitously found to give the jet room to disperse and hence reduce also HEAT penetration.|$|E

50|$|The SFF is {{relatively}} unaffected by first generation reactive armor, {{it can also}} travel more than 1,000 <b>cone</b> <b>diameters</b> (CDs) before its velocity becomes ineffective at penetrating armor due to aerodynamic drag, or hitting the target becomes a problem. The impact of a SFF normally causes a large diameter, but relatively shallow hole (relative to a shaped charge) of, at best, a few CDs. If the SFF perforates the armor, extensive behind-armor damage (BAD, also called behind-armor effect (BAE)) occurs. The BAD is mainly caused by the high temperature and velocity armor and slug fragments being injected into the interior space and also overpressure (blast) caused by the impact.|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese AWACS has a {{phased array}} radar (PAR) {{carried in a}} round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360 degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a {{triangular}} configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360 degree coverage. The multi-function, three-dimensional pulse-Doppler radar was developed by NII (Nanjing Electronic Technology Research Institute), and is designed to detect and track airborne and surface targets.

5000|$|While most spikes {{are between}} 3/16 inch (5 mm) and 1/2 inch (12 mm) long, {{the most common}} is 1/4 inch (6 mm). Additionally, there are various {{specialty}} lengths, as well as minimal [...] "blank" [...] spikes (also called studs) used to cover a spike well. Spikes are generally metal or ceramic and come in three main types: the pyramid, the needle (pin), and the compression tier (Christmas tree). Pyramids are conical spikes that taper to a sharp point. They normally have a maximum diameter nearly equal to {{the diameter of the}} threads of the spike. Needles also have a sharp point, but a thinner <b>cone</b> <b>diameter.</b> Track spikes create traction by penetrating the track surface. Some tracks do not allow pin spikes and limit the length of pyramid spikes to minimize damage to the track. A variation for synthetic tracks is the Christmas tree spike. It uses a terraced cone shape with a flat end to compress rather than penetrate the track below it and use the track's reaction force to return energy to the runner, increasing the runner's speed. Since it does not penetrate the track surface, it reduces wear on the track. Since the end is flat rather than pointed, it is less harmful to other runners in the event of being [...] "spiked." [...] Lastly, there are Tartan spikes that are dull that are most commonly used for rubber tracks.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the size of blocks of observations of resistance to penetration, obtained by a motorized digital penetrometer, {{and the number of}} blocks with semi-amplitude of the confidence interval between 5 and 20 % of the mean penetration resistance, for different soil depth ranges and <b>cone</b> <b>diameters.</b> Data were collected in two contrasting plots of a crop-livestock integration experiment, located in Abelardo Luz, SC, Brazil. Ten blocks were delimited and the resistance to penetration was determined in 20 points spaced by 20 cm, using a motorized digital soil penetrometer. To estimate the mean of resistance to penetration, 12 blocks of four points per experimental plot should be used for a semi-amplitude of the confidence interval equal to 10 % of the mean (1 - p = 0. 95). Twenty random points may be sampled to estimate mean of penetration resistance for a semiamplitude confidence interval of 10 % of the man (1 - p = 0. 95).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study conducted to determine the relative role of genotypic and environmental control over characters of cone morphology and seed weight in black spruce (Picea mariana (MILL.) B. S. P.) A three-stage cluster sampling scheme was adopted with the sampling stages of populations, trees within populations and cones within trees. Nine characters of cone morphology were measured on each cone and mean 1, 000 -seed weight was determined for each tree. Statistical analyses comprised (1) calculation of popula­ tion {{means and standard deviations for}} each character, (2) <b>cone</b> length-cone <b>diameter</b> correlations at the populations and tree levels, (3) hierarchical analyses of variance and (4) comparison of the <b>cone</b> length-cone <b>diameter</b> correlations with similar values obtained six years earlier. Genetic ana­ lyses consisted of (1) calculation of repeatibility with stand­ ard error and confidence limits for each character at the population level as estimates of heritability; and (2) multiple regression analysis for each character. The latter was con­ ducted using the stepwise zig-zag procedure with cone character as the dependent variable and 12 environmental factors together with their squares and first order inter­ actions as independent variables to identify the subset which contributes most to the variation in the character. Though the means and repeatabilities of all characters vary with populations, no geographic trends can be dis­ cerned. Repeatability values have been shown to be good estimates of heritability. All characters are under statisti­ cally significant genotypic as well as environmental con­ trol and the most important subset of the latter has been identified. <b>Cone</b> length, <b>diameter,</b> and oven dry weight as well as dimensions of the middle scale are under strong, and length and width of the base and tip scale, under weak genotypic control.
