40|$|Bioactive {{glasses are}} of great {{importance}} for medical and dental applications. In order to understand, model, and predict the behavior of these materials, and ultimately improve their design, {{it is important to}} understand the structure of these glasses. Ion dissolution is known to be the crucial first step in bioactivity and is strongly dependent upon the atomic-scale structure and network connectivity. While significant progress has been made understanding the structure of oxide-based glasses, relatively little is known about the structure of bioactive glasses containing halides. Recently, a series of novel chloride-based bioactive glasses has been developed. Chlorapatite converts to hydroxyapatite in water and these glasses are therefore of interest for novel toothpastes. This study reports the first detailed structural investigation of these bioactive <b>chloride</b> <b>glasses</b> using neutron diffraction and solid-state NMR. Chlorine was found to bond to calcium within the glass, and no evidence of Si-Cl bonding was detected. Furthermore, the absence of a chemical shift in the 29 Si NMR upon the addition of CaCl 2 helped confirm the absence of detectable amounts of Si-Cl bonding. Given that chlorine does not disrupt the Si-O-Si network, widely used network connectivity models are therefore still valid in oxychloride glasses...|$|R

40|$|An {{extended}} {{overview of}} the complex phase-mineral and chemical composition and properties of biomass ash (BA) was conducted in Part 1 of the present work. Then, the identified systematic associations, namely (1) Si–Al–Fe–Na–Ti (mostly glass, silicates and oxyhydroxides); (2) Ca–Mg–Mn (commonly carbonates, oxyhydroxides, glass, silicates and some phosphates and sulphates); and (3) K–P–S–Cl (normally phosphates, sulphates, <b>chlorides,</b> <b>glass</b> and some silicates and carbonates); connected with the occurrence, content and origin of elements and phases in the BA system were used for classification of BAs into four types and six sub-types in Part 1. The potential application of BA using the above classification approach is {{described in the present}} Part 2. It is demonstrated that such new BA classification has not only fundamental importance, but also has potential applications in prediction of properties and utilisation connected with the innovative and sustainable utilisation of BAs specified in different types and subtypes. The potential advantages and challenges related to utilisation of BA are described. Different aspects connected with BAs such as: (1) bulk utilisation (for soil amendment and fertilisation; production of construction materials, adsorbents, ceramics and other materials; plus synthesis of minerals); (2) recovery of valuable components and their utilisation (char, water-soluble, cenosphere–plerosphere, magnetic and heavy fractions; and elements); and (3) multicomponent utilisation; are described based on the reference investigations, present data and above classification. Subsequently, additional issues related to BAs, namely: (1) technological advantages and challenges (slagging, fouling and corrosion; low ash-fusion temperatures; erosion and abrasion; co-combustion and co-gasification; prediction of phase composition; and others); and (2) some environmental risks and health concerns (air, water, soil and plant contamination; acidity, alkalinity and leaching; volatilisation, retention, capture and immobilisation of hazardous elements and compounds; ash inhalation and disposal); during biomass and BA processing are also discussed. Finally, it is emphasised that the definitive utilisation, technological and environmental advantages and challenges related to BAs associate preferentially with specific BA types and sub-types and they could be predictable to some extent by using the above combined chemical and phase-mineral classification approaches.

40|$|An {{extended}} {{overview of}} the phase–mineral and chemical composition and classification of biomass ash (BA) was conducted. Some general considerations related to the composition of BA and particularly problems associated with this issue were discussed initially. Then, reference peer-reviewed data including phase–mineral composition and properties of BAs plus own investigations were used to describe and organise the BA system. It was found that BA is a complex inorganic–organic mixture with polycomponent, heterogeneous and variable composition. The phase–mineral composition of BA includes: (1) mostly inorganic matter composed of non-crystalline (amorphous) and crystalline to semi-crystalline (mineral) constituents; (2) subordinately organic matter consisting of char and organic minerals; and (3) some fluid matter comprising moisture and gas and gas–liquid inclusions associated with both inorganic and organic matter. Approximately 229 forming, major, minor or accessory phases or minerals were identified in BA. These species have primary, secondary or tertiary origin in the combustion residue and they are generated from natural (authigenic and detrital) and technogenic phases or minerals originally present in biomass. Common topics related to BA such as: terminology clarification; chemical composition; contents and concentration trends; correlations and associations; formation and behaviour; fusion temperatures; and leaching; were discussed and compared to coal ash. A general characterization of the phase–mineral composition and description of the occurrence and origin for common constituents in BA, namely: (1) silicates; (2) oxides and hydroxides; (3) sulphates (plus sulphides, sulphosalts, sulphites and thiosulphates); (4) phosphates; (5) carbonates (plus bicarbonates); (6) chlorides (plus chlorites and chlorates); (7) nitrates; (8) glass; (9) other inorganic phases; (10) organic phases; and (11) organic minerals; were also conducted and compared to coal ash. Finally, certain major associations related to the occurrence, content and origin of elements and phases were identified in the BA system and they include: (1) Si–Al–Fe–Na–Ti (mostly glass, silicates and oxyhydroxides); (2) Ca–Mg–Mn (commonly carbonates, oxyhydroxides, glass, silicates and some phosphates and sulphates); and (3) K–P–S–Cl (normally phosphates, sulphates, <b>chlorides,</b> <b>glass</b> and some silicates and carbonates).

40|$|An {{extended}} {{overview of}} the phase-mineral transformations of organic and inorganic matter during biomass combustion was conducted in Part I of the present work. The ash fusion and ash formation mechanisms of biomass types and sub-types during combustion are {{described in the present}} Part II. For that purpose the identified systematic associations based on the occurrence, content and origin of elements and phases in the biomass ash (BA) system, namely (1) Si - Al - Fe - Na - Ti (mostly glass, silicates and oxyhydroxides); (2) Ca - Mg - Mn (commonly carbonates, oxyhydroxides, glass, silicates and some phosphates and sulphates); and (3) K - P - S - Cl (normally phosphates, sulphates, <b>chlorides,</b> <b>glass</b> and some silicates and carbonates); were used as classification of BAs into four types ("S", "C", "K" and "CK") and six sub-types with high, medium and low acid tendencies and their description was given. Then, topics related to ash fusion behaviour such as some general considerations and observations about ash melting, ash fusion temperatures (AFTs) of biomass and their comparisons with coal, relationships between AFTs and inorganic composition of biomass and coal, and ash fusion mechanisms of biomass and coal are characterized. Further, issues connected with the ash formation mechanisms such as phase-mineral transformations of organic and inorganic matter and ash formation, ash acidity and description of ash types and sub-types are discussed. Subsequently, aspects related to potential applications of ash formation mechanisms for biomass types and sub-types during combustion, namely some key technological problems (fusion, slagging and fouling predictions, low ash fusion temperatures, co-combustion and application of biomass ash) and environmental risks (volatilization, capture and water leaching of hazardous elements) are described. Finally, it is emphasized that the application of this new classification approach based on combined phase-mineral and chemical composition of biomass and BA has not only fundamental importance, but also has potential applications in prediction of behaviour and properties connected with the innovative and sustainable utilization of biomass and BA. It is also demonstrated that the definitive utilization, technological and environmental advantages and challenges related to biomass and BA associate preferentially with specific BA types and sub-types and they could be predictable by using the above or similar combined chemical and phase-mineral classification approaches.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new strategy}} for fabricating continuous gold films based on the self-assembly of the gold colloid monolayer on a poly(diallyldimethylammonium <b>chloride)</b> -modified <b>glass</b> slide, followed by electroless plating. Hydroxylamine-mediated reduction was proven as an excellent route to enlargement of immobilized nanoparticles on polymer-coated glass substrates in comparison to formaldehyde-mediated reduction. Au colloidal surface-catalyzed reduction of Au 3 + by hydroxylamine exhibited very fast kinetics as monitored and confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy in real time. The nanoscale morphology of the gold film was dependent on the initial coverage of gold nanoparticles and thermal annealing. Atomic force micrographs further revealed that enlarged particles were neither spherical nor cyclindrical, but highly complex in shape. The gold film thickness and its corresponding surface roughness could be easily controlled by setting the electroless deposition time. X-ray diffraction certified uniformity of deposits with the Au(111) crystallographic structure as the predominant one.

To assess the antifouling properties of engineered coatings, advanced approaches {{are needed for}} in situ monitoring of bacterial viability and growth kinetics as the bacteria colonize a surface. Here, we present an optimized protocol for optical real-time quantification of bacterial viability. To stain living bacteria, we replaced the commonly used fluorescent dye SYTO® 9 with endogenously expressed eGFP, as SYTO® 9 inhibited bacterial growth. With the addition of nontoxic concentrations of propidium iodide (PI) to the culture medium, the fraction of live and dead bacteria could be continuously monitored by fluorescence microscopy as demonstrated here using GFP expressing Escherichia coli as model organism. The viability of bacteria was thereby monitored on untreated and bioactive dimethyloctadecyl[3 -(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium <b>chloride</b> (DMOAC)-coated <b>glass</b> substrates over several hours. Pre-adsorption of the antimicrobial surfaces with serum proteins, which mimics typical protein adsorption to biomaterial surfaces upon contact with host body fluids, completely blocked the antimicrobial activity of the DMOAC surfaces as we observed the recovery of bacterial growth. Hence, this optimized eGFP/PI viability assay provides a protocol for unperturbed in situ monitoring of bacterial viability and colonization on engineered biomaterial surfaces with single-bacteria sensitivity under physiologically relevant conditions.|$|R

Afterwards, common issues related to the composition, occurrence, transformation and origin of common constituents in biomass and BA such as: (1) OM, namely cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, char and other organic phases plus organic minerals; and (2) IM such as silicates, oxides and hydroxides, phosphates, sulphates (plus sulphides, sulphosalts, sulphites and thiosulphates), carbonates (plus bicarbonates), chlorides (plus chlorites and chlorates), nitrates, glass, amorphous (non-glass) material and other inorganic phases; were described and compared to coal ash. As a final point, a systematization of physico-chemical transformations during biomass combustion is given. It was found that the original OM and IM in biomass during combustion transform: (1) initially to devolatilization of OM and burning of combustible gases and char with formation of intermediate and less stable oxalates, nitrates, chlorides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulphates and inorganic amorphous (non-glass) material; (2) subsequently to more stable silicates, phosphates and oxides; (3) then to melting accompanied by dissolution of the refractory minerals; with increasing combustion temperatures in the system; and (4) followed by crystallisation of melt and formation of glass accompanied by some salt condensation and hydroxylation, hydration and carbonation of newly formed phases during cooling of BA. Finally, some post-combustion transformations of the newly formed minerals and phases to stable during weathering species among silicates, hydroxides, phosphates, sulphates, carbonates, chlorides and nitrates also occur due to their hydration, hydroxylation and carbonation by moisture and CO 2 in the air through storage of BA. Certain major associations related to the occurrence, content and origin of elements and phases were identified in the BA system and they include: (1) Si–Al–Fe–Na–Ti (mostly glass, silicates and oxyhydroxides); (2) Ca–Mg–Mn (commonly carbonates, oxyhydroxides, glass, silicates and some phosphates and sulphates); and (3) K–P–S–Cl (normally phosphates, sulphates, <b>chlorides,</b> <b>glass</b> and some silicates and carbonates). These associations were applied for classification of BAs to four types and six sub-types. It was found that such systematic relationships have a key importance in both fundamental and applied aspects related to innovative and sustainable processing of biomass and BA.

40|$|We {{report and}} discuss how gold {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized by {{the reduction of}} hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate by sodium citrate {{in the presence of}} unmodified -cyclodextrin (CD), -CD, and -CD. Gold nanoparticles were immobilized on poly(diallyldimethylammonium) <b>chloride</b> (PDDA) modified <b>glass</b> slides to enable AFM measurements. The particle size was dependent upon the type and concentration of cyclodextrin used as well as the sodium citrate concentration. An increase in the cyclodextrin concentration effected a shift of the particle size range from 12 - 15 to 4 - 6 nm with uniform particle size distribution. The homogeneity of the synthesized gold nanoparticles was also evident from transmission electron micrographs (TEMs). Synthesis of gold nanoparticles by the reduction of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate by sodium borohydride in the presence of cyclodextrins also reduced the particle size from 6 - 8 to 2 - 4 nm. The consecutive particle growth due to the mutual coalescence between nanoclusters and their neighboring free gold atoms was limited in the presence of CDs. FT-Raman, FT-IR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry (MS) indicated that the synthesis procedure exhibited no effect on the cyclodextrins. There was no evidence that gold nanoparticles were included in the CD cavities. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Autochthonous {{heterotrophic}} {{aerobic bacteria}} from drinking water were isolated, identified and characterized {{in terms of}} physicochemical surface properties (hydrophobicity). Additionally, eight different support materials were also characterized in terms of hydrophobicity. Concerning the surface properties of the isolated bacteria, from 27 different strains, belonging to 13 different species and 3 strains of the group IV class II of the CDC, only Brevundimonas diminuta was hydrophobic, being the remaining bacteria hydrophilic. Occurrence of surface properties variation within the same species were detected only for Comamonas acidovorans. However, hydrophilic characteristics were maintained within the different strains. All the materials tested were hydrophobic being the less hydrophobic glass and the most hydrophobic polyethylene (PE). The free energy of adhesion between the different bacteria and the support materials in aqueous medium was assessed and used to predict which material had a higher ability for bacterial adhesion and consequently for biofilm formation. This theoretical approach revealed that the support materials that favoured adhesion thermodynamically {{for a number of}} isolated bacteria equal or higher than 20 were stainless steel 304 (SS 304), copper, polypropylene (PP), PE and silicone, while adhesion was less favourable (number of bacteria equal or less than 7) for stainless steel 316 (SS 316), polyvinyl <b>chloride</b> (PVC) and <b>glass...</b>|$|R
40|$|Urinary tract infections {{primarily}} {{caused by}} uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) remain a significant {{public health problem}} in both developed and developing countries. An important virulence determinant in uropathogenesis is biofilm formation which requires expression of fimbriae, flagella, and other surface components such as lipopolysaccha-rides. In this study, we explored the regulation of uvrY and csrA genes in biofilm formation, motility and virulence determinants in uropathogenic E. coli. We found that mutation in uvrY suppressed biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces such as polyvinyl <b>chloride,</b> polystyrene and <b>glass,</b> and complementation of uvrY in the mutant restored the biofilm phenotype. We further evaluated the role of uvrY gene in expression of type 1 fimbriae, an important adhesin that facilitates adhesion to various abiotic surfaces. We found that phase variation of type 1 fimbriae between fimbriated and afimbriated mode was modulated by uvrY at its transcriptional level. Deletion mutant of uvrY lowered expression of fimbrial recombinase genes, such as fimB, fimE, and fimA, a gene encoding major fimbrial subunit. Furthermore, transcription of virulence specific genes such as papA, hlyB and galU was also reduced in the deletion mutant. Swarming motility and expression of flhD and flhC was also diminished in the mutant. Taken together, our findings unravel a possible mechanism i...|$|R
40|$|The {{cold war}} and the {{development}} of nuclear energy have resulted in significant inventories of miscellaneous fissile materials (MFMs). MFMs include (1) plutonium scrap and residue, (2) miscellaneous spent nuclear fuel (SNF), (3) certain hot cell wastes, and (4) many one-of-a-kind materials. Major concerns associated with the long-term management of these materials include: safeguards and nonproliferation issues; health, environment, and safety concerns. waste management requirements; and high storage costs. These issues can be addressed by converting the MFMs to glass for secure, long-term storage or repository disposal; however, conventional glass-making processes require oxide-like feed materials. Converting MFMs to oxide-like materials with subsequent vitrification is a complex and expensive process. A new vitrification process has been invented, the Glass Material Oxidation and Dissolution System (GMODS), which directly converts metals, ceramics, and amorphous solids to glass; oxidizes organics with the residue converted to glass; and converts <b>chlorides</b> to borosilicate <b>glass</b> and a secondary sodium chloride (NaCl) stream. Laboratory work has demonstrated the conversion of cerium (a plutonium surrogate), uranium, Zircaloy, stainless steel, multiple oxides, and other materials to glass. However, significant work is required to develop GMODS further for applications at an industrial scale. If implemented, GMODS will provide a new approach to manage these materials...|$|R
30|$|Building {{upon those}} observations, we present an {{optimized}} protocol {{to probe the}} viability and growth kinetics of surface-adhering and suspended bacteria using non-toxic concentrations of propidium iodide and Escherichia coli that express the fluorescent protein GFP. Beyond calibrating the assay and monitoring E. coli surface colonization kinetics on bare glass substrates, we demonstrate that this assay is applicable to monitor the inactivation kinetics of E. coli in contact with antimicrobial surface coatings, using dimethyloctadecyl[3 -(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium <b>chloride</b> (DMOAC) coated <b>glass</b> surfaces as model substrate. To kill bacteria, the quaternary ammonium chloride complexes of surface-bound DMOAC have to directly interact with the bacterial membrane [23]. We previously showed that bacterial fimbriae strongly influence the unspecific adhesion of E. coli to engineered surfaces [4]. Type 1 fimbriae (7  nm diameter, several 100  μm length) protrude from the bacterial membrane thereby preventing the bulk bacterial body from direct interaction with the underlying material surface. To ensure a physical contact of the bacterial membrane with the material surface, we used here the non-fimbriated K- 12 derivative AAEC 191 A E. coli strain. In addition, we highlight the effect of serum protein adsorption on the bactericidal properties of antimicrobial surfaces. We incubated the DMOAC surfaces with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to mimic the physiological situation where serum proteins adsorb to engineered biomaterials upon contact with host body fluids.|$|R
