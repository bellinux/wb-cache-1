40|$|PERSPECTIVES AND OVERVIEW Two {{species of}} cattle grubs (Diptera: Oestridae) affect cattle in the Northern Hemisphere: Hypoderma iineatum, the common <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> or lesser cattle warble fly, and Hypoderma bovis, the {{northern}} <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> or larger cattle warble fly. The word warble is Anglo-Saxon for boil. Adults of the <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> are {{commonly known as}} heel flies, warble flies, bomb flies, or gad flies. This parasite has been observed and recorded for centuries (159), and Bracy Clark (50) cited and discussed references from Biblical times to Shakespeare. Scientific observations on the biology were first recorded in the 1700 s by Vallisnieri (cited in 224) in Italy, followed by an extensive review and taxonomic description by Brauer (34) in Austria in the mid 19 th century. Major contributions followed in England by Ormerod (157) and Imms (93); in the United States by Riley (179), Osborn (158), Bishopp et al (24), and Mote (132); and in Canada by Hadwen (85). Other reviews completed before the widespread use of systemic insecticides for cattle-grub control include work by James (94) and Scharff (185) in the United States, Gansser in Austria (69), Gebauer in Germany (70), Grunin in Russia (81), Natvig in Norway (141), MacDougall in Scotland (124), and Bevan 2 ̆ 6 Edwards (22) in England. The quality of these reviews makes it unnecessary to repeat detailed information about the stage descriptions and life cycles for these two important species. Rather, I attempt to summarize these contributions, emphasizing additions to our knowledge since the 1950 s...|$|E

40|$|The {{scarcity}} {{of data on}} the actual extent of <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> infestation in Nebraska became evident {{during the winter of}} 1942 [...] 43 when a control program was being organized. Although there were some cattlemen who were acutely aware of the losses occasioned by this pest, there were many others who had given the problem little thought or who believed that infestation resulted largely from the importation of feeder cattle. More detailed information was obviously desirable in order to present an accurate and convincing account of the problem to the cattle growers...|$|E

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} DNA of the <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> Hypoderma lineatum (de Villers) (Diptera: Oestridae) {{was completely}} sequenced. The entire molecule was 16, 354 bp long and presented a heavy bias towards A + T, {{which accounted for}} 77. 8 % of the whole genome. Hypoderma lineatum genes were organized {{in the same order}} and orientation as in the mitochondrial genomes available for other species belonging to the Oestroidea superfamily and compared in this study [Chrysomya putoria (Wiedemann), Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), Lucilia sericata (Meigen) and Dermatobia hominis (L.) ], except for the occurrence of a 102 -bp non-coding region partially present in other species. The complete sequence of H. lineatum will represent a useful dataset to evaluate the evolutionary pattern of mtDNA within Oestroidea by using molecular information in diagnostic, taxonomic and evolutionary studies...|$|E
40|$|Gonotrophic {{development}} in Hypoderma lineatum (Villers) and Hypoderma bovis (L.) {{is characterized by}} initiation and complete growth in larval and pupal stages. Developing oocytes through six stages to the definitive egg are described. Polytrophic ovarian development is modified; only primary and secondary complements of eggs survive and develop simultaneously. The female emerges from the puparium with its life-long complement of eggs fully developed. Capability to mate and immediately oviposit on host cattle is well suited to the short life span of the nonfeeding fly. Mean reproductive capacity of H. lineatum is 516 ± 54 (SD) eggs, {{significantly higher than the}} 478 ± 70 (SD) eggs of H. bovis. This system of ovarian development is more efficient than that of other musciform Diptera and contributes to maintenance of <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> populations, even when adult fly populations are decimated in areas undergoing organized control...|$|E
40|$|The most {{variable}} {{region of}} the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of Hypoderma bovis Accession number: AF 497761. 1 and Hypoderma lineatum Accession number: AF 497762. 2 (Diptera, Oestridae) was amplified by PCR and the amplicons were sequenced and analysed. PCR products were digested with three restriction enzymes, namely BfaI, HinfI and TaqI, providing informative profiles. H. bovis and H. lineatum sequences revealed an inter-specific variation rate of 8. 5 %, and an intra-specific variation rate of 0. 87 and 0. 29 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{control of}} <b>cattle</b> <b>grubs</b> is {{discussed}} here, as are possible insecticide reactions, warnings and restrictions. <b>Cattle</b> <b>grubs</b> are the immature or larval stages of heel or warble flies. Losses from this insect {{begin with the}} fly stage in the insect 2 ̆ 7 s life history. As flies seek animals on which to deposit eggs, cattle become frightened and run. The running animal has its tail in the air, bent over the back. This behavior is termed 2 ̆ 2 gadding. 2 ̆ 2 Cattle fail to graze normally during the warble fly season because of gadding. They seek shade or stand in water to avoid the flies. The failure to graze normally results in decreased milk production and subnormal weight gains. Further losses occur when cattle, {{in their efforts to}} escape the flies, run through fences or into other objects. Slaughter losses result when grubby areas must be trimmed from the carcass and from the decreased value of hides containing grub holes...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS), USDA:APHIS:Veterinary Services {{conducted}} a national study of beef production, the Beef Cow/Calf Health and Productivity Audit (CHAPA). This {{study was designed to}} provide both participants and the industry with information on cow/calf health, productivity, and management practices. Data for Part II: Nutritional & Reproductive Management Practices, were collected by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) from beef producers in 18 of the largest cow/calf producing states from November 9 through December 4, 1992. These 18 states represented 70 percent of the U. S. beef cow inventory. Participating producers had five or more beef cows or beef replacement heifers and fifty percent or more of their 1992 calf crop born between January 1 and June 30, 1992. Replacement heifers were an average of 25 months old at first calving. During calving, 9 percent of replacement heifers required assistance via easy pull, and 7 percent required assistance via hard pull. Ninety-eight percent of mature cows required no assistance. Fifty-three percent of operations had no set calving season. Approximately 88 percent of replacement females were raised (not purchased). In purchasing females, the factor rated as extremely important by the greatest number of operations was temperament (33 percent). In purchasing bulls, several factors were rated as extremely important, including breed, appearance, and temperament (52, 51, and 49 percent of operations, respectively). In culling bulls, infertility, disease, and physical unsoundness were rated as extremely important (77, 62, and 57 percent of operations, respectively). For nearly 53 percent of operations, calf age/weight was {{the most important factor in}} determining when to wean. The most popular method of identifying individual cows was via plastic ear tag (45 percent of operations). The predominance of operations sold weaned steers/bulls, weaned heifers, cull cows and cull bulls by auction (85, 84, 94, and 91 percent, respectively). Two percent of operations practiced forward pricing. Approximately forty-eight percent of weaning or suckling age calves received nutritional supplement implants. Five percent of operations had experienced problems with magnesium deficiency during the previous 5 years; selenium toxicity had been a problem in 0. 3 percent of operations during the previous 5 years. Over 77 percent of operations dewormed cattle; the predominance of operations also treated <b>cattle</b> for <b>grubs,</b> ticks, lice, and flies (61, 60, 74, and 84 percent, respectively).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first documented case of <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> (hypodermosis) in Northern Serbia (Vojvodina). Subcutaneous warbles were determined in a si x year old Simmental cow, at nine places along the spine. After the extirpation of larvae, {{based on the}} morphological characterisation, larvae of the third stage of Hypoderma bovis were diagnosed. The cow was administered therapeutic treatment, which had a favorable outcome, with no signs of recurrence. To the authors’ best knowledge, the case described in this paper is the first documented case of hypodermosis in cattle in Northern Serbia (Vojvodina). As the climate changed {{in the past few}} decades, it is important to pursue detailed investigations of the prevalence of this parasitic myiasis, as there are few such literature data for the Southern region of Serbia. One should also not ignore the fact that species of the genus Hypoderma can cause myiasis in humans as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{profitability}} of livestock {{activities can be}} diminished significantly by the effects of parasites. Economic losses caused by cattle parasites in Brazil were estimated on an annual basis, considering {{the total number of}} animals at risk and the potential detrimental effects of parasitism on cattle productivity. Estimates in U. S. dollars (USD) were based on reported yield losses among untreated animals and reflected some of the effects of parasitic diseases. Relevant parasites that affect cattle productivity in Brazil, and their economic impact in USD billions include: gastrointestinal nematodes - $ 7. 11; cattle tick (Rhipicephalus(Boophilus) microplus) - $ 3. 24; horn fly (Haematobia irritans) - $ 2. 56; <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> (Dermatobia hominis) - $ 0. 38; New World screwworm fly (Cochliomyia hominivorax) - $ 0. 34; and stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) - $ 0. 34. The combined annual economic loss due to internal and external parasites of cattle in Brazil considered here was estimated to be at least USD 13. 96 billion. These findings are discussed in the context of methodologies and research that are required in order to improve the accuracy of these economic impact assessments. This information needs to be taken into consideration when developing sustainable policies for mitigating the impact of parasitism on the {{profitability of}} Brazilian cattle producers...|$|E
40|$|Pasture-Forage-Livestock A special P. F. L. cooperators {{card was}} made up for the range area. Five hundred cards were mailed out and 105 {{returned}} with signatures. Of the eleven practices listed on the card, the cooperator was asked to check those {{in which he was}} interested and wished information on. Labor saving devices ranked first, <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> control-second, protein supplements-third, minerals-fourth, wintering cattle on early cut hay-fifth, and bangs disease control-sixth. The average number of practices per rancher was approximately five. Noxious Weeds Bindweed infestation is rather limited in the county. Five drums of Atlacide were shipped in to the county, but soil was too dry for application. Crop Production Seed test service was furnished 22 farmers. Pure seed of improved oats and barley was placed on 12 farms. Certified varieties of Cheyenne winter wheat was furnished 2 cooperators this fall. On the Kenneth Hall farm, 19 corn hybrids and 5 local open pollinated varieties were grown in a test plot. Due to the exceptionally late varieties were grown in a test plot. Due to the exceptionally late frost the hybrids showed up well. Many out yielded the local varieties by 4 to 10 bushels. A field day was held at the tie of harvest, 12 farmers took time off the visit the field. No sorghum plots were seeded this year as interest has waned since the seasons have become more normal. Three Minnesota grain smut treaters were made. Livestock Activities in livestock production have centered around management, disease prevention and control. with no active local veterinarian in the county, a large number of stockgrowers come to the county agent for information and advice. Thirty two such cases were taken care of. Bangs Disease and foot rot in cattle, erysipelas in hogs and various poultry diseases were the chief troubles.

40|$|Educational {{program of}} {{extension}} work was supported entirely from County Tax funds. The Budget {{for the coming}} year was raised to $ 3, 475 from last years budget of $ 2975. This was very much appreciated, as it will allow a more complete extension service program. This is $ 25. 00 under the $ 3500 calling allowed by the new bill L. B. 405 The annual meeting was attended by 164 people. The program which was held in the new 4 -H building and at the experimental Station, consisted of a business session, four talks on current livestock problems, and a morning and afternoon session of witnessing feeding trials at the Valentine Experimental Sub-Station. Three new members were elected to the board for three year terms; this taking the place of three, one year members. Eleven project clubs, study clubs, with a membership of 185. One new club organized this year, with a membership of 28. Only one training center. There were Twenty active 4 -H clubs with 232 members, who were enrolled and 213 completed. Almost two-thirds were livestock club members. Three 4 -H club Achievement Days were held and one county 4 -H Achievement Day, which was held prior to the County Fair was a great success. Special events in the years 4 -H program were judging and demonstration days, six livestock judging contest, two 4 -H leaders training meetings, five achievement programs, many 4 -H parties, county 4 -H picnic, three 4 -H camps, county and State Fair, Ak-Sar-Ben and Sioux City, and Denver Livestock Show. The years highlight was when a 4 -H demonstration team attended and won first at the Chicago Livestock International Exposition. P. F. L., this year consisted of a Farmstead Improvement Program and working with various livestock and conservation cooperators. Four entries were made in the district Farmstead Improvement Program. six demonstrations were conducted on Control of <b>Cattle</b> <b>Grubs.</b> Four Fly control demonstrations. Seven stock growers assisted in obtaining spray outfits. It is estimated that over a hundred thousand cattle were treated for livestock pests during the year. 63 Farmers were assisted in obtaining improved varieties of seed; osage and clinton. Oats and good seed corn were among the seed obtained. Results of wintering test with protein, urea and mineral supplements, showed that the protein could be stretched out by seeding smaller quantities with liberal amounts. The urea test proved to be quite interesting, although, recommendations for its can not be made. These feeding trial resuts were publicized at various meetings and in the press. No quality cream meeting was held this year. However, assistance was given in the selection of better dairy stock, and the production of quality products was emphasized. Since there is not a veterinarian in the county, the agent is often asked for information and sometimes can aid with stock growers sick animals. blood samples, preventative control, good management, and administrating intravenous injections are the extent of the service. 4 -H club work increased the number of clubs from eighteen to twenty clubs, while the membership remained about the same as last year. There are 155 cooperators in the wind break project planting 152, 050 trees. Had the supply of red cedars not been exhausted, more orders would have been placed. The majority of the trees planted are in the east one-third of the county. Three demonstrations were conducted using the mechanical tree planter. Thirty persons used the tree planter. R. E. A. projects were very successful this year. 430 persons completed the sign up in the Cherry-Todd County R. E. A. districts with 341 miles of high line. The engineer completed his survey. The loan was approved. The main obstruction now is the source of power. The future is much brighter. Interest in a soil conservation district was increased to quite a satisfactory pitch. The vote for a district of all land in Cherry Count, with the Exception of township 28 south, and range 31 west, was carried. The board of supervisors was elected and a conservationest has been quite a full program under way. Farm labor needs were quite well met this year, without recruiting laborers {{from other parts of the}} country, etc. During the peak season, haying help was short, good help was scarce and still is. Help was also short three of the months during the year. The home extension club lesson on color, created more interest in home improvement than other lessons. Kitchen improvement was a close second. There was a large improvement in 41 kitchens. Ranch homes received more attention this year in the beautification of their yards and homes. One 4 -H club with 10 members completed 100 %, while many plans are being made and some executed as to year beautification. The agent helped plan or suggested changes in many yards during the year. Many changes were made, probably due to more available help, more available money and more time for yard beautification and development. One freezer local demonstration was held with a commercial company with 25 persons attending. This helped increase demand for service. Local systems have a long waiting list. A canning demonstration and nutrition talk also helped to improve the quantity and quality of meals [...] time of preparation in a great many homes. An annual flock owners meeting was held, emphasizing the control of disease and good management. Assistance was given the local hatchery in pullorum flock testing. Project clubs gave the Blue Cross drive assistance. These same clubs assisted with the polio drive in the county. Eighty-one operators are using extension service Income Tax Record Books, and two Farm Account Books were taken out for use in the ranch. Rural organization and community live was developed through 4 -H club work and Home Extension club work. Three home extension clubs gave definite assistance to three community through efforts in improving and remodeling buildings for community centers. The organization of a county 4 -H committee, also assisted the recreational life. A county rural youth group was organized and at this time there are 30 active members. This was the biggest step toward the improvement in rural recreation and community life. The electrical equipment show was the most outstanding meeting ever held, as 350 persons attended. This was the most outstanding feature for the extension service this year...|$|R
