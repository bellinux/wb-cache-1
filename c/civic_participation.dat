5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for its {{progressive}} political orientation and its high rate of <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a large number of European settlers entered the state who had mainly emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany. The state remains today a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is {{among the highest in the}} United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, after SMU chaired a {{technical}} workshop to obtain feedback on three alternative proposals, a well-known architect named Tay Kheng Soon {{held a press}} conference at The Substation to unveil his unofficial SMU masterplan. URA was invited to the presentation but did not show up. His proposal entailed re-routing the tunnel to save the National Library building. A week later, Tay wrote to the Prime Minister's Office regarding his proposal which was referred to the MND. Many members of the public wrote in publicly either in support of Tay's plans or argue for heritage conservation in general. A few articles and letters highlighted that the adamant official response to public dissent ran counter to the spirit of the Government's S21 Vision, which expressed a desire to foster <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> and active citizenry.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the topic of low <b>civic</b> and {{political}} <b>participation</b> of children and youth in the Czech Republic. Participatory democracy theory and theory of civil society are used as starting values. The work deals mainly with organized <b>civic</b> and political <b>participation</b> of children and youth. It is shown, based on several international studies, that in comparison with other states the <b>civic</b> and political <b>participation</b> of Czech children and youth is of the significantly lower level. Area of youth participation falls within the national policy on youth and therefore this work describes basic public-policy documents {{that are related to}} the topic of participation of children and youth. In the frame of this work, analysis of the actors involved in the czech youth policy-making, was done. Possible ways of <b>civic</b> and political <b>participation</b> of children and young people, such as children and youth associations, school parliaments, political parties, academic senates, etc, are discussed as well The work identified the main causes of low <b>civic</b> and political <b>participation</b> of children and youth and also proposed specific measures which can help to increase the level of <b>civic</b> and political <b>participation</b> of children and youth in the Czech Republic...|$|R

25|$|Countries with a {{minority}} Muslim population {{are more likely}} than Muslim-majority countries of the Greater Middle East to use mosques as a way to promote <b>civic</b> <b>participation.</b> American mosques host voter registration and <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> drives that promote involving Muslims, who are often first- or second-generation immigrants, in the political process. As a result of these efforts as well as attempts at mosques to keep Muslims informed about the issues facing the Muslim community, regular mosque attendants are more likely to participate in protests, sign petitions, and otherwise be involved in politics.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years, voter turnout has been {{steadily}} declining in the established democracies. This trend has been significant in the United States, Western Europe, Japan and Latin America. It has {{been a matter of}} concern and controversy among political scientists for several decades. During this same period, other forms of political participation have also declined, such as voluntary participation in political parties and the attendance of observers at town meetings. The decline in voting has also accompanied a general decline in <b>civic</b> <b>participation,</b> such as church attendance, membership in professional, fraternal, and student societies, youth groups, and parent-teacher associations. At the same time, some forms of participation have increased. People have become far more likely to participate in boycotts, demonstrations, and to donate to political campaigns.|$|E

In 2004, Lee Hsien Loong, then Deputy Prime Minister, expressed how the Government would be [...] "increasingly guided by the consensus of views in the community with regards to morality and decency issues" [...] {{in a bid to}} [...] "pull back from being all things to all citizens". However, he emphasized the caveat of [...] "opening up more choices for citizens, without imposing on the whole of society". <b>Civic</b> <b>participation</b> may be engaged through debates on policies and national issues, but criticism which [...] "scores political points and undermines the government's standing, {{whether or not this is}} intended" [...] will not be treated lightly. When the opposition criticizes an action or policy, the Government [...] "necessarily has to rebut or even demolish them, so not to lose its moral authority".|$|E

5000|$|Students {{are also}} demonstrating that their civic {{knowledge}} leaves {{much to be}} desired. A National Center for Education Statistics NAEP report card for civics (2010) stated that “levels of civic knowledge in U.S. have remained unchanged or even declined over the past century”. Specifically, only 24 percent of 4th, 8th, and 12th graders were {{at or above the}} proficient level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress in civics. Traditionally, civic education has emphasized the facts of government processes detached from participatory experience. [...] In an effort to combat the existing approach, the National Council for the Social Studies developed the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards. The C3 Framework emphasizes “new and active approaches” including the “discussion of controversial issues and current events, deliberation of public issues, service-learning, action <b>civics,</b> <b>participation</b> in simulation and role play, and the use of digital technologies”.|$|R

2500|$|During the Reconstruction Era that {{followed}} the American Civil War, African Americans had an unprecedented level of civil freedom and <b>civic</b> <b>participation,</b> especially in the Southern United States. [...] With the end of Reconstruction in the 1870s this began to change. By the 1890s many of the Southern states introduced laws that significantly restricted the political and civil rights of African Americans. [...] All of them passed laws restricting voting rights, or making them significantly more difficult to exercise, and also passed laws requiring racially segregated facilities. [...] These policies became entrenched when the United States Supreme Court in 1896 ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that law requiring [...] "separate but equal" [...] facilities were constitutional.|$|E
2500|$|Following the treaty, King George III {{issued the}} Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763 which {{outlined}} the division and {{administration of the}} newly conquered territory, {{and it continues to}} govern relations to some extent between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population, a demarcation that was only a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers. The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> by the Roman Catholic Canadians. The Quebec Act addressed this and other issues in 1774, raising concerns in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of [...] "popery."

This thesis is organized around the central question: How GIS {{can be used as a}} tool for <b>civic</b> engagement/public <b>participation</b> in the Community Development Corporation sector?, and examines three CDCs that employ <b>civic</b> engagement/public <b>participation</b> strategies, and who are also using GIS. Both the traditional neighborhood revitalization model and comprehensive community change model of CDCs are examined. As a collective the three cases presented in this study suggest that the impact of public participation on GIS is more evident when CDCs include their constituents in the planning process of GIS development. by Holly Elizabeth Harriel.
