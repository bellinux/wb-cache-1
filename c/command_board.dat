40|$|The {{atmospheric}} API-CIMS is a downsized {{version of}} the instrument used and described by Marandino et al. (2007). A schematic of the main components is given in Figure S 1. The ion source consists of a heated and temperature-controlled glass-lined stainless steel tube containing a radioactive 63 Ni foil, as described in Saltzman et al. (2009). Lens voltages for ion optics were supplied by a Gamma custom multichannel DC power supply and the quadrupole supply was an Extrel QPS 500 DC/RF power supply and mass <b>command</b> <b>board.</b> Ions were detected using an ion multiplier and discriminator/preamplifier. The primary difference between this instrument and the earlier CIMS instrument is the replacement of a turbo-pumped vacuum stage (1000 L s- 1; 5 x 10 - 3 Torr) in the vacuum system with a turbo charger/rough pumped (50 L s- 1; 1 Torr) collision chamber. The collision chamber is an Extrel API collision chamber with modified entrance configuration. A custom Labview™ program and multichannel A/D interface (NI USB- 6343, X Series DAQ) were used to provide the mass command signal and to acquire the ion counts. The same interface was used to acquire the saw tooth synchronizing signal and to output the ion counts as analog signals for logging by the multichannel data logger described above. The gas standard was supplied from a cylinder (11. 79 ppm) at a mass flow-controlled flow rate of 3 - 6 ml min- 1, resulting in a d 3 -DMS level of 440 – 885 ppt in the air stream. The gas standard was delivered using 1 / 32 ʺ ID Teflon tubing and a low volume 3 -way solenoid valve located {{at the base of}} the foremast. Gas flow rates were controlled and logged via a custom PC-controlled 8 -channel mass flow controller circuit board...|$|E

5000|$|The legitimization {{process is}} defined as [...] "giving legal force to {{decisions}} or justifying policy action".

They are the <b>commanding</b> <b>board</b> for the community colleges in North Carolina and the policies they implement can only be challenged by the court system if they are unconstitutional. So far their first four policies have been constitutional and have not broken any laws. This fifth policy that is meant to be long-term was legitimized through a memo delivered to all fifty-eight community colleges stating the terms of admission for undocumented students. Nineteen months have passed and the newest policy has yet to be challenged in court.|$|R
