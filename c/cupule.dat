5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a <b>cupule.</b> The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
25|$|Teosintes {{strongly}} resemble maize in many ways, notably their tassel (male inflorescence) morphology. Teosintes are {{distinguished from}} maize most obviously by their numerous branches each bearing bunches of distinctive, small female inflorescences. These spikes mature {{to form a}} two-ranked 'ear' of five to 10 triangular or trapezoidal, black or brown disarticulating segments, each with one seed. Each seed is enclosed by a very hard fruitcase, consisting of a <b>cupule</b> or depression in the rachis and a tough lower glume. This protects them from the digestive processes of ruminants that forage on teosinte and aid in seed distribution through their droppings. Teosinte seed exhibits some resistance to germination, but will quickly germinate if treated with a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 2010, {{the first}} sneak peek at The Book of Air, {{including}} two artworks [...] "Airship" [...] and [...] "Streets of Wish", was revealed {{on the official}} PlayFirst's blog, Inside PlayFirst. Art director at the developer KatGames, Pablo Vietto, explained the ideas behind [...] "Airship" [...] artwork that KatGames {{wanted to make a}} [...] "very rustic and compact interior where they could place everything necessary for the navigation of the airship." [...] The artistic inspiration came from the old machines designed by Da Vinci and used in the Jules Verne stories, but adapted to their own style. Meanwhile, adding comments about [...] "Streets of Wish" [...] artwork, Vietto expressed that he wanted to [...] "keep the essence of the Wish village from the first Dream , respecting the roofs and cupules in green tonalities." [...] The idea of having a house with a <b>cupule</b> for a roof was in his mind since the first Dream Chronicles, so this was the perfect opportunity to use it again. According to Vietto, some other details, like the iron works and lights, were inspired by works done by Hector Guimard, a French architect {{and one of the most}} important ones during Modernism.|$|E

2500|$|The pollen grains are {{dispersed}} by {{the wind}} to the female, [...] ovulate cone that {{is made up of}} many overlapping scales (sporophylls, and thus megasporophylls), each protecting two ovules, each of which consists of a megasporangium [...] (the nucellus) wrapped in [...] two layers of tissue, the integument and the <b>cupule,</b> that were derived from highly modified branches of ancestral gymnosperms. [...] When a pollen grain lands close enough to the tip of an ovule, it is drawn in through the micropyle ( [...] a pore in the integuments covering the tip of the ovule) [...] often by means of a drop of liquid known as a pollination drop. The pollen enters a [...] pollen chamber close to the nucellus, and there [...] it may wait for a year before it germinates and forms a pollen tube that grows through the wall of the megasporangium (=nucellus) where fertilisation takes place. During this time, the megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to form four haploid cells, three of which degenerate. The surviving one develops as a megaspore and divides repeatedly to form an immature female gametophyte (egg sac). Two or three archegonia containing an egg then develop inside the gametophyte. [...] Meanwhile, in the spring of the second year two sperm cells are produced by mitosis of the body cell of the male gametophyte. The pollen tube elongates and pierces and grows through the megasporangium wall and delivers the sperm cells to the female gametophyte inside. Fertilisation takes place when the nucleus of one of the sperm cells enters the egg cell in the megagametophyte’s archegonium.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{if not all}} lyginopteridalean ovules were borne in {{an outer}} {{protective}} sheath of tissue known as a <b>cupule</b> (there are some lyginopteridalean ovules that have been reported without a <b>cupule,</b> but these may simply have been shed from the <b>cupule</b> before being fossilised). In Late Devonian and early Mississippian species, the <b>cupule</b> contained several ovules, but by Pennsylvanian times there was normally just a single ovule per <b>cupule.</b> [...] A number of cases have been found of cupules occurring in clusters {{at the ends of}} branching axes. Many palaeobotanists now interpret these clusters of cupulate organs as fertile fronds, in which the cupulate tissue was derived from the laminate part of the frond that surrounded the ovule and thereby provided added protection for it.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cupule</b> {{is covered}} by {{numerous}} scales. In some (e.g. Castanea), the scales are developed into sharp spines, giving the nut protection from squirrels and other seed predators, while in others (e.g. most Quercus), they are not.

50|$|Surprisingly {{little is}} known about the purpose or {{significance}} of <b>cupules.</b> Many meanings or purposes have been suggested in the literature (one review lists 71). In a number of cases <b>cupules</b> were demonstrated to mark specific rocks used as lithophones; in some cases they served in board games; but other credible ethnographic interpretations of their former cultural functions have been secured in very few instances. These cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other corpora, which are widely separated temporally as well as spatially. Even the identification of <b>cupules</b> remains tenuous: archaeologists have encountered difficulties in distinguishing <b>cupules</b> from other features, such as potholes, mortars, querns, metates, tacitas, and small solution pans.|$|R

5000|$|The woody {{nature of}} {{associated}} stalks and preserved short shoots are evidence that Caytoniales were seasonally deciduous, shrubs and trees. Caytoniales had fertile branches with seed-bearing <b>cupules</b> [...] The ovules were located inside fleshy <b>cupules</b> with tough outer cuticle. Individual ovules had an apical tube called a micropylar canal, that allowed pollen to {{pass into the}} pollen chamber. The outer layers of the <b>cupules</b> were fleshy and fruit-like; it is possible this was to aid in animal dispersal. The <b>cupules</b> are 4-5mm in diameter and about 3 mm long (Fig 1-2), and resemble a blueberry.
