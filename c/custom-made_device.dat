The verses have a vaguely Motownesque feel to them, recalling [...] "(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave" [...] by Martha and the Vandellas, but the instrumental break features a raga-flavored lead guitar solo by McGuinn that lasts almost a full minute. Such an explicit juxtaposition of rhythm and blues and Indian modal improvisation was wholly without precedent in popular music at the time. While the song broke new ground in rock music with its Indian influences, it didn't actually feature the sound of a sitar. Instead, the song features raga-influenced scales played on McGuinn's twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar, which was run through a <b>custom-made</b> <b>device</b> designed to emulate the sound of a sitar. McGuinn explained this device in a 1977 interview: [...] "We used this special gadget I had made.

40|$|Abstract: Rationale: The {{efficacy}} of immediate adaptation of mandibular advancement devices made of thermoplastic material {{as a treatment}} option for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been demonstrated in clinical studies. To date, {{there have been no}} studies comparing the {{efficacy of}} such prefabricated devices with custom-made devices. Objectives: Our purpose was to compare the efficacy of both types of devices in patients with SDB. Methods: A randomized controlled cross-over trial, comprising 4 months of treatment with a thermoplastic and a <b>custom-made</b> <b>device,</b> with a 1 -month washout interval. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 35 patients (29 males; age, 49 +/- 9 yr; apnea-hypopnea index [AH 1], 13 +/- 11 events/h; body mass index, 28 +/- 4 kg/m(2)) completed the protocol. AHI was only reduced with the <b>custom-made</b> <b>device</b> (P = 0. 005). In addition, this device reduced snoring {{to a greater extent than}} the thermoplastic device. The success rate was higher with the <b>custom-made</b> <b>device</b> (60 vs. 31 %; P = 0. 02). One-third of the patients demonstrated compliance failure with the thermoplastic device, mainly because of insufficient overnight retention. Total failure rate with the thermoplastic device was 69 %, whereas the majority (63 %) of these were successfully treated with the <b>custom-made</b> <b>device.</b> At the end of the study, 82 % of the patients preferred the <b>custom-made</b> <b>device,</b> and 9 % had no preference (P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: In this study, a <b>custom-made</b> <b>device</b> turned out to be more effective than a thermoplastic device in the treatment of SDB. Our results suggest that the thermoplastic device cannot be recommended as a therapeutic option nor can it be used as a screening tool to find good candidates for mandibular advancement therapy...|$|E

The PPT was measured at 3 different rates of pressure application on 3 occasions, 1 week apart. Data were evaluated with analysis of covariance and intraclass correlations. Results: The prototype device had linear output characteristics within the operational range. The mean PPT ranged from 18 to 44 g. The PPT appeared to increase approximately linearly with increasing rate of pressure application (P < 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences in}} the PPT on different experimental occasions. In individual subjects, the PPT was reliable and uniform.

MethodsA total of 439 consecutive orders for <b>custom-made</b> <b>devices</b> were analysed, and positions for potential fenestrations in the RFSG were determined, based on the most frequent anatomical target vessel variations: a fixed SMA scallop 12  mm deep at 12 : 00, RA fenestrations at 9 : 15, 10 : 15 (target within the range 8 : 45 – 10 : 45), 2 : 15 and 3 : 15 (target within the range 1 : 45 – 3 : 45), each either 19 or 28  mm from the graft edge (GE); (within the range 15 – 32  mm), and 6  ×  8  mm in diameter. Proximal diameters of 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 36  mm were chosen. ResultsOf the 439 plans, 372 standard juxtarenal (SJR) cases, defined by the inclusion of a scallop and 0, 1 or 2 small fenestrations (12 %, 13 % and 75 % of the cases, respectively) were identified and used to test the applicability of the model. Mean CP (clock position) for right RA was 9 : 30, for the left RA 3 : 00, being a mean of 21  ±  5 and 22  ±  5  mm, respectively from the GE. RA CP was within the RFSG range in 86 % (right) and 88 % (left) of the cases, with 96 % and 98 %, respectively, within the allowable distance from the GE.

Conversely a wide aortic neck was reported in 9; in 2 cases were employed <b>custom-made</b> <b>devices</b> and in 7 standard stent-graft. The use of EVAR with commercially available stent-grafts is feasible and it represents an option especially in non-elective setting...|$|R
40|$|Changes in multi-segment foot {{biomechanics}} with a heat-mouldable semi-custom {{foot orthotic}} device Reed Ferber 1, 2 * † and Brittany Benson 3 † Background: Semi-custom foot orthoses (SCO) {{are thought to be}} a cost-effective alternative to <b>custom-made</b> <b>devices.</b> However, previous biomechanical research involving either custom or SCO has only focused on rearfoot biomechanics. The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to determine changes in multi-segment foot biomechanics during shod walking with and without an SCO. We chose to investigate an SCO device that incorporates a heatmoulding process, to further understand if the moulding process would significantly alter rearfoot, midfoot, or shank kinematics as compared to a no-orthotic condition. We hypothesized the SCO, whether moulded or nonmoulded, would reduce peak rearfoot eversion, tibial internal rotation, arch deformation, and plantar fascia strain as compared to the no-orthoses condition. Methods: Twenty participants had retroreflective markers placed on the right limb to represent forefoot, midfoot, rearfoot and shank segments. 3 D kinematics were recorded using an 8 -camera motion capture system whil...|$|R
40|$|Usually, {{buildings}} with seismic isolation {{are designed to}} comply with an operational building performance level after strong earthquakes. This approach, however, may limit the use of seismic isolation for the seismic rehabilitation of existing {{buildings with}} low lateral strength or substandard details, because it often requires invasive strengthening measures in the superstructure {{or the use of}} expensive <b>custom-made</b> <b>devices.</b> In this paper, an alternative approach for the seismic rehabilitation of existing buildings with seismic isolation, based on the acceptance of limited plastic deformations in the superstructure under strong earthquakes, is proposed and then applied to a real case study, represented by a four-storey RC frame building. Nonlinear response-time histories analyses of an accurate model of the case-study building are carried out to evaluate the seismic performances of the structure, comparing different rehabilitation strategies with and without seismic isolation. Initial costs of the intervention and possible (future) repair costs are then estimated. Based on the results of this study, values of the behavior factor (i. e. response modification factor) higher than those adopted in the current codes for base-isolated buildings are tentatively proposed...|$|R
