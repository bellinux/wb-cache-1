25|$|Broadly, the XML rules {{require that}} all {{elements}} be closed, either by a separate <b>closing</b> <b>tag</b> or using self-closing syntax (e.g. <br/>), while HTML syntax permits some elements to be unclosed because either {{they are always}} empty (e.g. <input>) or their end can be determined implicitly ("omissibility", e.g. <p>).|$|E
25|$|XML {{has been}} used to {{describe}} structured data and to serialize objects. Various XML-based protocols exist to represent the same kind of data structures as JSON for the same kind of data interchange purposes. Data can be encoded in XML several ways. The most expansive form using tag pairs results in a much larger representation than JSON, but if data is stored in attributes and 'short tag' form where the <b>closing</b> <b>tag</b> is replaced with '/>', the representation is often about the same size as JSON or just a little larger. If the data is compressed using an algorithm like gzip, there is little difference because compression is good at saving space when a pattern is repeated.|$|E

500|$|... "Murder" [...] was {{directed}} by Daniels. Daniels particularly enjoyed directing both the cold open, {{as well as the}} <b>closing</b> <b>tag,</b> likening both to [...] "an action film". In regards to the latter, he referred to it as a sequence that director Quentin Tarantino would have thought up, and noted the importance of having the camera appear {{in the middle of the}} Mexican standoff to reveal Fischer. Wilson, Helms, and Carell enjoyed filming the scene, and were particularly exuberant when it came time to fake-kill each other. Several of the scenes, such as when Andy first asks Erin on a date, had to be re-shot so that the cameras were in more discreet places. Daniels later referred to these shots as [...] "spy shots". Initially, after Michael announces that [...] "there has been a murder", the show was supposed to have cut to a commercial break. However, the producers realized that this was too misleading, as it would have implied that a real homicide had taken place.|$|E

50|$|XML allows parsers to {{separate}} the process of interpreting the document syntax and its structure. In HTML and SGML, a parser needed to know certain rules about elements during parsing, such as what elements could be contained within other elements and which elements implicitly close the previous element. This is because in HTML and SGML, <b>closing</b> <b>tags</b> and even opening tags were optional on some elements. By requiring all elements to have explicit opening and <b>closing</b> <b>tags,</b> XML parsers can parse the document and produce a document tree without any knowledge of the document type. This allows parsers to be universal and very light-weight, and {{to be separated from}} the process of validating or interpreting the document.|$|R
5000|$|If proper XML {{validation}} {{is not an}} issue, and a file {{contains only}} PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP <b>closing</b> (...) <b>tag</b> {{at the end of}} the file.|$|E

Oxford brackets syntax [...] introduces an indentation based structured html template with '$' prefixed lines of logic statements (See doc.). Automatic <b>closing</b> <b>tags</b> are generated only for the tag at line start position.|$|R
5000|$|... xupl doesn't require <b>closing</b> <b>tags</b> {{at the end}} of the document. This {{facilitates}} limited streaming {{of content}} into a document. To facilitate terse documents and demonstrated by the HTML example above, one attribute name per tag (and per namespace) is optional for which the xupl parser will provide the default name.|$|R
2500|$|In SGML and derived {{languages}} such as HTML and XML, a slash {{is used in}} <b>closing</b> <b>tags.</b> For example, in HTML, <b> {{begins a}} section of bold text and </b> closes it.

50|$|The first example {{contains}} extra {{spaces in}} the <b>closing</b> <b>tag</b> of the first node. The second example, which has been canonicalized, has had these spaces removed. Note that only the spaces within the tags are removed under W3C canonicalization, not those between tags.|$|E
5000|$|For example, in an XML context, {{when the}} {{developer}} types an opening tag [...] "<" [...] he is offered {{a list of}} tags via autocomplete, contextualized following the DTD or XML schema of the document. As the developer types more letters, the offered choices are filtered to only retain the relevant completions. When the developer finally completes the tag, the editor automatically generates the <b>closing</b> <b>tag.</b>|$|E
50|$|Those are {{the main}} changes {{necessary}} to translate a document from XHTML 1.0 to HTML 4.01. To translate from HTML to XHTML would also require the addition of any omitted opening or <b>closing</b> <b>tags.</b> Whether coding in HTML or XHTML it may just be best to always include the optional tags within an HTML document rather than remembering which tags can be omitted.|$|R
5000|$|Like raw strings, {{there can}} be any number of equals signs between the square brackets, {{provided}} both the opening and <b>closing</b> <b>tags</b> have a matching number of equals signs; this allows nesting as long as nested block comments/raw strings use a different number of equals signs than their enclosing comment: [...] Lua discards the first newline (if present) that directly follows the opening tag.|$|R
5000|$|HTML markup {{consists}} of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like [...] and , although some represent empty elements {{and so are}} unpaired, for example [...] The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, {{and the second is}} the end tag (they are also called opening <b>tags</b> and <b>closing</b> <b>tags).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Runyon {{performed}} the narration, including a <b>closing</b> <b>tag</b> for each episode that memorably {{began with an}} astonished [...] "Well-l-l-l-l."

His big goal was to break us up at the ending and make us laugh." ...|$|E
5000|$|Weibo uses {{a format}} similar to its American {{counterpart}} Twitter, but used almost exclusively by Chinese language speakers; {{this has a}} direct impact on features such as hashtags on Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo, which both employ a double-hashtag [...] "#HashName#" [...] method, since the lack of spacing between Chinese characters necessitates a <b>closing</b> <b>tag.</b> Internet users can set up real-time information sharing communities individually, and upload and update information in 140 character blocks.|$|E
50|$|In China, microblogs Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo use a double-hashtag #HashName# format, {{since the}} lack of spacing between Chinese {{characters}} necessitates a <b>closing</b> <b>tag.</b> In contrast, when using Chinese characters (and orthographies with similar spacing conventions) on Twitter, users must insert spacing {{before and after the}} hashtagged element (e.g. '我 #爱 你' instead of '我#爱你') or insert a zero-width non-joiner character before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance, such as '我#爱你'.|$|E
50|$|YAML is line-oriented {{and thus}} it is often simple to convert the {{unstructured}} output of existing programs into YAML format while having them retain much of {{the look of the}} original document. Because there are no <b>closing</b> <b>tags,</b> braces, or quotation marks to balance, it is generally easy to generate well-formed YAML directly from distributed print statements within unsophisticated programs. Likewise, the whitespace delimiters facilitate quick-and-dirty filtering of YAML files using the line-oriented commands in grep, awk, perl, ruby, and python.|$|R
50|$|Malformed markup {{is arguably}} the most severe problem in web authoring. However, thanks to better {{education}} and information and perhaps with some help from XHTML, the issue of malformed markup is becoming less common. Browsers, when faced with malformed markup, must guess the intended meaning of the author. They must infer <b>closing</b> <b>tags</b> where they expect them and then infer opening tags to match other closing-tags. The interpretation can vary markedly from one browser to the next. Ian Hickson wrote a detailed article investigating the differences between how browsers handle tag soup.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nested words model {{data with}} both linear and {{hierarchical}} structure such as XML documents and program traces. A nested word is {{a sequence of}} positions together with a matching relation that con-nects open tags (calls) with the corresponding <b>close</b> <b>tags</b> (returns). Vis-ibly Pushdown Automata are a restricted class of pushdown automata that process nested words, and have many appealing theoretical proper-ties such as closure under Boolean operations and decidable equivalence. However, like any classical automata models, they are limited to finite alphabets. This limitation is restrictive for practical applications to both XML processing and program trace analysis, where values for individual symbols are usually drawn from an unbounded domain. With this mo-tivation, we introduce Symbolic Visibly Pushdown Automata (SVPA) as an executable model for nested words over infinite alphabets. In this model, transitions are labeled with first-order predicates over the input alphabet, analogous to symbolic automata processing strings over infi-nite alphabets. A key novelty of SVPAs {{is the use of}} binary predicates to model relations between open and <b>close</b> <b>tags</b> in a nested word. We show how SVPAs still enjoy the decidability and closure properties of Visibly Pushdown Automata. We use SVPAs to model XML validation policies and program properties that are not naturally expressible with previous formalisms and provide experimental results for our implementation. ...|$|R

The <b>closing</b> <b>tag</b> for Ubu Productions is a photograph of Ubu Roi with a flying disc in his mouth, taken in the Tuileries Garden close to the Louvre Museum in Paris. Along with the picture is Goldberg's voice saying [...] "Sit, Ubu, sit! Good dog!", followed {{by the sound of}} a bark. The dog was named after Alfred Jarry's 1896 play Ubu Roi, considered a precursor to the Theatre of the Absurd. Ubu the dog died in 1984.|$|E
50|$|In particular, unlike markup languages, {{chunks of}} {{consecutive}} YAML lines {{tend to be}} well-formed YAML documents themselves. This makes it very easy to write parsers {{that do not have}} to process a document in its entirety (e.g. balancing opening and <b>closing</b> <b>tags</b> and navigating quoted and escaped characters) before they begin extracting specific records within. This property is particularly expedient when iterating in a single, stateless pass, over records in a file whose entire data structure is too large to hold in memory, or for which reconstituting the entire structure to extract one item would be prohibitively expensive.|$|R
