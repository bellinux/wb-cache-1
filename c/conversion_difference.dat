The comparative study was based on 20 %Co- 0. 5 %Re/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, a space time {{in a range of}} 0. 0020 – 0. 0060 gcat·min/N·cm 3 and Reynolds number lower than 1. The base case model was set as a square cross-sectional area with a dimension of 0. 7 mm× 0. 7 mm and a length of 20 mm. It gave 22. 41 % of CO conversion. The simulation results showed that changing of aspect ratio induced a little effect to reaction performance. The maximum <b>conversion</b> <b>difference</b> was 7. 90 % resulted from the most shallow flow channel of 1. 225 mm × 0. 175 mm compared to the base case model. When increasing microchannel cross-sectional area to 1. 00 mm × 1. 00 mm, it gave negative effect on Fischer – Tropsch reaction performance, while reducing the cross-sectional area, to a 0. 300 mm × 0. 300 mm with the length of 50. 18 mm, it gave higher CO conversion and higher pressure drop when compared to other cases. Minimum channel length obtained from different cross-sectional area of microchannel were studied. The smaller cross-sectional area the shorter channel length was required.

The neat MCM- 41 material possessed a surface area comparable with other MCM- 41 materials prepared using more conventional higher temperature methods. Incorporating Al into the MCM- 41 framework increased support acidity while entrapping Na ions in the MCM- 41 pores lowered acidity. The neat MCM- 41, Na-form, and Al-incorporated MCM- 41 were impregnated with 2. 5, 5 and 10 % Ni and catalytic performance was assessed for CO₂ reforming of methane (CH₄). XRD, TEM and H₂-TPR indicated at low loadings the Ni was highly dispersed on the support, whereby increasing the Ni loading encouraged {{the formation of}} larger Ni crystals on the external MCM- 41 surface. 2. 5 % Ni catalysts supported on neat MCM- 41 exhibited excellent catalytic activity invoking up to 98 % CH₄ conversion at 800 ℃ and 26 % at 500 ℃.

40|$|Since the coke {{deposition}} on the inorganic oxide in {{the course}} of ODEB to styrene has been considered as the true catalytically active substance, various carbonaceous materials have shown to be active and selective catalysts for this reaction. It has been confirmed that oxygenated surface functional groups of catalyst, especially carbonyl/quinoid and hydroxyl groups, are responsible for the catalytic performance. Therefore, the focus in this study is in the creation of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of carbon nanotubes by partial oxidation using high potential oxidizing agents, including hydroxyl radicals, and ozone in gas phase followed by investigating the influences of these groups on the ODEB catalytic behavior. The effects of the oxidative treatment methods on the textural, structural and chemistry surface of MWCNTs, as well as comparative investigations on the catalysts before and after the ODEB have been conducted by using a series of analytical techniques including TGA, BET surface area, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, FTIR and XPS. It is found that as-received MWCNTs possessed a number of oxygenated surface groups, as a result of CVD method. Further oxidation treatment with highly active hydroxyl radicals generated via UV/H 2 O 2 process increased substantially the formation of oxygenated surface functional groups compared to as-received MWCNTs, particularly hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. Using hydrogen peroxide solutions with concentrations higher than 35 wt. % for the radical oxidation of MWCNTs did not enhance the surface oxygen content as expected. The effectiveness of the oxidation could be declined by the scavenging of radicals instead. As a result, the catalytic performance of UV/H 35 catalyst is better than that of UV/H 50 or UV/H 60. At 400 oC and molar ratio EB/O 2 of 1 : 1, ethylbenzene conversion and styrene selectivity of UV/H 35 catalyst achieved 47 % and 91 %, respectively, for several hours time on stream. The styrene yield of UV/H 35 is two times higher than that of as-received MWCNTs. Purification of as-received MWCNTs followed by ozone corona discharge oxidation of samples generated various oxygenated functional groups on the MWCNTs as identified by FT-IR. The surface oxygen content of the ozonated MWCNT increased significantly with increasing ozone concentration in gas flow, leading to highly stable ethylbenzene conversion and styrene selectivity reaching up to 80 and 92 %, respectively, at 450 oC, and EB/O 2 molar ratio of 1 : 2 in long-term experiments under conventional heating. That is the best result for the ODEB community {{to the best of our}} knowledge. The catalyst performance does not depend on the porosity of the MWCNTs. At the same reaction conditions (EB/O 2 molar ratio of 1 : 1, 400 °C), the catalytic activity/ selectivity of the MWCNTs treated with ozone is better than that of the MWCNTs oxidized with hydroxyl radicals. The catalytic performance is substantially affected by the supplied heating mode for the reaction. A comparative investigation on catalyst performance under conventional and microwave heating indicated that the <b>conversion</b> <b>difference</b> between both heating methods is negligible, but conventional heating results in higher styrene selectivity than the microwave-assisted process. Generally, coke deposit has been observed for all the tested catalysts after the ODEB. However, the extent of coke formation depends strongly the oxidative treatment of nanotubes. For conventional heating, an increase in coke weight incorporated with oxygenated groups has been occurred, while for microwave heating coke deposit has been observed but the oxygenated groups are reduced after the ODEB. This fact could be the reason for the lower selectivity under microwave heating. In order to investigate the contribution of carboxylic groups on the nanotubes to the catalytic behavior, Boehm’s titration has been employed. By selective neutralization of carboxylic groups on the MWCNTs with NaHCO 3 solution, and by comparison of the catalytic activity/selectivity with that of untreated samples, it has been shown that the styrene yield of neutralized MWCNTs is 16 % lower than that of non-neutralized catalysts. Examining both catalysts after the reaction indicated that oxygenated coke is not deposited on carboxylic neutralized MWCNTs after the reaction test. This result demonstrates that carboxylic surface groups improve the catalytic performance indirectly. After the ODEB reaction, it is found that an enhancement of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of MWCNTs, particularly hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, have been observed, suggesting that these oxygenated groups could be able to be the main active phases in the reaction...|$|E

The aim of this BA thesis is to focus on the strategies that have been used in translating the titles of American fiction into Czech since 1945. Attention is paid especially to the titles in which some kind of shift in comparison with the original version may be discerned. The work is divided into two parts; the introductory section is theoretical and concentrates on the general characterization of a title, on the way it is structured from the grammatical, formal and stylistic points of view, and on the functions that are attributed to book titles in general. In the following chapter, the standards expected to be fulfilled while translating a book title are described at first.

40|$|A key {{step in the}} {{substitution}} of a new organelle mutant throughout a population is the generation of germ-line cells homoplasmic for that mutant. Given that each cell typically contains multiple copies of organelles, each of which in turn contains multiple copies of the organelle genome, processes akin to drift and selection in a population are responsible for producing homoplasmic cells. This paper examines the expected substitution rate of new mutants by obtaining {{the probability that a}} new mutant is fixed throughout a cell, allowing for arbitrary rates of genome turnover within an organelle and organelle turnover within the cell, as well as (possibly biased) gene <b>conversion</b> and genetic <b>differences</b> in genome and/or organelle replication rates. Analysis is based on a variation of Moran's model for drift in a haploid population. One interesting result is that if the rate of unbiased conversion is sufficiently strong, it creates enough intracellular drift to overcome even strong differences in the replication rates of wild-type and mutant genomes. Thus, organelles with very high conversion rates are more resistant to intracellular selection based on differences in genome replication and/or degradation rates. It is found that the amount of genetic exchange between organelles within the cell greatly influences the probability of fixation. In the absence of exchange, biased gene <b>conversion</b> and/or <b>differences</b> in genome replication rates do not influence the probability of fixation beyond the initial fixation within a single organelle. With exchange, both these processes influence the probability of fixation throughout the entire cell. Generally speaking, exchange between organelles accentuates the effects of directional intracellular forces. Provided there is exchange among organelles, biparental inheritance further strengthens the role of directional intracellular forces in fixing the mutant throughout a population...|$|R
