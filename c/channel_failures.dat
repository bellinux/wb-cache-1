A new redundant array of independent memory (RAIM) technology is being introduced to provide protection at the dynamic random access memory (DRAM), dual inline memory module (DIMM), and memory channel level. Three full DRAM failures per rank can be corrected. DIMM level failures, including components such as the controller application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), the power regulators, the clocks, and the board, can be corrected. Memory <b>channel</b> <b>failures</b> such as signal lines, control lines, and drivers/receivers on the MCM can be corrected. Upstream and downstream data signals can be spared using two spare wires on both the upstream and downstream paths. One of these signals can be used to spare a clock signal line (one upstream and one downstream). Together these improvements are designed to deliver System z's most resilient memory subsystem to date.|$|E
