40|$|An ad hoc {{network is}} a rapidly {{deployable}} wireless network {{that has no}} centralized <b>control</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Mobile <b>devices</b> in an ad hoc network request a variety of data types, including text and multimedia data. Different types of data need {{to be treated with}} different qualities of service. The implementation of service differentiation in wireless networks is very difficult because of device mobility and wireless channel contention. A backoff algorithm is used for resolving contention. Modification of the conventional backoff algorithm allows the design of several classes of flows. This paper specifies three types of flow classes: gold, silver, and bronze. Simulation results illustrate that the gold class flows receive almost up to their requested target bandwidth and the silver class flows are treated with reasonably high bandwidth allocation compared to the bronze class flows...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{promote the}} use of {{multihop}} networking {{in the context of}} large-scale Internet of Things (IoT). Recognizing concerns related to the scalability of classical multihop routing and medium access techniques, we advocate {{the use of}} blind cooperation in conjunction with multihop communications. However, we show that blind cooperation is actually inefficient unless power control is applied. Inefficiency in this paper is projected in terms of the transport rate normalized to energy consumption. To that end, we propose an uncoordinated power <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> whereby each <b>device</b> in a blind cooperative cluster randomly adjusts its transmit power level. We derive an upper bound on the mean transmit power that must be observed at each device. We also devise a practical <b>mechanism</b> for each <b>device</b> to infer about the size of its neighborhood; a requirement necessary for the operation of the power control scheme. Finally, we assess the performance of the developed power <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> and demonstrate how it consistently outperforms the point-to-point case...|$|R

40|$|This work {{shows that}} {{scalable}} video techniques {{together with a}} <b>controlling</b> <b>mechanism</b> for a <b>device</b> that receives and decodes video data provide a solution to some challenges posed by in-home networks. The challenges are resource limitations of devices (processor, memory, etc) and network (bandwidth). Additionally, a wireless network usually has bandwidth fluctuations that consecutively lead to rapid throughput fluctuations. These rapid changes severely reduce the quality of viewing as perceived by an end user. We developed a controller that optimizes user-perceived quality when looking at available input data and available processing power. The quality is optimized by smoothening the quality fluctuations and avoiding deadline misses. The strategy used by the controller is created offline {{by means of a}} Markov decision proces...|$|R

40|$|Emissions from {{processes}} {{with control}} devices must be determined {{as part of}} development of a point source emission inventory. There are many difficulties in this determination. Single pollutant emissions are, in reality, actually heterogeneous combinations. All oxides of nitrogen must be reported together as NO 2. Devices control the individual constituents differently and this may affect the emission rate on a throughput or time basis. <b>Mechanisms</b> of <b>control</b> for different devices also vary for the same emission. Different emission control devices may have very different removal mechanisms. Collection by some types of devices can be characterized by efficiency.

40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} {{presence of}} Linux implemen-tations in embedded devices (mobile handsets, set-top boxes, headless computing devices, medical equip-ments, etc.), {{there is a}} strong demand for defining the security requirements and augmenting, enhancing, and hardening the operating environment. Currently an estimated 70 % of new semiconductor devices are Linux-enabled; such a high growth is accompanied by inevitable security risks, hence the requirement for hardware-based trusted and secure computing environ-ment, enhanced with MAC (Mandatory Access <b>Control)</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for such <b>devices</b> in order to provide appro-priate levels of protection. Due to stringent security re-quirements for resource-constrained embedded devices, establishing trust-chain on hardware root of trust, and deploying MAC mechanisms to balance performance and control are particularly challenging tasks.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma thesis was to {{implement}} a service, which allows users to save and share data at a remote location. In the implementation, we focused on user experience. For a good user experience, {{it is very important}} that user can manage files in the same way as he is accustomed to dealing with local files. 	If a whole system allowing a service is not fully connected, unavailability and/or inconsistency may appear. That problem is further discussed in the context of CAP theorem, which says, that it is impossible to reach high availability together with atomic consistency in the presence of network partitions. 	 	We discuss two ways of file access control. Rights for file access are stored together with a user as a capability list and with files as an access control list. Access <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on local <b>devices</b> don't cause many problems. However, problems may appear, when different devices using different implementations of access <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> connect among themselves. In such cases it is difficult to assure effective access control that would be compatible with both devices. 	 	We describe some examples of service implementation solution, but none of them is ideal. Problems mainly occur in access <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In the NFS solution, client with root access can get arbitrary UID, which makes it capable to access any file. Other three solutions use their own implementation of access <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> with the exception of Git. The latter in final implementation also uses its own implementation of access <b>control</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Discussed systems using their own implementation of access <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> only allow management through a web interface. 	 	We present two examples of service implementation. In both, we succeed meeting all suitability criteria as we defined them. Services that we implemented are useful. We have chosen clients that maintain local copies of files, since they don't always have internet connectivity. This way we made files available even during network partition. However, we had to accept a possibility for some degree of inconsistency, which may appear while using service. In case of full connectivity, we can also achieve good consistency of files. At the end there still remains one important question, how to manage access rights from the file system of user device and not indirectly, using separate mechanism...|$|R

Therefore, an anticipated increase of usage of zero carbon technologies in new and existing building has led to the emergence of passive ventilation devices as an alternative to mechanical ventilation and air conditioning. The windvent is a commercially available passive ventilation device. The device is constructed from sheet metal and works on the principle of pressure differential. Whereby air rises, creating a low pressure in the receiving room, which then draws in the fresh air. The ensuing air delivery velocity is controlled by the dampers, installed at the room entry interface. The dampers are actuator operated, and form the basis of the control system for the device. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the <b>device</b> and ascertain an optimum operating range.

The operating range when considered in tandem with macro climatic influences is central to determining the overall control strategy for the fresh air supply.
