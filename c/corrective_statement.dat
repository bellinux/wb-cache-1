5000|$|Townshend {{was well}} treated by his Ottoman captors. He was transported to Istanbul {{where he was}} {{quartered}} in comfort {{for the remainder of}} the war on the island of Heybeliada in the Sea of Marmara before being transferred over to the island of Prinkipo (now Büyükada, Turkey). During his time in Istanbul, Townshend became friends with General Enver Pasha, the Ottoman minister of war who treated him as an honoured guest. Enver spoke no English while Townshend spoke no Turkish, but they were both fluent in French, and in that language they held their conversations in. Townshend was quoted in Ottoman newspapers as saying he was pleased to be [...] "the honored quest of Enver Pasha's nation" [...] (a statement that he did not deny making after the war). Townshend was given use of a Turkish naval yacht, and took part in receptions held in his honour at the Sultan's palace. Whilst still in captivity in 1917 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) by the British Government. The German newspaper editor Friedrich Schrader reported that Townshend appeared personally in the Istanbul offices of his newspaper Osmanischer Lloyd to receive the cable from London announcing the award. About Townshend's behaviour in Constantinople, Dixon commented: [...] "Underneath the agreeable veneer lay a fatal flaw that showed itself in a ravenous, self-destructive hunger for popular acclaim. Through its origins remain obscure, Townshend gave the impression of a man who at some time had suffered traumatic damage to his self-esteem, which resulted in an everlasting need to be loved" [...] Townshend tried very hard to get his wife Alice to join him in his captivity, writing that he being allowed to live in an English-style country house, the Villa Hampson on the island of Prinkipo in the Sea of Marmara, telling her how very happy he would be if she were to join him on Prinkipo. Alice Townshend refused her husband's invitations, and presciently warned him that the impression that he was enjoying his captivity too much would not help his image in Britain. In contrast to the fate of his men dying in POW camps in Anatolia, the most damaging event to Townshend that occurred during his captivity was in 1917 when he learned that his first cousin had fathered a son, which meant that Townshend would not inherit the title of marquess or Raynham Hall after all, news that he took very badly. During the First World War, the Ottoman state waged genocidal campaigns against the Armenian and Assyrian minorities, which attracted much unfavorable publicity around the world. The favourable treatment of Townshend was largely because he served the public relations needs of the Ottoman state as Enver cannily manipulated Townshend's obsessive need to have the great and mighty pay attention to him for his own advantage. Townshend's willingness to praise Enver Pasha in public for his generous hospitality and to issue press statements attacking the British for alleged mistreatment of Ottoman POWs in Egypt served to distract attention from what the Ottomans were doing to the Armenians and Assyrians. At the war's end Townshend, as the most senior British imperial official in Istanbul at that moment, was involved in the negotiations for the Ottoman Empire's military surrender to the British Empire's advancing Egyptian Expeditionary Force in October 1918. Townshend's claim made on his return to Britain that the entire Armistice of Mudros was all his work led to an annoyed Field Marshal Edmund Allenby to issue a <b>corrective</b> <b>statement</b> saying that Townshend did indeed play a role in negotiating the Armistice of Mudros, but he had greatly exaggerated his role by claiming that the armistice was all his work.|$|E
40|$|After reading {{articles}} in yesterday's papers reporting alleged statements of President Avila Camacho, Ezequiel Padilla called on President {{and pointed out}} to him the repercussions publication of such alleged remarks would have; President authorized Padilla to make <b>corrective</b> <b>statement,</b> but after reflection Padilla decided correction {{would be much better}} coming from President himself; Padilla suggested that Messersmith call on President early next week and express his concern over the statements; must recognize that President, while a wise and sound man, and very friendly to U.

40|$|Human-caused {{climate change}} is happening; nearly all climate {{scientists}} are convinced of this basic fact according to surveys of experts and reviews of the peer-reviewed literature. Yet, among the American public, there is widespread misunderstanding of this scientific consensus. In this paper, we report results from two experiments, conducted with national samples of American adults, that tested messages designed to convey {{the high level of}} agreement in the climate science community about human-caused climate change. The first experiment tested hypotheses about providing numeric versus non-numeric assertions concerning the level of scientific agreement. We found that numeric statements resulted in higher estimates of the scientific agreement. The second experiment tested the effect of eliciting respondents ’ estimates of scientific agreement prior to presenting them with a state-ment about the level of scientific agreement. Participants who estimated the level of agree-ment prior to being shown the <b>corrective</b> <b>statement</b> gave higher estimates of the scientific consensus than respondents who were not asked to estimate in advance, indicating that incorporating an “estimation and reveal ” technique into public communication about scien-tific consensus may be effective. The interaction of messages with political ideology was also tested, and demonstrated that messages were approximately equally effective among liberals and conservatives. Implications for theory and practice are discussed...|$|E
5000|$|The {{language}} of the <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> was not finalized until June 2017.  Still at issue is whether the court can order the <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> be posted at retail establishments - or the “point-of-sale” (“POS”) - for tobacco products.|$|R

50|$|In 2012, Judge Kessler {{released}} specific {{language for}} the five <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> based on proposals submitted by all parties after the 2009 DC Circuit ruling. The tobacco companies were ordered to make the <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> through television and newspaper advertising, on their websites, and on cigarette packaging. In a series of subsequent appeals, defendants challenged the language proposed by the court, claiming that portions of the selected text violated their First Amendment rights and were intended to humiliate them and disclose prior wrongdoing rather than prevent and restrain future RICO violations. These appeals resulted in modifications {{to the language of}} proposed statements.|$|R
50|$|The {{trial record}} {{established}} that defendants had made false, deceptive, and misleading public statements about cigarettes, {{and the court}} found that an injunction ordering them to issue <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> is appropriate and necessary to prevent and restrain them from making fraudulent public statements on smoking and health matters in the future.|$|R
40|$|In 1999, the Federal Government {{sued the}} tobacco {{companies}} {{in an attempt to}} recover expenses used to treat diseases caused by smoking. The 2006 verdict required the dissemination of <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> intended to inform the public of the dangers of smoking. This study analyzes smokers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of these statements. Statements were tested from November 5 to December 5, 2007. Results indicate: (1) messages created by public health intervenors and tobacco companies tended to have higher mean scores than those created by the DOJ, (2) statements on nicotine being addictive had significantly higher mean scores than the other two sets tested, (3) that all statements were rated higher in terms of believability than in terms of other factors, and (4) light smokers rated statements higher in terms of motivating and likelihood to quit than did medium or heavy smokers. These results will be used to refine the development of <b>corrective</b> <b>statements...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Judge Kessler {{ordered the}} tobacco {{companies}} to make <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> on five topics about which they had historically deceived and misled the public. The specific language of these statements {{was not included in}} the 2006 ruling, but the parties were to submit proposals for approval by the court. The tobacco companies appealed to the DC Circuit, challenging the corrective-disclosure remedy under both RICO and the First Amendment.|$|R
5000|$|Judge Kessler ordered {{defendants}} to make <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> about: (1) addiction, (2) {{the adverse}} health effects of smoking), (3) the {{adverse health effects}} of exposure to second-hand smoke, (4) the manipulation of the cigarettes to enhance nicotine delivery, and (5) {{the health benefits of}} “light” and “low tar” cigarettes. Defendants were required to publish these statements in newspapers and disseminate them through television, advertisements, onsets, in retail displays, and on their corporate websites.|$|R
40|$|Positive reinforcement, in {{the form}} of praise, {{is one of the most}} {{powerful}} tools used in effective programming by classroom staff for all types of educational environments. It is not only important for staff to use praise but to also specify the behavior for which the praise is being given. Increasing behavior specific praise in different educational settings was the aim of this current study. Two settings were observed in which a MotivAider tactile prompting device was worn. This device prompted the teacher and one instructional assistant to provide behavior specific praise once every minute during a 10 minute session. The researcher recorded the frequency of behavior specific praise, non-behavior specific praise and <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> delivered to students by each participant. It was discovered that using the MotivAider increased the amount of behavior specific praise delivered by all staff members whilst they were receiving the prompt themselves. It was also demonstrated that some participants reacted to the other participant???s increased frequency of praise, in that setting, when they themselves were not receiving the tactile prompt. A third finding was that an increase in the frequency of praise statements did not result in a decrease in the frequency of <b>corrective</b> <b>statements...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{comply with}} the court 2 ̆ 7 s ruling in U. S. v. Philip Morris USA Inc., tobacco {{companies}} must fund a large advertising campaign to 2 ̆ 7 correct 2 ̆ 7 smoking beliefs about which consumers may have been misled {{as a result of}} past deceptive practices of tobacco companies. The authors use an ad copy experiment to examine (1) the effects of different versions of <b>corrective</b> ad <b>statements</b> that plaintiff intervenors submitted to the court on multi-item belief measures and (2) the impact of the ad versions and beliefs on general attitudes toward smoking across current adult smokers and nonsmokers. The tested ad versions include a copy-only control condition, a copy-with-graphic-visual condition, and a version with a potentially distracting visual. The results indicate that the <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> in advertisements can {{have a positive effect on}} antismoking beliefs of focal interest in the case and that the test advertisements affect some beliefs more strongly than others. The authors discuss potential policy implications and limitations and provide suggestions for further research...|$|R
25|$|Stokes was {{the oldest}} of the trio of natural philosophers, James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin being the other two, who {{especially}} contributed to the fame of the Cambridge school of mathematical physics {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. Stokes's original work began about 1840, and from that date onwards the great extent of his output was only less remarkable than the brilliance of its quality. The Royal Society's catalogue of scientific papers gives the titles of over a hundred memoirs by him published down to 1883. Some of these are only brief notes, others are short controversial or <b>corrective</b> <b>statements,</b> but many are long and elaborate treatises.|$|R
5000|$|The DC Circuit {{upheld the}} <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> as a valid remedy in 2009, finding that {{requiring}} defendants {{to reveal the}} previously hidden truth about their products will prevent and restrain them from disseminating false and misleading statements, thereby violating RICO, in the future. However, the statements must be confined to purely factual and uncontroversial information, intended to thwart efforts to either directly mislead consumers or capitalize on prior deceptions by continuing to advertise {{in a manner that}} builds on consumers’ existing misperceptions. The DC Circuit also vacated a requirement that the statements be published on retail displays, instructing the District Court to consider the third-party implications of this remedy on remand.|$|R
60|$|In {{the short}} {{review of the}} present state of English Art, given you last year, I left {{necessarily}} many points untouched, and others unexplained. The seventh lecture, which I did not think it necessary to read aloud, furnished you with some of the <b>corrective</b> <b>statements</b> of which, whether spoken or not, it was extremely desirable that you should estimate the balancing weight. These I propose in the present course farther to illustrate, and to arrive with you at, I hope, a just--you would not wish it to be a flattering--estimate of the conditions of our English artistic life, past and present, in order that with due allowance for them we may determine, with some security, what {{those of us who have}} faculty ought to do, and those who have sensibility, to admire.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of consumer involvement and different types of deceptive claims on the formation and correction of brand beliefs. ^ A sample of 328 students at Arizona State University participated in the experiment. Subjects received multiple exposures of deceptive ads containing (1) objective and subjective claims, or (2) subjective claims. The experimental advertisements and other commercials were embedded in a situation comedy television program. Two days later receivers were treated with a similar television program containing corrective advertisements, or identical ads (innocuous) which did not contain the <b>corrective</b> <b>statements.</b> Subjects 2 ̆ 7 brand beliefs and involvement in the relevant product class were measured after each treatment, or only after the second TV program containing the corrective or innocuous ads. By varying the nature of the treatment stimuli and using both single and repeated measures, the distinct effects of different types of deceptive claims, consumer involvement, and corrective ads could be isolated. The research design also provided the means to control for the effects of forgetting, additional brand advertisements, and the test effect. ^ The results indicate that involvement and the nature of the deceptive claim influence the extent to which consumers accept deceptive messages. However, only involvement not the type of false claim, affects the degree to which receiver beliefs are altered by corrective advertisements. Specifically, more involved receivers possessed higher level brand beliefs than did less involved subjects after viewing deceptive ads. Furthermore, after subsequent corrective ad exposures the beliefs of more involved receivers were lower than the beliefs of the less involved. The beliefs of subjects exposed to deceptive ads containing objective and subjective claims were higher than those of receivers viewing subjective messages. However, no post-correction belief differences were observed between the two groups. ...|$|R
