40|$|Abstract - Phased-Arrays are {{increasingly}} used, and require Silicon implementations {{to result in}} affordable multi-beam systems. In this paper, CMOS implementations of two novel analogue beamforming multi-channel receivers will be presented. A narrow-band highly linear system exploiting switches and capacitors in advanced CMOS is presented, implementing a fully passive switched capacitor vector modulator exploiting a zero-IF I/Q mixer. This technique is not applicable to very wideband phased-array receivers. These systems require true-time delay beamforming, which is implemented in the second CMOS implementation. An innovative gm-RC implementation of a truetime delay cell is exploited in a four-channel beamforming receiver with more than 1. 5 GHz bandwidth, in a standard 0. 13 urn CMOS process. Professional phased-arrays <b>can</b> often <b>not</b> <b>live</b> with the dynamic range limitations imposed by these implementations. To that end a SiGe implementation of an integrated receiver was realized targeting a digital beamforming phased-array. Dynamic range and flexibility of use were the main driving factors. Alltogether, these results show large progress {{with respect to the}} feasibility of Silicon-based phased-array frontend implementation for commercial as well as professional phased-arrays...|$|R

And though a strong man may sometimes succeed in strangling such tormenting memories; yet, if in the beginning permitted to encroach upon him unchecked, the same man shall, in the end, become as an idiot. With a continent and an ocean between him and his wife--thus sundered from her, by whatever imperative cause, for a term of long years;--the husband, if passionately devoted to her, and by nature broodingly sensitive of soul, is wise to forget her till he embrace her again;--is wise never to remember her if he hear of her death.

It is a central topic every time we turn on the radio, TV, almost every time we go to a film or watch a documentary. Fear is becoming less an emotional state than it is an operational state; we are living and working against a backdrop of fear.

How <b>can</b> we <b>not</b> <b>live</b> in fear?

During this fieldwork I have been reflecting on fear itself, or more specifically, on the options available to agents who are reacting to fear.

In this paper I am going to outline what it means to fight against one of these fear sets that I have listed above. Fear, when it is dealt with in a fight, becomes a struggle.
