50|$|The liquid-ammonia-procedure was {{developed}} by Commodore/KiON for polysilazane synthesis. It calls for adding <b>chlorosilane</b> or <b>chlorosilane</b> mixtures simultaneously to an excess of liquid ammonia. The resulting ammonium chloride dissolves in the liquid ammonia and phase separates from the polysilazane. Two immiscible liquids form. This allows for the simple isolation of pure polysilazane from the liquid ammonia/ammonium chloride solution. The patented procedure is used today by AZ Electronic Materials {{in the manufacture of}} polysilazanes.|$|E
5000|$|Corriu and {{coworkers}} performed early work characterizing reactions thought to proceed through a hypervalent transition state. [...] Measurements {{of the reaction}} rates of hydrolysis of tetravalent chlorosilanes incubated with catalytic amounts of water returned a rate that is first order in <b>chlorosilane</b> and second order in water. This indicated that two water molecules interacted with the silane during hydrolysis and from this a binucleophilic reaction mechanism was proposed. Corriu {{and coworkers}} then measured the rates of hydrolysis {{in the presence of}} nucleophilic catalyst HMPT, DMSO or DMF. It was shown that the rate of hydrolysis was again first order in <b>chlorosilane,</b> first order in catalyst and now first order in water. Appropriately, the rates of hydrolysis also exhibited a dependence on the magnitude of charge on the oxygen of the nucleophile.|$|E
50|$|Organic <b>chlorosilanes</b> are {{frequently}} used as coatings for silicon and glass surfaces, {{and in the}} production of silicone (polysiloxane) polymers. While phenyl <b>chlorosilanes</b> and many others can be used, methylsiloxanes are produced in the greatest quantities.|$|R

50|$|In the cited {{example the}} Lewis acid TiCl4 is used. First, the Lewis acid {{activates}} the aldehyde component followed by carbon-carbon bond formation between the enol silane and the activated aldehyde.With {{the loss of}} a <b>chlorosilane</b> the compound 1 is built. The desired product, a racemate of 2 and 3, is obtained by aqueous work-up.|$|E
50|$|All chlorosilanes {{react with}} water to produce {{hydrogen}} chloride. The remaining hydroxyl group bonds to the silicon, initially forming a silanol group (analogous to alcohol). In general, this will eventually bond to a solid oxide surface or react with another <b>chlorosilane</b> or silol molecule. In the latter cases, the oxygen atom forms a link between two silicon atoms, analogous to the ether linkage in organic chemicals, and identical to the bonding in silicon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|If {{hexamethyldisilazane}} (HMDS) {{is used as}} a nitrogen source {{instead of}} ammonia, transamination takes place. The chlorine atoms liberated from the <b>chlorosilane</b> are tied to the trimethylsilyl groups of HMDS so that no chlorine-containing solid salts are formed. This procedure was used by Dow Corning to manufacture the hydridopolysilazane HPZ.Numerous additional procedures for the synthesis of Si-N based polymers have been described in the literature (for example a dehydrogenation coupling between Si-H and N-H or ring-opening polymerizations) but none are currently employed commercially.|$|E
40|$|The {{dissociation}} of <b>chlorosilanes</b> to silicon and its deposition on a solid substrate in a RF plasma of {{mixtures of}} argon and hydrogen were investigated {{as a function}} of the macrovariables of the plasma. The dissociation mechanism of <b>chlorosilanes</b> and HCl as well as the formation of Si in the plasma state were studied by sampling the plasma with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Macrovariables such as pressure, net RF power input and locations in the plasma reactor strongly influence the kinetics of dissociation. The deposition process of microcrystalline silicon films and its chlorine contamination were correlated to the dissociation mechanism of <b>chlorosilanes</b> and HCl...|$|R

5000|$|Silanols are {{generally}} synthesized by hydrolysis of halosilanes, alkoxysilanes, or aminosilanes. <b>Chlorosilanes</b> {{are the most}} common reactants: ...|$|R
5000|$|One common {{approach}} to the arm-first synthesis is through anionic polymerization methods. This involves using [...] "arms" [...] that are anionic and reacting them with a core containing deactivating groups for the arms to react with. The deactivating groups on the core are often chlorosilanes, chlorine leaving groups, or deactivating alkenes. <b>Chlorosilane</b> derivatives serve as especially reactive cores, and can react quantitatively (or very close to quantitatively) with carbanion living polymers; this reaction involves carbanions performing electrophilic substitution with the Si-Cl groups (as shown in the below figure). In a case like this, the resulting arms are all homogeneous and can be well-characterized, and the core can also be well-characterized, leading to a well-characterized star-shaped polymer. Since both the core and the arms are rather reactive, essentially all Si-Cl undergo electrophilic substitution, and the resulting star-shaped polymers thus have a rather narrow polydispersity index.|$|E
50|$|Like all polymers, polysilazanes {{are built}} {{from one or}} several basic monomer units. Linking {{together}} of these basic units can result in polymeric chains, rings or three-dimensionally crosslinked macromolecules {{with a wide range}} of molecular mass. While the monomer unit describes the chemical composition and the connectivity of the atoms (coordination sphere) it does not illustrate the macro-molecular structure.In polysilazanes, each silicon atom is bound to two nitrogen atoms and each nitrogen atom to at least two silicon atoms (three bonds to silicon atoms are also possible). If all remaining bonds are with hydrogen atoms, perhydropolysilazane H2Si-NH results (proposed structure is shown to the right). In organopolysilazanes, at least one organic substituent is bound to the silicon atom. The amount and type of organic substituents have a predominant influence on the macro-molecular structure of polysilazanes.Silazane copolymers are normally produced from ammonolyses of <b>chlorosilane</b> mixtures. In this chemical reaction, different chlorosilanes react at similar rates so that the monomers are statistically distributed in the copolymer.|$|E
5000|$|Molecular vapor {{deposition}} [...] is the gas-phase reaction between surface reactive {{chemicals and}} an appropriately receptive surface. Often bi-functional silanes {{are used in}} which one termination of the molecule is reactive. For example, a functional <b>chlorosilane</b> (R-Si-Cl3) can react with surface hydroxyl groups (-OH) resulting a radicalized (R) deposition on the surface. The advantage of a gas phase reaction over a comparable liquid phase process is the control of moisture from the ambient environment, which often results in cross polymerization of the silane leading to particulates on the treated surface. Often a heated sub-atmospheric vacuum chamber is used to allow precise control of the reactants and water content. Additionally the gas phase process allows for easy treatment of complex parts since {{the coverage of the}} reactant is generally diffusion limited. Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors often use molecular vapor deposition as a technique to address stiction and other parasitic issues relative to surface-to-surface interactions.|$|E

Variations of the <b>chlorosilane</b> flow under fixed conditions of gas composition, temperature and pressure resulted in growth rates between 4 to 20 µm/hr. Fixing the <b>chlorosilane</b> flow rate to achieve a growth rate of approximately 4 µm/hr, the effects of temperature, pressure and gas composition on background dopant incorporation, epitaxial layer uniformity and epitaxial defect generation were investigated.

Over the course of eight years, Dow Corning constructed and operated a pilot plant, a small scale commercial plant, and a full scale plant. The process reacts DPR with hydrogen and <b>chlorosilane</b> monomers at high temperature and high pressure. The process converted 85 % of the DPR to valuable <b>chlorosilane</b> monomers such as dimethyldichlorosilane and methyldichlorosilane. When feeding methyltrichlorosilane, the process converted 30 % of the MeSiCl 3 to other monomers. Alternate co-feed monomers were tested.

50|$|The {{synthesis}} of polyorganosilazanes was first described in 1964 by Krüger and Rochow. By reacting ammonia with <b>chlorosilanes</b> (ammonolysis), trimeric or tetrameric cyclosilazanes were formed initially and further reacted at high temperatures with a catalyst to yield higher molecular weight polymers. Ammonolysis of <b>chlorosilanes</b> still represents {{the most important}} synthetic pathway to polysilazanes. The industrial manufacture of <b>chlorosilanes</b> using the Müller-Rochow process, first reported in the 1940s, served as the cornerstone {{for the development of}} silazane chemistry. In the 1960s, the first attempts to transform organosilicon polymers into quasi-ceramic materials were described. At this time, suitable (“pre-ceramic”) polymers heated to 1000°C or higher were shown to split off organic groups and hydrogen and, in the process, the molecular network is rearranged to form amorphous inorganic materials that show both unique chemical and physical properties. Using polymer derived ceramics (PDCs), new application areas can be opened, especially in the area of high performance materials. The most important pre-ceramic polymers are polysilanes R^1R^2Si-R^1R^2Si_\mathit{n}, polycarbosilanes R^1R^2Si-CH2_\mathit{n}, polysiloxanes R^1R^2Si-O_\mathit{n} and polysilazanes R^1R^2Si-NR^3_\mathit{n}.|$|R

40|$|The high {{thermodynamic}} {{stability of}} titanium oxides formed as the inorganic byproducts in McMurrytype reactions {{has so far}} prevented {{the development of a}} catalytic procedure for such reductive carbonyl coupling processes. Similarly, a tightly bound oxide layer passivates the surface of commercial titanium, which is unreactive toward organic substrates under conventional conditions. This paper outlines a way to overcome both of these problems. Thus, oxoamides 1 a-h can be reductively cyclized to indoles 2 a-h using only catalytic amounts of low-valent titanium if the reaction is carried out {{in the presence of a}} <b>chlorosilane.</b> Specifically, the method is based upon the in situ generation of an activated titanium species from TiCl 3 and Zn in the presence of the substrate, followed by regeneration of titanium chloride from the titanium oxides formed via ligand exchange with the admixed <b>chlorosilane.</b> Its proper choice is crucial for obtaining both good turnover numbers and clean conversions. Depending on the product structure, (TMS) Cl, ClMe 2 SiCH 2 CH 2 SiMe 2 Cl (5), or ClMe 2 Si(CH 2) 3 CN (6) was found to be best suited. Similarly, chlorosilanes also effect the activation of commercial titanium powder which may then be used as a performant off-the-shelf reagent for various types of carbonyl and acetal coupling reactions, for the deoxygenation of epoxides and for the reductive cyclization of oxoamides or oxoesters to indoles, benzofurans, and 2 -quinolones. Under these conditions retinal can be reductively dimerized to ß-carotene in good yield. Moreover, the titanium/chlorosilane reagent combination exhibits a strong template effect, allowing macrocyclization reactions without recourse to high dilution. Up to 36 -membered rings have been closed in that way. 29 Si NMR studies provide some insight into the elementary steps responsible for the degradation of the surface oxide layer on titanium by the <b>chlorosilane.</b> The effect of Lewis acid additives on the course of the coupling processes is discussed...|$|E
