5|$|Azotobacter <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Some trees {{such as the}} alders (Alnus species) have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive. The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.|$|E

Caelius Aurelianus (acut. 3, 16, 134) allows us to narrow the possible date further, by naming him as a friend of Tullius Bassus, who is cited by Scribonius Largus (121); since Scribonius wrote in the early to mid 40s, this should narrow his period to before 40 A.D.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} {{begins as}} tidal flats gain elevation relative to sea level by sediment accretion, and subsequently the rate {{and duration of}} tidal flooding decreases so that vegetation can colonize on the exposed surface. The arrival of propagules of pioneer species such as seeds or rhizome portions are combined {{with the development of}} suitable conditions for their germination and establishment in the process of colonisation. When rivers and streams arrive at the low gradient of the tidal flats, the discharge rate reduces and suspended sediment settles onto the tidal flat surface, helped by the backwater effect of the rising tide. Mats of filamentous blue-green algae <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> silt and clay sized sediment particles to their sticky sheaths on contact which can also increase the erosion resistance of the sediments. This assists the process of sediment accretion to allow colonising species (e.g.,Salicornia spp.) to grow. These species retain sediment washed in from the rising tide around their stems and leaves and form low muddy mounds which eventually coalesce to form depositional terraces, whose upward growth is aided by a sub-surface root network which binds the sediment. Once vegetation is established on depositional terraces further sediment trapping and accretion can allow rapid upward growth of the marsh surface such that there is an associated rapid decrease in the depth and duration of tidal flooding. As a result, competitive species that prefer higher elevations relative to sea level can inhabit the area and often a succession of plant communities develops.|$|E

500|$|... "Fix a Heart" [...] is a pop piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I just ran out of bandaids / I don't even know where to start / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never really <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a little piece of it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things that make you happy".|$|E

For instance, Lang said that a crooked NBA referee <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus. When a game is being fixed, Lang said, the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future.

After this, the hashtag #DemiLovatoFeatSamSmith became a trending topic on the website.

500|$|Nitrogenase is {{the most}} {{important}} enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation. Azotobacter species have several types of nitrogenase. The basic one is molybdenum-iron nitrogenase. An alternative type contains vanadium; it is independent of molybdenum ions and is more active than the Mo-Fe nitrogenase at low temperatures. So it <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> nitrogen at temperatures as low as 5°C, and its low-temperature activity is 10 times higher than that of Mo-Fe nitrogenase. An important role in maturation of Mo-Fe nitrogenase plays the so-called P-cluster. Synthesis of nitrogenase is controlled by the nif genes. Nitrogen fixation is regulated by the enhancer protein NifA and the [...] "sensor" [...] flavoprotein NifL which modulates the activation of gene transcription of nitrogen fixation by redox-dependent switching. This regulatory mechanism, relying on two proteins forming complexes with each other, is uncommon for other systems.|$|E
