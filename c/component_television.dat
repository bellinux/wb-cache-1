For example, a <b>component</b> <b>television</b> system is a monitor, tuner and speakers sold separately and which can be integrated into a single system. The <b>component</b> <b>television</b> form factor began in 1980 (but became notable in 1982) with Sony's ProFeel television line and became a design fad with many manufacturers until the late 1980s.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, RCA responded to {{increased}} demand for <b>component</b> <b>televisions</b> with monitor capabilities by adding composite and S-video inputs to the Colortrak lineup. These inputs allowed owners to easily connect a stereo audio/video source, like a Video Cassette Recorder, LaserDisc player, or with use of an RCA SelectaVision CED videodisc players to the television. For example, early composite video-equipped RCA sets were to coincidentally be tuned to Non-broadcast channel 91 to display a composite video signal, if a set was equipped {{with more than one}} input, subsequent inputs are designated to channels 92 to 95, which are usually accessed from the remote control. However, when manufactures learned that accessing input mode within numeric channels pressing channel up/down was feasible, channel 9x channels were dropped from future models.|$|R

40|$|Purpose A {{knowledge}} of how young people use their time could be instrumental in informing health interventions, modeling consumer behaviors, and planning service delivery. The aim {{of the present study}} was to describe age- and gender-related patterns in the self-reported use of time on school days in a large sample of Australian children and adolescents aged between 10 and 18 years. Methods A single, detailed use-of-time diary for a school day was collected from 6024 Australians aged 10 – 18 from several state and regional surveys conducted in the states of South Australia (SA) and Victoria between 2001 and 2006. Time–use profiles were analyzed for a range of active and sedentary state behaviors. Results Boys reported higher physical activity levels (PALs), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sports than girls. There were no differences in free play, and girls used more active transport. All activity-related variables decreased with age, except active transport, which peaked at 14 – 15 years. Boys exhibited higher levels of screen time, whereas girls had higher levels of passive transport. Screen time and its <b>components</b> (<b>television,</b> videogames, and computer use) peaked in the peripubertal years. Conclusion Age- and gender-related patterns of time use vary greatly within adolescence. This may reflect a mix of biological and social factors. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|In 1980, Sony {{introduced}} the [...] "ProFeel" [...] line of prosumer <b>component</b> <b>televisions,</b> {{consisting of a}} range of Trinitron monitors that could be connected to standardized tuners. The original lineup consisted of the KX-20xx1 20" [...] and KX-27xx1 27" [...] monitors (the [...] "xx" [...] is an identifier, PS for Europe, HF for Japan, etc.) the VTX-100ES tuner and TXT-100G TeleText decoder. They were often used with a set of SS-X1A stereo speakers, which matched the grey boxy styling of the suite. The concept was to build a market similar to contemporary stereo equipment, where components from different vendors could be mixed to produce a complete system. However, a lack of any major third party components, along with custom connectors between the tuner and monitors, meant that systems mixing fully compatible elements were never effectively realized. They were popular high-end units, however, and found a strong following in production companies where the excellent quality picture made them effective low-cost monitors. A second series of all-black units followed in 1986, the ProFeel Pro, sporting a space-frame {{around the back of the}} trapezoidal enclosure that doubled as a carrying handle and holder for the pop-out speakers. These units were paired with the VT-X5R tuner and optionally the APM-X5A speakers.|$|R
