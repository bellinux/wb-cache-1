40|$|The {{classical}} {{modeling of}} radiation by accelerated charged particles in pulsars predicts a cutoff in photon energy at around 25 GeV. While this is broadly consistent with observations, the classical treatment is not self-consistent, and cannot {{be extended to}} explain the rare high-energy detections of photons in the 100 s of GeV range. In this paper we revisit the theoretical modeling of high-energy radiation processes in very strong electromagnetic fields, {{in the context of}} both single particles and <b>collective</b> <b>plasmas.</b> There are no classical constraints on this description. We find that there is indeed a critical energy of around 50 GeV that arises naturally in this self-consistent treatment, but rather than being a cutoff, this critical energy signals a transition from radiation that is classical to a quasiquantum description, in which the particle is able to radiate almost its total energy in a single event. This new modeling therefore places pulsar radiation processes on a more secure physical basis, and admits the possibility of the production of TeV photons in a self-consistent way...|$|R

40|$|Expressions {{are given}} for the drag due to Coulomb {{collisions}} on a charged dust grain moving through a plasma. The commonly used Chandrasekhar (1943) result does not include large scattering angles or <b>plasma</b> <b>collective</b> effects. An equation given by Morfill et al.

This paper also makes use of an analogy between the drag problem and problems in electrostatics. This analogy permits generalization to any isotropic plasma of an observation made by Chandrasekhar for a Maxwellian, namely, that the drag is independent of {{the presence or absence of}} plasma particles moving faster than the grain. Finally, the contribution of <b>plasma</b> <b>collective</b> effects to the drag is studied with the inclusion of large scattering angles...|$|R

Deuterium plasma of 10 ^ 21 m^- 3 density is heated by a high power relativistic electron beam (peak parameters are 1 MeV, 25 kA, 8 μs, 120 kJ). Magnetic system of the facility is a 12 -meter-long axisymmetrical solenoid with corrugated magnetic field, which consists of 55 cells with B_max/B_min= 4. 8 / 3. 2 T. <b>Collective</b> <b>plasma</b> heating by the electron beam results in peak electron temperature 2 keV. To this time the ions are also collectively heated by gradients of electron pressure in {{the cells of the}} trap. Ion temperature increases above 1 keV and confines at the high level for 1 ms. Dense hot plasma in GOL- 3 trap emits D-D neutrons for 1 ms. Details of <b>collective</b> <b>plasma</b> heating by the beam in the corrugated magnetic field will be presented in the paper. New physical mechanism of effective heating of plasma ions, substantially dependent on the corrugation of the magnetic field, is discussed.

40|$|This review {{presents}} {{results of}} the recent calculations of <b>collective</b> <b>plasma</b> processes of radiation transport in the solar interior. The review introduces a remarkable number of previously neglected effects which are shown to reduce substantially the Rosseland opacity at {{the centre of the}} Sun (the decrease of opacity is approximately 10 %, which is greater than the previously accepted possible errors in opacity). It is also shown that effects which were previously treated without taking into account the collective behaviour of plasma, change appreciably when the collective nature of the plasma is included. The analysis is based on modern concepts of plasma physics in which an essential role is played by photon scattering on ions and by the oscillations of ion electron shells in emission and bremsstrahlung absorption processes. The processes which contribute most to a decrease in opacity are: the broadening of the Raman resonance (due to both the Doppler effect and binary electron-ion collisions), frequency diffusion in radiation transfer processes, the processes of stimulated scattering and collective quantum corrections to the scattering. A list of <b>collective</b> <b>plasma</b> effects which influence photon transport in the dense central solar plasma is presented.
