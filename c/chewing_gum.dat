Specifically, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and P values (within parentheses) were − 0.40 (0.02) for the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> within the 4 -h interval, − 0.20 (0.25) for the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> after the first PET/CT scan, and − 0.24 (0.17) for the total number of <b>gums</b> <b>chewed</b> on the first day.|$|R
40|$|<b>Chewing</b> of <b>gum</b> {{contributes}} {{to the maintenance of}} oral health. Many oral diseases, including caries and periodontal disease, are caused by bacteria. However, it is unknown whether <b>chewing</b> of <b>gum</b> can remove bacteria from the oral cavity. Here, we hypothesize that <b>chewing</b> of <b>gum</b> can trap bacteria and remove them from the oral cavity. To test this hypothesis, we developed two methods to quantify numbers of bacteria trapped in <b>chewed</b> <b>gum.</b> In the first method, known numbers of bacteria were finger-chewed into <b>gum</b> and <b>chewed</b> <b>gums</b> were molded to standard dimensions, sonicated and plated to determine numbers of colony- forming-units incorporated, yielding calibration curves of colony-forming-units retrieved versus finger-chewed in. In a second method, calibration curves were created by finger-chewing known numbers of bacteria into gum and subsequently dissolving the gum in a mixture of chloroform and tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic-acid (TE) -buffer. The TE-buffer was analyzed using quantitative Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (qPCR), yielding calibration curves of total numbers of bacteria versus finger-chewed in. Next, five volunteers were requested to <b>chew</b> <b>gum</b> up to 10 min after which numbers of colony-forming-units and total numbers of bacteria trapped in <b>chewed</b> <b>gum</b> were determined using the above methods. The qPCR method, involving both dead and live bacteria yielded higher numbers of retrieved bacteria than plating, involving only viable bacteria. Numbers of trapped bacteria were maximal during initial chewing after which a slow decrease over time up to 10 min was observed. Around 108 bacteria were detected per gum piece depending on the method and gum considered. The number of species trapped in <b>chewed</b> <b>gum</b> increased with <b>chewing</b> time. Trapped bacteria were clearly visualized in <b>chewed</b> <b>gum</b> using scanning-electron-microscopy. Summarizing, using novel methods to quantify and qualify oral bacteria trapped in <b>chewed</b> <b>gum,</b> the hypothesis is confirmed that <b>chewing</b> of <b>gum</b> can trap and remove bacteria from the oral cavity...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} the xylitol in <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> in combination with the antibiotics for treatment of the chronic otitis media with effusion. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, single blinded. METHODS: 29 patients with chronic otitis media with effusion were given xylitol or sorbitol containing <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> in a constant dosage with antibiotics. They were followed up monthly {{and at the end of}} 3 months, tympanometry was performed to all children whose ear condition were recorded according to otoscopic examinations and tympanograms. RESULTS: In the xylitol group, the middle ear pressure for the right ear before the treatment was- 347, 71 ± 60, 04 daPa, whereas it was decreased to- 230. 00 ± 123. 88 daPa (p. 05). The patients who received xylitol containing <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> had more improvement in the pressure levels for the right and the left ears than those in the sorbitol group. CONCLUSION: In the treatment of chronic otitis media with effusion, the <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> containing xylitol have been more effective than sorbitol containing gums...|$|R
5|$|The Māori {{had many}} {{uses for the}} gum, which they called kapia. Fresh gum {{was used as a}} type of <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> (older gum was {{softened}} by soaking and mixing with juice of the puha thistle). Highly flammable, the gum was also used as a fire-starter, or bound in flax to act as a torch. Burnt and mixed with animal fat, it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing. Kauri gum was also crafted into jewellery, keepsakes, and small decorative items. Like amber, kauri gum sometimes includes insects and plant material.|$|E

5|$|England beat Argentina 1–0 in {{the last}} eight, with Geoff Hurst scoring with a header; the match was sullied by the first-half sending off of Argentinian midfielder Antonio Rattín, who refused to leave the pitch after being {{dismissed}} for dissent. In contrast to the previous games, the semi-final against Portugal {{proved to be a}} fair contest between two sides of talented players eager to attack {{from the start of the}} match. Yet there was panic in the buildup to the game as trainer Harold Shepherdson forgot to buy <b>chewing</b> <b>gum,</b> which Banks used to make his hands stickier and better able to handle the ball, and so Shepherdson had to run to a nearby newsagents to purchase gum as the teams were in the tunnel. Bobby Charlton scored two goals, but Portugal made a strong finish and won a penalty on 82 minutes after Jack Charlton handled the ball in the penalty area. Eusébio converted the penalty after sending Banks the wrong way, and the game finished 2–1 in England's favour. This was the first goal Banks had conceded for England in 721 minutes of regular play, since giving up Scotland's last goal after 81 minutes of the Home International clash in April.

30|$|In addition, {{stimulation}} protocol-related {{and methodological}} factors {{may influence the}} outcome of the absorbed dose calculations. Variations of the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> per hour and of chewing frequency may affect the results. Dawes and Macpherson [15] demonstrated that the flow rate ratio of initial to later <b>chewing</b> on <b>gum</b> base is approximately 5. Thus, the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> on the first day influences the salivary flow rate; however, no correlation between the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> and the absorbed doses per activity was observed in this study. Moreover, the salivary flow rate has been demonstrated to be independent of the chewing frequency after a few minutes [16]. Methodologically, the similar results of the absorbed doses using the three-point and seven-point models show that the outcome is not strongly affected by the calculation models. Moreover, the errors in the co-registration and the drawing of volumes of interest around the salivary glands have been shown to produce an average error of 9 % in the absorbed dose calculation [17]. As a result, the factors mentioned are unlikely reasons for the unexpected findings.|$|R
40|$|<b>Chewing</b> <b>gums</b> may be {{particularly}} effective means for delivering and maintaining bioactive molecules, included in the gum formulation, able to have an anti-cariogenic effect. The {{purposes of this study}} were: to develop novel <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> containing quercetin (Qt); to evaluate their release using in vivo trial; finally, to test their in vivo antibacterial effect against oral Streptococcus mutans strains. A preliminary study was performed to produce new gums, enriched with the polyphenol quercetin. Then, a first in vivo experimental study was assessed to test the percentages of Qt released in the saliva of young volunteers. Moreover, a second clinical trial was performed to analyze the antibacterial capability of these enriched <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> against S. mutans strains after 14 days of daily consumption. The release analysis showed that a more effective release of Qt occurs in the first minutes of chewing, and it does not change saliva pH values. Moreover, Qt included in gums demonstrates an effective antibacterial activity, showing a reduction of the concentration of S. mutans strains in saliva samples, especially after 7 days. Qt included in experimental <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> could be efficiently released into the oral cavity and could promote an effective anti-caries concentration in volunteer’s saliva, without changing salivary pH values...|$|R
25|$|<b>Chewing</b> <b>gum</b> {{is rather}} shelf stable {{because of its}} {{non-reactive}} nature and low moisture content. The water activity of <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> ranges from 0.40-0.65. The moisture content of <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> ranges from 3-6%. In fact, <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not {{required by law to}} be labeled with an expiration date. If <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but it will never be unsafe to eat. If <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead {{to the end of the}} product’s shelf life, causing the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chewing</b> <b>gum</b> {{is used as}} a novel {{approach}} for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). One hypothesis is that <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> stimulates the production of more bicarbonate-containing saliva and increases the rate of swallowing. After the saliva is swallowed, it neutralizes acid in the esophagus. In effect, <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> exaggerates one of the normal processes that neutralize acid in the esophagus. However, <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> is sometimes considered to {{contribute to the development of}} stomach ulcers. It stimulates the stomach to secrete acid and the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes that aren't required. In some cases, when consuming large quantities of gum containing sorbitol, gas and/or diarrhea may occur.|$|E

25|$|Modern <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> {{was first}} {{developed}} in the 1860s when chicle was brought from Mexico by the former President, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, to New York, where {{he gave it to}} Thomas Adams for use as a rubber substitute. Chicle did not succeed as a replacement for rubber, but as a gum, which was cut into strips and marketed as Adams New York <b>Chewing</b> <b>Gum</b> in 1871. Black Jack (1884), which is flavored with licorice, Chiclets (1899), and Wrigley's Spearmint Gum were early popular gums that quickly dominated the market and are all still around today. <b>Chewing</b> <b>gum</b> gained worldwide popularity through American GIs in WWII, who were supplied <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> as a ration and traded it with locals. Synthetic gums were first introduced to the U.S. after chicle no longer satisfied the needs of making good <b>chewing</b> <b>gum.</b> By the 1960s, US manufacturers had switched to butadiene-based synthetic rubber, as it was cheaper to manufacture.|$|E
25|$|The {{polymers}} {{that make}} up the main component of <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> base are hydrophobic. This property is essential because it allows for retention of physical properties throughout the mastication process. Because the polymers of gum repel water, the water-based saliva system in a consumer’s mouth will dissolve the sugars and flavorings in <b>chewing</b> <b>gum,</b> but not the gum base itself. This allows for gum to be chewed {{for a long period of}} time without breaking down in the mouth like conventional foods. <b>Chewing</b> <b>gum</b> can be classified as a product containing a liquid phase and a crystalline phase, providing gum with its characteristic balance of plastic and elastic properties.|$|E
