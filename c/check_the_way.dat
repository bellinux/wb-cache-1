40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} English N+N {{compounds}} {{and the primary}} purpose of the study is to investigate the way in which compounded structures acquire their meaning and to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which the semantics of each of the constituents contributes to the overall meaning of the structure. The way in which such contributions are made should be inferable from the linguistic analysis of the structure and meaning of compounds. In order to do this, the thesis looks first at the morphological productivity of the constituents comprising a compound. The second aim is to identify whether the productivity of a compound constituent on the morphological level coincides with the productivity of the semantic relation realised in the constituent family. The discussion of the results obtained from a corpus study provides plausible explanations for the regularities noted in the course of the analysis by using some of the relevant principles from the complex of approaches including the Construction Grammar and Cognitive Grammar approaches. Examples of compounds were collected from the printed media (NZ broadsheets) and the BNC. The analysis of the data used both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative analysis of the data confirms two hypotheses: (1) that a constituent is more productive in just one of the positions (modifier or head), and (2) the more productive a constituent is, the more likely it is to realise a single semantic relation in a constituent family. The qualitative analysis involves consideration of the semantic content of the concepts in each constituent in order to see how this content is reflected in the semantic relations realised by a constituent. It is discovered that the semantic content of the head is a stronger predictor of the relation realised in a compound than that of the modifier. The study is important in order to better understand the factors that govern the formation of compounds and the patterns that speakers use in the process of coining complex lexical items [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Levando em conta as propostas da LDB para o Ensino Médio, este estudo propõe uma reflexão acerca do trabalho com a disciplina de Literatura Brasileira, especialmente no que se refere às obras indicadas para os processos seletivos da Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (PEIES e Vestibular). A existência dos exames vestibulares para ingresso ao Ensino Superior é um fator decisivo na elaboração dos conteúdos programáticos das escolas, visto que muitos estudantes pretendem realizar as provas. Buscou-se nessa pesquisa verificar se os vestibulares e demais processos seletivos como o PEIES constituem-se como barreiras no ensino de Literatura Brasileira, ou se existem formas de trabalhar com textos indicados pela universidade sem que outros conteúdos e objetivos da disciplina sejam prejudicados. Procurou-se também observar a existência da preocupação em relacionar as obras estudadas com o contexto atual da sociedade por parte dos professores, por acreditar-se que esta pode ser uma maneira de instigar os estudantes a pensarem criticamente sobre o mundo que os cerca. A primeira parte do capítulo inicial {{consiste}} na análise de fragmentos de entrevistas realizadas com professoras de Literatura Brasileira que trabalham com o terceiro ano do Ensino Médio na cidade de Santa Maria. O objetivo é constatar a percepção das mesmas em relação ao trabalho com a disciplina e com as obras literárias. Foram escolhidas para a realização da pesquisa duas escolas da rede pública de Ensino, uma da rede particular e uma escola técnica vinculada à UFSM. Buscou-se também verificar a maneira pela qual os alunos se relacionam com a disciplina de Literatura Brasileira e com as obras indicadas para o PEIES e o vestibular através de um questionário. A segunda etapa desse trabalho constitui-se de uma análise das obras Terras do sem-fim e Contos gauchescos, destacando-se questões significativas dentro dos livros em questão que poderiam ser tomadas como pontos de partida para uma aproximação entre o texto literário e a realidade do aluno. O trabalho de interpretação proposto é apresentado em contraste com o relato de professores acerca de seu trabalho com as referidas obras. No terceiro capítulo, são retomadas algumas questões abordadas ao longo da pesquisa com o intuito de buscar uma qualificação do ensino de Literatura Brasileira no Ensino Médio. Somente com uma constante reavaliação das práticas educativas será possível obter melhorias na formação de leitores críticos e apreciadores da obra literáriaConsidering {{the proposals}} of LDB for the High School, this study proposes a reflection {{about the work}} with {{the subject matter of}} Brazilian Literature, specifically refering to the books indicated to the entrance selective processes of the Federal University of Santa Maria (PEIES and vestibular). The existence of entrance exams to access the College is a decisive factor in the definition of the contents that have been taught in High Schools because lots of students intend to take such exams. This research checks whether the entrance exams and other entrance selective processes like PEIES are barriers in the teaching of Brazilian Literature. It also searches for ways of working with the books indicated to the entrance exams without compromising other contents and goals of the subject matter. It was also observed whether teachers were willing to correlate the books used in Brazilian Literature with the current societys context, because we believe this can be a way to motivate students to think critically about the world around them. The beginning of chapter one consists of an analysis of fragments of an interview made with Brazilian Literature teachers who work with third grade of High School in Santa Maria city. The goal is to identify how they deal with the work with the subject and with literary books. Two public schools, one private and one technical school associated to UFSM were chosen {{to be part of this}} research. A questionnaire was also used to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> students relate themselves with studies of Brazilian Literature and with the books indicated to PEIES and UFSM college entrance exam. The second part of this research is made up by the analysis of two literary books called Terras do sem-fim and Contos gauchescos. The focus is on significant points of those books, which could be taken as starting points for an approach between the literary book and the students reality. The interpretation study proposed in the paper is presented in contrast to the interview made with teachers about their work with those literary books. In the third chapter some points covered through out the research are revisited in order to get a qualification of the Brazilian Literature teaching in High School. Only with a constant revaluation of the teaching practices it will be possible to achieve improvements in the formation of readers and of people who like literary work...|$|E

40|$|Model {{checking}} {{would answer}} all finite-state verification problems, {{if it were}} not for the notorious state-space explosion problem. A problem of practical importance, which attracted less attention, is to close open systems. Standard model checkers cannot handle open systems directly and closing is commonly done by adding an environment process, which in the simplest case behaves chaotically. However, for model <b>checking,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of closing should be well-considered to alleviate the state-space explosion problem. This is especially true in the context of model checking SDL with its asynchronous message-passing communication, since chaotically sending and receiving messages immediately leads to a combinatorial explosion caused by all combinations of messages in the input queues. In this paper we develop an automatic transformation yielding a closed system. By embedding the outside chaos into the system’s processes, we avoid the state-space penalty in the input queues mentioned above. To capture the chaotic timing behaviour of the environment, we introduce a non-standard 3 -valued timer abstraction. We use data-flow analysis to detect instances of chaotic variables and timers and prove the soundness of the transformation, which is based on the result of the analysis...|$|R
