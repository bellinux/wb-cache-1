25|$|That day was, I fear, {{the fatal}} term of local patriotism.

All the little quiet rivulets, that watered an humble, a contracted, but not an unfruitful field, are to {{be lost in the}} waste expanse, and boundless, barren ocean of the homicide philanthropy of France. It is no longer an object of terrour, the aggrandizement of a new power, which teaches as a professor that philanthropy in their chair; whilst it propagates by arms, and establishes by conquest, the comprehensive system of universal fraternity. In what light is all this viewed in a great assembly? The party which takes the lead there has no longer any apprehensions, except those that arise from not being admitted to the closest and most confidential connexions with the metropolis of that fraternity. That reigning party no longer touches on its favourite subject, the display of those horrours, that must attend the existence of a power, with such dispositions and principles, seated in the heart of Europe.|$|E

500|$|The quark flavors {{were given}} their names for several reasons. The {{up and down}} quarks are named after {{the up and down}} {{components}} of isospin, which they carry. Strange quarks were given their name because they were discovered to be components of the strange particles discovered in cosmic rays years before the quark model was proposed; these particles were deemed [...] "strange" [...] because they had unusually long lifetimes. Glashow, who coproposed charm quark with Bjorken, is quoted as saying, [...] "We <b>called</b> <b>our</b> construct the 'charmed quark', for we were fascinated and pleased by the symmetry it brought to the subnuclear world." [...] The names [...] "bottom" [...] and [...] "top", coined by Harari, were chosen because they are [...] "logical partners for up and down quarks". In the past, bottom and top quarks were sometimes referred to as [...] "beauty" [...] and [...] "truth" [...] respectively, but these names have somewhat fallen out of use. While [...] "truth" [...] never did catch on, accelerator complexes devoted to massive production of bottom quarks are sometimes called [...] "beauty factories".|$|E
500|$|Usher founded New Look, a {{non-profit}} charity organization {{which aims to}} [...] "provide young people with a new look on life through education and real-world experience". Its flagship project, camp New Look, ran from July 11 to July 23, 2005, in Clark Atlanta University. In 2006, the charity started an initiative <b>called</b> <b>Our</b> Block, for which it helped rebuild and revitalize city blocks in New Orleans. The project went on one street at a time, and the funding was helped through part of the proceeds of Usher's team-up with Armani Exchange in creating [...] "Love 4 Life" [...] dog tags, which were made available at the company's stores and Web site. Since then, Usher has launched chapters of New Look in such cities as Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New York, and Washington D.C. New Look has for basic pillars; Talent, Education, Service, and Career. New Look program begins in the 8th grade and progresses through a student's high school and post-secondary education. Education is the center focus, Usher and his program ensures this.

500|$|The {{history of}} Catholicism in Nepal begins with its {{inclusion}} in the diocese of Funchal, Portugal, and in 1533 {{as part of the}} diocese of Goa. From then on until 1983, it was a part of many different Indian dioceses. Apart from a short visit of Jesuit fathers Albert d'Orville and Johann Gruber who spent the month of January 1662 in Kathmandu, missionaries settled in Nepal proper in 1715, when Capuchin fathers entered the Kathmandu Valley at the invitation of the Malla Kings. Father Sharma Anthony Francis, who has headed the Catholic mission and then prefecture since 1983, has stated, [...] "The priests were given full authority to preach Christianity and even build a church, <b>called</b> <b>Our</b> Lady's Assumption, somewhere in Lalitpur District". Assumption was built in 1760, and another church called Annunciation of Our Lady was built in Bhaktapur. After the unification of Nepal by Prithvi Narayan Shah into a Hindu kingdom, the priests were asked to leave for fear they were British spies. In 1769 the priests and many Nepalese Christians left for India and settled in Chuhari, Northern Bihar, where they have remained. One Catholic priest did remain until his death in 1810. After that, there was no Christian presence until 1950. On May 19, 1893, the whole of Nepal was added to the Prefecture of Bettiah, India. It was then a part of the Patna, India apostolic vicariate from 1919 until the establishment of the mission covering only Nepal in 1983. With the introduction of democracy in 1951, Jesuit missionaries started educational institutions but were not allowed to evangelize. Saint Xavier's School was established in 1951.|$|E
