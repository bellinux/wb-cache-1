500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of its revival, {{the race was}} subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government. On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I tell you what we ought to do. As far as we are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me where we are going to be racing?" ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 21, 2013, {{radio host}} Janet Mefferd accused Driscoll of plagiarism. Mefferd claimed that 14 pages of Driscoll's book A Call to Resurgence quoted [...] "extensively and without citation" [...] from Peter Jones's 1999 book, Gospel Truth/Pagan Lies: <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tell</b> the Difference? and Jones's 2010 book One or Two: Seeing a World of Difference. Driscoll's {{publisher}} Tyndale House {{stated that they}} performed a [...] "thorough in-house review" [...] and disagreed {{that this was a}} case of plagiarism. Neil Holdway, a plagiarism expert with the American Copy Editors Society, concluded that [...] "Driscoll had not adequately indicated the extent to which he had borrowed Jones's work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the 1972 Sunbury Pop Festival was not {{the first}} held in Australia, it benefited from a high level of {{publicity}} and, despite flagging attendances at 1975 festival, it consistently attracted large crowds. As many as 40,000 people attended Sunbury in 1972, although figures vary considerably depending on the source, and more conservative estimates place the figure between 30,000 and 35,000. Looking back in 1973, promoter John Fowler, who worked with property owner George Duncan, as site manager, said [...] "The papers put it at anything from 25 to 60,000 people. How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> for sure?" [...] In 1974 about 30,000 attended. The final festival had a crowd of 16,000 which was affected by poor weather and the higher cost of admission.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the liner}} notes for the {{compilation}} album, Natural Selection (October 2003), Seymour described [...] "Back on the Breadline" [...] and wrote [...] "This song spearheaded the North American campaign of 1987. We were signed to I.R.S. Records, and What's a Few Men? would've been our second album with them. Unfortunately they couldn't hear a single. Stoically, we wrote more. 'Back on the Breadline' was one amongst several which {{went on a}} compile {{with the best of}} the rest from the What's a Few Men? album ... I could have sworn this song had 'hit' written all over it. How wrong can you be? Just before getting on the plane, standing at the terminal gate, waiting to fly home after I'd been to what felt like every radio station in North America promoting the track, the managing director of the record company asked me, in all seriousness, 'Hey young fella, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me, exactly what is the breadline?".|$|E

2500|$|The VHS, and {{subsequent}} DVD release (which is verbatim the VHS release) lasts 40 minutes. However, the live telecast, {{and subsequent}} LP release were longer. The CD release is {{faithful to the}} LP release, with a total running time of about 52 minutes. In editing the VHS release down to 40 minutes, the lead-up to a delayed punch-line is lost. The punch line comprises Bluebottle asking Moriarty: [...] "...what is that lump on your nut?", to which Moriarty replies: [...] "That {{is the difference between}} margarine". The primer for this punch-line was edited out between announcer Andrew Timothy's follow-on at the end of Ray Ellington's song, and the part where Neddy drives up on an unlicensed Goon Show. Amongst the banter, Grytpype-Thynne tells Moriarty to place his head on an anvil, followed by a clang, and screams of pain from Moriarty. Grytpype then says: [...] "now, taste this margarine". Moriarty complies. Grytpype says: [...] "There. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> the difference?". Moriarty: [...] "No". Grytpype (triumphantly): [...] "You see! You can't tell the difference between a lump on the head and margarine. The leadership of the Conservative Party is yours for the asking!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} coined by Angular Records founder Joe Daniel and was {{featured}} on the [...] "An Angular Disco" [...] flyer used to advertise Klaxons's first gig. Klaxons later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a [...] "joke that's got out of hand" [...] and that the term was originally ironic, not serious. In reaction to the media overkill of the [...] "genre", Klaxons banned the use of glowsticks at their gigs in April 2007, saying that [...] "We kept getting asked to explain it. The whole idea of new rave {{was to take the}} piss out of the media by making them talk about something that didn't exist, just for our own amusement. And they'd say, I appreciate that, but <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me more about new rave?" [...] Los Angeles Times critic Margaret Wappler comments that the [...] "minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of [...] (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy" [...] contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music.|$|E
