50|$|Of {{the past}} Fringe cases {{that the team}} uses against the Observers, these include the {{nematode}} worms, the radioactive isotopes, the parasitic <b>cold</b> <b>slug,</b> anti-gravity osmium bullets, the hallucinogenic drug that simulates deadly butterflies and the skin-growth toxin. These cases all occurred within the show's first 3 seasons, showing that they still occurred in some way in the timeline created by Peter being erased.|$|E
50|$|The punch is {{attached}} to a mechanical or hydraulic press. These machines reciprocate in a cycle 20 to 60 times per minute. A <b>cold</b> <b>slug</b> is placed below the punch and over the die. The punch makes contact with the slug forcing it around the circumference of the punch and into the die. The metal slug deforms to fit the punch on the inside and the die on the outside. Lubricants are added to aid the machine for an easier punch-out. It only takes one impact for the finished shape to form from the slug. Once the slug has been contoured to the desired shape, a counter-punch ejector removes the work piece from within the die.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—It is {{analyzed}} by the technology plastics materials and molding process of bearing cylinder pieces, which has {{carried on the}} mold scheme demonstration and demoulding mechanism, the forming problem of bearing cylinder pieces is solved, and it is designed that the main runner, <b>cold</b> <b>slug</b> well, pull rod, the runner and gate of gating system. The ejection force is calculated, and which is design of parting surface. It {{is given to the}} assembly diagram of special injection mould. Practice has proved that the bearing cylinder pieces injection mold structure is reasonable, reliable, good machining quality and high production efficiency.

40|$|Fisher and Paykel (F&P) are {{developing}} {{a new model of}} washing machine. One of its key features will be that it uses less water. It is important to regulate the operating temperature of washing machines since if they operate hotter than the user-selected temperature there is a risk of damage to clothes and if they operate below the user-selected temperature there is a risk of incompletely dissolved detergent being sprayed onto clothes, which is also undesirable. F&P seek to improve their temperature regulation strategies from the current state-of-the-art. Further, since the new machine will have a smaller mass of water relative to clothes load, the impact of abnormal clothes loads and of start-up disturbances in water supply temperatures (e. g. <b>cold</b> <b>slugs</b> in hot water supply) on the bulk temperature is greater. Thus a thorough review of temperature regulation strategies is well motivated...|$|R
50|$|This {{study also}} found that the diet of the orange-banded arion is {{variable}} throughout the year. For example, an increase in animal material during May and June. The hypothesis is that during the <b>colder</b> months <b>slugs</b> don't move much under the leaf litter, and take in a lot of leaves where the chlorophyll as already broken down, and during the warmer months, they take advantage of the earthworms and small arthropods who have high mortality rates.|$|R
