40|$|The overall {{success and}} {{long-term}} durability of a patch repair is significantly {{influenced by the}} bond developed at the interface between the concrete substrate and the repair material. In turn, the bond strength {{is influenced by the}} topography (roughness) of the substrate surface after removal of the defective concrete. However, different removal methods of defective concrete produce substrate surfaces with different topographies. Hence, the ability to measure and characterise the topography of substrate surfaces is of great importance for evaluating the effectiveness of different removal methods. In this paper, the effect of two removal methods: electric <b>chipping</b> <b>hammers</b> and Remote Robotic Hydro-erosion (RRH) on the surface roughness is investigated {{through the use of a}} prototype non-contact (optical) laser interferometry measuring device.

40|$|Percussive {{tools such}} as <b>chipping</b> <b>hammers,</b> {{riveting}} hammers and concrete breakers produce shock-type (impact) vibrations with large amount of vibration energy in the high frequency region (kHz). Reported injuries from shock-type and high frequency vibrations are higher  occurrence of vascular disorders, myelin disruption, edema and reduced motor performance. An Atlas Copco Tools customer has reported an increase of VWF (vibration induced white finger) {{during the last decade}} and the <b>chipping</b> <b>hammers</b> have been identified as the main cause. A mean of 1. 8 workers/year has been injured with VWF and the cost of one injured worker has been estimate to 0. 5 million SEK. One way to eliminate the injuries could be to replace the tools from Atlas Copco with better tools from another manufacturer. A protective handle was designed for the <b>chipping</b> <b>hammers</b> by Atlas Copco, to prevent operators from holding directly on the vibrating parts. However, the protective handle was not vibration isolated and a follow up project, this thesis, was started to redesign and vibration isolate the handle. An isolated protective handle with two rubber bushings was finally developed from theory of vibration isolation together with a subjective evaluation by experienced personnel and with low and high frequency vibration measurements. The final protective handle significantly reduced both the harmful low frequency vibrations (measured according to ISO 5349) and the potentially harmful high frequency vibrations (not measured according to any ISO standard), compared to the non-isolated original handle  developed by Atlas Copco...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Prolonged {{exposure}} to severe <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer</b> vibration may cause hand–arm vibration syndrome. A reliable test method {{is required to}} select appropriate tools and assist {{in the development of}} better chipping hammers. In the present study, the ISO standardized test method (ISO 8662 - 2, 1992) was examined through an investigation of the vibration character-istics of chipping hammers operating on the energy absorber specified in the standard. Methods: The energy absorber and test setup were designed and constructed based on those specified in the standard. The experiment employed six subjects and used two pneumatic chip-ping hammers and three different feed forces (50, 100 and 200 N). The subject posture was the same as that specified in the standard. Results: The vibration emission at the tool dominant frequency (or air blow rate) generally declined with an increase in feed force, thus decreasing the frequency-weighted accelerations. The increase in feed force, however, resulted in an increase in the unweighted vibration emis-sion at high frequencies. The <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer</b> vibration emission operating on the energy absorber at the high feed force (200 N) was inconsistent. Conclusions: The measurement method has a good repeatability except at a high feed force. The feed force has a significant effect on the vibration emission. The single feed force specified in the standard may not be sufficient to test the tool behaviors. Multiple levels of feed force should be used for the <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer</b> test. Doing so may provide a more appropriate basis for tool screening...|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to hand transmitted vibration (HTV) {{arises from the}} hand held powered tools extensively used in the mining and construction industry such as rock drills, chipping hammers, chain saws etc. Regular {{exposure to}} HTV is the major cause {{of a range of}} permanent injuries to human hands and arms which are commonly referred to as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). In addition to this, the percussive tools generate overall sound power levels in excess of 110 dBA in most cases. Such a high sound power level greatly exceeds the maximum permissible exposure limit (PEL) of organizations such as National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Long term occupational exposure to this noise has been diagnosed as the main reason for permanent hearing loss in the operators. It is therefore important to develop an understanding of the mechanisms which lead to these high vibration and sound levels and in order to do this a detailed computational model of a pneumatic <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer</b> has been made. This paper presents a nonlinear computational model of a pneumatic <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer.</b> In order to better understand the dynamics of the <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer,</b> the hammer was subdivided into components that are shown in figure 1 (a) (based on a <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer</b> manufactured by Atlas-Copco). The hammer mainly consisted of a center body, a moving piston and a chisel. Compressed air is used to drive the piston inside of a cylinder and on the downward stroke this piston impacts the chisel to create the hammer effect. The machine has one pneumatic valve and this valve regulates the air supply either to the upper chamber or to the lower chamber. The valve changes according to the relative pressures in the two chambers and the supply pressure. There are also twelve different exhaust ports at two positions along the cylinder labeled upper ports and lower ports. As the piston moves the ports can be closed or open (allowing exhaust). Fundamentally, the computational model was made up of two different sub-models, a fluid model and a structural dynamic model as shown in Figure 3 (a) and (b) respectively. The first sub-model takes into consideration the fluid dynamics of the machine since the hammer is driven by compressed air. Equations for the mass flow rate though bleed orifices (assuming an isentropic process) 1 is used to determine the mass flow {{into and out of the}} upper and lower chambers. From this the pressures in the two chambers and consequently the forcing on the piston can be calculated. The second sub-model deals with modeling the structural [...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare various effects on the hand-arm system of {{vibration}} exposure from a <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer</b> and a grinder with the same frequency weighted acceleration. Grip and push forces were measured and monitored during the exposure. The various effects were: muscle activity (measured with surface electrodes), discomfort ratings for different parts of the hand-arm system (made during and after exposure), and vibration perception threshold (for 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after the exposure). RESULTS [...] No increase in muscle activity due to exposure to vibration was found in the hand muscle studied. In the forearm, conversely, there was an increase in both muscle studied. For the upper arm the muscle activity only increased when exposed to impact vibration. Subjective ratings in the hand and shift in vibration perception threshold were effected more by the grinder than the hammer exposure. CONCLUSION [...] These results show that the reaction of the hand-arm system to vibration varies with frequency quantitatively as well as qualitatively. They do not support the notion that one single frequency weighted curve would be valid for the different health effects of hand-arm vibration (vascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, and psychophysiological) ...|$|E

40|$|Work with {{hand-held}} {{power tools}} {{can be found}} in most industries all over the world. This type of work exposes the operators to different kind of loads like gripping-forces, feed-forces, exposure to vibration and noise, holding hot or cold surfaces and the exposure to dust. Designing a power tool with good ergonomics is a matter of finding the best compromise. As a simple example, increasing the mass is not acceptable because it will increase the forces needed to handle the tool. At the same time increased mass will in most cases reduce the vibrations. Vibration disorders related to the use of hand-held power tools has been known and reported since long. It is therefore essential that low vibrating tools are developed and used. The new vibration regulations in Europe, based on the Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive, have put increased focus on the vibration control in industry. Forces acting on the tool cause vibration Tools for industrial use must be of very robust design to withstand the very hard use they are exposed to. Industrial tools are therefore normally designed with the main parts made of metal. From a vibration point of view this means that most tools can be regarded as rigid bodies, especially because the dominating frequency normally is equal to the rotational frequency of the tool spindle or the blow frequency for a percussive tool. These frequencies are with few exceptions below 200 Hz. Handles however can not always be regarded as rigidly connected to the tool. There are several examples of weak suspensions designed to reduce vibration transmitted to the hands of the operator. There are also examples of designs where the handles just happened to be non-rigidly connected and in some cases even in resonance within the frequency region of interest. Oscillating forces act on the tool and the result is vibration. Design principals In all cases forces are the source of vibration. This leads to the three basic principles to control vibration: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Control the magnitude of the vibrating forces. Examples are the balancing unit on a grinder or the differential piston in a <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer.</b> 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Make the tool less sensitive to the vibrating forces. Examples can be when the mass of the guard on a grinder is rigidly connected to the tool to increase the inertia of the tool. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Isolate the vibrations in the tool from the grip surfaces. Examples are vibration-dampening handles on grinders or pavement breakers, the air-spring behind the blow-mechanism in a riveting hammer or the mass spring system in a <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer...</b>|$|E
40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} hand power tools {{has long been}} associated with several disorders of the hand and arm, which are collectively termed as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Owing to high prevalence of HAVS among the operators of the power tools, particularly the percussive tools, the desire to develop low vibration tool designs, has been widely recognized. The design of vibration isolators or assessment of vibration performance of tools necessitates development of dynamic model of the tool coupled {{with that of the}} hand-arm system (HAS) to account for energy absorption within the HAS. This dissertation research is aimed at development of dynamic model of a percussive <b>chipping</b> <b>hammer</b> together with a biomechanical model of the hand-arm system. The model could serve as an essential tool for identifying effective vibration attenuation design features. The dynamic model of the tool is formulated considering identifications of various component contact pairs and the air flows between the primary piston and the striker. A tool tip-workpiece contact model is integrated to the tool model to describe the interactions between the tool and an energy dissipator. A biomechanical model of the hand-arm system is implemented to the tool model to develop a coupled hand-tool system, which could be applied to determine the hand vibration responses {{as a function of the}} push force. The properties of different impact pairs are identified from the theory of visco-elastic collision between rigid bodies. The validity of the hand-tool model is examined on the basis of available measured data under selected levels of the hand push force. A simple model of an anti-vibration glove is further introduced to study its effectiveness in limiting the vibration exposure. The simulation results show that the percussive tool model coupled with the biomechanical hand-arm model can yield reasonably good trends in view of the hand-transmitted vibration. The results suggest that the tool vibration transmitted to the hand is more sensitive to variations in push force and the operating speed. Slight increases in the diameter of the upper chamber orifices and the weight of the tool body, together with lower the striker mass, could yield notable reductions in the magnitudes of vibration transmitted to the hand-arm system. The results further show that the anti-vibration gloves yield very minimal vibration attenuation. ...|$|E

Topics discussed include early deaths from dust exposure, symptoms of silicosis, exposure to silica (14808607), activities during which silica dust may be present, prevention of silicosis, medical examinations for exposed workers, and sources of additional information. Construction workers may be exposed to silica dust through their work with building materials. Abrasive blasting, <b>chipping,</b> <b>hammering,</b> drilling, sawing, grinding, crushing, loading, hauling, dumping, demolishing, and dry sweeping are activities which allow the dust to enter the air. The use of dust control systems during drilling and sawing can reduce dust exposures. Local exhaust ventilation is important; good work practices also reduce much of the exposure. Abrasives containing less than 1 % crystalline silica should be used during abrasive blasting to prevent harmful quartz dust from being released. Respirators should only be used until adequate dust control measures are in place and should never be the primary method of protection.

The primary objective of this research was to show that use of vibrating tools in the foundry involves exposure not only to vibration, but also to physical stresses both while the tool is running and while it is not running. Four types of tools were investigated: (1) small handheld grinders, (2) scaling hammers, (3) inline <b>hammers,</b> and (4) <b>chipping</b> <b>hammers.</b> The paper {{describes the}} characteristics of these tools with respect to physical work factors such as muscle load, upper extremity posture, hand repetition, and exposure to hand/arm vibration. The analysis is based on the use of instrumentation as well as the use of observational methods to quantify the physical work elements. With the exception of the grinders, all the tools investigated in this study produced vibration levels that limited their time of acceptable use, according to published guidelines. In addition to vibration exposure, workers experienced high peak muscle loading, medium to high levels of hand repetition, and extreme or awkward posture of the elbow and shoulder. All tools met or exceeded published recommendation limits for hand activity level. Relevance to industry The use of vibrating tools is common in many industrial settings.

40|$|Prolonged, {{extensive}} {{exposure to}} hand-transmitted vibration {{could cause a}} series of vibration-induced disorders in the vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal structures of the human hand-arm system, which have been collectively called hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). 1 To assess the risk of HAVS the international standard ISO 5349 - 1 (2001) 1 recommends using the root-mean-square (rms) acceleration of the measured vibration with a frequency weighting. While a few epidemiological studies have reported results consistent with the predictions made according to the recommendation, many other studies have reported results with large discrepancies. 2 This may be partially attributed to the time-averaging effect involved in calculation of the frequency components, especially for impact type tools. Because the spectral characteristics of impact tools change dramatically with time, a time-frequency (T-F) analysis can provide better characterizations of such highly transient vibrations. The analytic wavelet transform (AWT) is an ideal T-F analysis tool because it possesses the advantages of both the Fourier transform and the wavelet transform. 3 The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the application of the AWT method for characterizing the impact tool vibrations and assessing their exposure risk. Methods Five tools (two <b>chipping</b> <b>hammers,</b> two riveting hammers, and one concrete cutting saw) were used in this study.

The vibrations on the other tools were measured by the procedure specified in ISO 8662 - 2 (1992). 4 A sampling rate of 16, 386 Hz was used in the measurement. The AWT and Fourier analysis were applied to these signals and to identify their characteristics. Results Figure 1 compares the T-F characteristics of the accelerations measured from the relatively steady concrete saw and a riveting hammer.

The later will require setting acceptable dose standards, which will require negotiation with all involved parties and a balance of risk and cost to benefit. To accomplish the first two, disposal or decontamination, a combination of technologies will be deployed that can be loosely classified as: Decontamination; Equipment removal and size reduction; and Demolition. This report will deal only with the decontamination technologies that will be used to return assets to service or to reduce waste disposal. It will not discuss demolition, size reduction or removal technologies or equipment (e. g., backhoe mounted rams, rock splitter, paving breakers and <b>chipping</b> <b>hammers,</b> etc.). As defined by the DOE (1994), decontamination is removal of radiological contamination from the surfaces of facilities and equipment. Expertise in this field comes primarily from the operation and decommissioning of DOE and commercial nuclear facilities as well as a small amount of ongoing research and development closely related to RDD decontamination. Information related to decontamination of fields, buildings, and public spaces resulting from the Goiania and Chernobyl incidents were also reviewed and provide some meaningful insight into decontamination at major urban areas. In order to proceed with decontamination, the item being processed needs to have an intrinsic value that exceeds the cost of the cleaning and justifies the exposure of any workers during the decontamination process(es). In the case of an entire building, the value may be obvious; it's costly to replace the structure. For a smaller item such as a vehicle or painting, the cost versus benefit of decontamination needs to be evaluated. This will be determined on a case by case basis and again is beyond the scope of this report, although some thoughts on decontamination of unique, personal and high value items are given. But, this is clearly an area that starting discussions and negotiations early on will greatly benefit both the economics and timeliness of the clean up.

They built huts of woven boughs, and for defence sometimes surrounded a group of huts with a palisade of stakes set up on end. They had no agriculture in the true sense, but they cultivated Indian corn and pumpkins in the openings of the forests, and also the tobacco plant, with the virtues of which they were well acquainted. They made for themselves heavy and clumsy pottery and utensils of wood, they wove mats out of rushes for their houses, and they made clothes from the skin of the deer, and head-dresses from the bright feathers of birds. Of the metals they knew, at the time of the discovery of America, hardly anything. They made some use of copper, which they <b>chipped</b> and <b>hammered</b> into rude tools and weapons. But they knew nothing of melting the metals, and their arrow-heads and spear-points were made, for the most part, not of metals, but of stone. Like other Indians, they showed great ingenuity in fashioning bark canoes of wonderful lightness.|$|R

Whole maize grains are heated in a cooker with an alkaline solution. Then the cooked grains are washed with hot tap water and rested for a while to assure a better distribution of moisture within the maize grains. Unfortunately this nixtamalized maize is not done yet. This research investigates the appropriate cooking time and concentration of alkaline solution. Visual assessment, hardness and lightly to flatten on cooked grains are basis of decision. Afterward, the cooked grains are flattened into chips which could be function as by product. Instant corn flour is obtained by grounding dry <b>chips</b> with a <b>hammer</b> mill. Finally, chemical compositions and physicochemical properties of instant cornflour are evaluated to measure its quality. The nixtamalized maize was done after cooking in 90 minutes at 3 %w/w Ca(OH) 7 solution and yielded 89 % instant corn flour. Resulted corn flour had moisture (10, 67 %), crude protein (9, 15 %), crude lipid (5, 40 %), ash (2, 55 %) and amylose (26, 24 %). The resulted data of physicochemical properties showed that instant corn flour had colour (L 84, 23; a - 0, 12; b + 24, 50), bulk density (606 kg/m 3), angle of repose (36, 49 Â°), swelling power (7, 03 g/g), water holding capacity (617 %) and digestibility 58, 69 % in 6 hours...|$|R
