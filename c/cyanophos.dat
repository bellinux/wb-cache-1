This material was found near the location that the original specimens of M.chlorophos were found, {{but a couple of}} weeks later. Japanese mycologists Seiya Ito and Sanshi Imai studied these collections in the late 1930s, and concluded that Agaricus <b>cyanophos</b> was the same species as M.chlorophos, despite differences in cap shape, gill attachment, and the color of emitted light. Desjardin and colleagues agreed with this determination after examining the type material of both taxa. M.chlorophos is classified in the section Exornatae of the genus Mycena. Other luminescent species in this section are M.discobasis and M.marginata. Some authors have considered M.illuminans to be synonymous with M.chlorophos due to their morphological similarity, but molecular analysis has shown that they are distinct species.|$|E

Symptoms of <b>cyanophos</b> {{poisoning}} resemble those of the chemical weapon sarin and include dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, bronchorrhea, blurred vision, and opsoclonus.|$|E

40|$|A {{competitive}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) {{was developed}} for the quantitative detection of organophosphorus insecticide <b>cyanophos.</b> An analogue (hapten) of <b>cyanophos</b> was synthesized and was coupled to BSA to produce polyclonal antibodies from rabbits. The antisera were screened against another hapten coupled to ovalbumin (OVA). Using the sera of highest specificity, an antigen-coated ELISA was developed, which showed an I 50 of 310 ng/mL with the detection limit of 20 ng/mL. The antibodies showed negligible cross-reactivities with other organophosphorus pesticides except for parathion-methyl, which makes the assay suitable for the selective detection of <b>cyanophos...</b>|$|E
40|$|Continuous and {{excessive}} use of organophosphorus compounds {{has led to the}} contamination of water and soil ecosystems. The degradation of organophosphorus insecticides, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos- methyl, <b>cyanophos</b> and malathion in mineral salts media were studied. The effect of additional biofertilizers, singly or combined with organic amendments, on chlorpyrifos and <b>cyanophos</b> degrading activity in soil were investigated. Paenibacillus (Bacillus) polymyxa (Prazmowski) and Azospirillum lipoferum (Beijerinck) were found to degrade the organophosphorus insecticides, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos- methyl, <b>cyanophos</b> and malathion in mineral salts media as a carbon and phosphorus source. Paenibacillus (Bacillus) polymyxa (Prazmowski) appeared to be more effective than Azospirillum lipoferum in degrading all the tested organophosphate pesticides in mineral salts media. The half-life values (t 1 / 2) of chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos â€“ methyl, <b>cyanophos</b> and malathion were found to be undetectable, undetectable, 2. 4, and undetectable days in mineral salts media inoculated by Paenibacillus (Bacillus) polymyxa (Prazmowski),while they reached 1. 6, 0. 1, 5. 2, and 0. 8 days by Azospirillum lipoferu...|$|E
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was developed}} to detect organophosphorus pesticides using a phage-borne peptide that was isolated from a cyclic 8 -residue peptide phage library. The IC 50 values of the phage ELISA ranged from 1. 4 to 92. 1 L(- 1) for eight organophosphorus pesticides (parathion-methyl, parathion, fenitrothion, <b>cyanophos,</b> EPN, paraoxon-methyl, paraoxon, fenitrooxon). The sensitivity was improved 120 - and 2 -fold compared to conventional homologous and heterologous ELISA, respectively. The selectivity of the phage ELISA was evaluated by measuring its cross-reactivity with 23 organophosphorus pesticides, among which eight were the main cross-reactants. The spike recoveries were between 66. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePhotodegradation in aqueous {{solutions}} is {{an important}} pathway for many agrochemicals such as pesticides. In the present work, the photochemical transformation of <b>cyanophos</b> (CYA) was investigated in aqueous solutions using UV light within the 254 - 313 nm range as well as solar light. The study was performed {{in order to have}} a deep insight into the mechanistic pathways for the photochemical disappearance of CYA. Upon UV irradiation of an aerated solution of CYA, the degradation quantum yield was found equal to 1. 8 x 10 - 2. It is independent of the excitation wavelength but varies with oxygen concentration. It increased by a factor of 2 from oxygen-saturated to oxygen-free solution. Photosensitized experiments were performed using acrylamide and hydroquinone as energy acceptor and energy donor substrates, respectively. They show that both singlet and triplet excited states were involved in the photochemical behavior of CYA. The laser flash photolysis experiments clearly showed the involvement of the triplet excited state which was efficiently quenched by molecular oxygen and acrylamide with the rate constants 1. 97 x 109 and 2. 71 x 109 mol- 1 L s- 1, respectively. The photoproducts structures were proposed according to the mass spectral data using the LC/MS technique. The analytical study shows that various processes such as hydrolysis, homolytic bond dissociations and Photo-Fries process occur...|$|E
