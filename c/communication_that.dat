After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a <b>communication</b> <b>that</b> since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E
5|$|As {{the battle}} escalates, the Inhumans arrive to aid Captain Marvel while Ulysses has {{a vision of}} Miles Morales killing Steve Rogers. In reaction, Captain Marvel places Morales under arrest. While Iron Man and Captain Marvel argue the merits of arresting Morales, Rogers gives Morales the {{opportunity}} to decide for himself and Morales asks to go home. As Morales leaves, Maria Hill places Iron Man's team under arrest but Doctor Strange teleports them to one of Nick Fury's safehouses. At the safehouse, the younger Avengers sneak off to find Morales before the adults. Meanwhile, Hill receives <b>communication</b> <b>that</b> Morales is at the United States Capitol, the location seen in Ulysses' vision.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{believed}} that, {{by establishing}} a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral Ottoman Empire), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against British India, possibly {{in conjunction with the}} Tipu Sultan of Seringapatam, that might successfully drive the British out of the war. The campaign would sever the chain of <b>communication</b> <b>that</b> connected Britain with India, {{an essential part of the}} British Empire whose trade generated the wealth that Britain required to prosecute the war successfully. The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel as far from France as possible. During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at Toulon. He also formed the Commission des Sciences et des Arts, a body of scientists and engineers intended to establish a French colony in Egypt. Napoleon kept the destination of the expedition top secret—most of the army's officers did not know of its target, and Bonaparte did not publicly reveal his goal until the first stage of the expedition was complete.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and <b>communication</b> <b>that</b> pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable <b>communication</b> <b>that</b> if the British were to {{pass the}} Rowlatt Act, he will appeal Indians to start civil disobedience. The British {{government}} ignored him, passed the law stating it will not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi. People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they own. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side uses violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested. People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some Britons {{and parts of the}} British media as an appropriate response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the British government. Gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Capacity of a {{compound}} channel without feedback {{is defined in}} a pessimistic manner as the maximum rate determined {{before the start of}} <b>communication</b> such <b>that</b> <b>communication</b> is reliable. In the presence of feedback, the transmission rate can adapt to the channel chosen by nature. Thus, capacity can be defined in an opportunistic manner as the maximum rate de-termined at the end of <b>communication</b> such <b>that</b> <b>communication</b> is reliable. Under this definition, transmission rate and error exponents are regions rather than scalars. In this paper, variable length communication over {{a compound}} channel with feedback is formulated, its opportunistic capacity region is characterized, and lower bounds for its error exponent region are provided.
