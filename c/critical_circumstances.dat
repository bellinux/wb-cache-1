For example, vapor deposition cannot be utilized to prepare the nanofluids containing high boiling point or non-crystal nanoparticles. Laser ablation and vacuum buried arc methods are in high-cost and require <b>critical</b> <b>circumstance</b> conditions. The chemical method generally requires the services of specific reaction conditions such as required pH value and temperature. And it can easily synthesize some by-products in the liquids [74].

The precursor solution included titanium isopropoxide and isopropanol as well as double-distilled water. It can be concluded that this mixture with such specific pH value and complex chemical compositions could not be used as the heat transfer nanofluids. Therefore, they dried the synthesized TiO 2 nanoparticles and then re-dispersed them into required base working fluids including water, EG, and paraffin oil with ultrasonic treatments to obtain the required nanofluids. It can be concluded that the one-step method is hardly to be utilized for some nanofluids with specific ingredients, especially for the nanofluids with pure water, oil, refrigerant, etc. as base fluids and also for an application system containing volatile gas.|$|R

Seeing no probability of reaching a space of clear water in which to stand off and on during the night, and no prospect of shelter under any of the islands, I found myself under the necessity of adopting a hazardous measure; and with the concurrence of the master's opinion, we steered directly before the wind for the main coast, where the appearance of some beaches, behind other islands, gave a hope of finding anchorage. At seven in the evening we entered a small sandy bay; and finding it sheltered everywhere except to the south-westward, in which direction there were many islands and rocks in the offing to break off the sea, the anchor was dropped in 7 fathoms, sandy bottom.

It is probable that the paramount desire of the Duke in his effort to confirm his power was to rally and restore the ranks of the Tory party, disturbed rather than broken up by the passing of the Relief Bill. During the very heat of the struggle it was significantly observed that the head of the powerful family of Lowther, in the House of Commons, was never asked to resign his office, although he himself and his following voted invariably against the Government measure. The order the day was the utmost courtesy to the rebels, who were treated, as some alleged, with more consideration than the compliant. At the same time the desire of the Whigs to connect, perhaps even to merge themselves with the ministerial ranks, was not neglected. A Whig had been appointed to succeed the eccentric and too uncompromising Wetherell in the office of attorney-general, other posts had been placed at their disposal, and one even, an old companion in arms of the Duke, had entered the cabinet.

At his return, he found, however, that several still adhered to him; but here, too, incapable of acting with rigor, he agreed to an accommodation, which placed the crown on the head of his rebellious son, and only left to himself a sphere of government as narrow as his genius,--the district of Kent, whither he retired to enjoy an inglorious privacy with a wife whom he had married in France.|$|E

Also prioritization of these factors and offering some solutions and suggestions for departing from this situation to a suitable one are the other goals in this essay.

The problems from which this branch suffers are included into two genres of internal organizational and external organizational factors. In this article managerial dysfunction, machine depreciation, high cost price, disrespecting the standards and low quality of production, raw materials with low quality and, counter-productivity of working staff have been considered as six internal organizational factors. In addition, five external factors including lack of government support, decrease in market requirement, investor's lack of job security, high rate of banking interest and disabled system of banking facilities, and formal/informal smuggling of goods, have been noted as the most effective factors explaining crisis in this industry.
