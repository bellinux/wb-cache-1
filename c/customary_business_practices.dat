But does management matter in micro and small firms, {{where the majority of}} the labor force in developing countries works? We develop 26 questions that measure <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> in marketing, stock-keeping, recordkeeping, and financial planning. These questions have been administered in surveys in Bangladesh, Chile, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria and Sri Lanka. We show that variation in <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> explains as much of the variation in outcomes – sales, profits and labor productivity and TFP – in microenterprises as in larger enterprises. Panel data from three countries indicate that better <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> predict higher survival rates and faster sales growth. The association of <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> with firm outcomes is robust to including numerous measures of the owner’s human capital. We find that owners with higher human capital, children of entrepreneurs, and firms with employees employ better <b>business</b> <b>practices.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The end of {{the cold}} war has {{resulted}} in many changes for the Nuclear Weapons Complex (NWC). We now work in a smaller complex, with reduced resources, a smaller stockpile, and no new phase 3 weapons development programs. This new environment demands that we re-evaluate the way we design and produce nuclear weapons. The Defense Program (DP) <b>Business</b> <b>Practices</b> Re-engineering activity was initiated to improve the design and production efficiency of the DP Sector. The activity had six goals: (1) to identify DP <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> that are exercised by the Product Realization Process (PRP); (2) to determine the impact (positive, negative, or none) of these practices on defined, prioritized customer criteria; (3) to identify <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> that are candidates for elimination or re-engineering; (4) to select two or three <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> for re-engineering; (5) to re-engineer the selected business practices; and (6) to exercise the re-engineered practices on three pilot development projects. <b>Business</b> <b>practices</b> include technical and well as administrative procedures that are exercised by the PRP. A QFD exercise was performed to address (1) -(4). The customer that identified, defined, and prioritized the criteria to rate the <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> was the Block Change Advisory Group. Five criteria were identified: cycle time, flexibility, cost, product performance/quality, and best <b>practices.</b> Forty-nine <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> were identified and rated per the criteria. From this analysis, the group made preliminary recommendations as to which practices would be addressed in the re-engineering activity. Sixteen practices will be addressed in the re-engineering activity. These practices will then be piloted on three projects: (1) the Electronic Component Assembly (ECA) /Radar Project, (2) the B 61 Mod 11, and (3) Warhead Protection Program (WPP) ...|$|R
