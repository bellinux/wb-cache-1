5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share <b>cholesterol</b> as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, {{the first step in}} steroidogenesis is <b>cholesterol</b> uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire <b>cholesterol</b> through two paths. The main source is through dietary <b>cholesterol</b> transported via the blood as <b>cholesterol</b> esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of <b>cholesterol</b> is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the lysosome, <b>cholesterol</b> esters are converted to free <b>cholesterol,</b> which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E
5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of <b>cholesterol.</b> Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of <b>cholesterol</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal <b>cholesterol</b> absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for <b>cholesterol</b> could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal <b>cholesterol,</b> thereby limiting the <b>cholesterol</b> uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma <b>cholesterol</b> and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic <b>cholesterol</b> and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cholesterol</b> {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total <b>cholesterol,</b> markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total <b>cholesterol</b> levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total <b>cholesterol</b> levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. <b>Cholesterol</b> levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|LDL <b>cholesterol</b> {{normally}} circulates in {{the body}} for 2.5 days, and subsequently the apolipoprotein B portion of LDL <b>cholesterol</b> binds to the LDL receptor on the liver cells, triggering its uptake and digestion. This process results in the removal of LDL from the circulatory system. Synthesis of <b>cholesterol</b> by the liver is suppressed in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. In FH, LDL receptor function is reduced or absent, and LDL circulates for an average duration of 4.5 days, resulting in significantly increased level of LDL <b>cholesterol</b> in the blood with normal levels of other lipoproteins. In mutations of ApoB, reduced binding of LDL particles to the receptor causes the increased level of LDL <b>cholesterol.</b> It is not known how the mutation causes LDL receptor dysfunction in mutations of PCSK9 and ARH.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{may also}} play a role in {{supporting}} cardiovascular health by modulating <b>cholesterol</b> and fat uptake. Clinical trials in adult populations have shown that MFGM could positively affect markers associated with cardiovascular disease including lowering serum <b>cholesterol</b> and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|More {{controversial}} is {{the addition}} of ezetimibe, which inhibits <b>cholesterol</b> absorption in the gut. While it reduces LDL <b>cholesterol,</b> {{it does not appear}} to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the intima-media thickness. Whether this means that ezetimibe is of no overall benefit in FH is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The initial part of {{conversion}} of <b>cholesterol</b> into steroid hormones involves {{a number of}} enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family that {{are located in the}} inner membrane of mitochondria. Transport of <b>cholesterol</b> from the outer to the inner membrane is facilitated by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and is the rate-limiting step of steroid synthesis.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert panel}} in 2006 advised on early {{combination}} therapy with LDL apheresis, statins, and <b>cholesterol</b> absorption inhibitors {{in children with}} homozygous FH at the highest risk.|$|E
5|$|Beef is an {{excellent}} source of zinc, selenium, phosphorus, iron, and B vitamins. Bison meat is lower in fat and <b>cholesterol</b> than beef, but has a higher protein content.|$|E
5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower <b>cholesterol</b> and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when <b>cholesterol</b> levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of <b>cholesterol</b> since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL <b>cholesterol</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing <b>cholesterol</b> levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the <b>cholesterol</b> levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence <b>cholesterol,</b> and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E
5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} {{may play}} a role in supporting cardiovascular health by modulating <b>cholesterol</b> and fat uptake.|$|E
5|$|Sporadic {{publications}} {{have also}} mentioned a weak but nonetheless {{significant effect of}} APOA5 variants on plasma HDL-cholesterol and non-HDL <b>cholesterol</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|High <b>cholesterol.</b> Taking alfalfa seeds {{seems to}} lower total <b>cholesterol</b> and “bad” low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) <b>cholesterol</b> {{in people with}} high <b>cholesterol</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Eating dietary <b>cholesterol</b> {{causes a}} small rise in serum <b>cholesterol.</b> Dietary limits for <b>cholesterol</b> were {{proposed}} in United States, {{but not in}} Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia. However, there is no conclusive evidence regarding the effect of dietary <b>cholesterol</b> on cardiovascular disease. Consequently, in 2015 the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee in the United States removed its recommendation of limiting <b>cholesterol</b> intake.|$|E
25|$|Diet has {{an effect}} on blood <b>cholesterol,</b> but the size of this effect varies between individuals. Moreover, when dietary <b>cholesterol</b> intake goes down, {{production}} (principally by the liver) typically increases, so that blood <b>cholesterol</b> changes can be modest or even elevated. This compensatory response may explain hypercholesterolemia in anorexia. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that dietary <b>cholesterol</b> is associated with higher blood <b>cholesterol.</b> Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL. LDL and total <b>cholesterol</b> also increases by very high fructose intake.|$|E
25|$|LDL receptors {{are used}} up during <b>cholesterol</b> absorption, and its {{synthesis}} is regulated by SREBP, the same protein {{that controls the}} synthesis of <b>cholesterol</b> de novo, according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant <b>cholesterol</b> will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new <b>cholesterol</b> in LDL molecules from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in <b>cholesterol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drinking {{green tea}} or taking green tea {{supplements}} decreases the blood concentration of total <b>cholesterol</b> (about 7mg/dL), LDL <b>cholesterol</b> (about 2mg/dL), {{and does not}} affect the concentration of HDL <b>cholesterol.</b> A 2013 Cochrane review performed a meta-analysis of longer-term randomized controlled trials (>3 months duration) and concluded that green tea consumption lowers total and LDL <b>cholesterol</b> concentrations in the blood.|$|E
25|$|In {{biochemical}} experiments radiolabelled {{forms of}} <b>cholesterol,</b> such as tritiated-cholesterol are used. These derivatives undergo degradation upon storage {{and it is}} essential to purify <b>cholesterol</b> prior to use. <b>Cholesterol</b> can be purified using small Sephadex LH-20 columns.|$|E
25|$|Plants make <b>cholesterol</b> in {{very small}} amounts. Plants {{manufacture}} phytosterols (substances chemically similar to <b>cholesterol),</b> which {{can compete with}} <b>cholesterol</b> for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing <b>cholesterol</b> reabsorption. When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of <b>cholesterol,</b> they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ~200–300mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700mg/day.|$|E
25|$|A {{blood sample}} after 12-hour fasting is {{taken by a}} doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to {{determine}} a lipoprotein profile. This measures total <b>cholesterol,</b> LDL (bad) <b>cholesterol,</b> HDL (good) <b>cholesterol,</b> and triglycerides. It is recommended to test <b>cholesterol</b> at least every five years if a person has total <b>cholesterol</b> of 5.2mmol/L or more (200+mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL (good) <b>cholesterol</b> less than 1mmol/L (40mg/dL), or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Other risk factors for heart disease include Diabetes, Hypertension (or use of anti-hypertensive medications), low HDL, family history of CAD and hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking.|$|E
25|$|For healthy adults, the UK National Health Service {{recommends}} upper {{limits of}} total <b>cholesterol</b> of 5nbsp&mmol/L, and low-density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> (LDL) of 3nbsp&mmol/L. For people {{at high risk}} of cardiovascular disease, the recommended limit for total <b>cholesterol</b> is 4nbsp&mmol/L, and 2nbsp&mmol/L for LDL.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{an episode}} of <b>cholesterol</b> emboli is {{generally}} symptomatic, i.e. it deals with the symptoms and complications but cannot reverse the phenomenon itself. In kidney failure resulting from <b>cholesterol</b> crystal emboli, statins (medication that reduces <b>cholesterol</b> levels) {{have been shown to}} halve the risk of requiring hemodialysis.|$|E
25|$|While <b>cholesterol</b> is {{essential}} for membranes and steroid hormones, excess <b>cholesterol</b> affects blood flow impairing cognitive function in vascular dementia.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the cell}} membrane, <b>cholesterol</b> also {{functions}} in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. <b>Cholesterol</b> {{is essential for}} the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrin-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The role of <b>cholesterol</b> in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using methyl beta cyclodextrin (MβCD) to remove <b>cholesterol</b> from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that <b>cholesterol</b> is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. In multiple layers, <b>cholesterol</b> and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a myelin sheath, rich in <b>cholesterol</b> since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. Demyelination (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed {{to be part of the}} basis for multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|The enteric loss of bile acids {{results in}} {{increased}} synthesis of bile acids from <b>cholesterol</b> {{which in turn}} reduces body <b>cholesterol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Cholesterol</b> is one {{of three}} major classes of lipids which all animal cells use to {{construct}} their membranes and is thus manufactured by all animal cells. Plant cells do not manufacture <b>cholesterol.</b> It is also the precursor of the steroid hormones and bile acids. Since <b>cholesterol</b> is insoluble in water, it is transported in the blood plasma within protein particles (lipoproteins). Lipoproteins are classified by their density: very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL). All the lipoproteins carry <b>cholesterol,</b> but elevated levels of the lipoproteins other than HDL (termed non-HDL <b>cholesterol),</b> particularly LDL-cholesterol, are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. In contrast, higher levels of HDL <b>cholesterol</b> are protective.|$|E
25|$|As an {{isolated}} molecule, <b>cholesterol</b> is only minimally soluble in water; it dissolves into the (water-based) bloodstream only at exceedingly small concentrations. Instead, <b>cholesterol</b> is transported within lipoproteins, complex discoidal particles with exterior amphiphilic proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; i.e. transport via emulsification. Triglycerides and <b>cholesterol</b> esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and <b>cholesterol,</b> being amphipathic, are transported in the monolayer {{surface of the}} lipoprotein particle.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthesis of <b>cholesterol</b> is {{directly}} {{regulated by the}} <b>cholesterol</b> levels present, though the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of intracellular <b>cholesterol</b> in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2). In the presence of <b>cholesterol,</b> SREBP is bound to two other proteins: SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) and INSIG-1. When <b>cholesterol</b> levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when <b>cholesterol</b> levels are low.|$|E
25|$|Most {{ingested}} <b>cholesterol</b> is esterified, and esterified <b>cholesterol</b> {{is poorly}} absorbed. The body also compensates for any absorption of additional <b>cholesterol</b> by reducing <b>cholesterol</b> synthesis. For these reasons, <b>cholesterol</b> in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if {{any effect on}} concentrations of <b>cholesterol</b> in the blood. However, during the first seven hours after ingestion of <b>cholesterol,</b> as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various lipoproteins (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase. It {{is also important to}} recognize, however, that the concentrations measured in the samples of blood plasma vary with the measurement methods used. Traditional, cheaper methods do not reflect (a) which lipoproteins are transporting the various fat molecules, nor (b) which cells are ingesting, burning or exporting the fat molecules being measured as totals from samples of blood plasma.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{atheroma}} {{development and}} progression {{as opposed to}} regression, the key issue has always been <b>cholesterol</b> transport patterns, not <b>cholesterol</b> concentration itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cholesterol</b> binds to and {{affects the}} gating {{of a number}} of ion {{channels}} such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, GABAA receptor, and the inward-rectifier potassium ion channel. <b>Cholesterol</b> also activates the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), and may be the endogenous ligand for the receptor. The constitutively active nature of the receptor may be {{explained by the fact that}} <b>cholesterol</b> is ubiquitous in the body. Inhibition of ERRα signaling by reduction of <b>cholesterol</b> production has been identified as a key mediator of the effects of statins and bisphosphonates on bone, muscle, and macrophages. On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the ERRα should be de-orphanized and classified as a receptor for <b>cholesterol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Increasing soluble fiber {{consumption}} {{has been}} shown to reduce levels of LDL <b>cholesterol,</b> with each additional gram of soluble fiber reducing LDL by an average of 2.2mg/dL (0.057mmol/L). Increasing consumption of whole grains also reduces LDL <b>cholesterol,</b> with whole grain oats being particularly effective. Inclusion of 2 g per day of phytosterols and phytostanols and 10 to 20 g per day of soluble fiber decreases dietary <b>cholesterol</b> absorption. A diet high in fructose can raise LDL <b>cholesterol</b> levels in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Abnormally {{low levels}} of <b>cholesterol</b> are termed hypocholesterolemia. Research into the causes of this state is {{relatively}} limited, but some studies suggest a link with depression, cancer, and cerebral hemorrhage. In general, the low <b>cholesterol</b> levels {{seem to be a}} consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness. A genetic defect in <b>cholesterol</b> synthesis causes Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, which is often associated with low plasma <b>cholesterol</b> levels. Hyperthyroidism, or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the LDL receptor, may result in hypocholesterolemia.|$|E
25|$|An {{elevated}} {{concentration of}} plasma <b>cholesterol,</b> especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) <b>cholesterol,</b> is now generally {{accepted as a}} major risk factor {{for the development of}} coronary heart disease. The objective is to decrease excess levels of <b>cholesterol</b> to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. <b>Cholesterol</b> is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the isoprenes that are building-blocks of squalene, the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to <b>cholesterol.</b> A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of <b>cholesterol</b> resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and <b>cholesterol.</b> A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is {{at the level of the}} microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.|$|E
25|$|Androgen therapy can {{adversely}} affect the {{blood lipid profile}} by causing decreases in HDL (good) <b>cholesterol,</b> increases in LDL (bad) <b>cholesterol,</b> and increases in triglycerides.|$|E
