5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} <b>contact</b> <b>UNIT</b> to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. The Doctor has them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds {{it really is a}} swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E

While a General <b>Contact</b> <b>Unit</b> (GCU) does not strictly need a crew (and could construct artificial avatars when it did), a real human crew adds richness to its existence, and offers distraction during otherwise dull periods.

40|$|DE 102007004509 A 1 UPAB: 20080721 NOVELTY - The {{unit has}} a base {{electrode}} (20) made from an optically transparent electrically conducting material, and an organic {{light emitting diode}} covered with an electrically insulating intermediate layer (50). An electrically conducting metal layer (60) is arranged on the intermediate layer and forms an electrically conducting connection to the base electrode along with <b>contact</b> <b>units</b> (61) guided through the intermediate layer. The diode is arranged on an optically transparent substrate (10), and the intermediate layer is formed from a material e. g. nitride, oxide or polymer e. g. acrylate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing lighting units. USE - Lighting unit. ADVANTAGE - The electrically conducting metal layer is arranged on the intermediate layer and forms the electrically conducting connection to the base electrode along with the <b>contact</b> <b>units</b> guided through the intermediate layer, thus homogeneously emitting electromagnetic radiation over the entire area for lighting purposes...|$|R

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{formulation}} {{for the large}} sliding contact problem is discussed. With respect t o a set of two material points the free and contacting state are distinguished. Because of the possibly occurring large slidings, the two points contact conditions are transformed to contact conditions with respect to larger sets of points, the so-called <b>contact</b> <b>units.</b> An incremental solution strategy is presented which calculates the equilibrium solution that obeys these contact conditions using an iterative procedure. Part of this strat-egy is the identification of actual sets of contacting material points. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by some case-studies...|$|R

Eva tells him he was modeled on the real Fred Stiller, a person whom Eva loved, but became mad with power from directing the simulation in the world above. While Stiller is programmed to die in an ambush, Eva switches the minds of the two Stillers and brings the simulated Stiller into the real world.|$|E

50|$|On 22 June 1944, I-41 was {{detached}} from her group {{and ordered to}} Guam to evacuate naval aviators stranded there.

After sunset she surfaced 1,100 yards offshore and <b>contacted</b> <b>units</b> on land. Two barges managed to transfer a total of 106 pilots (mostly from the 705th Naval Air Group) before an approaching patrol bomber (a Consolidated B-24 Liberator) forced the submarine to dive. Further embarkation was aborted. The submarine and her passengers returned to Ōita on Kyushu, landing there on 30 June 1944.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, {{one of the}} {{identity}} units in the simulation attempts suicide. This unit is deleted by Stiller's colleague Walfang, to keep the simulation stable. To investigate {{the reasons for the}} suicide, Stiller contacts the <b>contact</b> <b>unit</b> of the simulated world. The unit, called Einstein, is the only identity unit who knows about the simulation, and this is necessary to run the program. In an attempt to become a real person, Einstein switches his mind into Walfang's body while the latter is in contact with the simulated world. Einstein gives Stiller an explanation for the mysteries, vanishing memories, and vanishing persons. He tells him that the real world is nothing else but a simulation of a real world one level above.|$|E

The Doctor contacts the Master, offering to return his dematerialisation circuit {{in exchange for the}} missile. The Master agrees on condition he will come alone. But the Doctor uses Barnham to transport the Keller Machine to the airfield and turn the Mind Parasite loose on the Master. With the Master helpless, the Doctor is able to trigger the missile's self-destruct circuit and the Thunderbolt and the Keller Machine are destroyed. The Master uses the chaos to escape with his dematerialisation circuit, killing Barnham in the process. He contacts the Doctor by telephone to taunt him that he is now free while the Doctor remains trapped in his exile on Earth.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{states have}} {{recognised}} {{the need for}} representation of an incapacitated person when a benevolent relative or friend cannot be found to act on his behalf, this is {{the function of the}} Office of the Official Solicitor. The Official Solicitor becomes formally involved when appointed by the Court, and he can act as his own solicitor, or instruct a private firm of solicitors to represent him. The Official Solicitor has two main functions. Firstly, in England and Wales, his main function is to represent minors who are incapable of representing themselves in the High Court and in the Court of Protection. He also acts as last resort personal representative for the estate of a deceased person, or trustee of a trust. Secondly, in the area of international child protection obligations to which the UK government is a signatory, the Official Solicitor deals with cases brought under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction through the International Child Abduction and <b>Contact</b> <b>Unit</b> (ICACU). In this capacity it deals with international child abduction and contact issues and handles maintenance enforcement in cases where one parent lives outside the UK through the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Unit (REMO).|$|E
50|$|On {{his way to}} UNIT HQ {{in order}} to deliver some {{radioactive}} materials, Warrant Officer John Benton has an unexpected flashback to his childhood in Lancashire. After visiting the grave of his older brother Chris, Benton has a further flashback to his childhood in 1944. Later, having failed to <b>contact</b> <b>UNIT</b> successfully, Benton senses that there is potential trouble lurking nearby and orders Willis to repair the jeep whilst he himself investigates. Unbeknownst to both of them, there is a stranger lurking in the woods who aims to steal the radioactive material. As Benton wanders through the woods, he is further haunted by his childhood; it is revealed that Benton blames himself {{for the death of}} his older brother Christopher- whilst playing a game of chase, Christopher slipped off a wall and fell to his death. A ghostly entity, which takes the form of Benton's father, torments John and tries to convince him that he is weak and unworthy of being in the army. John eventually breaks the hold over the spirit and realizes that his brother's death was an accident and that he was actually trying to save him. Returning back to the jeep, having now exorcised his demons, he manages to subdue the mystery man who was attempting to steal the radioactive source. Benton and Willis leave the woods and resume their journey whilst the voice of his father states that the game is now over.|$|E
