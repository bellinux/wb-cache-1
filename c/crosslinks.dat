40|$|This {{study focused}} on thermostabilization of enzymes in {{solution}} by intramolecular <b>crosslinking</b> of the specific functional groups within an enzyme molecule. Three model enzymes were used: α-amylase of Aspergillus oryzae (EC 3. 2. 1. 1), β-galactosidase of Aspergillus oryzae (EC 3. 2. 1. 23) and extracellular invertase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <b>Crosslinking</b> was examined using the following homobifunctional reagents: diisocyanates (O=C=N(CH 2) nN=C=O, n = 4, 6, 8), diimidoesters (CH 3 O(=NH) C(CH 2) nC(=NH) OCH 3, n = 4, 5, 6) and diamines (NH 2 (CH 2) nNH 2, n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12). The concentration of the enzymes was kept low at 0. 9 μM in attempts to promote intramolecular <b>crosslinking</b> as opposed to intermolecular <b>crosslinking.</b> Only invertase could be stabilized relative to controls by <b>crosslinking</b> with diisocyanates. Invertase (0. 9 μM) <b>crosslinked</b> with 1, 4 -diisocyanatobutane (n = 4; or butamethylene diisocyanate, BMDC) and 1, 6 -diisocyanatohexane (n = 6) showed enhanced thermostability. Stability was improved dramatically by <b>crosslinking</b> invertase with 20 - 30 μM of the reagent. Molecular engineering of invertase by <b>crosslinking</b> reduced its first-order thermal denaturation constant at 60 °C from 1. 232 min- 1 for the native enzyme to 0. 831 min- 1 for the stabilized enzyme. Similarly, the best <b>crosslinking</b> treatment increased the activation energy for thermal denaturation from 372 kJ mol- 1 for the native invertase to 517 kJ mol- 1 for the stabilized enzyme. Values of the Michaelis- Menten parameters (Km and νmax) showed a reduced efficiency of invertase after the <b>crosslinking</b> treatment. The nature of the <b>crosslinking</b> was examined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and multiple angle laser light scattering (MALLS). Depending on the conditions used, both intermolecular and intramolecular <b>crosslinking</b> occurred. The estimated molecular weight of the intermolecularly <b>crosslinked</b> invertase appeared to be much higher compared to the intramolecularly <b>crosslinked</b> invertase and the native invertase. In attempts to simplify certain analyses, {{attempts were made to}} remove the carbohydrate moiety from <b>crosslinked</b> invertase (a glycoprotein) molecule. Deglycosylation with PNGase F achieved a significant reduction of carbohydrate for the native invertase but not for the intra- and intermolecularly <b>crosslinked</b> invertase. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements showed that <b>crosslinking</b> with BMDC affected slightly the secondary structure of invertase. The nature of the <b>crosslinking</b> that might be occurring in invertase molecule was further studied using small model oligopeptides, small nonglycosylated enzymes (hen egg white lysozyme and pepsin) and glycoprotein models (ovalbumin). <b>Crosslinking</b> of the model pentapeptide (0. 9 μM) suggested that <b>crosslinking</b> with BMDC involved reaction between BMDC and the amino group of lysine or the carboxylate at C-terminal of the pentapeptide. Using a heptapeptide (1 mM) in <b>crosslinking</b> with BMDC showed a changed hydrophobicity of the <b>crosslinked</b> peptide.

Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and <b>crosslinks</b> the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense.

25|$|The {{properties}} of a polyurethane are {{greatly influenced by}} the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make it. Long, flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, elastic polymer. High amounts of crosslinking give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with lots of <b>crosslinks</b> produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high. In some respects a piece of polyurethane {{can be regarded as}} one giant molecule. One consequence of this is that typical polyurethanes do not soften or melt when they are heated; they are thermosetting polymers.

500|$|The cyclol {{hypothesis}} {{is the first}} structural model of a folded, globular protein. [...] It was developed by Dorothy Wrinch in the late 1930s, and was based on three assumptions. [...] Firstly, the hypothesis assumes that two peptide groups can be crosslinked by a cyclol reaction (Figure 1); these <b>crosslinks</b> are covalent analogs of non-covalent hydrogen bonds between peptide groups. [...] These reactions have been observed in the ergopeptides and other compounds. [...] Secondly, it assumes that, under some conditions, amino acids will naturally make the maximum possible number of cyclol <b>crosslinks,</b> resulting in cyclol molecules (Figure 2) and cyclol fabrics (Figure 3). [...] These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed. [...] Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a tertiary structure corresponding to Platonic solids and semiregular polyhedra formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges. [...] Such [...] "closed cyclol" [...] molecules have not been observed either.|$|E
500|$|Wrinch {{developed}} this suggestion into a full-fledged model of protein structure. [...] The basic cyclol model {{was laid out}} in her first paper (1936).

[...] Assuming that the cyclol form of the peptide bond could be more stable than the amide form, Wrinch concluded that certain cyclic peptides would naturally make the maximal number of cyclol bonds (such as cyclol 6, Figure 2). [...] Such cyclol molecules would have hexagonal symmetry, if the chemical bonds were taken as having the same length, roughly 1.5Å; for comparison, the N-C and C-C bonds have the lengths 1.42Å and 1.54Å, respectively.|$|E
500|$|DNA repair is a {{collection}} of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome. In human cells, both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage, resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day. Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes. Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell's genome, which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis. As a consequence, the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure. [...] When normal repair processes fail, and when cellular apoptosis does not occur, irreparable DNA damage may occur, including double-strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages (interstrand <b>crosslinks</b> or ICLs). This can eventually lead to malignant tumors, or cancer as per the two hit hypothesis.|$|E

500|$|For thermosets, {{typically}} {{two different}} chemical components are {{injected into the}} barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions which eventually <b>crosslinks</b> the material into a single connected network of molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid.

This typically means that the residence time and temperature of the chemical precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be reduced by minimising the barrel's volume capacity and by maximising the cycle times. These factors {{have led to the}} use of a thermally isolated, cold injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot mould, which increases the rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component. After the part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical precursors, and the mould opens to eject the moulded parts.
