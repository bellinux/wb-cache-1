5|$|Although Kuala Lumpur is {{touted as}} one of the host cities for the Formula One World Championship, the open-wheel auto racing A1 Grand Prix and the Motorcycle Grand Prix, races are held at the Sepang International Circuit in Sepang in the {{neighbouring}} state of Selangor. The Formula One event contributes significantly to tourist arrivals and tourism income to Kuala Lumpur. This was evident during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. Despite cities around Asia suffering declining tourist arrivals, Kuala Lumpur tourist arrivals increased from 6,210,900 in 1997 to 10,221,600 in 2000, or 64.6% increase in tourist arrivals. In 2015, the Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit was <b>constructed</b> <b>to</b> host the Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix motor racing event.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were <b>constructed</b> <b>to</b> mitigate the catastrophic erosion {{that came with the}} creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end of}} the canyon where a sharp bend in the creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs. In flooding events, this area generally sustains heavy damage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. System self-contextualizability is {{the system}} ability to {{autonomously}} adapt its behavior to the uncontrollable relevant context to keep its objectives satisfied. Self-contextualizable system must have alternative behaviors each fitting {{to a set of}} contexts. We propose to start considering context at the level of requirements engineering, adopting Tropos goal model to express requirements and complementing it with our proposed context analysis. We define variation points on goal model where a context-based decision might need to be taken, and propose <b>constructs</b> <b>to</b> analyze context. While goal analysis provides <b>constructs</b> <b>to</b> hierarchically analyze goals and discover alternative sets of tasks to be executed to satisfy a goal, our proposed context analysis provides <b>constructs</b> <b>to</b> hierarchically analyze context and discover alternative sets of facts to be monitored to verify a context. ...|$|R
