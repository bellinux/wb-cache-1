5|$|Lines 4, 5 and 6 of the Oslo Metro {{operate to}} Nydalen, {{each with a}} 15-minute headway. Lines 4 and 5 operate {{counterclockwise}} through the ring via {{the western part of}} town into the Common Tunnel, while line 6 operates clockwise via the eastern part into the Common Tunnel. Line 5 continues eastwards only to Storo before stopping; lines 4 and 6 swap numbers between Nydalen and Storo. Travel time from Nydalen to Stortinget is 13 minutes clockwise and 12 minutes counterclockwise. Therefore, any traveler heading for the city center can get on the first train, independent of its direction (except line 5 to Storo), and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> it will be the quickest connection to the downtown area.|$|E

Wuvulu speakers use a realis mood to convey past tense as speakers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> about events that have occurred. In some cases, realis mood is used to convey present tense — often to indicate a state of being. Wuvulu speakers use an irrealis mood to convey future tense.|$|E
25|$|With {{renewable}} {{water resources}} of only 125cubic meters per capita/year Yemen {{is one of}} the most water-scarce countries in the world. This level is less than one tenth of the threshold for water stress, which is defined at 1,700cubic meters per capita/year. Total water demand of 3,400 million cubic metres per year exceeds renewable resources of 2,500 million cubic metres per year, thus leading to a steady decline in groundwater levels, varying between 1m per year in the Tuban-Abyan area and 6–8m per year in the Sana’a basin. Today, there are between 45,000 and 70,000 wells in Yemen, the majority of which are under private control. No one <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> of the exact number, as almost all were drilled without license. Agriculture takes the lion’s share of Yemen’s water resources, sucking up almost 90 percent, and it is estimated that qat production accounts for 37 percent of all water used in irrigation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} slopes of Devil's Peak, above Groote Schuur Hospital, an animal camp bequeathed to the City of Cape Town by Cecil John Rhodes {{has been used}} in recent years as part of the Quagga Project. The quaggas used to roam the Cape Peninsula, the Karoo and the Free State in large numbers, but were hunted to {{extinction}} during the early 1800s. The last quagga died in an Amsterdam zoo in 1883. In 1987 a project was launched by Reinhold Rau to back-breed the quagga, after it had been established, using mitochondrial DNA obtained from museum specimens, that the quagga was closely related to the plains zebra, and on 20 January 2005 a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping was born. These quagga-like zebras are officially known as Rau quaggas, as no one <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> that they are anything more than quagga look-alikes. The animal camp above Groote Schuur Hospital has several good looking Rau quaggas, but they are unfortunately not easily seen except from within the game camp, which is quite large and undulating, and the animals are few. The animal camp is not open to the public.|$|E

But that did not diminish the power and influence of the clas at Llanbadarn Fawr. By the middle of the ninth century the clas was clearly the wealthiest in the province. The renowned Asser, scholar and adviser to Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, may have been educated at Llanbadarn Fawr. If this is correct it would be a strong indication that Llanbadarn's reputation for learning was well-founded.|$|E

He writes that although Coady tried to mask his feelings behind a veneer of faith in democracy and ordinary people, the veneer wore thin later in his life, and Coady’s faith in others was replaced by a sense of betrayal and a tendency towards manipulation.|$|E

Duns Scotus however argued that inductive inference from {{a finite number of}} particulars to a universal generalization was justified by [...] "a proposition reposing in the soul, 'Whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that cause.

We <b>can</b> <b>be</b> more <b>certain</b> that cell lines are developed from the particular tissues of interest and accurate anatomical and appropriate clinico-pathological control tissues are also harvested. We <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> of less cell line cross contamination. </p...|$|R

2500|$|The {{wording of}} the {{proposed}} advert caused considerable debate among atheists and Christians alike and Sherine discussed it in a post-launch article, [...] "Probably the best atheist bus campaign ever", on the Guardian's [...] "Comment Is Free" [...] section. Dawkins stated that he preferred the wording [...] "There is almost certainly no God". Ariane Sherine claims {{it is necessary to}} be factually accurate, and that as it is impossible to disprove the existence of God it is only possible to say one 'probably' does not exist. Critic D. J. Taylor felt that this qualification let the campaign down, but admired it for introducing some tentativeness into an often polarised debate, while atheists including A. C. Grayling think that they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> there is no God and therefore the word 'probably' should not be used. It was also suggested that inserting the word would avoid a breach of the Advertising Standards Authority's rules.|$|E
2500|$|While many {{agreements}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain,</b> {{it is by}} {{no means}} certain that in the case of social and domestic affairs people want their agreements to be legally binding. In Balfour v Balfour Atkin LJ held that Mr Balfour's agreement to pay his wife £30 a month while he worked in Ceylon should be presumed unenforceable, because people do not generally intend such promises in the social sphere to create legal consequences. Similarly, an agreement between friends at a pub, or a daughter and her mother will fall into this sphere, but not a couple who are on the verge of separation, and not friends engaged in big transactions, particularly where one side relies heavily to their detriment on the assurances of the other. This presumption of unenforceability can always be rebutted by express agreement otherwise, for instance by writing the deal down. By contrast, agreements made among businesses are almost conclusively presumed to be enforceable. But again, express words, such as [...] "This arrangement... shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the law courts" [...] will be respected. In one situation, statute presumes that collective agreements between a trade union and an employer are not intended to create legal relations, ostensibly to keep excessive litigation away from UK labour law.|$|E
