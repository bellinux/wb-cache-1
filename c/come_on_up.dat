See how, where the hay has been already carried, he floods all the slopes with yellow light, making them stand out sharp against the black shadows of the wood; while where the grass is standing still, he makes the sheets of sorrel-flower blush rosy red, or dapples the field with white oxeyes.|$|E

These travelers had absolutely nothing for an outfit except a blanket and a half-empty bag.

5000|$|During the {{construction}} {{phase of the}} station (Early 1980s), the selected call letters were WXCO-FM. The call letters were named after its sister station WXCO-AM.

The station signed on using Unistar's adult contemporary format. The positioning statement was [...] "Y-108". At that time WYCO-FM was only a satellite receiver and several cart/tape machines.

5000|$|Once I got {{the hang}} of it I made up ... six sample pages of pencils penciled, uninked art pages, which I regret, because I wanted to be an inker. I didn't want to pencil. My first few jobs for Marvel were inking jobs, but I did those while working for Design Center. I wanted to work {{full-time}} for Marvel, so it was out of necessity that I penciled. Stan Lee loved samples. He asked me to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>up</b> to New York, which I did, and I went through the most fantastic interview of my life. Stan was leaping on his chair and his desk, just to relate to me physically what he wanted on a comic-book page. It was fascinating and it was charming all at the same time. He made the sound effects, the whole nine yards. ... He demonstrated every other way you could possibly demonstrate what he wanted on those pages—the dynamics and so on.|$|E
