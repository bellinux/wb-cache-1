40|$|AbstractBearing {{capacity}} of silty mudstone roofs {{is likely to}} become weaker after reacting with water during excavation-and-support process, which has resulted in many roof collapse accidents in some mining areas. Based on the practical situation of one coal mine, we carried out experimental research on instability mechanism of silty mudstone roofs under action with water, including: (1) quantitative analysis on clay minerals, consisting of 15 % illite, 19 % montmorillonite and 12 % illite/montmorillonite interstratified materials, who have high water absorption capacity and they are the internal cause of instability of silty mudstone roofs, (2) experiments of disintegration and expansion, which shows the completely disintegration time is 1. 5 - 2 h and expansion pressure is 0. 87 MPa and 3) experiment of complete stress-strain curves under natural condition as well as situation under action of water, which indicates that the peak strength decrease by 21. 6 % and 17. 3 % respectively when test block reacts with water in elastic and plastic stage, but residual strength decrease by 4. 1 %, 33. 8 %, 9. 6 % and 55. 9 % during elastic, plastic, strain-softening and residual stage under action of water. Overall, our study indicates that silty mudstone roofs contain high water absorption capacity minerals, which makes it disintegrate easily and expand strongly, another aspect is that its peak strength and residual strength decrease after reacting with water, which is the instability mechanism of silty mudstone roofs. In addition, we proposed a technology for controlling roofs stability, including water retention and improving support system stiffness.

Along with this {{is the fact that}} the resulting stress and the behaviour of the materials is dependent on time. Therefore the only possibility is, based on the results structured geotechnical measurements, to draw conclusions regarding the stability of the shotcrete outer shell and with that the <b>combined</b> outer/inner shell <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> For this investigation, the results of 1491 convergence cross-sectional measurements were taken from tunnel constructions of the northern section of the newly build DB line (German rail network) from Hannover to Wuerzburg. With the help of model calculations for an embedded circular girder, the utilization factor of the shotcrete outer shell can be determined. Subsequently using a continuum model, the support effect of the outer/inner shell <b>support</b> <b>system</b> was investigated. Taking into account the capacity of the outer shell at the time of installation of the inner shell results in a utilization factor for the <b>combined</b> outer/inner shell <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> The investigations lead to the conclusion that when dimensioning the inner shell of a two shell tunnel it is absolutely essential to consider the deformation of the outer shell as being dependent on time and thus, the strain on the shotcrete at the time of installation of the final construction be taken into account, in order to obtain evidence of the predicted support reserves of the <b>combined</b> outer/inner shell <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> Only with an inverse calculation of the actual measured vertical and horizontal deformations can the utilization of the outer shell be determined. In conclusion, recommendations for a measuring programme are given, setting the conditions for dimensioning of the inner shell using the above mentioned procedure. (orig.)

40|$|The {{excavation}} for the 53 -story {{reinforced concrete}} One Museum Park West building (OMPW) in Chicago was constructed using <b>combined</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems.</b> The building {{was supported by}} caissons and a perimeter wall formed by secant piles which transitioned to tangent piles below {{the bottom of the}} cut. After installing the perimeter wall and deep foundations for the building, the excavation for the reinforced concrete central core was supported by a circular cofferdam made of sheet piles and steel ring beams. This excavation was made using conventional bottom-up excavation techniques.  The excavation {{for the rest of the}} building was made using a top-down method and was laterally braced with reinforced concrete floor slabs structurally connected to the secant pile walls and the reinforced concrete core. Field performance data during construction of the OMPW basements were collected with settlement points, inclinometers and strain gages installed in the concrete basement slabs. Significant settlements were observed adjacent to the excavation during wall and deep foundation installation, central core construction and top-down excavation. The influence of concrete material time-dependence of the floor slabs on the performance during top-down excavation is evaluated and a method for the separation of temperature-related strains from the excavation-induced strains in the concrete is described.  The construction of the basements is simulated with a 3 D numerical structural model to study the influence of the concrete material time-dependence of the floor slabs in the excavation-induced movements resulting from top-down construction. Computed strains in the floor slabs are compared with the observed performance data collected from the strain gages. For use in numerical simulation of the entire excavation process, hypoplasticity constitutive parameters for clays (HC model) at the element test level were calibrated with tests conducted on high quality block samples obtained from the excavation of Block 37 project in Chicago. They included oedometer tests, bender element measurements, and triaxial tests following different stress probes, and were further refined with seismic cone penetration results.  The entire OMPW excavation is simulated with the calibrated parameters with a fully coupled-flow deformation, three-dimensional finite element model. Influence of the construction of secant pile walls, concrete material time-dependence, and nonlinear concrete behavior of the perimeter pile walls on the performance of the OMPW excavation is determined. Conclusions about top-down construction are drawn in light of the measured and simulated performance of the OMPW excavation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{classification}} system for German coal mining {{is the result}} of approximately 100 years of experience in roadway development and longwall mining. It is also based on different research projects covered by national and European research programs. Over the past 30 years, more then 600, 000 m of road-ways have been driven and employed for mining activities. To properly describe the German rock mass {{classification system}}, therefore, it is useful {{to take a look at}} the main geomechanical preferences and common <b>support</b> <b>systems.</b> The decision about the most effective development technique and <b>support</b> <b>system</b> is based on a synthesis of rock mass classification and geomechanical analysis. The properties of surrounding rock, the in situ stress, and the influence of mining activities in several seams at each German mine must be considered for the evaluation of the expected deformation of the roadway. The mine layout, the requirements of ventilation and fire prevention, as well as the need to maintain emergency escape routes for the miners, require that the gate roads remain usable after the passage of the longwall face in most cases. Moreover, the gate roads must be maintained despite the high stresses that are applied during longwall retreat mining. Therefore, gate road design must address a broad spectrum of potential deformation environments. In the past, when gate roads were supported solely with yielding steel arches, lithologic descriptions of the surrounding strata conditions were adequate for the dimensioning of support and the prediction of the roadway deformation. The current conditions of multiple-seam mining at depths of up to 1, 700 m require <b>combined</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems,</b> including pattern bolting and backfilled steel arches. Rock bolt support is used for development, after which (typically 50 - 100 m outby the face) the steel arches are installed and backfilled with building material (concrete) in order to achieve an optimized development rate. The rock mass classification system described below was developed especially for the conditions of German hard-coal mining. It includes the stress distribution caused by multiseam workings (including crossing goaf edges of former longwalls), as well as in situ stresses due to greatdepth and the presence of tectonic faults. It is based on the evaluation of four parameters: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical analysis of drill cores 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical observation of the development face 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical classification of tectonic structures (faults) 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Standard classification derived from geotechnical assessment and evaluation of stress conditions (using numerical modeling for stress calculation) ROCK STRENGTH One of the most important input parameters for describing strata conditions is the strength of the rock. The German classification system is based on a description of lithotypes. This method has been used successfully since the 1950 s and is based mainly on the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of the material. An evaluation of the rock strength observed in a survey of approximately 82, 500 samples of rock core yielded the results shown in Figure 1. The three most common coal measure rock types are mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone. Each shows a specific mean UCS level and a different spread between the minimum and maximum values. Sandstones, in particular, have a wide spectrum of compressive strength, ranging from approximately 40 MPa to greater than 130 MPa, with an average of 85 MPa. The causes of this wide range include different sedimento-logical preconditions, facies, and digenetic processes. [...|$|R
40|$|Workflow {{management}} {{is seen as}} one of the enabling technologies for e-commerce. Together with software agent technology, they reduce the costs and inconveniences of manual e-commerce transactions. This is partly due to the high dependability of workflow management, and to the nature of software agents, which are capable of exhibiting an autonomous, proactive, social, and adaptive behaviour. In a Combined Negotiation (CN), a consumer is interested in a package of interdependent items, and for that, participates in separate negotiations for all these items. The negotiations take place in separate markets, and possibly obey to different rules. We aim to provide a <b>Combined</b> Negotiation <b>Support</b> <b>System</b> (CNSS) to help the consumer model the CN by specifying the sequencing of the individual negotiations and the dependencies between them. Modeling the CN is a first step towards tackling its complexity, and towards ensuring that it will be conducted according to a well thought plan. The CNSS is then used to run the CN by enacting the model. The consumer also uses the support tool to control, track, and monitor the progress of the CN, as well as the individual negotiations. We designed and implemented a CNSS that we call CONSENSUS, based on a Workflow Management System (WfMS). At build-time, the CN is modeled as a workflow, and at run-time, software agents participate in individual negotiations as actors in the workflow. Coordination between agents is implemented using rule-engine technology...|$|R

Combined Negotiations are a {{novel and}} general type of negotiation, {{in which the}} user is {{interested}} in many goods or services and consequently engages in many negotiations at the same time. The negotiations are independent of each other, whereas the goods or services are typically interdependent. Using currently available technology for electronic negotiations, the user conducts each negotiation separately, and has the burden of coordinating and reconciling them. The inherent complexity of combined negotiations in B 2 C as well as B 2 B e-commerce calls for software support.
