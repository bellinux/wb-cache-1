40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} serum Cys C and Hcy {{as well as}} urine mindin and NAG <b>contents</b> <b>in</b> {{patients}} with diabetic nephropathy and the value for early diagnosis of disease. Methods: Patients with diabetic nephropathy and patients with diabetes alone were selected for study, serum was collected to detect Cys C, Hcy, PGF- 2 α, MDA, AOPP, SOD, GSH-Px and VitE contents, and urine was collected to detect mindin, NAG, MST 1, JNK, Foxos, Caspase- 3 and Caspase- 12 contents.

The plantation was a randomized complete block design. We collected leaves (growing seasons only), bark and xylem of twigs, branches, stem and roots with a tree trimmer knife and an increment borer in the spring (17 April), summer (14 July), autumn (23 September) and winter (9 December). Each sample was a mixture from 3 - 4 model trees in the block, and then digested by a H 2 SO 4 -H 2 O 2 solution to measure N, P, K, Ca, and Mg contents. Results showed that the order of macronutrient <b>contents</b> <b>in</b> all samples was N> Ca> K> Mg> P. Seasonal changes in N, P and K <b>contents</b> <b>in</b> each component had clearly specific trends through the year, while Ca and Mg contents varied irregularly except in leaves. The P and K <b>contents</b> <b>in</b> twigs were particularly high in spring, and roots always had high K contents through the seasons.
