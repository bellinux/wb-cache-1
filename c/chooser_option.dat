40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to formalize the optimal choice of market entry {{strategy}} for an individual multinational enterprise (MNE) from a dynamic perspective. It is argued that incorporating a suitable treatment of irreversibility, uncertainty and flexibility related to a MNEs investment decision gives further insights to the expansion, dissolvement, and optimal timing of international joint ventures (IJVs). The evolutionary process of the value of the foreign direct investment can be interpreted as a compound complex <b>chooser</b> <b>option.</b> The results suggest that uncertainty, size of equity share and future investment/divestment opportunities play an important role when it comes to transit from export to the first phase of the foreign direct investment commitment.

40|$|In {{this project}} we study {{numerical}} approximations of the Libor Market Model by using Sparse Grid techniques. This {{approach is a}} promising method to solve high dimensional partial differential equations. The LIBOR Market Model is a model for interest rate movements and typically suffers from the curse of dimensionality when finite-difference techniques are used. As {{an extension of the}} earlier work by J. Blackham [Blackham, 2004], we target a more detailed study of the accuracy of the sparse ’Greeks ’ (∆ and V) for 2 D <b>Chooser</b> <b>Option,</b> 3 D Bermudan Swaption and a 2 D Digital Option. Given the results of experiments, we conclude that, despite satisfactory convergence of sparse grid values, further improvements are required to enhance the quality of the ’Greeks ’ in the discussed setting. Applicable recommendations of possible further developments are included accordingly. Acknowledgements This project {{would not have been possible}} without the support of many people.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of trading futures with {{transaction}} costs when the underlying spot price is mean-reverting. Specifically, we model the spot dynamics by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU), Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR), or exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (XOU) model. The futures term structure is derived and its connection to futures price dynamics is examined. For each futures contract, we describe {{the evolution of the}} roll yield, and compute explicitly the expected roll yield. For the futures trading problem, we incorporate the investor's timing option to enter or exit the market, as well as a <b>chooser</b> <b>option</b> to long or short a futures upon entry. This leads us to formulate and solve the corresponding optimal double stopping problems to determine the optimal trading strategies. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the optimal entry and exit boundaries under different models. We find that the option to choose between a long or short position induces the investor to delay market entry, as compared to the case where the investor pre-commits to go either long or short.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the pricing of American-type contingent claims. First, the explicit solutions to the perpetual American compound option pricing problems in the Black-Merton-Scholes model for financial markets are presented. Compound options are financial contracts which give their holders the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell some other options at certain times in the future by the strike prices given. The method of proof is based on the reduction of the initial two-step optimal stopping problems for the underlying geometric Brownian motion to appropriate sequences of ordinary one-step problems. The latter are solved through their associated one-sided free-boundary problems and the subsequent martingale verification for ordinary differential operators. The closed form solution to the perpetual American <b>chooser</b> <b>option</b> pricing problem is also obtained, by means of the analysis of the equivalent two-sided free-boundary problem. Second, an extension of the Black-Merton-Scholes model with piecewise-constant dividend and volatility rates is considered. The optimal stopping problems related to the pricing of the perpetual American standard put and call options are solved in closed form. The method of proof is based on the reduction of the initial optimal stopping problems to the associated free-boundary problems and the subsequent martingale verification using a local time-space formula. As a result, the explicit algorithms determining the constant hitting thresholds for the underlying asset price process, which provide the optimal exercise boundaries for the options, are presented. Third, the optimal stopping games associated with perpetual convertible bonds in an extension of the Black-Merton-Scholes model with random dividends under different information flows are studied. In this type of contracts, the writers have a right to withdraw the bonds before the holders can exercise them, by converting the bonds into assets. The value functions and the stopping boundaries' expressions are derived in closed-form in the case of observable dividend rate policy, which is modelled by a continuous-time Markov chain. The analysis of the associated parabolic-type free-boundary problem, in the case of unobservable dividend rate policy, is also presented and the optimal exercise times are proved to be the first times at which the asset price process hits boundaries depending on the running state of the filtering dividend rate estimate. Moreover, the explicit estimates for the value function and the optimal exercise boundaries, in the case in which the dividend rate is observable by the writers but unobservable by the holders of the bonds, are presented. Finally, the optimal stopping problems related to the pricing of perpetual American options in an extension of the Black-Merton-Scholes model, in which the dividend and volatility rates of the underlying risky asset depend on the running values of its maximum and its maximum drawdown, are studied. The latter process represents the difference between the running maximum and the current asset value. The optimal stopping times for exercising are shown to be the first times, at which the price of the underlying asset exits some regions restricted by certain boundaries depending on the running values of the associated maximum and maximum drawdown processes. The closed-form solutions to the equivalent free-boundary problems for the value functions are obtained with smooth fit at the optimal stopping boundaries and normal reflection {{at the edges of the}} state space of the resulting three-dimensional Markov process. The optimal exercise boundaries of the perpetual American call, put and strangle options are obtained as solutions of arithmetic equations and first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations...|$|E

30|$|Compared to {{the group}} who saw the E. coli/Vaccinated label version (the {{reference}} category), those in the Safer Choice/Enhance or Safer Choice/Vaccinated versions {{were more likely to}} <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> B relative to option A. Being in the Safer Choice/Enhance group, which provided no justification for the safety claims made, significantly increased the odds of participants <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> B. Participants in this group were 4.41 times more likely to <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> B relative to option A and 2.45 times more likely to <b>choose</b> the neither <b>option</b> compared to option A, both significant at the 5 % level or better. Participants in the Safer Choice/Vaccinated group {{were also more likely to}} <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> B, although the odds ratio for this group at 1.89 was lower than the Safer Choice/Enhance group. The fact that participants who received the “unsubstantiated” food safety label (Safer Choice/Enhance) without the words “vaccines” or “E. coli” were more likely to choose this version, compared to those who were exposed to the more informative labeling versions, suggests the importance of the nature of information on food labels in influencing consumer choice.|$|R

40|$|Freedom {{of choice}} is often defended with {{reference}} to its positive influence on the satisfaction of preferences. The more choice options there are, the greater the level of utility one derives from choosing one of the options. Moreover, {{it is assumed that}} the satisfaction of preferences will not decrease if the size of the choice set increases, in particular in parametric situations. This paper opposes this conclusion by showing that <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> a from a one-element choice set {a} may not be identical with <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> a from a two-element choice set {a,b}. The character and the consequences of <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> a may change considerably with the addition of another option b. Therefore, the level of utility derived from option a changes as well, possibly even in a negative way. Hence, an increase in freedom of choice may diminish one's preference satisfaction, also in parametric situations...|$|R

30|$|Participants {{who wanted}} beef {{products}} from vaccinated cattle labeled as such were 1.40 {{times more likely}} to <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> B and had a 56 % increase in their odds of choosing neither of the two options, relative to option A. It can thus be inferred that consumers in the latter group might prefer having the vaccine intervention indicated on a beef label to avoid it, likely the result of their concerns about the intervention. This result is similar to findings by Lusk and Fox (2002) who found a strong demand to mandatorily label beef products treated with hormones. Another interesting finding is that participants who wanted vaccines against E. coli to be mandatorily adopted had a 45 % increase in their odds of <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> B, relative to option A. This finding combined with the preference for labeling beef with the vaccine intervention among participants who <b>chose</b> <b>option</b> B or neither of the two options highlights the fact that consumers can have competing motivations when they demand food labeling. As argued by Messer et al. (2017), food process labels can lessen asymmetric information between producers and consumers. Thus, while food labels make it easier for consumers to purchase their preferred product, there are also consumer segments whose clamor for a label is to have a signal to avoid the product altogether (Liaukonyte et al. 2015). Regarding demographics, male and income were the two variables that emerged significant at the 5 % level. Males were more likely to <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> B, and household income did not increase the odds of <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> B over option A.|$|R

50|$|Many classic {{probabilistic}} {{models of}} choice satisfy two rational types of choice principles. One principle is called independence of irrelevant alternatives, {{and according to}} this principle, if the probability of <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> X is greater than option Y when only X,Y are available, then option X should remain {{more likely to be}} chosen over Y even when a new option Z is added to the choice set. In other words, adding an option should not change the preference relation between the original pair of options. A second principle is called regularity, and according to this principle, the probability of <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> X from a set containing only X and Y should be {{greater than or equal to}} the probability of <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> X from a larger set containing options X, Y, and a new option Z. In other words, adding an option should only decrease the probability of choosing one of the original pair of options. However, empirical findings obtained by consumer researchers studying human choice behavior have found systematic context effects that systematically violate both of these principles.|$|R
