5|$|Organofluorines exhibit biopersistence {{due to the}} {{strength}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), which are sparingly water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted persistent organic pollutants; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are most often researched. PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in breast milk and the blood of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA. In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans. High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at <b>current</b> <b>exposure</b> levels.|$|E

2500|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a {{chemical}} {{used to make}} plastics, and is frequently used to make baby bottles, water bottles, sports equipment, medical devices, and as a coating in food and beverage cans. [...] Scientists are concerned about BPA's behavioral effects on fetuses, infants, and children at <b>current</b> <b>exposure</b> levels because it can affect the prostate gland, mammary gland, and lead to early puberty in girls. BPA mimics and interferes with the action of estrogen—an important reproduction and development regulator. It leaches out of plastic into liquids and foods, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found measurable amounts of BPA in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U.S. population studied. [...] The highest estimated daily intakes of BPA occur in infants and children. Many plastic baby bottles contain BPA, and BPA {{is more likely to}} leach out of plastic when its temperature is increased, as when one warms a baby bottle or warms up food in the microwave.|$|E

The Lang study was released, and co-author David Melzer presented {{the results of the}} study before the FDA panel. An editorial accompanying the Lang study's publication criticized the FDA's assessment of bisphenolA: [...] "A fundamental problem is that the current ADI [...] for BPA is based on experiments conducted in the early 1980s using outdated methods (only very high doses were tested) and insensitive assays. More recent findings from independent scientists were rejected by the FDA, apparently because those investigators did not follow the outdated testing guidelines for environmental chemicals, whereas studies using the outdated, insensitive assays (predominantly involving studies funded by the chemical industry) are given more weight in arriving at the conclusion that BPA is not harmful at <b>current</b> <b>exposure</b> levels." [...] The FDA was criticized that it was [...] "basing its conclusion on two studies while downplaying the results of hundreds of other studies." [...] Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women and Families, criticized the FDA in her testimony at the FDA's public meeting on the draft assessment of bisphenolA for use in food contact applications, that [...] "At the very least, the FDA should require a prominent warning on products made with BPA".|$|E

40|$|Measuring urine {{heavy metals}} is an {{accepted}} method {{for assessing the}} presence of these toxins in an individual. A random sample (without a flushing agent) is excellent for showing <b>current</b> <b>exposures</b> because it reflects the level of heavy metals in the bloodstream during the hours immediately before bladder voiding. A sample taken after using a heavy-metal-mobilizing agent provides a reflection of total body burden. By utilizing both pre- and post-flush testing, the clinician gains information that cannot be acquired by other means, including identification of <b>current</b> <b>exposures</b> to lead and mercury – critical for proper treatment. Conducting pre-flush testing is also currently the clinician’s only means of identifying cadmium toxicity. In addition, pre- and post-challenge testing allows the clinician to identify which chelating agent is the most effective for the patient; and if oral agents are employed, possible absorption problems can be identified. Since these benefits are not realized with only post-flush testing, it is recommended that clinicians test both before and after a chelation challenge. (Altern Med Rev 2009; 14 (1) : 3 - 13...|$|R
