2500|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} (CO2) {{extinguisher}} was invented (at {{least in the}} US) by the Walter Kidde Company in 1924 in response to Bell Telephone's request for an electrically non-conductive chemical for extinguishing the previously difficult-to-extinguish fires in telephone switchboards. It consisted of a tall metal cylinder containing [...] of CO2 with a wheel valve and a woven brass, cotton covered hose, with a composite funnel-like horn as a nozzle. CO2 is still popular today as it is an ozone-friendly <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> and is used heavily in film and television production to extinguish burning stuntmen. [...] Carbon dioxide extinguishes fire mainly by displacing oxygen. It was once thought that it worked by cooling, although this effect on most fires is negligible. This characteristic is well known and {{has led to the}} widespread misuse of carbon dioxide extinguishers to rapidly cool beverages, especially beer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clean</b> <b>agent</b> FS 49 C2 is an {{environmentally}} engineered, human safe, fast extinguishing <b>Clean</b> <b>Agent</b> fire extinguishing gas for gaseous fire suppression {{installed in a}} suited fire suppression system. The <b>Clean</b> <b>agent</b> FS 49 C2 is an extinguishing gas mixture that suppresses fire while maintaining breathable concentrations of oxygen in the air. This {{makes it possible to}} extinguish a fire with less danger to people in the room at extinguishing concentrations in contrast to pure Carbon Dioxide (CO2) based fire suppression system which is deadly to humans when released. In the beginning the gas was called Halotron II B/FS49C2 but later only the name FS 49 C2 is used. It is a gaseous solution of 60-80% tetrafluoroethane (R-134a), 10-30% pentafluoroethane (R-125) and 10-30% carbon dioxide (CO2). Former fire chief Einar Gjessing made an article about the product to inform firemen how this gas works in case they need to enter a fire site with FS 49 C2.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Clean</b> <b>agents</b> {{extinguish}} fire by displacing oxygen (CO2 or inert gases), removing {{heat from}} the combustion zone (Halotron-1, FE-36, Novec 1230) or inhibiting the chemical chain reaction (Halons). [...] They {{are referred to as}} <b>clean</b> <b>agents</b> because they do not leave any residue after discharge which is ideal for protecting sensitive electronics, aircraft, armored vehicles and archival storage, museums, and valuable documents.|$|R

50|$|HFC-125 (ECARO-25 / FE-25 / NAF S 125) is a gaseous fire {{suppression}} agent {{which can be}} used in <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> {{fire suppression}} systems. It is generally used in situations where water from a fire sprinkler would damage expensive equipment, or where water-based fire protection is impractical, such as museums, banks, clean rooms and hospitals. HFC-125 does not deplete ozone (ODP 0). The HFC-125 <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> is stored in a pressurized container and introduced into the hazard as a gas. The agent is odorless, colorless, electrically non-conductive, non-corrosive, and leaves no residue. It is used in occupied enclosed areas that contain high-value assets.|$|E
50|$|Condensed aerosol {{systems are}} {{suitable}} for special hazards applications as replacements for Halon 1301 systems and high-pressure carbon dioxide systems. Aerosol systems {{can also be used}} as alternatives to <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> gaseous suppressants or water-mist systems.|$|E
50|$|Data centers feature fire {{protection}} systems, including passive and Active Design elements, {{as well as}} implementation of fire prevention programs in operations. Smoke detectors are usually installed to provide early warning of a fire at its incipient stage. This allows investigation, interruption of power, and manual fire suppression using hand held fire extinguishers before the fire grows to a large size. An active {{fire protection}} system, such as a fire sprinkler system or a <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> fire suppression gaseous system, is often provided to control a full scale fire if it develops. High sensitivity smoke detectors, such as aspirating smoke detectors, activating <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> fire suppression gaseous systems activate earlier than fire sprinklers.|$|E

50|$|Gaseous fire {{suppression}} {{is a term}} to describe the use of inert gases and chemical agents to extinguish a fire. Also called <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> {{fire suppression}}. These agents are governed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard for <b>Clean</b> <b>Agent</b> Fire Extinguishing Systems - NFPA 2001 in the USA, with different standards and regulations {{in other parts of}} the world. The system typically consists of the agent, agent storage containers, agent release valves, fire detectors, fire detection system (wiring control panel, actuation signaling), agent delivery piping, and agent dispersion nozzles. Less typically, the agent may be delivered by means of solid propellant gas generators that produce either inert or chemically active gas.|$|E
50|$|Smoke dampers are passive fire {{protection}} products used in air conditioning and ventilation ductwork or installed in physical smoke barriers (e.g., walls). This may be done {{to prevent the spread}} of smoke from the space of fire origin to other spaces in the same building. A combination of fans and dampers can exhaust smoke from an area while pressurizing the smoke-free areas around the affected area (inhibiting smoke infiltration into additional areas). may also be used to maintain the required concentration of a fire suppression <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> in a space, as installed in supply air ducts to restrict the introduction of air into the space, and as installed in return or exhaust air ducts to restrict the depletion of the <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> from the space. Smoke dampers are usually installed by sheet metal contractors.|$|E
50|$|Fire can be {{controlled}} or extinguished, either manually (firefighting) or automatically. Manual control includes {{the use of a}} fire extinguisher or a standpipe system. Automatic control means can include a fire sprinkler system, a gaseous <b>clean</b> <b>agent,</b> or firefighting foam system. Automatic suppression systems would usually be found in large commercial kitchens or other high-risk areas.|$|E

25|$|Novec 1230 fluid (AKA dry water, or Saffire fluid), a {{fluorinated}} ketone {{that works}} by removing {{massive amounts of}} heat. Available in fixed systems and wheeled units in the US and in portables in Australia. Unlike other <b>clean</b> <b>agents,</b> this one {{has the advantage of}} being a liquid at atmospheric pressure, and can be discharged as a stream or a rapidly vaporizing mist, depending on application.|$|R
40|$|Consequent to {{abandoning the}} use of halon in total {{flooding}} gas protection systems, <b>clean</b> <b>agents</b> are used for fire control. It is difficult to carry out so many physical experiments on assessing their performance. Numerical modeling is an effective tool and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a good method for studying the interaction with the fire-induced flow. Thermal radiation is a key point in modeling such process {{and the importance of}} it will be discussed in this paper. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|Attacking all the {{elements}} of the fire tetrahedron, condensed aerosol fire suppression agents are among the more effective flame-extinguishing agents. For example, some condensed aerosol fire suppressants can extinguish a Class B flammable liquid pool fire with 1/5 the amount of Halon 1301 agent or 1/10 the amount of a hydrofluorocarbon or fluoroketone based <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> gaseous fire suppression system in terms of kilogram mass of agent per cubic meter.|$|E
5000|$|Newer airport crash tenders also {{incorporate}} twin agent nozzles/injection {{systems to}} inject {{a stream of}} Purple-K dry chemical into the AFFF foam stream [...] "knocking-down" [...] the fire faster. Some also have Halotron tanks with handlines for situations that require a <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> to be utilized. These features give the airport crash tenders a capability to reach an airplane rapidly, and rapidly put out large fires with jet fuel involved.|$|E
50|$|Escalators {{sometimes}} include {{fire protection}} systems including automatic fire detection and suppression systems within the dust collection and engineer pit. To limit the danger caused by overheating, spaces that contain motors and gears typically include additional ventilation. Small, targeted <b>clean</b> <b>agent</b> automatic extinguishing systems are sometimes installed in these areas. Fire protection of an escalator floor opening is also sometimes provided by adding automatic sprinklers or fireproof shutters to the opening, or by installing the escalator in an enclosed fire-protected space.|$|E
25|$|Condensed aerosol fire {{suppression}} is a particle-based form of fire extinction similar to gaseous {{fire suppression}} or dry chemical fire extinction. As with gaseous fire suppressants, condensed aerosol suppressants use <b>clean</b> <b>agents</b> {{to suppress the}} fire. The agent can be delivered by means of mechanical operation, electric operation, or combined electro-mechanical operation. To the difference of gaseous suppressants, which emit only gas, and dry chemical extinguishers, which release powder-like particles of a large size (25–150µm) condensed aerosols are defined by the National Fire Protection Association as releasing finely divided solid particles (generally <10nbsp&µm), usually in addition to gas.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Clean</b> Access <b>Agent</b> (abbreviation: CCAA, [...] "Cisco Clean Access Agent") resides on the client's machine, authenticates the user, and scans for the {{required}} patches and software. Currently the <b>Clean</b> Access <b>Agent</b> application is only available for some Windows and Mac OS X operating systems (Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Mac OS X); most network administrators allow clients with non-Windows operating systems (such as Mac OS 9, Linux, and FreeBSD) {{to access the}} network without any security checks (authentication is still required and is usually handled via a Web interface).|$|R
50|$|Operation - Water mist {{systems can}} operate {{with the same}} {{functionality}} as deluge, wet pipe, dry pipe, or pre-action systems. The difference is that a water mist system uses a compressed gas as an atomizing medium, which is pumped through the sprinkler pipe. Instead of compressed gas, some systems use a high-pressure pump to pressurize the water so it atomizes as it exits the sprinkler nozzle. Systems can be applied using local application method or total flooding method, similar to <b>Clean</b> <b>Agent</b> Fire Protection Systems.|$|E
50|$|When {{introduced}} to the market HFC-125 was not considered safe for use in occupied spaces. The US EPA Significant New Alternative Policy (SNAP) listing reflected this. Following the introduction and acceptance of the PBPK model in the NFPA standard 2001 on <b>Clean</b> <b>Agent</b> Fire Extinguishing Systems 2004 Edition, the restriction was relaxed and now HFC-125 {{can be used in}} occupied hazards. Generally, class B (flammable liquid) hazards require concentrations that exceed the agent's no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) so extra precautions must be taken to avoid prolonged exposure to the agent.|$|E
50|$|HFC-227ea finds use in fire {{suppression}} systems in data processing and telecommunication facilities, and in protection of many flammable liquids and gases. HFC-227ea falls {{in the category of}} Clean Agents and is governed by NFPA 2001 - Standard for <b>Clean</b> <b>Agent</b> Fire Extinguishing Systems. Effective {{fire suppression}} requires introducing a concentration of the HFC-227ea agent between 6.25% and 9% depending on the hazard being protected. Its NOAEL level for cardiac sensitization is 9%. The United States Environmental Protection Agency allows concentration of 9% volume in occupied spaces without mandated egress time, or up to 10.5% for a limited time. Most {{fire suppression systems}} are designed to provide concentration of 6.25-9%.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the mass}} {{casualty}} potential of an aviation emergency, {{the speed with which}} emergency response equipment and personnel arrive {{at the scene of the}} emergency is of paramount importance. Their arrival and initial mission to secure the aircraft against all hazards, particularly fire, increases the survivability of the passengers and crew on board. Airport firefighters have advanced training in the application of firefighting foams, dry chemical and <b>clean</b> <b>agents</b> used to extinguish burning aviation fuel in and around an aircraft in order to maintain a path for evacuating passengers to exit the fire hazard area. Further, should fire either be encountered in the cabin or extend there from an external fire, the ARFF responders must work to control/extinguish these fires as well.|$|R
2500|$|Water mist (WM) uses a fine misting nozzle {{to break}} up a stream of {{de-ionized}} (distilled) water to the point of not conducting electricity back to the operator. Class A and C rated. It is used widely in hospitals and MRI facilities because it is both completely non-toxic and does not cause cardiac sensitization like some gaseous <b>clean</b> <b>agents.</b> [...] These extinguishers come in 1-3/4 and 2-1/2 gallon sizes, painted white in the United States. Models used in MRI facilities are non-magnetic and are safe for use inside the room that the MRI machine is operating. Models available in Europe come in smaller sizes as well, and some even carry a Class F rating for commercial kitchens, essentially using steam to smother the fire and the water content to cool the oil.|$|R
40|$|Many of the <b>clean</b> <b>agents</b> {{currently}} used in total flooding fire suppression applications have vapor densities greater than ambient air. The denser agent-air mixture creates hydrostatic pressure differences causing {{flow of the}} mixture out of the enclosure as well as flow of ambient air in through leakage paths inherent in building construction. Hold time refers {{to the amount of}} time it takes for the concentration of the agent-air mixture to drop below a specified concentration at a designated height within the protected enclosure. In this study an experimental test enclosure was used to evaluate an analytical model of agent-air mixture leakage and to investigate the effects of different leakage areas on agent hold times. The analytical model, known as the descending interface model, demonstrated favorable agreement with experimental measurements for heights greater than one-half the height of the enclosure for the agent used in this investigation...|$|R
