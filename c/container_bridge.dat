50|$|In 2000 Kranbau Eberswalde was {{merged with}} the {{mechanical}} engineering company Kirow Leipzig Rail & Port AG and it continued operating {{under the name of}} KE Kranbau Eberswalde AG. In the same year the company was awarded the Berlin-Brandenburg Innovation Prize for developing the feeder server, the world's first mobile <b>container</b> <b>bridge.</b> In 2002, the company celebrated its 100th anniversary. In 2008 the company returned to its original family name of Ardelt and is now officially called Kirow Ardelt GmbH.|$|E
50|$|The cranes {{ownership}} {{was returned}} to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1985. The crane is used to lift small boats and ships for repair work. She also help the Bremen warehouse company with heavy piece when needed. She help build the many new <b>container</b> <b>bridges</b> at the new Bremerhaven container terminal.|$|R
50|$|By hanging a {{container}} (such as a trash can) {{from the bridge}} and loading known weights into the <b>container</b> until the <b>bridge</b> breaks. The tester could also slowly add water or sand to the <b>container</b> until the <b>bridge</b> breaks and then weigh the container, providing a more accurate way to find the breaking force.|$|R
50|$|The ship sets {{on one of}} {{the four}} couch places. One of the 14 two-Katz <b>container</b> <b>bridges</b> takes care of the container. First the crane driver in the main cat {{transports}} it on the lax platform of the bridge, where lax worker removes Twistlocks. In the port, the fully automatic handling begins. As soon as one of the 65 AGVs on the land side of the bridge automated themselves, the portal cat reloads the container. The driverless AGV finds its way to the destination conveyed by radio waves and moreover it is being watched by GPS. The pedestrian access to the area of AGV drive is prohibited for security reasons.|$|R
50|$|The Albert Canal has a {{standard}} depth of 3.4 m and an overhead clearance of 6.7 m. To allow four-stacked <b>container</b> traffic, <b>bridges</b> over the canal {{are currently being}} heightened {{to allow for a}} 9.1 m overhead.|$|R
50|$|Project {{cargo ships}} are non-submersible ships that load large and heavy cargo items {{with one or}} more {{on-board}} cranes. Such vessels have between 13,000 and 19,000 dwt capacity. Examples of cargo transported includes <b>container</b> cranes, <b>bridge</b> sections, and suction piles.|$|R
25|$|There are 31 {{laboratories}} with 650m² (6,997 sq. ft.) total surface area, {{plus the}} possibility of additional lab <b>containers</b> on the <b>bridges</b> and helicopter platform.|$|R
40|$|Some {{thirty years}} {{passed since the}} {{commencement}} of a more vigorous development of modern container vessels. Up to this point of time we have had operating four generations of container vessels while the fifth, still more modern one {{is in the process}} of preliminary designing activities. In the period of 1970 - 1989 liner (general) cargo that lends to containerization reported a 300 % increase (ba three times}, the capacities of container vessel fleet by 16, and container transport by 12 so that the share of containerized cargo in the overall general cargo operations increased from 17, 5 % in 1970 to 77, 4 % in 1989. In the year 1989 there were 4, 300 container vessečs of 2 909 00 teu capacity. The development of port/sea container capacities has been followed by the development of containerization in shipping. In the past decade port container traffic has been developing at the average annual rate of 15, 9 % and then until the year 1984 at 4, 2 % to reach over the past two years the figure of 8 % annual growth. The existing annual container port traffic in sea ports of the worlds is 76 million teu while in the year 200 it is planned to reach the average annual growth of 4, 2 % to be in the order of 115 milion teu. The development of mainland <b>container</b> <b>bridges</b> makes a positive factor of total development of containerization in transcontinental relations. </p...|$|R
50|$|The LSB overcomes {{limitations}} in width, span, capacity and fatigue that {{is associated with}} many other systems in the RE use The LSB can be built by hand, but where cranes and other mechanical handling equipment are available, they are used to reduces {{the time it takes to}} build and also the number of trained personal needed. Bridge components can be transported using DROPS (NATO) flat racks and ISO shipping <b>containers.</b> The <b>bridge</b> can be constructed by a Royal Engineer Section; when mechanical equipment is used, without it can take up to three sections. Once constructed a LSB tends to remain in situ for far longer periods than either a CSB or a GSB, one bridge in Iraq remained in use for three years. The bridge has a width (roadway) of 4.2m and can be built with sloping or level access ramps depending on the site.|$|R
50|$|In road transport, an {{oversize}} load (or overweight load) is a load that exceeds the standard or ordinary legal size and/or weight limits for a specified portion of road, highway or other transport infrastructure, such as air freight or water freight. There are also {{load per axle}} limits. However, a load that exceeds the per-axle limits, but not the overall weight limits, is considered overweight. Examples of oversize/overweight loads include construction machines (cranes, front loaders, backhoes, etc.), pre-built homes, <b>containers,</b> construction elements (<b>bridge</b> beams, generators, windmill propellers, rocket stages, industrial equipment).|$|R
40|$|An efficient, smart, {{energy-saving}} automated {{container terminal}} (ACT) scheme is introduced in this paper, {{in which one}} three-dimensional container distribution system is proposed between crane yard and storage yard. In this scheme, <b>container</b> vehicle-low <b>bridge</b> coupled vibration greatly affects the ACT’s structural safety and handling efficiency. Firstly, the coupled vibration time-domain responses, inspired by self-excitation including track irregularity and hunting movement as well as environmental (wind and seismic) load, were obtained by using free-interface component mode synthesis (CMS) method. The relationship of response and vehicle speed, wind velocity and ground motion intensity was studied as well. Accordingly, the structural safety, running safety and stationarity were assessed by indicators such as deflection-span ratio, vibration acceleration, wheel-rail relative displacement, etc. The container vehicle speed limits of the low bridge rigid supported or lead rubber bearing (LRB) supported under seismic and operational wind load were compared. The results of model test and prototype simulation prove with each other, which validates LRB’s effects on vibration isolation and absorption, thus can increase ground motion intensity and vehicle speed thresholds to structural safety...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to compare {{construction}} metaphors and political discourses, and their trajectories {{of change in the}} cases of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Slovenia. The paper examines how the political appeared and functioned through the use of metaphor in Yugoslavia and Slovenia. A repetitive structure of metaphorical thought in both state formations was and is positioned along the axis of building connections/unity versus independence/diversity. In the first section of the paper, five major theoretical considerations relevant to a study of metaphor in political science are considered. In the second section, the paper focuses on construction metaphors of binding/connection, <b>bridge,</b> <b>container</b> and block. It evaluates the role, extension, influence and effectiveness of metaphors in their historical contexts...|$|R
50|$|Since neither half {{reaction}} {{will occur}} {{independently of the}} other, the two half cells must be connected {{in a way that}} will allow ions to move freely between them. A porous barrier or ceramic disk may be used to separate the two solutions while allowing the flow of sulfate ions. When the half cells are placed in two entirely different and separate <b>containers,</b> a salt <b>bridge</b> is often used to connect the two cells. The salt bridge typically contains a high concentration of potassium nitrate (a salt that will not interfere chemically with the reaction in either half-cell). In the above wet-cell during discharge, nitrate anions in the salt bridge move into the zinc half-cell in order to balance the increase in Zn2+ ions. At the same time, potassium ions from the salt bridge move into the copper half-cell in order to replace the Cu2+ ions being discharged.|$|R
