50|$|Because {{snubbing}} {{is normally}} done under pressure, initially, {{the weight of}} pipe in wellbore {{is less than the}} force due to the wellbore pressure. This is described as light-pipe: downward force is required on the pipe to force it in against resistance. Once a sufficient amount of pipe has been run into the hole, the weight becomes sufficient to overpower the wellbore pressure and the pipe naturally wants to fall in the hole; this is heavy-pipe. At this point, the snubbing mechanism is changed over to the one which provides upward force to hold the pipe and lower it <b>controllably</b> into the well.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{operations of}} a quantum computer {{have been demonstrated}} experimentally with the currently highest accuracy in trapped ion systems.

5000|$|An {{inversion}} produces gain, causing phonon laser action above a {{pump power}} threshold of around 7 μW. The proposed device is characterized from a continuously tunable gain spectrum that selectively amplifies mechanical modes from radio frequency to microwave rates. Viewed as Brillouin process, the system accesses a regime {{in which the}} phonon {{plays the role of}} Stokes wave. [...] Stokes wave refers to a non-linear and periodic surface wave on an inviscid fluid (ideal fluid assumed to have no viscosity) layer of constant mean depth. For this reason it should be also possible to <b>controllably</b> switch between phonon and phonon laser regimes.|$|E
50|$|Boiler {{turndown}} ratio is {{the ratio of}} maximum heat output to the minimum level of heat output at which the boiler will operate efficiently or <b>controllably.</b> Many boilers are designed to operate {{at a variety of}} output levels. As the desired temperature/pressure point is approached, the heat source is progressively turned down. If pressure/temperature falls, the heat source is progressively turned up. If a boiler application requires it to operate at a low proportion of its maximum output, a high {{turndown ratio}} is required. Conversely, in applications where the operational conditions are not expected to vary significantly (for example, a large power plant), a low turndown ratio will be sufficient.|$|E

50|$|The T44 {{was adopted}} as the M14 in 1957. Around {{the same time}} Britain and Canada adopted the Belgian FN FAL (L1A1 SLR British) as the L1 {{followed}} by West German army as the G1. The Germans soon transitioned to {{a modified version of}} the Spanish CETME rifle by Heckler & Koch that was adopted as the G3. With all three of these firearms, it was clear that the 7.62&thinsp;mm NATO could not be fired <b>controllably</b> in fully automatic because of recoil. Both the M14s and FAL would later go through several variations intended to either limit fully automatic selection through semi-auto version or selector locks or to improve control with bipods or heavier barrels.|$|E
50|$|The {{sensitive}} {{dependence of}} a semiconductor's electronic, optical, and magnetic properties on dopants has provided an extensive range of tunable phenomena {{to explore and}} apply to devices. It is possible to move past the tunable properties of an ensemble of dopants and to identify {{the effects of a}} solitary dopant on commercial device performance as well as locally on the fundamental properties of a semiconductor. New applications have become available that require the discrete character of a single dopant, such as single-spin devices in the area of quantum information or single-dopant transistors. Dramatic advances in the past decade towards observing, <b>controllably</b> creating and manipulating single dopants, as well as their application in novel devices have allowed opening the new field of solotronics (solitary dopant optoelectronics).|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} {{requirement of the}} high voltage pre-charge circuit is to minimize the peak current out from the power source by slowing down the dV/dT of the input power voltage such that a new “pre-charge mode” is created. Of course the inductive loads on the distribution system must be switched off during the precharge mode. While pre-charging, the system voltage will rise slowly and <b>controllably</b> with power-up current never exceeding the maximum allowed. As the circuit voltage approaches near steady state, then the pre-charge function is complete. Normal operation of a pre-charge circuit is to terminate pre-charge mode when the circuit voltage is 90% or 95% of the operating voltage. Upon completion of pre-charging, the pre-charge resistance is switched out of the power supply circuit and returns to a low impedance power source for normal mode. The high voltage loads are then powered up sequentially.|$|E
5000|$|Creeking {{is perhaps}} best {{thought of as a}} {{subcategory}} of river running, involving very technical and difficult rapids, typically in the Grade/Class IV to VI range. While people will differ on the definition, creeking generally involves higher gradient, approaching or in excess of 100 ft per mi (19 m per km), and is likely to include running ledges, slides, and waterfalls on relatively small and tight rivers, though some will allow for very large and big volume rivers in their definition. Canoes used for creeking usually have higher volume (more gallons or liters of displacement) and more rounded bow and stern, as these features provide an extra margin of safety' against the likelihood of pinning, and will resurface more quickly and <b>controllably</b> when coming off larger drops.

50|$|McDaniel had {{determined}} that when facing the target directly, {{most people can}} attain {{a high degree of}} horizontal accuracy when pointing the index finger at the target. Vertical alignment is what requires special training. By developing his favored hip-shooting stance in which the shooter points his body at the target, pivoting on the balls of his feet to get there, either prior to or during the draw, McDaniel minimized the number of movable joints in the body that the subconscious has to control in order to hit the target. To recap, the shooter does not twist his neck, at his waist, knees or ankles; those joints are immobilized, as is his right shoulder, if he is right-handed. By planting his right elbow against his stomach at the same point each time, he establishes a constant reference point from which the subconscious can easily determine the parallax between the direct line-of-sight of the shooter's eyes and his gun barrel. Also, with his elbow planted in his stomach, the shooter has greater leverage for pulling the trigger of a double-action revolver or automatic <b>controllably.</b> The only real variable that the shooter's subconscious now has to deal with is figuring out how much bend to put in his elbow to get the vertical alignment correct for the offset of the gun barrel and the distance to the target.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the use of the substrate surface chemistry is the ability to readily control the areal dose of the dopants by forming a mixed monolayer of ‘blank’ and dopant-containing molecules. For instance, a mixture of boron precursor molecules and dodecene (all-carbon ‘blank’ precursor) in different ratios is utilized to manipulate the areal dose of boron. Besides the mixed monolayer formation, the areal dose can be readily tuned by using the molecular structure details of the dopant precursor. In specific, the molecular footprint of the precursor directly governs the surface concentration of the dopants, with larger molecules resulting in a lower dose. In this regard, using trioctylphosphine oxide (TOP) as the phosphorus precursor with an approximately six-fold larger molecular footprint than DPP, the dopant dose can be modulated in the reduction of six times accordingly. Moreover, the doping profiles can be readily tuned through optimization of the annealing conditions. In this case, the high surface doping density with sharp spatial decay can be obtained by using this MLD method with low anneal temperatures and short times for the formation of USJs. The ability to <b>controllably</b> tune the dopant dose through the structural design of the precursor and to control the dopant profile by the annealing conditions present a unique aspect of the MLD process for attaining the desired dopant dose and profile.|$|E
5000|$|Arthropods {{make use}} of smooth {{adhesive}} pads as well as hairy pads for climbing and locomotion along non-horizontal surfaces. Both types of pads in insects {{make use of}} liquid secretions and are considered 'wet'. [...] adhesive mechanisms primarily rely on van der Waals’ forces and are also used by organisms other than insects. [...] The fluid provides capillary and viscous adhesion {{and appears to be}} present in all insect adhesive pads. [...] Little is known about the chemical properties of the adhesive fluids and the ultrastructure of the fluid producing cells is currently not extensively studied. Additionally, both hairy and smooth types of adhesion have evolved separately numerous times in insects. Few comparative studies between the two types of adhesion mechanisms have been done and {{there is a lack of}} information regarding the forces that can be supported by these systems in insects. [...] Additionally, tree frogs and some mammals such as the arboreal possum and bats also make use of smooth adhesive pads. The use of adhesive pads for locomotion across non-horizontal surfaces is a trait that evolved separately in different species, making it an example of convergent evolution. The power of adhesion allows these organisms to be able to climb on almost any substance. [...] The exact mechanisms of arthropod adhesion are still unknown for some species but this topic is of great importance to biologists, physicists and engineers. [...] These highly specialized structures are not restricted to one particular area of the leg. They may be located on different parts, such as claws, derivatives of the pretarsus, tarsal apex, tarsomeres or tibia. From the scaling analysis, it has been suggested that animal lineages relying on the dry adhesion, such as lizards and spiders have a higher density of terminal contact elements compared to systems that use wet adhesive mechanisms such as insects. Since these effects are based on fundamental physical principles and highly related to the shape of the structure, they are also the same for artificial surfaces with similar geometry. [...] Adhesion and friction forces per-unit-pad area were very similar in smooth and hairy systems when tested. Strong adhesion may be beneficial in many situations but it also can create difficulties in locomotion. [...] Direction-dependence is an important and fundamental property of adhesive structures that are able to rapidly and <b>controllably</b> adhere during locomotion. Researchers are unsure whether direction-dependence is achieved through changes in contact area or through a change in shear stress. [...] Friction and adhesion forces in most animal attachment organs are higher when they are pulled towards the body than when they push away from it. This has been observed in geckos and spiders but also in the smooth adhesive pads of ants, bush-crickets and cockroaches. [...] Adhesive hairs of geckos are non-symmetrical and feature distally pointing setae and spatulae that are able to generate increased friction and adhesion when aligned with a proximal pull. The adhesive hairs of some beetles behave similarly to those of geckos. While directional-dependence is present in other animals, it has yet to be confirmed in insects with hairy adhesive pads.|$|E
