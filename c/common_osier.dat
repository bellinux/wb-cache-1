40|$|Rust (Melampsora spp.) is a {{damaging}} {{disease of}} willows (Salix spp.), including <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> (S. viminalis L.). So far, the pathogens {{of this species}} found in Europe were identified as M. larici-epitea Kleb. or M. ribesii-viminalis Kleb. Moreover, a stem infecting form (SIF), deprived of a sexual stage in its life cycle was reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to find out which species of the rust fungi cause disease symptoms on <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> in Poland. The isolates from <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> were compared to the ones originating from its putative hybrids with trembling aspen (Populus tremula L.) and Simon's poplar (P. simonii Carr.). Fungal isolates were obtained in 2008 - 2010 from 15 different genotypes of willows, including seven varieties of <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> (4 Swedish and 3 Polish), two landraces of <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> and six putative hybrids with poplars. Fungal isolates originated from three experiment sites, including west (Wielkopolska and Lubuskie) and north-east (Warmia) regions of Poland. To ensure the genetic uniformity, the isolates were derived from single uredinia, obtained from natural infection conditions. In all collected samples the position of uredinia was always hypophyllous. The diameter of uredinia was measured by Sigma Scan Pro software, after inoculation of four standard genotypes, including two <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> and two willow hybrids. The studies proved that the main cause of <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> rust is Melampsora larici-epitea f. typica. All studied isolates, including the ones obtained on putative hybrids, were very similar according to the size of uredinia and the size and morphology of urediniospores. The average size of a uredinium was 1. 1 mm diameter and slightly differed between the isolates (from 0. 9 to 1. 3 mm), depending on willow genotype, the quality of plant material used for artificial inoculations and infection conditions. The average size of a typical urediniospore was 12. 4 x 10. 5 µm, but the sizes varied from 9. 8 to 13. 2 µm. Urediniospores from <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> were slightly bigger and more oval (12. 5 x 10. 4 µm) as compared to spores from the putative hybrids Salix x Populus (12. 3 x 10. 6 µm), but the differences were statistically insignificant. The spores were ovoid, globoid or angular, evenly echinulated. The size of uredinia, as well as the size and morphology of urediniospores were in full agreement with literature data for M. larici-epitea f. typica...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{a review of}} {{classical}} and recent studies on willow rusts in Europe, with special reference to short rotation coppice willows used for biomass production, such as <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> willow (Salix viminalis L.). The review presents the taxo-nomic classification of rust fungi from the genus Melampsora spp. We present a list of telial hosts (genus Salix) as well as ae-cial hosts for different rust species. The life cycle of this fungal pathogen is described in detail from the epidemiological and genetic point of view. The DNA polymorphism of M. larici-epitea, the rust species most responsible for severe yield losses of plant biomass, is characterised based on RAPD, AFLP and RFLP-PCR methods.

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of the cultivation of the <b>common</b> <b>osier</b> on sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium concentrations in groundwater was evaluated between January 2011 and December 2012 in north-eastern Poland. The analyzed site is situated in Samawki on the premises of the Educational and Research Station in £ê¿any administered by the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn. Groundwater samples for chemical analyses were collected once a month from seven piezometers. Four piezometers were installed in a willow plantation: one on a hilltop, one on a slope and two varied-depth piezometers (904 A – depth of 1. 62 m, 904 B – depth of 2. 65 m) in a surface depression. The remaining three piezometers were installed for comparative purposes on arable land, in a forest on a hilltop and in a surface depression. Magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium concentrations were determined in water samples by standard methods. The highest groundwater levels were noted in arable land (110. 8 53. 7 cm below ground level), and the lowest levels – on the forest hilltop (572. 8 27. 0 cm below ground level). In the willow plantation, the highest groundwater table was noted in a surface depression (272. 0 25. 4 cm below ground level). Growing common osiers for energy significantly influenced magnesium and calcium concentrations in groundwater, which were highest on {{the slope of the}} plantation (15. 1 3. 8 mgMg dm– 3 and 88. 8 26. 4 mgCa dm– 3) and on the hilltop (13. 6 4. 5 mgMg dm– 3 and 109. 1 22. 3 mgCa dm– 3). The highest sodium levels in groundwater were noted on the plantation hilltop (10. 2 1. 6 mgNa dm– 3) and in arable land (11. 5 2. 0 mgNa dm– 3). Potassium concentrations in groundwater were determined by the height of the groundwater table, and they were highest on hilltops in the willow plantation (5. 2 4. 4 mgK dm– 3) and in the forest (4. 3 2. 7 mgK dm– 3) ...|$|E
