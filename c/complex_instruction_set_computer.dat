2500|$|Intel {{had tried}} unsuccessfully to push Apple to migrate the Macintosh {{platform}} to Intel chips. Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (<b>Complex</b> <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Computer)</b> architecture ultimately {{would not be able}} to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 [...] offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering did not help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series, several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops hit the market which cost Apple considerable sales. In 1993 Intel rolled out the Pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology. In 1994, Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the RISC PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola. The Power Macintosh line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months. However, in the long run, spurning Intel for the PowerPC was a mistake as the commoditization of Intel-architecture chips meant Apple couldn't compete on price against [...] "the Dells of the world".|$|E
40|$|Retargetable Instruction Scheduling for Pipelined Processors by David Gordon Bradlee Chairperson of the Supervisory Committee: Professor Susan J. Eggers Department of Computer Science and Engineering Retargetable code {{generators}} for <b>complex</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>computers</b> (CISCs) {{have focused}} on sophisticated pattern matching code selection, because CISCs provide many machine instruction sequence choices. Recent pipelined processors, known as reduced <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>computers</b> (RISCs), provide fewer instruction sequence choices, but expose pipeline and functional unit costs to the compiler. For RISCs the compiler's emphasis must be shifted from code selection to instruction scheduling, resulting in code generation issues that are different than those for CISCs. In particular, the machine description language for a retargetable RISC compiler must contain scheduling requirements. Also, the interaction between register allocation and instruction scheduling is significant. This dissertation com [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|In early computers, {{memory was}} expensive, so {{minimizing}} {{the size of}} a program to make sure it would fit in the limited memory was often central.

50|$|Another {{principle}} {{was the use}} of very high-level complex {{instructions to}} be implemented in microcode. As an example, one of the instructions, , was a complete linkage editor.

50|$|In the past, {{microprocessor}} {{design technology}} evolved from <b>complex</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>computer</b> (CISC) to {{reduced instruction set computer}} (RISC). In {{the early days}} of the computer industry, compiler technology did not exist and programming was done in assembly language. To make programming easier, computer architects created complex instructions which were direct representations of high level functions of high level programming languages. Another force that encouraged instruction complexity was the lack of large memory blocks.|$|E
40|$|This report {{makes the}} case that a well-designed Reduced <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Computer</b> (RISC) can match, and even exceed, the {{performance}} and code density of existing commercial <b>Complex</b> <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Computers</b> (CISC) while maintaining the simplicity and cost-effectiveness that underpins the original RISC goals. We begin by comparing the dynamic instruction counts and dynamic instruction bytes fetched for the popular proprietary ARMv 7, ARMv 8, IA- 32, and x 86 - 64 <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set</b> Architectures (ISAs) against the free and open RISC-V RV 64 G and RV 64 GC ISAs when running the SPEC CINT 2006 benchmark suite. RISC-V {{was designed as a}} very small ISA to support a wide range of implementations, and has a less mature compiler toolchain. However, we observe that on SPEC CINT 2006 RV 64 G executes on average 16 % more instructions than x 86 - 64, 3 % more instructions than IA- 32, 9 % more instructions than ARMv 8, but 4 % fewer instructions than ARMv 7. CISC x 86 implementations break up <b>complex</b> <b>instructions</b> into smaller internal RISC-like micro-ops, and the RV 64 G instruction count is within 2 % of the x 86 - 64 retired micro-op count. RV 64 GC, the compressed variant of RV 64 G, is the densest ISA studied, fetching 8 % fewer dynamic instruction bytes than x 86 - 64. We observed that much of the increased RISC-V instruction count is due to a small set of common multi-instruction idioms. Exploiting this fact, the RV 64 G and RV 64 GC effective instruction count can be reduced by 5. 4 % on average by leveraging macro-op fusion. Combining the compressed RISC-V ISA extension with macro-op fusion provides both the densest ISA and the fewest dynamic operations retired per program, reducing the motivation to add more instructions to the ISA. This approach retains a single simple ISA suitable for both low-end and high-end implementations, where high-end implementations can boost performance through microarchitectural techniques...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> {{computing}} (CISC [...] ) is {{a processor}} design, where single instructions can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store) or {{are capable of}} multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions. The term was retroactively coined in contrast to reduced <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>computer</b> (RISC) and has therefore become something of an umbrella term for everything that is not RISC, from large and complex mainframe computers to simplistic microcontrollers where memory load and store operations are not separated from arithmetic instructions.|$|R

50|$|An ISA may be {{classified}} {{in a number}} of different ways. A common classification is by architectural complexity. A <b>complex</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>computer</b> (CISC) has many specialized instructions, some of which may only be rarely used in practical programs. A reduced instruction set computer (RISC) simplifies the processor by efficiently implementing only the instructions that are frequently used in programs, while the less common operations are implemented as subroutines, having their resulting additional processor execution time offset by infrequent use.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} {{instruction}} sets {{is a complex}} issue. There were two stages in history for the microprocessor. The first was the CISC (<b>Complex</b> <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Computer),</b> which had many different instructions. In the 1970s, however, places like IBM did research and found that many instructions in the set could be eliminated. The result was the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer), an architecture that uses a smaller set of instructions. A simpler instruction set may offer the potential for higher speeds, reduced processor size, and reduced power consumption. However, a more complex set may optimize common operations, improve memory and cache efficiency, or simplify programming.|$|E

5000|$|Note {{that there}} is no {{generally}} accepted way of naming the various addressing modes. In particular, different authors and computer manufacturers may give different names to the same addressing mode, or the same names to different addressing modes. Furthermore, an addressing mode which, in one given architecture, is treated as a single addressing mode may represent functionality that, in another architecture, is covered by two or more addressing modes. For example, some <b>complex</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> <b>computer</b> (CISC) architectures, such as the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX, treat registers and literal or immediate constants as just another addressing mode. Others, such as the IBM System/360 and its successors, and most reduced instruction set computer (RISC) designs, encode this information within the instruction. Thus, the latter machines have three distinct instruction codes for copying one register to another, copying a literal constant into a register, and copying the contents of a memory location into a register, while the VAX has only a single [...] "MOV" [...] instruction.|$|E
