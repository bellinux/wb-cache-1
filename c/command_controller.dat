50|$|The {{inside of}} the 2017 E-Class was {{unveiled}} of a video released by Mercedes-Benz in December 2015. The interior mounts two 12.3-inch full HD screens housed within a single unit. Most E-Class models will receive the widescreen set-up as standard. However, base Avantgarde versions will feature traditional analogue dials with a seven-inch multi-information display, along with an 8.4-inch central infotainment screen. Mercedes-Benz claimed a first for the automotive industry, adding a pair of touch-sensitive control buttons on the steering wheel, which respond to finger swipes to control the car's infotainment system. The more traditional <b>Command</b> <b>controller</b> is also retained on the centre console. The interior was previewed on the Concept IAA (Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile) that Mercedes showed in September 2015 at the Frankfurt auto show.|$|E
5000|$|Controller is {{the main}} entry to Zend Framework application. The front {{controller}} handler is main hub for accepting requests and running the accurate actions as requested by the commands. The whole process of requesting and reacting is routing and dispatching (which basically means calling correct methods in a class) which determines the functionality of the code. This is implemented by Zend_Controller_Router_- Interface. The router functionality is to find which actions need to be run and on contrary dispatcher runs those requested actions. The controller in Zend Framework is connected in a diverse array of structural directories, which provides a support to efficient routing. The main entry point and the <b>command</b> <b>controller</b> is the Zend_Controller_Front, this works as a foundation which delegates the work received and sent. The request is shaped and encapsulated with an instance of Zend Controller Request HTTP, as a provider of access to HTTP requests. The HTTP hold all the superglobals of the framework ($_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, $_SERVER, and $_ENV) with their relevant paths. Moreover, the controller also provides getParam (...) functions which enables collection of requested variables.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 54) This report {{describes the}} resign {{and implementation of}} a flexible and interactive microprogram simulator. The structure of the simulator is functionally subdivided in four independent blocks: Master Controller, <b>Command</b> <b>Controller,</b> Simulation Controller, Simulation Routines. A high degree of flexibility is obtained by keeping {{the description of the}} machine structure and the simulator procedure apart. An easy-to-modify table-driven system description is used to facilitate updating. Moreover a user friendly command language is provided for user-simulator communication. Proposed uses for the simulator include verification of the hardware design and debugging of the software and firmware. The use of the simulator {{in the development of a}} microprogrammable machine, based on Am 2900 bit-slice microprocessors, is described. The host machine used for the simulator is the CDC CYBER 170 / 750 computer. The simulator itself is written in the PASCAL language. This simulator can also be used as a teaching aid in microprogroming courses. With this tool, one may design and run a microprogram in a more friendly environment than usually found with micropogrammable hardware.

40|$|The Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) {{program was}} {{initiated}} and propelled {{due to the}} inadvertent terminations of Global Hawk and the Strategic Target System and the NASA Inspector General's assessment letter and recommendations regarding the exploration of low-cost, lightweight space COMSEC for FTS. Additionally, the standard analog and high alphabet systems most commonly used in FTS are secure, but not encrypted. A study group was initiated to select and document a robust, affordable, reliable technology that provides encrypted FTS capability. A flight demonstration was conducted to gain experience using EFTS in an operational environment, provide confidence {{in the use of}} the EFTS components, integrate EFTS into an existing range infrastructure to demonstrate the scalability of system components, to provide a <b>command</b> <b>controller</b> that generated the EFTS waveform using an existing range infrastructure, and to provide a report documenting the results of the demonstration. The primary goal of the demonstration was to obtain operational experience with EFTS. Areas of operational experience include: mission planning, pre-flight configuration and testing, mission monitoring and recording, vehicle termination, developing mission procedures. and post mission data reduction and other post mission activities. An Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) was selected to support the EFTS demonstration due to interest in future use of EFTS by the AMRAAM program, familiarity of EFTS by range personnel, and the availability of existing operational environment to support EFTS testing with available program funding. For demonstration purposes, the AMRAAM was successfully terminated using an EFTS receiver and successfully demonstrating EFTS.

Full-state feedback, full-state <b>command</b> <b>controllers</b> are shown, utilizing both filter inductor current and filter capacitor current feedback to augment output voltage control. All controllers pre-sented include output voltage decoupling in a manner analogous to “back-electromotive force (EMF) ” decoupling in dc motor drives. Disturbance input decoupling of the load current and its derivative is presented. An observer-based controller is ad-ditionally considered and is {{shown to be a}} technically viable, economically attractive option.

40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} argued that a robot’s {{morphology}} (rather than its controller) may “compute. ” We hypothesize that there may be circumstances under which there is some advantage for a robot to compute using its body rather than its brain. If this is true, and if we use an evolutionary algorithm to improve the bodies and brains of robots under these circumstances, it should sometimes discover morphological computation and make use of it. Here we argue that morphological complexity may be correlated with morphological computation, and demonstrate a system in which morphological complexity evolves. We also hypothesize about how such a tool could be used to investigate how and when morphological computation is useful.

40|$|The authors {{present a}} new method of {{recognizing}} different human facial gestures through their neural activities and muscle movements, {{which can be}} used in machine-interfacing applications. Human–machine interface (HMI) technology utilizes human neural activities as input controllers for the machine. Recently, much work has been done on the specific application of facial electromyography (EMG) -based HMI, which have used limited and fixed numbers of facial gestures. In this work, a multipurpose interface is suggested that can support 2 – 11 control commands that can be applied to various HMI systems. The significance of this work is finding the most accurate facial gestures for any application with a maximum of eleven control commands. Eleven facial gesture EMGs are recorded from ten volunteers. Detected EMGs are passed through a band-pass filter and root mean square features are extracted. Various combinations of gestures with a different number of gestures in each group are made from the existing facial gestures. Finally, all combinations are trained and classified by a Fuzzy c-means classifier. In conclusion, combinations with the highest recognition accuracy in each group are chosen. An average accuracy > 90 % of chosen combinations proved their ability to be used as <b>command</b> <b>controllers...</b>|$|R
