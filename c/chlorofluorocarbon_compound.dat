40|$|The {{problem of}} ozone {{depletion}} has recently become {{a topic of}} major concern. What was once a vague, theoretical hypothesis that artificial <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> <b>compounds</b> could accumulate in the stratosphere and break down ozone molecules is an imminent reality. A decrease in 1 the concentration of stratospheric ozone would {{increase the amount of}} ultraviolet radiation in ambient sunlight. In addition to altering plant and aquatic life in unpredictable ways, increiased ultraviolet radiation will adversely affect human health. The incidence of various types of skin cancers will increase, as will the rate of deaths from skin cancer. In addition, there will be an increase in the occurrence of certain types of ocular cataracts. The most recently described effect of ultraviolet radiation on a biologic system is its ability to alter the immune system in experimental animals and humans. Although much is known about the immunologic effects of ultraviolet radiation, particularly in animal models, little information is available on its potential to decrease host resistance to infectious diseases. This is an important topic {{that needs to be addressed}} in order for us to understand fully the consequences of ozone depletion for human health...|$|R
50|$|Freon {{was used}} as the {{original}} brand name for electronic gases produced and marketed by DuPont. With the depletion of the ozone layer and the subsequent phase-out of <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) gas <b>compounds,</b> the company rebranded this product line to differentiate from refrigerant gases that had been using the same Freon brand name.|$|R
40|$|The {{recombinant}} bacterium Pseudomonas putida G 786 (pHG- 2) metabolizes pentachloroethane to glyoxylate {{and carbon}} dioxide, using cytochrome P- 450 CAM and toluene dioxygenase to catalyze consecutive reductive and oxidative dehalogenation reactions (L. P. Wackett, M. J. Sadowsky, L. N. Newman, H. -G. Hur, and S. Li, Nature [London] 368 : 627 - 629, 1994). The present study investigated metabolism of brominated and <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> <b>compounds</b> by the recombinant strain. Under anaerobic conditions, P. putida G 786 (pHG- 2) reduced 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrabromoethane, 1, 2 -dibromo- 1, 2 -dichloroethane, and 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrachloro- 2, 2 -difluoroethane to products bearing fewer halogen substituents. Under aerobic conditions, P. putida G 786 (pHG- 2) oxidized cis- and trans- 1, 2 -dibromoethenes, 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -difluoroethene, and 1, 2 -dichloro- 1 -fluoroethene. Several compounds were metabolized by sequential reductive and oxidative reactions via the constructed metabolic pathway. For example, 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrabromoethane was reduced by cytochrome P- 450 CAM to 1, 2 -dibromoethenes, which were subsequently oxidized by toluene dioxygenase. The same pathway metabolized 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrachloro- 2, 2 -difluoroethane to oxalic acid {{as one of}} the final products. The results obtained in this study indicate that P. putida G 786 (pHG- 2) metabolizes polyfluorinated, chlorinated, and brominated compounds and further demonstrates the value of using a knowledge of catabolic enzymes and recombinant DNA technology to construct useful metabolic pathways...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) <b>compounds</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} as agents contributing to the reduction of stratospheric ozone. It Is incumbent upon the electronics industry, as a primary user of CFC solvents, to find alternative processes and materigls which eliminate the need for CFCs. One such alternative is the substitution of water-soluble fluxes in the soTdering process. As a follow on to earlier studies where the more traditional cleaning processes involving rosin-based fluxes and CFC solvents were characterized, the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Indianapolis, (NAWC Indianapolis, formerly Naval Avionics Center) in a joint industry/military/EPA program is doing a comparative study of the overall cleanliness of printed wiring board assemblies exposed to water soluble fluxes and cleaned with water...|$|R
40|$|This PhD project {{dealt with}} {{different}} topics mainly linked together by fluorinated compounds. The work started from the preparation and characterization of mesoporous materials as support for catalysts {{for the production}} of fluorinated monomers of industrial interest. From these monomers, fluorinated polymers are obtained through industrial processes, with all their interesting properties, due to the presence of fluorine, such as thermal and chemical stability, flame resistance. This particular family of polymer find many applications, but their use as catalyst in gas-phase reactions is still poorly investigated. Indeed, the research work was focused also on the use of fluorinated polymers, in particular perfluorosulfonic superacid resins, as catalyst in gas-phase reactions. Consequently, this work can be divided in three main sections. Section 1 : preparation and characterization of PdCu/MCM- 41 catalysts for hydrodechlorination (HDC) reaction of <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> <b>compounds</b> with the aim to obtain fluorinated monomers. In previous works, has been demonstrated that microporous texture of activated carbon used as support, significantly limited possible application of this catalytic system, because of reduced mass transfer. Support with larger pores, as mesoporous silicate materials (such as MCM- 41) can overcame these drawbacks. Section 2 : The competences achieved during {{the first part of the}} work were exploited for the synthesis and characterization of mesoporous carbon material, always with the aim to solve the problems related to microporous features of active carbon based material. This part of the work is strongly linked with the previous section due to mesoporous features. Section 3 : Study of Aquivion® PFSA, a perfluorosulfonic resin produced by Solvay Specialty Polymers, as catalyst in gas-phase dehydration reaction. The application of this particular polymer, with an acidity close to that of 100...|$|R
40|$|Hydrofluoric acid is a water {{solution}} of hydrogen fluoride (HF). Hydrofluoric acid is used widely in diverse types of industrial applications; traditionally, {{it is used}} in pickling solutions in the metal industry, in the fabrication of <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> <b>compounds,</b> as an alkylation agent for gasoline and as an etching agent in the industry of glass. In recent years, hydrofluoric acid has extensively {{been used in the}} manufacture of semiconductors and microelectronics during the wet chemical cleaning of silicon wafers. Hydrofluoric acid can be considered a reducing acid and although it is chemically classified as weaker than, for example, sulfuric or hydrochloric acids, it is extremely corrosive. This acid is also particularly toxic and poses greater health hazard than most other acids. The corrosion behavior of metals in hydrofluoric acid has not been as systematic studied in the laboratory as for other common inorganic acids. This is largely because tests using hydrofluoric acid cannot be run in standard equipment and because of the toxic nature of this acid. Moreover, short-term weight loss laboratory corrosion tests in hydrofluoric acid can be frustrating since the results are not as highly reproducible {{as in the case of}} other acids such as sulfuric or hydrochloric. One of the reasons is because hydrofluoric acid commonly attacks the coupons used for testing in a non-uniform manner. That is, the corrosive power of this acid is not aimed to uniform thinning but mostly to localized penetration below the skin of the metal in the form of thin cracks, voids, pits, trenches and sometimes intergranular attack. Figure 1 shows the cross section of a coupon of Alloy 600 (N 06600) exposed for 336 h to the vapor phase of a {{solution of}} 20 % HF at 93 C. In cases where internal penetration occurs such as in Figure 1, it may not be recommended to use corrosion rates based on weight loss for material selection...|$|R
40|$|A high {{interest}} in predicting physical, chemical, and biological properties of halogenated compounds {{is generated by}} the urgent need to develop alternatives to <b>chlorofluorocarbons,</b> new <b>compounds</b> with low ozone depletion potential and a low global warming potential. Quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRR) for halogenated compounds {{can be used to}} predict gas chromatographic retention indices by using theoretical descriptors computed from the chemical structure. QSRR models for the gas chromatographic retention indices of 207 halogenated compounds are established with the CODESSA (Comprehensive Descriptors for Structural and Statistical Analysis) program. The best results are obtained with a group of QSRR models with six structural descriptors, with a correlation coefficient between 0. 994 and 0. 993 and a leave-one-out cross-validation correlation coefficient between 0. 992 and 0. 991. All QSRR models contain the Kier and Hall connectivity index 1 χ v, the number of F atoms NoF, and the gravitation index for all pairs of atoms G 1. A fourth descriptor comes from the class of charged-partial surface area indices, while the remaining two descriptors are related to the number of I or Br atoms, bond order, or Randic connectivity index 1 χ. QSRR models developed with CODESSA allow accurate computation of the gas chromatographic retention indexes of halogenated compounds using simple constitutional, topological, geometric, electrostatic and quantum descriptors that can be computed with standard quantum chemistry packages...|$|R
30|$|The {{original}} {{appearance of}} the ozone layer allowed the emergence of life on land, because ozone in the stratosphere filters out ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Human use of <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> and other <b>compounds</b> has depleted ozone, and resulted in the thinning {{of the ozone layer}} in the polar stratosphere. This exposes humans to health risks and has negative effects on marine ecosystems. Ozone depletion is also the major cause of changes in the pattern of atmospheric circulation in the southern hemisphere (Portmann et al. 2012). Climate models suggest that ozone depletion led to a significant increase in rainfall across SE South America during the last 40 years of the 20 th century. Any recovery of the ozone layer in the future may thus lead to a drying of this region, with consequent adverse effects on agriculture and economies (Gonzalez et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|So {{how quickly}} will the ozone hole recover? This {{depends on how}} quickly the {{chlorine}} content (Cl 2) of the atmosphere will decline. The ozone hole forms over the Antarctic each southern spring (September and October). The extremely small ozone amounts in the ozone hole are there because of chemical reactions of ozone with chlorine. This chlorine originates largely from industrially produced <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) <b>compounds.</b> An international agreement, the Montreal Protocol, is drastically {{reducing the amount of}} chlorine-containing compounds that we are releasing into the atmosphere. To be able to attribute changes in stratospheric ozone to changes in chlorine we need to know the distribution of atmospheric chlorine. However, {{due to a lack of}} continuous observations of all the key chlorine gases, producing a continuous time series of stratospheric chlorine has not been achieved to date. We have for the first time devised a technique to make a 17 -year time series for stratospheric chlorine that uses the long time series of HCl observations made from several space borne instruments and a neural network. The neural networks allow us to both inter-calibrate the various HCl instruments and to infer the total amount of atmospheric chlorine from HCl. These new estimates of Cl, provide a much needed critical test for current global models that currently predict significant differences in both Cl(sub y) and ozone recovery. These models exhibit differences in their projection of the recovery time and our chlorine content time series will help separate the good from the bad in these projections...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest in chlorine-containing trace gases in the atmosphere, particularly in Antarctica because {{of the relationship between}} chlorofluorocarbons and the antarctic ozone hole. All chlorinecontaining trace gases, whether produced by human activities or by natural processes, have a potential for destroying ozone in the stratosphere. This is a complex environmental problem, {{but it is clear that}} manmade chlorine-containing gases are the driving force behind the antarctic ozone hole and, by extension, reductions of stratospheric ozone over other parts of the world [World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 1989, 1991, 1995]. We have taken measurements of the major chlorine-containing gases in Antarctica for more than 20 years, first at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station and more recently at Palmer Station (64. 46 °S 64. 04 °W). Here we report the results of this work. During recent years, major changes in the concentration of ozone-depleting compounds have taken place in Antarctica because of the Montreal Protocol, which is designed to phase out the production of <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> and related <b>compounds,</b> to prevent the destruction of the ozone layer (WMO 1995) ...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{stable isotope}} ((13) C) {{fractionation}} in <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> (CFC) <b>compounds</b> arising from abiotic (chemical) degradation using zero-valent iron (ZVI) and biotic (landfill gas attenuation) processes is investigated. Batch tests (at 25 °C) for CFC- 113 and CFC- 11 using ZVI show quantitative degradation of CFC- 113 to HCFC- 123 a and CFC- 1113 following pseudo-first-order kinetics corresponding to a half-life (τ(1 / 2)) of 20. 5 h, and a ZVI surface-area normalized rate constant (k(SA)) of -(9. 8 ± 0. 5) × 10 (- 5) L m(- 2) h(- 1). CFC- 11 degraded to trace HCFC- 21 and HCFC- 31 following pseudo-first-order kinetics corresponding to τ(1 / 2) = 17. 3 h and k(SA) = -(1. 2 ± 0. 5) × 10 (- 4) L m(- 2) h(- 1). Significant kinetic isotope effects of ε(‰) = - 5. 0 ± 0. 3 (CFC- 113) and - 17. 8 ± 4. 8 (CFC- 11) were observed. Compound-specific carbon isotope analyses {{also have been}} used here to characterize source signatures of CFC gases (HCFC- 22, CFC- 12, HFC- 134 a, HCFC- 142 b, CFC- 114, CFC- 11, CFC- 113) for urban (UAA), rural/remote (RAA), and landfill (LAA) ambient air samples, {{as well as in}} situ surface flux chamber (FLUX; NO FLUX) and landfill gas (LFG) samples at the Dargan Road site, Northern Ireland. The latter values reflect biotic degradation and isotopic fractionation in LFG production, and local atmospheric impact of landfill emissions through the cover. Isotopic fractionations of Δ(13) C ∼ - 13 ‰ (HCFC- 22), Δ(13) C ∼ - 35 ‰ (CFC- 12) and Δ(13) C ∼ - 15 ‰ (CFC- 11) were observed for LFG in comparison to characteristic solvent source signatures, with the magnitude of the isotopic effect for CFC- 11 apparently similar to the kinetic isotope effect for (abiotic) ZVI degradation...|$|R
