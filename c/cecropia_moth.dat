40|$|The larvae of {{the giant}} silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia) spin strikingly dimorphic, {{multilayered}} cocoons that are either large and fluffy (baggy) or significantly smaller and tightly woven (compact). Although these cocoon-morphs share the same function (i. e., housing for pupal to adult development during overwintering), previous work {{has been unable to}} determine why cocoon dimorphism exists. We addressed this issue in <b>cecropia</b> <b>moth</b> cocoons collected along power line right-of-way habitats in Massachusetts. We first characterized the architectural differences between cocoon-morphs for all three cocoon sections (outer and inner envelopes, and the intermediate layer separating the two). We show that outer envelope structural and ultrastructural differences are what underlie dimorphism. Using a common spinning arena, we next show that the behavioral suites used to construct the outer envelopes of the two morphs are significantly different in behavioral time investment and patterning, {{as well as in the}} location of silk placement in the common spinning arena. Finally, we compared the cocoon-morphs in response to various environmental stressors to ask whether dimorphism is an adaptive response to such pressures. In contrast to compact cocoons, we find that baggy cocoons act as heat sinks and allow greater moisture permeability; differences in outer envelope architecture underlie these characteristics. These two biophysical properties could be advantageous for pupae in baggy cocoons, during unseasonably cold or dry conditions encountered during development prior to adult emergence. Our results suggest that cocoon dimorphism in the <b>cecropia</b> <b>moth</b> may provide a bet-hedging strategy for dealing with varying environmental conditions in Massachusetts and perhaps over its entire habitat range, during pupal to adult development...|$|E

The latter presumably donates the nitrogen of the amide group present on the COOH-terminal leucine residue of the mature cecropin B. The sequence deduced for the mature cecropin B differed in the COOH-terminal region from the tentative structure previously determined by carboxypeptidase digestion. To settle the discrepancy, cecropin B was synthesized according to the cDNA sequence with an amidated COOH-terminal leucine.

The other class II mutant was an incomplete revertant still susceptible to immune hemolymph and with repressed export of proteins. Virulence was not coupled to phage resistance as such or to lack of flagella because other mutants affected in these properties were virulent.

40|$|An intense (up to 20 μA/cm 2) steady {{electrical}} current enters the anterior or nurse cell {{end of the}} growing follicle (or oocyte—nurse cell complex) of the <b>Cecropia</b> <b>moth</b> and is balanced by a more diffuse current leaving elsewhere. In late growth stages, the total transfollicular current is about 100 nA. Moreover, a separate small current, of about 1 nA, seems to leave the furrow between the oocyte and the nurse cells. After the nurse cells collapse, but before shell formation, the transfollicular current is redistributed so that a second relatively localized inward current appears at the posterior pole of the follicle. Thus, at this later stage currents enter both poles of the follicle and leave its sides. Previous measurements, with intracellular microelectrodes, seem to imply a very large (order of 1000 nA) back current across the cytoplasmic bridge between the oocyte and nurse cells. A simple model is presented that attributes the apparent bridge current, and the more directly measured transfollicular and furrow currents, to the action of an ion pump lying within the nurse cell face of the furrow membrane...|$|E
40|$|Most insects produce {{two or more}} storage hexamers whose {{constituents}} and developmental profiles are sufficiently different to suggest specialization {{in the ways that}} they support metamorphosis and reproduction. Hexamerin specializations are compared here in the <b>Cecropia</b> <b>moth</b> (Hyalophora cecropia), which produces eggs during the pupal-adult molt, and the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), which produces eggs under long-day conditions after adult eclosion. In both sexes of both species, reserves of arylphorin (ArH) were exhausted by the end of metamorphosis. In Cecropia, the same was true for the high-methionine hexamerins, V-MtH and M-MtH. But in short day Monarch females 20 - 30 % of the pupal reserves of V-MtH and M-MtH survived metamorphosis, persisting until long-day conditions were imposed to stimulate egg formation. Differences in storage sites have been documented in other lepidopterans, with MtH reserves being found primarily in fat body protein granules and the ArH reserve being found primarily in the hemolymph. Similar differences could explain how a fraction of the MtH's, but not of ArH, escapes utilization during metamorphosis in a species with post-eclosion egg formation.

Antibody reaction was used to show the selective synthesis of immune proteins P 4 and P 5 with mRNA from pupae subjected to injury or infection. The protein synthesized in vitro, which cross-reacted with P 5 antibodies, is most likely a precursor of the attacins described in the preceding paper. A cDNA clone bank was prepared and two clones were isolated and shown to contain 750 bp corresponding to P 4 and 250 bp of attacin information. These clones were used to estimate the sizes of the mRNAs by Northern blotting and to estimate, by RNA/DNA hybridization, the levels of P 4 and P 5 mRNA.

Chromatofocusing separated attacins A-F, with isoelectric points between 5. 7 and 8. 3. Immunological experiments show that the attacins constitute antibacterially active forms of the previously isolated inducible immune protein P 5.

The six attacins can be divided into two groups according to their amino acid composition and amino-terminal sequences, attacins A-D constitute a basic group and attacins E and F an acidic one. Within each group the forms are very similar. The attacins efficiently killed Escherichia coli and two other Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the gut of a silk worm but they did not act on other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested.

40|$|Cecropins, {{positively}} charged antibacterial peptides {{found in the}} <b>cecropia</b> <b>moth,</b> and synthetic peptide analogs form large time-variant and voltage-dependent ion channels in planar lipid membranes in the physiological range of concentration. Single-channel conductances of up to 2. 5 nS (in 0. 1 M NaCl) were observed, which suggests a channel diameter of 4 nm. Channels formed by the peptides cecropin AD and MP 3 had a permeability ratio of Cl-/Na+ = 2 : 1 in 0. 1 M NaCl. A comparative study of the three cecropins, cecropins A, B, and D, and of six synthetic analogs allowed determination of structural requirements for pore formation. Shorter amphipathic peptides did not form channels, although they adsorbed to the bilayer. A flexible segment between the N-terminal amphipathic region and the C-terminal more hydrophobic region of the peptide was required for the observation of a time-variant, voltage-dependent conductance. Cecropin AD was the most effective voltage-dependent pore-forming peptide and was also the most potent antibacterial peptide against several test organisms. A positive surface charge or cholesterol in the bilayer reduced the conductances caused by cecropin AD or MP 3 by at least 5 -fold. This behavior {{is consistent with the}} known insensitivity of eukaryotic cells to cecropins.

40|$|Fluorescein-labeled rabbit serum {{globulin}} was injected into vitellogenic oocytes of the <b>cecropia</b> <b>moth.</b> Though the label {{spread throughout the}} ooplasm in less than 30 min, it was unable even after 2 h to cross the complex of intercellular bridges connecting the oocyte to its seven nurse cells. After injection into a single nurse cell, fluorescence was detected in the oocyte adjacent to the bridge complex within 3 min and had spread throughout the ooplasm in 30 min. Here also, the cell bodies of the six uninjected nurse cells remained nonfluorescent. Four of the nurse cells are not bridged directly to the oocyte but only through the apical ends of their siblings. Unidirectional movement must therefore occur in the apical cytoplasm of the nurse cells, {{as well as in}} the intercellular bridges. The nurse cells of healthy follicles had an intracellular electrical potential - 40 mV relative to blood or dissecting solution, while oocytes measured - 30 mV. A mV difference was also detected by direct comparison between a ground electrode in one cell and a recording electrode in the other. Three conditions were found in which the 10 mV difference was reduced or reversed in polarity.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed for separating the oocytes and follicular epithelium-nurse cell complexes making up the vitellogenic ovarian follicle of the <b>Cecropia</b> <b>moth.</b> Both com-ponents remained viable during short-term in vitro incubation in female blood. Isolated epithelial cells were found by autoradiography to incorporate tritiated amino acids and to secrete a fixable, non-dialysable labelled material. Isolated oocytes incubated in a blood medium containing this tritiated, dialysed follicle cell product incorporated it in small cortical yolk bodies, presumably by pinocytosis. Quantitative perchloric acid-precipitation and scintil-lation counting indicated {{that the amount of}} labelled material incorporated by the oocytes increased with time. These results provide direct confirmation of a follicle contribution to the yolk. Isolated oocytes were also tested for their ability to incorporate labelled amino acids. Fixable label was observed autoradiographically throughout the oocyte cytoplasm, with the greatest concentration in the cortex, but little appeared in the yolk spheres. The amount of perchloric acid-precipitable amino acid in oocytes incubated in female blood increased with time for up to 2 h and then remained constant or decreased slightly. In medium that had been previously conditioned by follicle cells and dialysed, however, incorporation of labelled amino acid continued for at least 4 h. A possible interpretation of this result is that stimulation of pinocytosis by the epithelial cell products causes increased turnover of cell membrane and demands continued synthesis of new proteins. Labelled female blood proteins were not incorporated into yolk to an appreciable extent by isolated oocytes, even in the presence of follicle cell product. Perhaps extracellular preconcen-tration, as occurs in the intact follicle, is necessary for effective accrual of blood proteins. The female blood proteins did become associated with the oocyte cortex, however, and exhibited a higher affinity for the oocyte than male blood proteins. Thus preferential adsorption to the oocyte surface may be a component of the selection process in vitellogenesis...|$|E
