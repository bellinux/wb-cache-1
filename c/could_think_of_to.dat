25|$|The Great Depression created {{economic}} obstacles for the park, and Owen {{lost her}} congressional seat. Coe, however, worked tirelessly for the park's establishment in Washington D.C. He sent coconuts to congressmen, President Herbert Hoover, and the Secretary of the Interior. While {{the concept of}} what landscapes were worth protecting were developing {{in the minds of}} scientists and politicians, Coe used any tactic he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> advance the idea of Everglades National Park, even equating its powers with the mythical Fountain of Youth. He took Congressional appointees from the Department of the Interior on tours through the Everglades, and though attempts to establish the park failed twice, it finally passed in May 1934. It carried a provision that the federal government would not be responsible for buying lands for the park, but its establishment ensured that no more land would be purchased from the protected area. Removing the prospect of developing lands in South Florida angered many state politicians. Newly elected governor Fred P. Cone fired Coe and left the Everglades Tropic National Park Commission without any guidance.|$|E
2500|$|Describing his {{gameplay}} {{strategy in}} 1930, he said, [...] "My system was all offense. I believed in {{putting up a}} mental hazard for the other fellow. If we were five or six runs ahead, I'd try some wild play, such as going from first to home on a single. This helped to make the other side hurry the play in a close game later on. I worked out all the angles I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>to</b> keep them guessing and hurrying." [...] In the same interview, Cobb talked about having noticed a throwing tendency of first baseman Hal Chase, but having to wait two full years until the opportunity came to exploit it. By unexpectedly altering his own baserunning tendencies, {{he was able to}} surprise Chase and score the winning run of the game in question.|$|E
2500|$|Reed {{established}} himself as {{a force to be reckoned}} with while competing in Bill Watts’ Mid-South Wrestling from 1983 through early 1986. In Mid-South, he was known as “Hacksaw" [...] Butch Reed and came into the territory as a tag team partner for the main face in the territory the Junkyard Dog. Reed immediately came face to face with [...] "Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan over the “Hacksaw" [...] nickname. Back in 1983, Duggan was part of the heel group the [...] "Rat Pack" [...] along with Ted DiBiase and Matt Borne and used every dirty move he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> beat Butch Reed. Reed and Duggan would feud over the “Hacksaw" [...] name until Jim Duggan turned face. Duggan’s face turn resulted in Butch Reed’s heel turn when Duggan was picked to be the Junkyard Dog’s tag team partner over Reed.|$|E

60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing <b>to</b> say, to any purpose, and {{my mouth}} was very dry. The wind and the wires took up the story with a long lamenting wail.|$|R
2500|$|Joan Quigley {{first met}} Nancy Reagan in the 1970s on The Merv Griffin Show. After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley {{if she could have}} foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying that she could have done so had she been looking at the time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people can understand what it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed all the time to enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun.... I was doing everything I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> protect my husband and keep him alive." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nothing except marriage,' {{answered}} the king. And he invited all the handsomest young men he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> the palace, and bade the princess choose a husband from among them.|$|E
6000|$|The Nome King <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing <b>to</b> say next, so he puffed away at {{his pipe}} and paced {{up and down the}} room. Finally, he remembered how angry he was, and cried out: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} {{all about what}} I had been doing, where I had gone, and {{everything}} I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> likely <b>to</b> amuse him, and {{was still in the}} middle of my story when Miss Harmer came in.|$|R
6000|$|... "When we ’eard {{that the}} tiger ’ad been seen within three miles of Claybury {{things began to}} look serious, and Peter Gubbins said that {{something}} ought to be done, but before we <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything <b>to</b> do something ’appened.|$|R

6000|$|... "He has his {{daughter}} still," [...] Le Neve put in, vaguely. It {{was all he}} <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> say by way of consolation; and to him, Cleer Trevennack would have made up for anything.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hollo! What is it?' And as he {{received}} no answer--'Wilmet's {{not given up}} Jack? Eh? Nor Cherry fallen in love next? Clem hasn't turned bare-footed friar?' crowding together the wildest suggestions he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> force answer.|$|E
60|$|His {{silence and}} anxious looks {{returned}} {{as they drove}} from the station, and she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing <b>to</b> say but the old hope that the baby was better. As they stopped, he threw open the carriage-door, and springing out, impatiently rang.|$|R
60|$|As Mr. Dove <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{no reply}} <b>to</b> her very final Scriptural example, he {{attacked}} {{her on the}} latter point.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; and Smith was the commonest name he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> go with it. The most {{surprising}} thing," [...] added their uncle, [...] "is {{the fact that}} a man of his standing was not missed or sought for." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{ground was}} damp and scent always lies best on damp ground. This {{made it easy}} for the hounds to follow him with their {{wonderful}} noses. Lightfoot tried every trick he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> make those hounds lose the scent.|$|E
60|$|For {{two months}} Goodloe Banks and I--separately--tried every scheme we <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> track the runaways.

60|$|He {{took the}} hand and shook it, but for the life <b>of</b> him <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing <b>to</b> say. Not {{one of the little}} speeches he had {{prepared}} would come into his mind. Yet the desperate necessity of saying something forced itself upon him.|$|R

60|$|Look {{on which}} side he would, nothing but ruin seemed to lie before him, {{and he became}} so gloomy, that his daughters were frightened, and did {{everything}} they <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> cheer him up, but all to no purpose.|$|E
6000|$|Never {{has there}} been a gayer Court.

6000|$|... "With all my heart, sir," [...] said Dennet, {{coming to}} him with outstretched hands. [...] "Oh! sir, canst thou save them? I have been vowing all I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> our Lady and the saints, {{and now they are}} going to grant it!" ...|$|E

60|$|He {{wanted to}} use this as the {{beginning}} of a conversation, but he was strangely nervous and <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing <b>to</b> say. She gave him no opportunity, but at once went away. He had no chance of saying anything till he asked for his bill.|$|R

60|$|Just {{then all}} that Sandridge <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> {{do was to}} go outside and throw himself face {{downward}} in the dust by the side of his humming-bird, of whom not a feather fluttered.

60|$|At {{the head}} of the table sat, in the Bishop's throne and state, which had been hastily brought thither from his great council chamber, the redoubted Boar of Ardennes himself, well deserving that dreaded name in which he {{affected}} to delight, and which he did as much as he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> deserve.|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} {{commander}} <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing <b>to</b> do {{to relieve the}} vessel, but presently {{it was suggested that}} the ice be chopped away from the bow and one side in a slanting direction.
