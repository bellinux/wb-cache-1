40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{telecommunication}} problem known as inter-cell interference is examined. Inter-cell interference originates from users in neighboring cells and affects the {{users in the}} own cell. The reason that inter-cell interference is interesting to study is that it affects the maximum data-rates achievable in the 3 G network. By knowing the inter-cell interference, higher data-rates can be scheduled without risking cell-instability. An expression for the coupling between cells is derived using basic physical principles. Using the expression for the <b>coupling</b> <b>factors</b> a nonlinear model describing the inter-cell interference is developed from {{the model of the}} power control loop commonly used in the base stations. The expression describing the <b>coupling</b> <b>factors</b> depends on the positions of users which are unknown.

500|$|The symbols {{most often}} used for {{directional}} couplers {{are shown in figure}} 1. [...] The symbol may have the <b>coupling</b> <b>factor</b> in dB marked on it.

[...] Port 2 is the transmitted port where the power from port 1 is outputted, less the portion that went to port 3. [...] Directional couplers are frequently symmetrical so there also exists port 4, the isolated port. [...] A portion of the power applied to port 2 will be coupled to port 4.

500|$|The λ/4 coupled line {{design is}} good for coaxial and {{stripline}} implementations but does not work so well in the now popular microstrip format, although designs do exist. [...] The {{reason for this is}} that microstrip is not a homogeneous medium – there are two different mediums above and below the transmission strip. [...] This leads to transmission modes other than the usual TEM mode found in conductive circuits. [...] The propagation velocities of even and odd modes are different leading to signal dispersion. [...] A better solution for microstrip is a coupled line much shorter than λ/4, shown in figure 5, but this has the disadvantage of a <b>coupling</b> <b>factor</b> which rises noticeably with frequency. [...] A variation of this design sometimes encountered has the coupled line a higher impedance than the main line such as shown in figure 6.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of energy among the subsystems of a system {{can be found in}} terms of the modes of the system. If there are enough modes in the frequency band of interest then the system can be described by an SEA model. However, in general this is a "quasi-SEA" model, which involves both direct and indirect <b>coupling</b> loss <b>factors,</b> whose values depend on the modal overlap. This paper explores the conditions under which the indirect <b>coupling</b> loss <b>factors</b> are zero, so that the system is described by a "proper-SEA" model. It also investigates the dependence of the direct and indirect <b>coupling</b> loss <b>factors</b> on the modal properties of the system and on the modal overlap. In summary, the indirect <b>coupling</b> loss <b>factors</b> are zero, so that a proper-SEA model can be formed, either if all the system modes are local or in the weak coupling regime as the modal overlap becomes large. It is seen that in the low modal overlap limit the <b>coupling</b> loss <b>factors</b> are proportional to the damping loss factor and equipartition of energy only occurs if all modes are global. For higher modal overlap the SEA parameters depend on the detailed statistics of the modes and the situation is complicated. However, if all the modes are local the indirect <b>coupling</b> loss <b>factors</b> are all zero. In the high modal overlap limit the <b>coupling</b> loss <b>factors</b> asymptote to constants, with indirect <b>coupling</b> loss <b>factors</b> becoming zero. This behaviour occurs because of mode shape correlation at the boundary between two directly connected subsystems...|$|R
