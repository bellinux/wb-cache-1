40|$|International audienceIndium Phosphide is a {{material}} of primary relevance {{in the field}} of opto-electronics since it supersedes conventional materials such as AsGa for electron mobility and heat conduction for instance. It is often doped with iron to reduce its conductivity and enhance its light dependent conduction properties. Indium Phosphide is well known for its two <b>carrier</b> <b>band</b> transport conduction mechanism, where both electrons and holes play a significant role. Its transport mechanisms have been heavily investigated, especially in the dark. Light induced charge transport, on the contrary, has beeninvestigated {{at the end of the}} XX th century as far as periodic illumination stemming from beam interference is concerned. More recently, non periodic illumination was tackled. Both have shown the existence of a particular intensity, named the resonance intensity, at which charge transportis enhanced and around which it changes behavior. Both have in common the small modulation hypothesis where ligh intensity is assumed not to deviate too far from its mean value. InP:Fe being a electro-optic material, this resonance mechanism has been shown to be at the heartof a light induced refractive index modulation, leading to light self-focusing. However, a one beam illumination is far from the small modulation hypothesis. Experiments indeed show that the very notion of resonance intensity no longer holds. They also show a behavior-reversal intensity. Itsvalue is different from that of the resonance intensity, but remains to be explained. We attempt here a theoretical study of the two <b>carrier</b> <b>band</b> transport model in InP:Fe, in the simplifying framework of one single space dimension alongside the time dimension. Our originalapproach is to rule out all conventional approximations, aiming to justify each of them mathematically with precise numerical values. Once this is done, we go on to a simplified model of two carrier transport in InP:Fe, for which basic simulation will be undertook and checked against experimentalresults. The mathematical method undertook here is know as multi-scale modeling. It is needed because of the presence of largely varying orders of magnitudes in the parameters of the two <b>carrier</b> <b>band</b> transport model...|$|E

40|$|The {{decrease}} of minority carrier lifetime as resistivity decreases in dendritic-web silicon solar cells is addressed. This variation {{is shown to}} be consistent with the presence of defect levels in the bandgap which arise from extended defects in the web material. The extended defects are oxide precipitates (SiOx) and the dislocation cores they decorate. Sensitivity to this background distribution of defect levels increases with doping because the Fermi level moves closer to the majority <b>carrier</b> <b>band</b> edge. For high-resistivity dendritic-web silicon, which has a low concentration of these extended defects, cell efficiencies as high as 16. 6 percent (4 sq cm, 40 ohm-cm boron-doped base, AM 1. 5 global, 100 mW/sq cm, 25 C JPL LAPSS 1 measurement) and a corresponding electron lifetime of 38 microsec have been obtained.

The N implanted sample (Ninterface ~ 1 x 1019 cm- 3) is compared with a non-implanted one (Ninterface ~ 1 x 1016 cm- 3) by means of the electron interface trap density (Dit). The Dit is determined via High-Low frequency C-V method and Thermal Dielectric Relaxation Current (TDRC) technique. It is shown that the TDRC method, mainly used so far for determination of near interface oxide charges, can be exploited to gain information about the Dit too. The determined value of Dit in the N-implanted sample is nearly one order of magnitude lower than that in the sample without N implantation. Good agreement between the TDRC results and those obtained from High-Low frequency C-V measurements is obtained.

Shift of 3 mm or more caused the consonant recognition scores to decrease significantly. The effects of spectral resolution disappeared when the amount of shift reached ≥ 3 mm. Information transmitted for voicing and place of articulation varied with spectral shift and spectral resolution, while information transmitted for manner was affected only by spectral shift but not spectral resolution. Spectral shift has shown specific effects on the confusion patterns of the consonants. The direction of errors reversed as spectral shift increased and the patterns of reversal were consistent across channel conditions.
