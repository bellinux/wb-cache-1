40|$|Some of {{the latest}} {{financial}} products that have become prevalent on Wall Street defy easy categorization for tax purposes. Certain products, such as economic derivatives or weather derivatives, bear the trappings of options, but lack an underlying property component. Other products, such as credit default swaps, have option-type payouts, but are cast {{in the form of}} financial swaps. Which of these products are truly options and why? When and how to tax these instruments depends on proper resolution of this fundamental classification issue. With respect to credit default swaps, arguably the single most important product innovation on Wall Street in the last 20 years, {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in potential tax liability (on <b>cross-border</b> <b>swap</b> payments) are riding on a resolution of this issue. This article tackles a longstanding philosophical question which has modern-day resonance in the ongoing debate over the appropriate taxation {{of the latest}} generation of financial products. Relying on contract-law principles and economic risk analysis, the article revisits longstanding case law to fashion a modern-day definition for what constitutes an option. Ultimately, it resolves the question of whether the concept of an option properly encompasses non-property-based options, such as economic or weather derivatives, as well as contingent options, such as credit default swaps. The article concludes by proposing a basis for differentiating between options and financial swaps, two product categories which have overlapping reach, allowing taxpayers to avoid undesired tax results by the simple expedient of selecting the desired form of transaction. While the article’s suggested approach would deprive taxpayers of the flexibility inherent in current law’s ambiguity, this flexibility conflicts with the government’s asserted interest in promoting neutrality in the taxation of financial products. Equally important, the financial products sector is more likely to thrive when uncertainties in the taxation of economically useful transaction are satisfactorily resolved...|$|E
50|$|While A&D was a British Electric Traction {{company with}} a varied fleet {{including}} mostly Dennis Lolines and AEC Reliances, Thames Valley had a typical Tilling Group fleet comprising almost entirely Bristol vehicles. Some <b>cross-border</b> <b>swapping</b> of vehicles occurred between the two divisions after the merger. Through NBC days, Alder Valley adopted the Leyland National and Bristol VRT as its standard single and double deck buses. In the early/mid-1970s there was a severe shortage of vehicles, resulting in the hiring-in of a varied fleet which included a Trans World Airlines double decker noted on services from Aldershot, including the service 12 to Reading in 1974; a number of elderly City of Oxford AEC Reliances in maroon and green livery, which operated Aldershot local services; {{and at least two}} ageing Sheffield United Tours coaches which operated daily on the Farnham to London service. Vehicle shortages (together with poor staff morale and retention) led to poor customer service at this time, with many service cancellations.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{linkages}} between volatility of interest rate swaps (hereafter, IRS) and macroeconomic risk, <b>cross-border</b> linkages of <b>swap</b> markets from two-factor volatility models, {{and the influence of}} three additional risk factors on swap spreads. In order to investigate these, the thesis presents three empirical research essays that all revolve around a common theme: volatility and risk modelling in interest rate swaps. First research essay, presented in Chapter 3, explores whether and how the volatility of swap yield curves is related to macroeconomic risk. The methodology in this essay is based on a recent Spline-GARCH model, multivariate regression, principal component analysis and Granger causality. The empirical analysis is conducted on a sample of daily data for the period between 1987 and 2010 from three major swap markets namely, Japan, the UK and the US. The empirical analysis reveals two important findings. First, using “low-frequency” volatility extracted from aggregate volatility shocks of the three swap markets the analysis suggests that this low-frequency IRS volatility has strong and (mostly) positive association with most of the macroeconomic risk proxies. This relationship between the macroeconomic risks and IRS volatility varies slightly across the different swap maturities but is robust to alternative volatility specifications, namely C-GARCH model and model-free realized volatility. This finding is fairly consistent with the argument that the greater the macroeconomic risk the greater is the use of derivative instruments to hedge or speculate. Second, to explore the dynamic interaction including lead-lag relationship, the study finds that it is the low-frequency (IRS) volatility that Granger causes most of the macroeconomic risk proxies. This finding is, nonetheless, consistent with the argument that, as forward looking instrument, IRS has predictive power to forecast the changes in macroeconomic risk. Motivated by these findings, an empirical analysis is done on reverse regression in which macroeconomic risk proxies and their principal components are regressed on low-frequency volatility of swaps. The findings are encouraging for those who would like to use swaps in predicting macroeconomic risk. Second research essay, presented in Chapter 4, explores whether the observed relationship between macroeconomic risk proxies and volatility of swap market can be extended to investigate the <b>cross-border</b> linkages of <b>swap</b> markets. The mixed and inconclusive evidence on volatility transmission and swap market integration motivated this essay to investigate this issue from different approach. In particular, using the decomposed volatilities (long-term and short-term), this essay examines the financial integration and volatility linkages of three major swap markets, namely Japan, the UK and the US. To facilitate empirical investigation, a step-by-step approach is proposed in measuring volatility transmission and financial linkages including dynamic correlations, contagion and causality of volatility components. These findings have important implications for portfolio risk diversifications in swaps. Third research essay, presented in Chapter 5, exploits the puzzle with regard to determinants and components of swap spreads. This essay argues that in addition to default risk and liquidity risk, three risk factors namely, business cycle risk, market skewness risk and correlation risk contain significant information in determining the swap spreads. Using the GMM approach, this essay provides empirical support of risk premia related to these three risk factors in addition to default and liquidity risk premia. The results are robust to sub-sample analysis...|$|R
