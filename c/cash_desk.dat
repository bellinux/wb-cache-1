25|$|After graduation, Landale {{followed}} {{the footsteps of}} his father to join Jardine Matheson in the Far East. He started from the <b>cash</b> <b>desk</b> and was eventually appointed {{a director of the}} firm in 1936, a position that he held until his death in 1970. As a member of the board, he was also appointed to the directorships of a number of subsidiary and affiliated companies of Jardine Matheson, such as the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd. He was appointed an unofficial Justice of the Peace by the Hong Kong government in 1937. At that time, the future prospect of the firm was shadowed by uncertainties arising from the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and the increasing instability in the Far East. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, he was enlisted to the Hong Kong Defence Reserve. Yet, he was permitted to quit the Reserve in the following year to join the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He saw active service until 1943, when he retired from the Volunteer Reserve as a lieutenant and was appointed as the Minister of War Transport Representative in the Middle East. His role was to help co-ordinate logistical support and transportation for the Allied Forces in that region. He held that position until the war ended in 1945. In the same year, he returned to Hong Kong, where he served briefly as the first Honorary Air Commodore of the Air Arm of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps.|$|E
2500|$|Another legend is {{that the}} birth of poutine took place in Princeville at the {{restaurant}} La Petite Vache, founded in 1966 by Henri Provencher. At that time, the Princesse cheese factory (now located in Plessisville) produced grain cheese but {{did not have a}} retail kiosk. La Petite Vache being located in a building adjacent to the cheese factory, they began selling fresh cheese at the restaurant's <b>cash</b> <b>desk.</b> An assiduous customer came to the restaurant and ordered french fries and bought a sack of cheese curds, then went to his table, opened the bag and mixed the cheese in with his fries. Max Sévigny, who owned the restaurant, confirmed in November 2010 that the original designation was 50-50 referring to a mixture of 50% fries and 50% cheese. The sauce was then included, and the name [...] "mixed" [...] was adopted. The 50-50 made its appearance {{in the first year of}} operation of La Petite Vache. For several years, in the cities of Plessisville, Princeville and Victoriaville, the poutine was known as a [...] "mixed". It was only when large chains began to sell this product that the name [...] "poutine" [...] appeared; probably in connection with other dishes also called poutines and made from potatoes. The name [...] "mixed" [...] continued to be used for several years in the above-named cities even after the word poutine was widely spread.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, the Law #142-FZ “On Gambling Tax” {{being in}} effect for a sixth year, Chapter 29 “Gambling Tax” of the Russian Federation’s Tax Code came into effect. A new and the most {{complicated}} stage {{in the area of}} gambling taxation began. As of January 1, 2004, gambling tax became regional and its receipts are transferred to the budgets of the Federation’s constituent entities. As of 2004, each region was entitled to independently determine the gambling tax rate within the limits provided for by the Law #142-FZ “On Gambling Tax”. The taxation rate for slot machines with cash winnings was 1,500 to 7,500 roubles and for gaming tables, totalisator <b>cash</b> <b>desks</b> and bookmaker <b>cash</b> <b>desks</b> - 25,000 to 125,000 roubles.

I had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of boxes and drawers, but at last I managed to turn out what I sought; the box label called them lambswool pants, and lambswool vests. Then socks, a thick comforter, and then I went to the clothing place and got trousers, a lounge jacket, an overcoat and a slouch hat--a clerical sort of hat with the brim turned down.

His collar is so high that it scars his inaggressive jawbone, and his hat has a curly brim, his tie shows taste, his trousers are modestly brilliant, and his boots have light cloth uppers and button at the side. He jabs at the gravel before him with a cheap cane, and glances sideways at Flo Bates, the young lady from the <b>cash</b> <b>desk.</b> She is wearing a brilliant blouse and a gaily trimmed hat.

[...] The two things, I admit, pass by insensible gradations into one another, but while on the one hand such work as being a master gardener and growing roses, or a master cabinet maker and making fine pieces, or an artist of almost any sort, or a story writer, or a consulting physician, or a scientific investigator, or a keeper of wild animals, or a forester, or a librarian, or a good printer, or many sorts of engineer, is work that will always find men of a certain temperament enthusiastically glad to do it, if they can only do it for comfortable pay--for such work is in itself living--there is, on the other hand, work so irksome and toilsome, such as coal mining, or being a private soldier during a peace, or attending upon lunatics, or stoking, or doing over and over again, almost mechanically, little bits of a modern industrial process, or being a <b>cash</b> <b>desk</b> clerk in a busy shop, that few people would undertake if they could avoid it.|$|E
