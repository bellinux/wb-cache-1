40|$|Carding is one {{important}} step in processing line of jute spinning. The cylinder {{is the heart of}} the whole machine due to the carding action, which causes from its cylinder speed and other rollers. This action mainly occurs in breaker card machine. This study was carried out to find out the effectiveness of various speeds of breaker <b>card</b> <b>cylinder</b> on fibre length and quality of jute yarn 276 tex (8 lbs. /spy). Medium speed of the brake <b>card</b> <b>cylinder</b> was better than any other speeds for good fibre length and quality of jute yarn...|$|E
40|$|Textile {{production}} wastes are undesirable but inevitable by-products in any {{manufacturing process}} (spinning, weaving or knitting) and are frequently undervalued. However, {{if one can}} convert such wastes into useful product economically, there will be great contribution to the market. In the present investigation, therefore, torn-out garments were firstly cut, then opened and carded. The carded slivers were afterwards fed into the Dref 2 Machine, and yarns were spun at different <b>card</b> <b>cylinder</b> and perforated spinning drum speeds. Testing on the yarns and fabrics were then carried out to evaluate their performance...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{people have}} given credit to Richard Arkwright for inventing the doffer, which was {{incorporated}} in his machine, but others consider {{that it was}} invented by James Hargreaves. The design was refined by Samuel Crompton shortly after 1785. Before {{the surface of the}} <b>carding</b> <b>cylinder</b> reaches the doffer it passes a [...] "fancy roller", which brushes and raises the fibers on the cylinder so they can be transferred to the doffer more easily. In a wool mill a doffer would move relatively slowly compared {{to the surface of the}} <b>carding</b> <b>cylinder,</b> picking up the fiber. The fiber would then be removed from the doffer by a comb.|$|R
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use <b>carding</b> <b>cylinders.</b> He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|R
40|$|Carding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} preparatory processes in the short-staple spinning of yarn from a raw material such as cotton. The main purpose of carding is to individualise fibres thoroughly so that they can be spun into yarns. Therefore, the quality of the yarns spun and the quality of fabrics produced from them is largely determined by the effectiveness of the carding process. The design of the licker-in zone determines the degree of pre-opening, and so plays a major role in determining the carding efficiency. This work investigates and evaluates the influence and effectiveness of licker-in design in determining the quality of carded yarns and the fibre configurations in yarn with the two licker-in designs in use today, viz. the single and triple licker-in designs. Two Indian cotton fibre varieties with widely differing characteristics were processed on a commercial high-production card using the single and triple licker-in systems. The quality of yarns spun revealed that licker-in design indeed has a bearing on fibre, yarn and fabric quality. Test results show that whilst the triple licker-in system demonstrated a relative improvement in the yarn quality when processing the medium staple cotton of average fineness, the single licker-in was observed to be more suitable for the longer and finer variety. The analysis of the fibre configuration in yarns indicates that licker-in designs as well as the processing parameters such as licker-in speed and carding rate have an influence on the fibre configuration. Yarns spun using the material processed through the triple licker-in showed more disorder than those of the single licker-in. Finally, an investigation into the fibre opening at the licker-in using high-speed video photography indicates that the degree of opening and the fibre orientation on the licker-in surface before fibre transfer to the main <b>carding</b> <b>cylinder</b> is different between the two licker-in systems. The degree of opening and fibre orientation were also found to depend on the cotton variety, the production rate and licker-in parameters such as speed.

40|$|When {{examining}} the engineering {{decisions of the}} aircraft engine designers of the past {{it is necessary to}} bear in mind the many gaps in the understanding of engine-related phe-nomena with which they had to cope. These gaps were {{due to a lack of}} information that analytical and experimental techniques would eventually yield and included such topics as detonation, the thermodynamic properties of fuel-air mixtures and their products of combustion, fatigue of met-als, the inability to get accurate indicator <b>cards</b> from engine <b>cylinders,</b> and the prediction and amelioration of the effects of mechanical vibration, particularly torsional vibration. Despite these gaps in their knowledge, the engine designers could not be too conservative or aircraft would never have left the ground. Thus intuition and artistry played an important role in the early development of aircraft engines...|$|R
50|$|The {{exhibits}} {{were arranged}} {{to tell the}} story of wool manufacturing. The design was organized around a modular system of floor-to-ceiling posts and panels. The use of silk screens and photographic blow-ups, along with the use of color filled the galleries. The contents of the exhibit illustrated the transition from hand to machine technology in wool manufacturing. A ‘before’ and ‘after’ example was used at each stage in cloth production, from sheep-shearing to cloth-dyeing. The materials shown included artifacts, text blocks, illustrations, models, and replicas. Illustrations outnumbered the 3-dimensional objects by a ratio of 2 to 1. The exhibit contained less than 2 dozen artifacts that illustrated significant developments in textile technology. Among the machines on display were a wool picker, a double <b>cylinder</b> <b>carding</b> engine, a 200 spindle spinning jack, a two-harness plain loom, an automatic bobbin-changing dobby loom and a shearing machine.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the performance of spatial problems by rats when purely behavioral manipulations disturb the relation-ship between the place cell representation and the cues used to solve the problems. Place cells were recorded while rats per-formed a task {{in which they had}} to locate a goal in a gray cylinder. In the “far ” task, the unmarked goal was displaced by a large fixed distance from a white <b>card</b> on the <b>cylinder</b> wall. In the “near ” task, the unmarked goal was {{directly in front of the}} card. Finally, in the “cue ” task the goal was marked by a black disk on the cylinder floor. Relationships between visible stimuli and place cell activity were manipulated by conducting either “hidden ” (with the rat in its home cage) or “visible ” (with the rat in the recording apparatus) rotations of the wall card and, when present, independent rotations of the black disk. Hidden card rotations generally caused equal firing field rotations, wherea...|$|R
