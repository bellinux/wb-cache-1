50|$|A $4.5 million {{update to}} the chocolate-making tour ride opened in 1988, {{featuring}} a curious robot {{for a host}} named CP-1. It was phased out within a year. In the mid-1990s, the ride saw numerous revisions on a small scale, including the removal of several show elements. The last renovation occurred in early 2016 when several scenes in the chocolate tour ride were replaced. Today, there are still portions of the ride that have changed very little from the 1978 updated version, including the sorting and <b>cleaning,</b> <b>roll</b> refining, milling, and chocolate conching scenes.|$|E
50|$|The first no-direct-contact {{continuous}} {{process for the}} electrolytic pickling of stainless steel and degreasing and <b>cleaning</b> cold <b>roll</b> steel prior to coating was placed in operation at the Sharon Steel Hoop Corporation in 1933.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{model of}} {{electrolytic}} <b>cleaning</b> for cold <b>rolled</b> strip was established, and the simulation of cleaning process {{was carried out}} in the finite element method with the software(Ansoft). The influence of processing parameters was investigated. The results show that, the processing parameters, such as the current efficiency, the electrode plate intervals and the insulation board have intense influence on current efficiency, which is significant for improving cleaning efficiency and energy conservation...|$|R
5000|$|Though large wide-web flexo rolls {{are only}} maneuverable by {{overhead}} crane, on smaller presses anilox rolls are often handled directly by operators. Extreme caution {{must be taken}} when handling these pieces of hardware as a single bump against a hard surface or sharp corner can destroy the delicate cell structure {{on the surface and}} render a roller completely useless, at a cost of around 5000 for even small narrow-web rollers. Nicks and scratches add up quickly, so fine brushes (never brass brushes) are used for <b>cleaning</b> the anilox <b>roll.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{object that}} will be {{developed}} {{in this study is}} a simple technology shredding machine design, artificial and has been patented by Andi Patolla (1988). which is often used by people specifically to grate the coconut. The methods used for product development using QFD. This method is needed to analyze and evaluate the level of consumer desires in order to develop products grate machine. The subject matter of the research outlined in the distribution table discussion. The research instrument used when data collection is questionnaire technique, which is supported by the observation technique, documentation, and interviews. From the discussion that has been done, it can be concluded that the priority consumers are very stressed to do a modification component or an additional tool in the machine grater multipurpose namely Cover Safeguard Fan Belt, Exhaust, Priority Motor Driving Fuel Gasoline, layout position Mover, Motor Starter, Plastic <b>cleaning</b> brush <b>Roll</b> Grate, and Plate Cap. 2...|$|R
50|$|Increased {{participation}} {{is occurring in}} both rich and poor states in India. The sex ratio of voters has improved from 715 female voters for every 1,000 male voters in the 1960s to 883 female voters in the 2000s. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has sought to increase voter turnout by <b>cleaning</b> up electoral <b>rolls</b> and removing missing or deceased members. Voter outreach has included door-to-door voter registration, and in 2014 elections, voters will be issued a photo id with polling station information to increase voter turnout. Increased voter turnout in India is also partially due to the women voters. ECI has sought to encourage voter registration among women and participation through education and outreach on college and university campuses. Growing participation has also been attributed to increased security at polling stations.|$|R
