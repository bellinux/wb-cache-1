40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} facing mining engineers when dealing with deep, hard rock mines is to prevent and/or reduce rockburst hazard around mine openings. Rockburst is a phenomenon which is characterised by violent rock failure. The current research focuses on the assessment and control of rockbursts in deep, hard rock mines. Strainbursts, or strain-type rockbursts, occur {{in the vicinity of}} mine openings and are generally provoked by high stress conditions in a brittle rock mass. A new theory has been developed for the assessment of the potential of violent rock failure by strainburst, in underground hard rock mines. In this theory, the mining-induced energy parameters are used to calculate the so-called burst potential index (BPI). When the BPI reaches or exceeds 100 %, the method predicts a burst prone situation. One of the most commonly used methods to control strainbursts in hard rock mines is destress blasting. Motivated by the lack of a dedicated analysis tool to help assess destress blasting, a new, geomechanical model was developed. The technique employs two newly introduced parameters, alpha, a rock fragmentation factor, and beta, a stress dissipation factor, inside the modelled, fractured zone. Implemented in a 3 -dimensional finite element code developed by the author, the new model simulates the damage zone induced by destress blasting of a mining face to help evaluate the efficiency of destress blasting. Extensive model verification and parametric studies have been undertaken. The effects of the destress blasting pattern, premining stresses and their orientation, and the two destress blasting factors (rock fragmentation factor, and stress dissipation factor) are studied. The model has been applied successfully to Canadian mine case histories. A detailed case study of a <b>cut-and-fill</b> <b>mine</b> stope involving crown and sill pillar destressing has been carried out. It is shown that the new method can be useful in the assessment of destress blasting in deep drift face development and the crown/sill pillar problems in <b>cut-and-fill</b> <b>mine</b> stopes...|$|R

40|$|The virgin {{stress state}} in the rock mass is {{disturbed}} by mining, which leads to locally increased or decreased stresses. The rock mass in Sweden is generally composed of high strength brittle rock types, so the risk of seismicity and rockbursts (violent failures) increase with increasing depth of mining due to increasing stress levels. Seismicity is the rock mass response to deformation and failure. A seismic event is the sudden release of potential or stored energy in the rock. The released energy is then radiated as seismic waves. A rockburst {{is defined as a}} mining-induced seismic event that causes damage to openings in the rock. The most important factors influencing the occurrence and intensity of seismicity are virgin stress state, rock properties, and the influence of the mining method on the stress field. The Swedish <b>cut-and-fill</b> <b>mines</b> are comparable to the studied Canadian mines regarding stress state, mining method, and rock properties, so the same seismicity problems should be expected as mining depth increases. The Swedish sublevel caving mines are not comparable to the studied open stoping mines, regarding stress state and the influence of mining on the stress field. The sublevel caving mining method influences the virgin stress state over a larger area than open stoping methods, which means that the principal stresses around footwall drifts are of the same order or higher at the same depth. This means that seismic events of certain magnitude that are experienced at a depth of 2000 m in Canadian mines, can be expected to occur at less depth in the sublevel caving mines. At present the damage caused by seismicity is limited and can be controlled with the standard stiff reinforcement. When the events become larger, the reinforcement must be complemented with more yielding and energy absorbing components. Practices regarding energy absorbing reinforcement and destressing of drifts should be studied and evaluated for application in the Swedish mines. The application of the correct reinforcement in seismic areas requires that these areas can be identified before seismicity start to occur. This identification can be accomplished by combining a geomechanical model of the mine with 3 D stress and energy modeling of the proposed mining sequence. The geomechanical model should include geological structures, properties and locations of different rock types, failure mappings, and rock mass classification. The purpose of the model would be to increase the understanding of the behavior of the rock mass, and to identify areas of high seismic hazard. In the mines where a model already exists, the model should be developed further, to connect geology with seismic events, and to elastic stress analysis on both small and large scale. A seismic monitoring system is an investment worth considering for mines experiencing seismicity, both for localization and estimation of magnitude of seismic events, but also to monitor the behavior of the rock mass during mining. This can provide valuable input for production planning, sequencing etc. Godkänd; 2004; 20070108 (mlk) </p...|$|R
40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Dept. of Earth Resources Engineering for the degree of Master of Science. CD ROM included. This research includes {{the study of the}} mining method adopted at Bogala Graphite Mines and its suitability compared with other mining methods used in the mining industry. The mining method adopted in Bogala mines has been assessed through this study. It mainly focus on the rock mechanics and financial aspects with comparisons to the mining methods adhered by the Sri Lankan mining industry. The major graphite occurrence discovered more than hundred years has produced highly valued the world over. In Sri Lanka, graphite mineralizations occur in the form of rich veins with steep dips in the South-Western sector of the island, the vast stretch of area which has been famous for graphite mining with thousands of pits in operation during the high demand of the first and second world wars. Where an outcrop is encountered, a pit had been sunk and the steeply dipping vein had been followed to the depths. At Bogala mines, the adoption of Overhand <b>Cut-and-Fill</b> <b>mining</b> method is influenced by the steeply dipping vein environment with rock intercalations and high water inflows with less competent country rock. Although <b>cut–and–fill</b> <b>mining</b> has been traditionally successful ensuring high recovery and safety, only limited studies has been carried out with an engineering input to evaluate this method. With the use of literature and site visits to Bogala mines, the mining method used at Bogala mines, the underground environment and the other mining methods used in the mining industry both internationally and locally have been studied. In evaluating the most suitable mining method, workability, safety and ore dilution and recovery factors of different mining methods were considered and the most suitable method for Bogala mine was evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Jinchuan nickel mine is {{the largest}} cut-and fill mining mine in China. After keep {{successive}} mining for nearly twenty years, it appeared serious ground fissures. A major thrust {{of this paper is}} to discuss the distribution features, deformation regularities, development tendency and formation mechanisms of ground fissures based on long-term subsidence monitoring and investigation. The results showed that large-scale ground subsidence basin has been developed in the mine area, and the ground fissures mainly scattered in the tensile zone of the subsidence basin. Besides, ground fissures have the features of compressive shear or tensile mechanical properties and zonary pattern. Unfortunately, with the mining scale keep expanding, both the quantity and width of the ground fissures increased rapidly. This will be unfavourable to safety of mining and engineering facilities. Therefore, strengthened monitoring and prevention works are essentially important to the similar mines which designed with <b>cut-and-fill</b> <b>mining</b> method...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{monitoring}} of mine induced seismicity and rockburst hazard {{can be carried}} out at different scales of resolution. The strategy usually adopted aims to get a global coverage of the mine layout, based on a large-scale array of low-frequency seismic sensors which may extend up to tens of squared kilometers, in order to monitor the numerous disseminated mining works and enable a periodical rating of seismic hazard. However, some major drawbacks must be dealt with. First, the microseismic detection limits for each mining work considered as a stand-alone rockburst prone area induces the loss of all those small magnitude events occurring {{in the vicinity of the}} working faces. Moreover, quality of the seismic source location reveals insufficient to pinpoint unambiguously its very origin in the surrounding geology and mining voids. These two limits affect strongly the capabilities of ground engineers to detect for sure significant change in the seismic regime of any specific seismogenic zone. Refining the monitoring may be reached by the deployment of mobile local-scale arrays made of short period sensors around those mining works rated at higher risk. These permit to record a much more complete microseismic catalogue while enhancing drastically the accuracy and reliability of the expertise. However, the processing of small magnitude events recorded locally calls for some precautions due to some nearfield conditions adverse to accuracy. Besides the increasing complexity of the rock mass when dealing with higher frequency waves, the presence of important ancient backfilled works more or less interlaced with multilevel fast advancing mining works may be a very issue. This is often the case for highly productive methods based on retreat <b>mining,</b> <b>cut-and-fill</b> or sub-level <b>mining.</b> Because installing a socalled high resolution microseismic network rises new expectations in the understanding of the seismic activity versus the local geology and the mining process, the authors have undertaken the development of an evolving 3 D velocity model taking into account not only the underground geological aspects encountered, but also and above all the dynamic mining process itself. Besides synthetic numerical tests that have been run to assess the relevance of this issue, we applied this new numerical procedure to a true microseismic dataset recorded during the controlled collapse of a large solution mined cavern lying 220 meters deep. Tens of thousands of microseismic events were recorded with the critical enlargement of the cavern towards the surface. 3 D surveys of the cavern itself together with geophysical loggings of its geological overburden have been used to dimension the presence of this volume full brine and calibrate this innovative location procedure applied to selected microseismic swarms. Detailed comparisons with conventional 3 D location studies have been established emphasizing the considerable gain brought by a more realistic three dimensional velocity model including the pre-existent and evolving voids before and during seismic crisis. This gain includes a much better separation of the fracturing processes in the cap rock and on the sidewalls of the cavern, discerning unambiguously the impact of the roof falls at the bottom of the cavity, delineating geological rock strata and discontinuities playing clearly a role in the physics of the collapse phenomena. Such a numerical procedure is currently being improved and automated for operational implementation in a deep mine...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of its}} {{research}} program to investigate ways of improving resource recovery and reducing subsidence, researchers from the U. S. Bureau of Mines placed instruments in the B-North ore body of the Cannon Mine, Wenatchee, WA, to monitor cemented backfill and rock deformation during mining. The vibrating-wire gauges proved to be reliable and versatile, and {{approximately half of the}} instruments are providing data after 2 years of use. A two-dimensional, finite-element model was used to analyze the Cannon Mine's multilevel bench <b>cut-and-fill</b> <b>mining</b> method and predict rock and backfill displacements. The model accurately predicted rock displacements, but the predicted and measured displacements in cemented backfill had a correlation coefficient near zero, indicating that the model should only be used to predict rock displacements and not backfill displacements. A finite-difference model was also used to evaluate the stability of a cemented backfill pillar. Results can be used to conservatively predict backfill stresses, but on-site observation of pillar failures coupled with in situ measurements are needed to make more accurate predictions. An ongoing evaluation of the mining system has indicated that filling the primary stopes tight to the back with cemented backfill allowed these pillars to carry overburden loads soon after the cemented backfill was placed...|$|E
40|$|Vein {{graphite}} mining is {{more often}} carried out by underground mining in Sri Lanka due to its mode of occurrence. Bogala underground mine {{is one of the}} major graphite mines in the country, where overhand <b>cut-and-fill</b> <b>mining</b> method is used for the extraction of graphite since the ore bodies are steeply dipping, with considerable vertical extent and clear and stable ore boundaries. According to the standard practices at the mine, ectraction is carried out at the stope by blasting of both rock and graphite vein in the exposed face, followed by hand sorting to collect graphite. Blasting the host rock and veins are carried out separately. Waste rock generated is used to fill the lower bench. Simultaneously, stope support is carried out and the working platform prepared. In this practice one cycle extends for four shifts and the research was launched with the objective of improving stope productivity by reducing the cycle time. In the proposed methodology, blasting of the face (graphite vein and rock) was carried out simultaneously resulting in the reduction of cycle time to two shifts. Therefore, in the research carried out, with the proposed alternative stope technique followed by froth flotation relevant performance indicators or parameters of productivity, cost and safety were analysed...|$|E
