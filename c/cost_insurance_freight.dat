The excess production has {{allowed for the}} expansion of the export sector, converting Chile in a net exporter in 2001. A relevant question in this new market scenario is how this Structural change can affect milk prices paid to producer,; in Chile. the consequences of this Structural change were explored in this study using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model and cointegration analysis. The results indicated that the domestic, CIF (<b>Cost.</b> <b>Insurance,</b> <b>Freight)</b> and FOB (Free Oil Board) prices were cointegrated, implying that changes in the import and export prices are transmitted to the domestic market affecting the milk price paid to producers. Prior to 200 1, the import price (CIF) was the relevant reference dictating the movements of the domestic price. After 2001, the export price (FOB) became the reference, whereas the CIF price was no longer significant. the parameters of the VEC model SLIcroest that the conitegrating relation between CIF and domestic prices for the first period Under analysis (1990 - 2000) was clearer than that between FOB and domestic prices for the second period (2001 - 2007 / 3). the price elasticity for the FOB-domestic price vector had a large confidence interval, which is Why it IS difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the impact Of future FOB fluctuations Oil the milk price paid to producers in Chile after 2001...|$|E

30|$|During the {{dictatorship}} the government purchased wheat at artificially high prices; however, as the aforementioned interviewees expounded, {{a more open}} economy exposed Brazilian producers to foreign competition, and high prices were thus no longer guaranteed. The government’s official policy of self-sufficiency in wheat ended in 1990, leading to increases in imports. At that time, the <b>cost,</b> <b>insurance,</b> and <b>freight</b> (CIF) of importing wheat were low. The high global stock of wheat and the American government’s subsidization of wheat exports were largely responsible for low global prices, and increased the appeal of foreign wheat to Brazilian purchasers. In spite of the sharp drop in prices brought by liberalization, Brazilian prices remained high in comparison to international prices, and millers consequently increased consumption of foreign wheat (Brum & Müller 2008).|$|R

This approach {{is based on an}} error correction model where the adjustment coefficients switch between regimes. Disequilibrium is captured by the correction, but this may be unstable or relate to a further equilibrium. Estimation of the Markov Switching ECM indicates that deviations from long-run equilibrium have an effect on gasoline price dynamics. Also the result signifies that regular gasoline <b>costs</b> (<b>insurance</b> and <b>freight),</b> gas retail real price, residual fuel oil price, and distillate fuel oil price significantly affect the relative real gasoline price in the market. More specifically it demonstrates that there are two different regimes of Supply and Demand in the US gasoline market indicating that the market collusion may be less concern of this market in the USA.|$|R

30|$|In the 1980 s, the {{air express}} {{business}} was originally operated by airlines that used “on board courier” (OBC) with their excess cargo capacity to transport express cargoes. OBC uses the passenger channel, and the cargo passes through customs inspection {{under the name}} of luggage, with simple clearance procedures and most of the time, with no tax and duties being charged. Not surprisingly, the widespread dispute over the concern of tax evasion for OBC prompted the CA to regulate the weight and value of the cargo to be transported via OBC. For example, the maximum gross weight of a bag should be 40  kg, and the <b>cost,</b> <b>insurance,</b> and <b>freight</b> (CIF) value of each bag should be lower than NT$ 20, 000 (US$ 500). Either the CIF value or the weight of the bag that is higher than the regulated one, along with its document, should be inspected as cargo and be charged with imposed taxes and duties accordingly.|$|R
50|$|No direct {{taxation}} is imposed on residents and Cayman Islands companies. The government receives {{the majority of}} its income from in{{direct taxation}}. Duty is levied against most imported goods, which is typically in the range of 22% to 25%. Some items are exempted, such as baby formula, books, cameras and certain items are taxed at 5%. Duty on automobiles depends on their value. The duty can amount to 29.5% up to $20,000.00 KYD CIF (<b>cost,</b> <b>insurance</b> and <b>freight)</b> and up to 42% over $30,000.00 KYD CIF for expensive models. The government charges flat licensing fees on financial institutions that operate in the islands and there are work permit fees on foreign labour. A 13% government tax is placed on all tourist accommodations in addition to US$37.50 airport departure tax which is built into the cost of an airline ticket. There are no taxes on corporate profits, capital gains, or personal income.

30|$|Company C is a {{manufacturer}} of steel powder products. It turns over 750  M€ per annum, employs around 1700 workers, and has sales and distribution representation in 75 countries. Most of the production is located in Sweden from Swedish iron ore, {{but there are also}} production facilities in the USA and India. Company C recognizes that its global competitive advantage is product quality and advanced research and development. Flows included in the case study are outbound flows of components (i.e., general steel powder) and finished products (i.e., customer-specific prepared mixes of steel powders). The company purchases container liner shipping services directly, without the involvement of a forwarder, using Incoterm CIF (<b>Cost</b> <b>Insurance</b> and <b>Freight)</b> when delivering to its customers. The company has a standing order based on the departure schedule of the relevant shipping lines. Deviation from the standing order is managed through contacts with the shipping line. Air freight is an option only during rare occasions of emergency. Usually, different shipping lines are called on in order to manage variation in demand and disturbances. Transport service suppliers are re-evaluated annually using competitive tenders. The annual volume for the relevant flows is about 10, 000 TEUs.|$|R
50|$|This term is broadly {{similar to}} the above CFR term, with the {{exception}} that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit to the named port of destination. CIF requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy {{should be in the}} same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the bill of lading. These three documents represent the <b>cost,</b> <b>insurance,</b> and <b>freight</b> of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized seafreight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.|$|R

One plausible explanation to this apparent paradox is that reported CIF prices include at least part of quota rents generated by the tariff-rate quota policy. On this basis, we analyse the impacts of different MFN tariff levels on EU banana imports under contrasting hypotheses regarding, first whether the price gap between CIF and FOB unit values does include at least part of quota rents, second whether banana exports to the EU from Western African ACP countries were constrained under the previous regime where a specific import quota were reserved to ACP countries.

40|$|LLM (Import and Export Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In {{the import}} and export business, once a buyer and a seller have {{agreed on the}} product and price, {{they also have to}} agree on special terms that will ensure that the parties’ {{different}} obligations are fulfilled. The seller has an interest in the payment he 1 receives for the goods and the buyer has an interest in the actual goods. Both parties therefore have to agree on an insurance policy that will protect the goods from harm, from the time they are at the seller’s warehouse to the time that they reach the buyer’s warehouse. Depending on the type of contract they agree on, the risk of loss, damage or destruction in respect of the goods will be transferred from the seller to the buyer at different crucial stages of the voyage. If the parties contract according to the <b>cost</b> <b>insurance</b> and <b>freight</b> 2 terms, then the seller has the responsibility to procure insurance for the goods. If the parties contract on the terms of the free on board 3 contract, then it is the buyer's responsibility to procure insurance for the goods from the time that the seller delivers them past the ship’s rail. Finally, if the parties trade according to the ex works 4 contractual terms, then the buyer’s obligation is more burdensome because he has to insure the goods already when they are on the premises of the seller, from where he has to collect such goods. In international sales contracts, all such issues are covered, some with great flexibility and others with great misunderstanding. All these matters are dealt with in the present research in an attempt to investigate which party to an international trade contract has an insurable interest in the goods and at what stage during the execution of each party’s duties in terms of the sales contract.

When both exporting and importing countries do report, we have two different figures for the same flow. In order to have a single coherent figure for each bilateral flow, we have need to reconcile them. Firstly, as import values are reported CIF (<b>cost,</b> <b>insurance</b> and <b>freight)</b> and the exports are reported FOB (free on board), CIF costs have to be estimated and removed from imports values to compute FOB import values. We regress the unit-values ratios reported for a given elementary flow by gravity variables: bilateral distance, dummies for adjacent or landlocked countries and for years, and world median unit-value for each product category (we consider a non-linear relationship between CIF costs and distance by introducing also the square distance). As expected, we find that CIF costs increase with distance and decrease with unit value. The second step is an evaluation of the reliability of country reporting, based on the declaration distances among partners. In order to evaluate this quality of countries reporting (as exporters or importers) we decompose the absolute value of the ratios of mirror flows using a (weighted) variance analysis, and an index is build for every country.

40|$|In {{almost all}} {{countries}} that operate a value-added tax (VAT), the VAT “zero-rates ” exports, meaning that exporting firms can claim credit for VAT on their inputs, but pay no VAT {{on sales of}} exports. This is necessary when {{the goal is to}} make the base of the tax domestic consumption. A consequence is that firms can reduce their tax burdens by misreporting some of their sales to domestic consumers as exports. In principle, reported exports from country i to country j should match up with reported imports into country j from country i, except for measurement errors, and <b>costs</b> of <b>insurance</b> and <b>freight</b> that are included in import value but not export value. VAT evasion can be another source of discrepancy which would tend to cause reported exports to exceed reported imports for trade flows in the same direction. We use data on such discrepancies in trade flows between pairs of European Union member countries during 1984 through 2011 to infer whether higher VAT rates are associated with greater over-reporting of exports. A difference-in-differences identification strategy, exploiting the fact that VAT rates changed in different ways over time in different countries, suggests that each percentage point increase in the exporting country’s standard VAT rate increases the discrepancy of exports over imports by about 1. 1 percent of exports. For the typical EU- 15 country, this implies that at the margin, about 15 percent of the static revenue gain from a VAT rate increase would be lost due to this particular channel for VAT evasion...|$|R
