5|$|Disaster {{elements}} {{portrayed in}} Independence Day represented a significant {{turning point for}} Hollywood blockbuster films. With advancements in CGI special effects, events depicting mass destruction became <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> films that soon followed, such as 1998's Armageddon and Deep Impact. The trend continued throughout the 2000s and 2010s, evident in films like 2004's The Day After Tomorrow and 2012's The Avengers.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{has the authority}} to call on the General Assembly to convene a special session if legislators are unable to complete necessary work within time allotted by the regular sessions. Special sessions of the General Assembly were rarely called in the state's early history, but have become more <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> modern times.|$|E
5|$|The only {{region that}} has a {{significant}} difference {{from the rest of}} Wales is the Gower peninsula, whose lack of land transport links left it isolated. Instead it was strongly influenced by Somerset and Devon {{on the other side of}} the Bristol Channel. Dishes such as whitepot and ingredients such as pumpkin, rare elsewhere in Wales, became <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> Gower.|$|E

Her mind asked, [...] "Shall I, too, sometimes wish to talk <b>commonplaces</b> <b>in</b> the midst of such glories?" ...|$|R
5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley {{and parts of the}} Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|E
5000|$|Predecessor {{culture is}} a sociological phrase {{originating}} in Alasdair MacIntyre's book, After Virtue, in which he considers society before the Enlightenment's project of rationalizing all things as having an internal consistency and meaning which has been lost to us. It {{can be considered as}} {{having to do with the}} set of heroes and stories that were re-iterated in former cultures; these are called <b>commonplaces</b> <b>in</b> English literature.|$|R
50|$|Having {{embarked}} for England, {{he escaped}} being pressed {{to serve in}} the Navy by pricking his hands and face, and rubbing in bay salt and gunpowder, so as to simulate smallpox. Such tricks were <b>commonplaces</b> <b>in</b> rogue literature. On returning to England, he claims to have found his wife and daughter and then travelled to Scotland by 1745 in time to accompany Charles Edward Stuart to Carlisle and Derby.|$|R

5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hinde opposed slavery. Although their parents owned slaves, {{he and his}} {{siblings}} repudiated slavery on religious grounds. Hinde's opposition increased and eventually he and other friends became outspoken critics of the institution in Kentucky, where slavery was <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> the middle and western parts of the state. In the Great Awakening, Methodists were prominent among those who opposed slavery, although they also converted slaves and welcomed them into congregations. In Kentucky Hinde joined other Methodist ministers in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
5|$|Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging {{quantities}} to tiny scopes. For example, the decibel is a unit quantifying signal power log-ratios and amplitude log-ratios (of which {{sound pressure}} {{is a common}} example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> scientific formulae, and in measurements {{of the complexity of}} algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.|$|E

5|$|Rare co-founder Tim Stamper {{conceptualized}} a gardening {{game for}} the handheld Pocket PC platform in 2002. A three-person team began work on a simple prototype while the company was still affiliated with Nintendo, prior to its Microsoft acquisition. Development transferred to the original Xbox and, ultimately, to the Xbox 360 for its enhanced graphical capabilities. The development team wanted its animals to have a unified style, which was how the concept artist arrived at the piñata conceit. The idea was exciting for the team, as piñatas were not <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom. The connection between piñatas and candy-filled insides led to new gameplay directions.|$|E
5|$|The Act of Parliament {{governing}} the enclosure of Portishead {{was passed in}} 1814, and stipulated {{the right to a}} public wharf, although there is historical evidence of nautical connections dating back to the Patent Rolls of 1331. Around the 1860s, {{at the height of the}} iron and steel era, a pier and a deep-water dock were built by the Bristol & Portishead Pier and Railway to accommodate the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour. They brought valuable cargoes from across the globe and exported local products overseas. Ships carrying coal were <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> Portishead Docks.|$|E
5|$|The first 14 {{picks in}} the draft belonged to teams that had missed the playoffs; the order was {{determined}} through a lottery. The lottery determined the three teams that would obtain the first three picks on the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win-loss record in the previous season. As it is <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> the event of identical win-loss records, the NBA performed a random drawing to break the ties on April 18, 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} middle-distance track events are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, {{although}} the 3000 metres {{may also be}} classified as a middle-distance event. The 880 yard run, or half mile, was the forebear of the 800m distance and it {{has its roots in}} competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s. The 1500m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500m track, which was <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> continental Europe in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{symbolism}} of the garden, particularly of the carvings, {{as well as the}} repetition of sevens and threes, has inspired many interpretations. The engravings upon which the carvings are based were <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> Scotland at the time, and were frequently used in the art of memory, a mnemonic memory technique associated with Freemasonry. The art of memory had become a feature throughout Scottish culture, from the court of Queen Anne, Danish consort of James VI, to the lodges of operative stonemasons. The potential influence of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's symbolic garden at Uraniborg, which was visited by James IV of Scotland in 1590, has also been noted.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{interest}} in the war memorials diminished considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, reflected in a reduced level of ceremonies and a simplification of the commemorative events around memorials. In the post-war years, for example, the separate official and veterans ceremonies at the Verdun memorials blended into one; in 1956, German and French ceremonies were also united into a single event. Attendance at events like Anzac Day diminished. Many memorials slowly deteriorated: {{in some cases the}} original inter-war funding had never included maintenance, in other cases the materials used to construct the memorials were not durable. In some towns and cities, the memorials were moved to less prominent locations as part of urban renewal projects, or hidden by new buildings. World War I memorials were <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> many countries and were paid little attention.|$|E

5|$|By 1938, over 400 {{contraceptive}} manufacturers were in business, over 600 {{brands of}} female contraceptives were available, and industry revenues exceeded $250million per year. Condoms {{were sold in}} vending machines in some public restrooms, and men spent twice as much on condoms as on shaving.Tone, p. 136. Although condoms had become <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued to push for development of a contraceptive that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led to the birth control pill decades later. To increase the availability of high-quality contraceptives, birth control advocates established the Holland–Rantos company to manufacture contraceptives– primarily diaphragms, which were Sanger's recommended method. By the 1930s, the diaphragm with spermicidal jelly had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception; in 1938, female contraceptives accounted for 85 percent of annual contraceptive sales.|$|E
5|$|Censorship was <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> {{the early}} 20th century. State laws and city {{ordinances}} routinely outlawed speech {{deemed to be}} obscene or offensive, and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization. Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature. In that year, H. L. Mencken deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned American Mercury magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal. The ACLU {{went on to win}} additional victories, including the landmark case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book Ulysses by James Joyce. The ACLU only achieved mixed results in the early years, and it was not until 1966 that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the Roth v. United States and Memoirs v. Massachusetts cases.|$|E
5|$|Despite his staunch Catholicism, Joaquim Inácio {{became a}} freemason, joining the Loja Integridade Maçônica (Freemasonry Integrity Lodge) in 1828. He {{eventually}} {{rose to the}} highest ranks of that lodge, becoming Deputy Grand Master in 1863. He was also accorded membership in other Brazilian lodges, became an honorary member of Portuguese Freemasonry and was {{a representative of the}} Grand Orient de France in Brazil. Freemasonry opened new venues for Joaquim Inácio, providing him with connections and influence he had previously lacked and which were essential to advancing his political career. On 2 March 1861, his friend Caxias, also a freemason and staunch Catholic, became prime minister. He invited Joaquim Inácio, who {{became a member of the}} Conservative Party, to assume the naval ministry's portfolio. It was <b>commonplace</b> <b>in</b> Brazil for high-ranking military officers to engage in politics.|$|E

The main aim is to suggest some hint of reflections about some differences but also about common attitudes and <b>commonplaces</b> <b>in</b> front of methodological and technical problems. Moreover, the aim is to suggest some hints just to think over some of the reasons of the deep connection between archaeology and restoration of ancient buildings in Italy...|$|R
