5|$|The high {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium has {{a potential}} use in radiation therapy, and organometallic complexes have been synthesized {{in order to}} deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium citrate (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs. Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone <b>chelate</b> complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es3+ ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd3+ ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate {{during the period of}} 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es3+ was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the <b>chelate</b> matrix to Es3+ ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.|$|E

This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to <b>chelate</b> metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E

Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron <b>chelate</b> or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens.

40|$|A {{chickpea}} {{protein hydrolysate}} produced with pepsin and pancreatin {{was used for}} the affinity purification of chickpea <b>chelating</b> peptides. Three <b>chelating</b> peptide fractions were obtained after affinity chromatography with immobilised copper. These peptide fractions showed a higher <b>chelating</b> activity and histidine contents than the original protein hydrolysate. <b>Chelating</b> activity was positively correlated with the histidine content of the purified fractions. Different subfractions were also obtained after gel filtration chromatography from the affinity purified peptide fractions. Some of these subfractions showed a higher <b>chelating</b> activity and histidine contents than the original fractions. These results suggest that a combination of high His contents, around 20 - 30 %, and small peptide size provide the best <b>chelating</b> activities. Thus sequential purification with affinity and gel filtration chromatography is a useful procedure for the purification of chickpea peptides with high <b>chelating</b> activity. These results show that a range of <b>chelating</b> peptides are generated during digestion of the chickpea proteins that, after metal chelation, may prevent the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and favour metal absorption. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, the detail study of iron <b>chelating</b> {{property}} of malic acid has not yet been reported. Due to low biodegradability (e.g., BOD 5 of EDTA: 0.01 %), the disposal of iron <b>chelates</b> used in Lo-CAT process raised serious environmental concern [28]. In order to overcome this environmental pollution, there is need to look for alternative iron <b>chelating</b> agents. The carboxylic acids are known to possess high rate of biodegradation (e.g., BOD 5 of malic acid: 65 %) along with good iron <b>chelating</b> property. The results of the present investigation indicated that Fe+ 3 –malic acid iron <b>chelates</b> in w/o microemulsion can effectively oxidize hazardous H 2 S gas to produce sulfur nanoparticles. Besides reduction in environmental pollution (use of biodegradable <b>chelating</b> agents) and waste utilization (H 2 S abatement), the described process also has high commercial significance.|$|R

5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to <b>chelate</b> metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E
