40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{population-based}} {{information is}} available on the use of chiropractic services. METHODS: We analyzed data from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE), a community-based study of the use of health services. Insurance claim forms for all fee-for-service patients who completed the study were examined for all visits coded as being seen by a <b>chiropractor.</b> <b>Services</b> provided and patient-specified symptoms were taken from these forms. Population-based use rates were calculated for each HIE site. Use rates and services were calculated separately for first visits and repeat visits. RESULTS: There were 5, 279 persons who contributed 19, 021 person-years of exposure during the study; 395 different persons used 7, 873 chiropractic services for a visit rate of 41 per 100 person-years and rate of use of 7. 5 percent. Forty-two percent of all visits were for pain in the back. Spinal manipulation accounted for 61 percent of all services provided. Compared to non-users, users tended to be White, middle-aged, married, and high school educated. Seven-fold geographic variations in the use of chiropractic services were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Chiropractors deliver a substantial amount of health care to the US population, and there are significant geographic variations in the rate and intensity of use of chiropractic services...|$|E
50|$|ABC codes fill gaps in {{healthcare}} coding and the National Health Information Network (NHIN) that older medical code sets do not cover by describing care provided by all healthcare practitioners. ABC codes {{can also be}} used in conjunction with two-digit, alpha-numeric practitioner identifiers (e.g., 1A) to identify the practitioner type (e.g., <b>chiropractor)</b> providing the <b>service.</b> Additionally, ABC codes are supported by state legislative references regarding scope of practice and training requirements on a code, state and practitioner-specific basis.|$|R
5000|$|William T. Jarvis, Ph.D. has stated: [...] "Chiropractic is a {{controversial}} health-care {{system that has}} been legalized throughout the United States and in several other countries. In the United States in 1984, roughly 10.7 million people made 163 million office visits to 30,000 chiropractors. More than three fourths of the states require insurance companies to include chiropractic services in health and accident policies. The federal government pays for limited chiropractic services under Medicare, Medicaid, and its vocational rehabilitation program, and the Internal Revenue Service allows a medical deduction for chiropractic <b>services.</b> <b>Chiropractors</b> cite such facts as evidence of [...] "recognition." [...] However, these are merely business statistics and legal arrangements {{that have nothing to}} do with chiropractic's scientific validity." ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chiropractors, physiotherapists, and osteopaths receive {{training}} in the diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal conditions. As a result there is considerable overlap {{in the types of}} conditions that are encountered clinically by these practitioners. In Australia, the majority of benefits paid for these services come from the private sector. The {{purpose of this article is}} to quantify and describe the development in service utilization and the cost of benefits paid to users of these healthcare services by private health insurers. An exploration of the factors that may have influenced the observed trends is also presented. Methods: A review of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, and the Australian Government Private Health Insurance Administration Council was conducted. An analysis of chiropractic, physiotherapy and osteopathic service utilisation and cost of service utilisation trend was performed along with the level of benefits and services over time. Results: In 2012, the number of physiotherapists working in the private sector was 2. 9 times larger than that of chiropractic, and 7. 8 times that of the osteopathic profession. The total number of <b>services</b> provided by <b>chiropractors,</b> physiotherapists, and osteopaths increased steadily over the past 15 years. For the majority of this period, <b>chiropractors</b> provided more <b>services</b> than the other two professions. The average number of <b>services</b> provided by <b>chiropractors</b> was approximately two and a half times that of physiotherapists and four and a half times that of osteopaths. Conclusions: This study highlights a clear disparity in the average number of <b>services</b> provided by <b>chiropractors,</b> physiotherapists, and osteopaths in the private sector in Australia over the last 15 years. Further research is required to explain these observed differences and to determine whether a similar trend exists in patients who do not have private health insurance cover. 7 page(s...|$|R
