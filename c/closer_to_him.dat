5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} became {{convinced}} that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left the table and sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was finished Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all {{of whom had been}} watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they differed in their versions of what they saw. Others saw nothing, including people sitting <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E
5|$|Spurred by the crisis, on 1 April 286, Maximian took up {{the title}} of Augustus. His {{appointment}} is unusual {{in that it was}} impossible for Diocletian to have been present to witness the event. It has even been suggested that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion is unpopular, as it is clear that Diocletian meant for Maximian to act {{with a certain amount of}} independence. It may be posited, however, that Diocletian felt the need to bind Maximian <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> by making him his empowered associate, in order to avoid the possibility of having him striking some sort of deal with Carausius.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, {{and she wants to}} donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E

25|$|Much to everyone's sadness, Kaori dies {{due to the}} surgery, but {{leaves a}} letter to Kōsei which is {{given to him by}} her parents at her funeral in which she {{eventually}} states that {{she was in love with}} Kōsei the whole time, and she lied that she had a crush on Watari to get <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> while not hurting Tsubaki's (who also has a crush on Kōsei) feelings. This was her lie: a lie she told in April.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Gandalf warns Aragorn {{that this}} is only the {{beginning}} of hostilities. However, he points out that Sauron fears Aragorn, as he knows of Aragorn's bloodline, and that he can inspire the men of Gondor. He also says the forces of good have one major advantage over Sauron; the Ring is hidden, and that they should attempt to destroy it has not entered Sauron's mind. He expects them {{to use it as a}} weapon, never imagining it is being brought <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> every day.|$|E
25|$|It was Buemi's fourth {{victory of}} the season, his second {{consecutive}} in Monaco, and the tenth of his career. The result meant Buemi moved further ahead of di Grassi in the Drivers' Championship to be 15 points ahead of him while Nico Prost kept third despite a poor result. Vergne remained in fourth despite his retirement but Sam Bird was one point <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in fifth place. e.Dams-Renaut increased their Teams' Championship over Audi Sport ABT by a further six points while Mahindra's strong result enabled them to move from fifth to third with seven races left in the season.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{the common}} pejorative {{doctrine}} pertaining to the Old Testament held in some Christian groups that Jewish korbanot were for sins, which is a well known fallacy, their use was far more complex—only some korbanot in mostly one rare restrictive circumstance were used to atone for unintentional sins, and these sacrifices only accompanied the important required core means of atonement to be ever considered legitimate. Besides this one exception, there were {{the overwhelming majority of}} other purposes for bringing korbanot, and the expiatory effect is often incidental, and is subject to significant limitations. Korbanot are brought purely for the purpose of communing with God and becoming <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Also, they were brought for the purpose of expressing thanks, gratitude, and love to God.|$|E
25|$|Antonescu's plan to {{act against}} his {{coalition}} partners {{in the event of}} further disorder hinged on Hitler's approval, a vague signal of which had been given during ceremonies confirming Romania's adherence to the Tripartite Pact. A decisive turn occurred when Hitler invited Antonescu and Sima both over for discussions: whereas Antonescu agreed, Sima stayed behind in Romania, probably plotting a coup d'état. While Hitler did not produce a clear endorsement for clamping down on Sima's party, he made remarks interpreted by their recipient as oblique blessings. On 14 January 1941 during a German-Romanian summit, Hitler informed Antonescu of his plans to invade the Soviet Union later that year and asked Romania to participate. By this time, Hitler had {{come to the conclusion that}} while Sima was ideologically <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Antonescu was the more competent leader capable of ensuring stability in Romania while being committed to aligning his country with the Axis.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{parable of}} a lost son {{can also be found}} in the Mahayana Buddhist Lotus Sutra. The two parables are so similar in their outline and many details that several {{scholars}} have assumed that one version has influenced the other or that both texts share a common origin. However, an influence of the biblical story on the Lotus sutra is regarded as unlikely given the early dating of the stratum of the sutra containing the Buddhist parable. In spite of their similarities, both parables continue differently after the two meet {{for the first time at}} the son's return. In the biblical story, there is an immediate reunion of the two. In contrast, in the Lotus sutra, the poor son does not recognize the rich man as his father. When the father sends out some attendants to welcome the son, the son panics, fearing some kind of retribution. The father then lets the son leave without telling him of their kinship. However, he gradually draws the son <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by employing him in successively higher positions, only to tell him of their kinship in the end. In the Buddhist parable, the father symbolises the Buddha, and the son symbolises any human being. Their kinship symbolises that any being has Buddha nature. The concealment of the kinship of the father to his son is regarded as a skillful means (Sanskrit:upāya).|$|E

25|$|Clare becomes {{interested}} in Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) {{when he gets}} a lucrative property development job. They grow <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and she attempts to seduce him but he rebuffs her advances, due to recently separating from his wife, Stacey (Lacey Turner), but relents when Clare dresses up as Princess Leia to impress him. He propositions her but Clare refuses {{to have sex with}} him, breaking down and telling him about an affair she had with an aggressive, married man named Arnold. Arnold traces Clare to Walford, wanting to rekindle their affair but Clare only wanted Arnold to buy her expensive gifts and when he stopped, she fled. Clare knows that Arnold had bought his wife expensive jewellery and persuades Bradley to help her steal it by claiming that it belongs to her. Believing Arnold is a bully, Bradley agrees. The robbery goes off without a hitch, but Arnold sees Clare leaving and returns to Walford to confront her. Clare admits that she never loved Arnold and was only using him for his money. When he threatens to call the police, Clare threatens to ruin his marriage and Bradley throws him out after Clare lies that he was verbally abusing her. Satisfied with her pay off, Clare realises that Bradley is too good for her and tells him this, refusing to start a relationship, but is jealous, however, when Bradley reconciles with Stacey.|$|E
25|$|Heidfeld placed {{pressure}} onto Abt but Vergne {{was drawing}} <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> allowing Abt {{to pull out}} a small advantage over the two drivers. Vergne began his attack before {{the opening of the}} pit stop window and moved ahead of Heidfeld at the turn two chicane for third on lap 18. Further down the field, Carroll and Félix da Costa battled each other and both cars made contact, littering the track with debris. On the 21st lap, Abt fell to third when he was passed by Vergne. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on the same lap when Lynn entered the pit lane after being passed by Sarrazin for sixth position. Bird and Vergne made their pit stops on the same lap, handing the lead back to Abt. Engel set the race's fastest lap on the same lap. He completed a circuit in one minute and 3.883 seconds, and earned him one point. Abt was on an alternative strategy, and held the lead for one lap before handing it back to Bird. After the pit stops, Bird led Vergne by 2.2 seconds, with Abt five seconds adrift of the Virgin car. Sarrazin gained the most places as swift work from his pit crew moved him to fourth, while Rosenqvist was now running in sixth after starting from 17th position, though his teammate Heidfeld fell to eighth.|$|E

500|$|In Sangala, Robert Carlyle plays Carl Benton, an {{old friend}} of Jack Bauer, who runs a school for rescued war orphans. Carlyle {{suggested}} that there is a very close friendship between Benton and Bauer, since he seems to let Benton come <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> than others. Towards the end of the film, he sacrifices himself in order to buy time for Bauer and the children to escape. Gil Bellows plays Frank Tramell, a U.S. State Department official who is ordered to subpoena Bauer. Native South African actor Sean Michael plays Charles Solenz, a UN aid worker helping at Benton's school, and later abandons Benton and the children, claiming that the United Nations is [...] "neutral" [...] in the Sangala conflict.|$|E
500|$|No {{breakaway}} {{was formed}} in the first two-and-a-half hours of racing. Dan Martin won the day's first intermediate sprint, earning him three bonus seconds, with Contador taking one second for third place at the sprint. Eventually, after more than [...] of racing, a seven-rider breakaway was formed. The riders in the breakaway were Carlos Verona (Etixx–Quick-Step), Dario Cataldo (Astana), Jan Polanc (Lampre–Merida), Kanstantsin Sivtsov (Dimension Data), Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto–Soudal), and Gaëtan Bille and Frederik Veuchelen (both Wanty–Groupe Gobert). With [...] remaining, the breakaway had two minutes' lead. On the Alt de Lilla, Poels attacked alone. At the summit, Poels had a lead of 20 seconds over the other breakaway riders. Cataldo and Verona attempted to chase him down, but their failure to collaborate in the chase meant that Sivtsov and Bille were able to catch them; Poels's lead extended to 30 seconds. In the final kilometres, the chase group got <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> but {{he was able to}} take the stage win, eleven seconds ahead of the chasing group.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) {{deals with}} {{complaints}} from local residents {{due to a}} new town policy requiring public officials to deal more directly to the public. Ron calls the policy [...] "my hell", and seeks a new assistant {{to protect him from}} the citizens. Tom (Aziz Ansari) volunteers to find Ron an assistant, but during job interviews he asks questions about [...] "real-world expertise", such as what tie he should wear to the club and what to text girls after a party. Tom brings forward a fast-talking candidate named Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz), whose personality closely resembles Tom's. Ron hates him right away. April (Aubrey Plaza) draws attention around the office for showing up late and slacking off at work. Bored with her internship, April insists she cannot wait to leave the parks department. However, after spending time with Andy at the town hall shoeshine stand where he works, April decides she wants to stay <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and volunteers to be Ron's assistant. She also convinces Andy to sell his band's CDs at the hall, which proves successful. When she slams the door on Tom while he tries to talk to them, Ron immediately hires her.|$|E

Shuichi knows Yu Himura and Chihiro as well, but she forgets Shuichi due to her condition. He meets the main heroine from the fourth chapter of the story named [...] after being introduced by Renji's mother. She goes to an affiliated school and admires Kei greatly {{as someone who is}} older than she is; in fact, Mizuki is also on her school's girls' basketball team. She greatly enjoys reading shōjo manga. She has a straightforward attitude and likes to be frank towards others, especially to Kei. She initially comes to Otowa to visit her older cousin Renji, and this is when she meets Shuichi. Shuichi keeps to himself that he is dying of a special case of neurosis, of which Mizuki is aware of, but even though she tries to get <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> he forcibly pushes her away and rejects her affections. Mizuki becomes depressed and obtains Chihiro's diary. Casually reading it, she finds Yu's name which she recognizes from her past. Mizuki goes to the church to find Yu, but the chapter ends shortly after.|$|E
500|$|Eberhardt {{spent her}} money {{recklessly}} in Algiers, and quickly exhausted the funds left {{to her by}} her mother; she would often spend several {{days at a time}} in kief dens. Augustin, ejected from the Foreign Legion due to his health, returned to Geneva alongside Eberhardt in early 1899. They found Trophimowsky in poor health, suffering from throat cancer and traumatised by the loss of Eberhardt's mother and Vladimir, who had committed suicide the previous year. Eberhardt nursed her father, growing <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She also commenced a relationship and became engaged to Rehid Bay, an Armenian diplomat with whom she had been friends and possibly lovers when she was seventeen. Though Trophimowsky approved of the engagement, the relationship soon ended. Historian Lesley Blanch attributes the relationship's downfall to Bey being assigned to Stockholm. Trophimowsky died in May. Blanch attributes the death to a chloral overdose, with which Eberhardt may have intentionally euthanised him. Eberhardt intended to sell the villa, although Trophimowsky's legitimate wife opposed the execution of the will. After several weeks of legal contentions, Eberhardt mortgaged the property and returned to Africa on the first available ship. With both parents dead, she considered herself free of human attachments and able to live as a vagabond. Eberhardt relinquished her mother's name, and called herself Si Mahmoud Saadi. She began wearing male clothing exclusively and developed a masculine personality, speaking and writing as a man. Eberhardt behaved like an Arab man, challenging gender and racial norms. Asked why she dressed as an Arab man, she invariably replied: [...] "It is impossible for me to do otherwise." [...] A few months later, Eberhardt's money ran low, and she returned to Geneva to sell the villa; due to the legal troubles there was little to no money available.|$|E
