He {{was also}} {{instrumental}} in founding the Association of International Courier and Express Services (AICES) and later the Association of European Express Carriers. Through this and his membership of the International Express Carriers Conference (IECC) https://web.archive.org/web/20080718174808/http://www.jcampbell.com/articles/CP_shape_pub_pol.pdf he worked steadfastly to dispel the 'cowboy' image of the courier industry and promote it as a respected worldwide enterprise on which the business community could depend. He was a recognised expert on the complexities of international customs procedures for express shipments and worked tirelessly to achieve parity of treatment with postal administrations. He contributed valuable input to the European Commission in formulating its Paper on <b>Community</b> <b>Postal</b> <b>Policy,</b> ensuring that it was aware of the courier industry's interests. This helpfully reinforced the line which the Department of Trade and Industry took with the Commission. Having left school in 1941 Bertie Coxall joined the RAF and was commissioned as a navigator, serving in Canada and the Middle East. On demobilisation in 1947 he joined LEP as a Customs Entry Clerk and remained there for 20 years, through LEP's takeover first by American Airlines and then by Pan American Airways (Pan Am), rising to managerial level. In 1966 finding he could not progress in Pan Am without emigrating to the United States, he resigned to form his own company, Airport Courier Services Ltd (ACSL), providing document transmission by motorcycle within the Heathrow area between freight agents and airlines. In 1969, he expanded operations by sending an employee daily to Paris and back. This innovative air courier service was gradually extended to other destinations across the world.|$|E

(Henry IV Part I, 3. 1. 53) Bill number 22, {{introduced}} by Congressman John McHugh in the first session of the 105 th Congress of the United States, proposes the most fundamental changes to American postal laws since 1970, when Congress abolished the Post Office Department and established the United States Postal Service. 2 Since Mr. McHugh chairs the only congressional committee devoted to <b>postal</b> <b>policy</b> 3 and the United States carries about 40 percent of the world’s mail, HR 22 — called the “Postal Reform Act of 1997 ” — has attracted a degree of attention in <b>postal</b> <b>policy</b> circles. The United States Postal Service, representatives of the large American direct mail industry, and competitors like United Parcel Service have all offered their alternatives to HR 22. This paper views HR 22 in the perspective gained by a consideration of these other proposals {{as well as a}} consideration of postal reform measures being implemented or studied in other developed countries. 1 POSTAL REFORM PROPOSALS IN THE UNITED STATES In the United States, as elsewhere, scholars and political activists have urged a variety of fundamental postal reforms ranging from repeal of the postal monopoly to sale of the Postal Service to private shareholders to breakup into regional units.
