Harrison is not a great wordsmith but he is a superb musician. Everything flows, everything interweaves. His melodies are so superb they take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> …" [...] Like Holden, Nicholas Schaffner approved of the singer's gesture in donating his publishing royalties to the Material World Charitable Foundation and praised the album's [...] "exquisite musical underpinnings". Although the [...] "transcendent dogma" [...] was not always to his taste, Schaffner recognised that in Living in the Material World, Harrison had [...] "devised a luxuriant rock devotional designed to transform his fans' stereo equipment into a temple".|$|E

2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god {{takes care of}} the things in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything,</b> there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything.</b> On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he take care of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is able to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything.</b> But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not {{able to take care of}} the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care of the things in the cosmos.|$|E

Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness.

The women feel overburdened by the need to conciliate multiple roles.
