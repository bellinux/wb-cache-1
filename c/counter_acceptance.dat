40|$|This work {{presents}} a heuristic for component pick-and-place sequencing {{to improve the}} throughput of a multi-head surface mount device placement machine for assembling printed circuit board. We present a Variable Neighbourhood Monte Carlo Search (VNMS), which employs variable neighbourhood search with an Exponential Monte Carlo acceptance criterion. VNMS is a descent-ascent heuristic that operates on three sets of neighbourhood structures {{that are based on}} three different local searchers. The first two sets use a steepest descent and Exponential Monte Carlo local search, respectively whilst the third set uses a random 3 -opt operator. The solution returned by a local search, after exploring a neighbourhood structure, will be accepted based on the EMCQ (Exponential Monte Carlo with <b>counter)</b> <b>acceptance</b> criterion. The novelty of the VNMS approach (in the context of VNS) is the concept of three stages of neighbourhood search, using an EMCQ acceptance criterion (at the VNS level) and the shaking procedure (which is only applied when the local searchers cannot find an improved solution). Results show that the VNMS consistently produces good quality solutions. Key words: Heuristic, component placement sequencing, variable neighbourhood search, printed circuit board assembly. 1...|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Recent work of the last 15 years has sought to revaluate what are often thought of as consistent business cycle facts, and one of these in particular is that of procyclical prices. Several publications have found empirical evidence that, <b>counter</b> to widespread <b>acceptance,</b> this cycle fact is not always true, and in the post World War II era prices have indeed been countercyclical. It is the goal of this work to replicate this finding in a set of simulated time series while also keeping inflation procyclical. Furthermore, the simulations show that this occurrence can be produced by moving the simulated time series of the price level out of phase with the output time series. This resulting phase difference can then be adapted to an empirical time frame as a number of quarters that the price level leads output. This process involves calibrating the representative output cycle length in the simulation with a representative output cycle length in empirical data. The conclusion of this study provides a link between the correlation of output and the price level with the phase difference between the cycles of the two variables. Future models could seek to explain this phase difference or operate within the partition suggested in these results...|$|R
40|$|With {{attention}} to parenting, mothering, and fathering {{in the academy}} and {{attention to}} pediatric nutrition in the sciences, this study meets at their intersection. Using a critical approach to study narrative, this inquiry examines pediatric nutrition instruction birth through 12 -months that is targeted to parents. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine how pediatric nutrition instruction construct master (dominant) and counter narratives that determine what constitutes good parenting. Critical narrative analysis reveals that the maternal role is foregrounded and positions mothers as responsible for pediatric nutrition decisions based on expert recommendations. The master narrative, moderate naturalism, limits good decision making to breastfeeding in the first 4 - 6 months. The focus on breastfeeding within moderate naturalism highlights the postfeminist-individualization of the maternal role to self-educate about nutrition, self- diagnose breastfeeding problems, and self-govern the body. The totalizing role of mother is evidenced in the social expectations related to education, health enhancement, risk aversion, and cultivating a healthy eater. The two <b>counter</b> narratives, synthetic <b>acceptance</b> and strict naturalism, are in dialogue with yet resist the master narrative. First, synthetic acceptance resists ?breast is best? constraints on feeding by legitimizing formula feeding as acceptable but inferior. Mothers within synthetic acceptance enact totalizing motherhood through feeding education, control over the scene and feeding process/products, and formula-matching. Synthetic acceptance simultaneously seeks legitimization through maternal storytelling and delegitimizes itself through guilt discourse. Second, strict naturalism resists motivations for feeding choices and the characterization of the apolitical mother in moderate naturalism. Within strict naturalism the maternal role is politicized. Paradoxically, maternal feeding responsibilities reify traditional gender roles and promote domesticity, but they do so in a way that empowers women to enact environmental advocacy. Strict naturalism features mothers who are health literate, environmentally-active, equipped to make homemade organic baby food, and pursue environmental advocacy. By politicizing motherhood, counter narration has the potential to shift from post-feminist-individual frameworks within moderate naturalism to feminist-cooperative frameworks in counter narration. Practice-based recommendations are made to redress the totalizing implications of pediatric nutrition instruction on mothers, limitations on legitimate feeding choices, and neglect of paternal roles...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{detail how}} {{capitalism}} has turned pollution into a generally accepted form of violence perpetuated {{in the name}} of economic health. Complete with a corps of risk managers and environmental consultants, neoliberal capitalism has fashioned pollution into a universal standard that functions as an ambient form of socialization. Pollution, I contend, serves as a social apparatus, an atmospheric example of what Jacques Rancire refers to as distributing the sensible (2004). Instead of being simply a by-product or unavoidable consequence, pollution serves as a constant reminder of the production/flow of capital and of modernitys dependency on heavy industries. But beyond its obvious emissions, spills, dumps, and tailing ponds, much of the fallout of pollution remains hidden. Thus, in mapping the social significance of pollution, the dissertation stresses these two conflicting principles: pollution is constantly present but also invisible. Pollution exists in the form of microscopic particles that travel on the wind and in waterways, penetrating ecosystems, neighbourhoods, homes, and bodies so that people are exposed to its poisons as a matter of fact, as a condition of the everyday, as an emblem of ones modernity. To <b>counter</b> this general <b>acceptance</b> of pollution, I engage in an ecological storytelling that utilizes comic book imagery, along with a mixture of archival and everyday material (government reports, tourist guides, newspaper clippings, postcards, and childrens drawings), to situate the specific harm done by the ambient toxins, chemicals emitted from specific polluting industries and imposed on specific people and ecologies. I concentrate on two ethnographic sites and two polluting industries, as half of the dissertation examines the politics of lead in Toronto (tracing its historical influence and public acceptance in two working class neighbourhoods), while the other half focuses on a massive petrochemical corridor that is located in and around the small city of Sarnia (in southwestern Ontario) and immediately adjacent to the First Nation of Aamjiwnaang. In addition to the more traditional ethnographic methods adopted in the textual chapters, the comics provide a stream of countermemories that refute neoliberal capitalism and its demand for more of the same...|$|R

UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have gone {{through a series of}} major changes over the last few decades. Different authors have asked what changes such as widening participation, changing management and audit practices, and relationships with the world of work mean for academic careers and the university. One notable change has been the continuing {{growth in the number of}} women working and studying in UK higher education. It could be argued that we are now seeing the incremental improvement in the gender balance that will inevitably result from women's greater representation in the academy. As Walsh remarks, it was thought that bringing more women into academia would change the balance of power in HE. However, while women are here in numbers, they tend to dominate the lower ranks of the universities. In terms of academic jobs and structure, women make up 40 % of academics in the UK, but only around 14 % of the top professorial positions. If we examine the culture of higher education in the UK, this tends to both reflect and maintain the relative positions of women and men in the academy. Feminist research continues to play a vital role in highlighting the impact of gender and other power relations in academic careers, despite the wider view of academic meritocracy. And while the number of women working in HE continues to grow, women can still face major challenges and deeply embedded social practices. Elsewhere I have explored some of the micro practices that sustain the male-biased discourse of the successful academic who is focused, aggressive, puts their academic career before everything else, probably doesn't have a family (or has a non-career-minded partner that cares for the children), and has a very planned, linear career pathway. As such, the "silhouette" of the academic, or what we expect the academic to be, look or act like, remains heavily gendered. The fact that the majority of women working in HE continue to dominate the lower "ranks" in many ways reflects the persistence of this gendered silhouette. As Marchbank notes, "it is not so much that discrimination is overt, nor even sneakily covert, but that it is culturally so strong that it appears nonexistent". As such, experiences that are deeply gendered come to be seen as natural, rather than being recognized as something that requires reflection, critique, challenge and transformation. This paperdraws on interviews with a small group of women and men academics in the UK to explore how gender can be seen to shape individual career journeys. This includes a focus on journeys into HE, developing a career and more specific gendered tensions experienced in the academy. The paper concludes that there are a number of areas of experience that are shared by both these women and men within their academic careers. However, it is highlighted that certain aspects of the academic journey remain particularly gendered. It is vital to explore the areas in which there are specifically gendered experiences in order to <b>counter</b> their <b>acceptance</b> as natural or simply "the way it is around here.
