5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the <b>centre</b> <b>point.</b> The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The road's {{name comes}} from the Old English strond, meaning {{the edge of a}} river, as it {{historically}} ran alongside the north bank of the River Thames.

These included Essex House, Arundel House, Somerset House, Savoy Palace, Durham House and Cecil House. The aristocracy moved to the West End over the 17th century, following which the Strand became well known for coffee shops, restaurants and taverns. The street was a <b>centre</b> <b>point</b> for theatre and music hall during the 19th century, and several venues remain on the Strand.

The third ring is a group of people of law in different country and different time. They made a law, which became mainstream of existing laws of today.
