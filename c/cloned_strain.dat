First, I compared the virulence of two case-associated clone isolates from the blood of children with BPF from Serrana, Brazil, which differed in P 145 expression but were identical in all other phenotypic and genotypic characteristics studied. Twenty-four hours after intraperitoneal inoculation of infant rats, there was a significantly higher incidence (51 versus 26 %; P = 0. 035) and magnitude (2. 9 +/- 5. 8 versus 0. 7 +/- 2. 0 CFU/ 0. 01 ml; P = 0. 024) of bacteremia in rats inoculated with the P 145 -expressing strain. I next compared the virulence of a P 145 -expressing case-associated <b>clone</b> <b>strain</b> with two P 145 -nonexpressing phase variants of this strain.

In cloned cells, the abolition of glucocorticoid inhibition by ECM was independent of seeding density and serum concentration. The inhibition on plastic was dependent on serum concentrations> 1 % and resulted in both a slow rate of proliferation and a lower saturation density.

Here, we report the cloning of different genotypes from an isolate of Helicoverpa armigera single-nucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaSNPV) by using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). A transfer vector (pHZB 10) was constructed which contained an Escherichia coli mini-F replicon cassette within the upstream and downstream arms of HaSNPV polyhedrin gene. Hz 2 e 5 cells were co-transfected with wild-type HaSNPV DNA and pHZB 10 to generate recombinant viruses by homologous recombination. The DNA of budded viruses (BVs) was used to transform E. coli. One of the bacmid colonies, HaBacHZ 8, has restriction enzyme digestion profiles similar to an in vivo <b>cloned</b> <b>strain</b> HaSNPV-G 4, the genome of which has been completely sequenced. For testing the oral infectivity, the polyhedrin gene of HaSNPV was reintroduced into HaBacHZ 8 to generate the recombinant bacmid HaBacDF 6.

Consequently, wild-type HCMV differ fundamentally from the passaged strains used for research. To generate a genetically intact source of HCMV, we <b>cloned</b> <b>strain</b> Merlin into a self-excising BAC. The Merlin BAC clone had mutations in the RL 13 gene and UL 128 locus that were acquired during limited replication in vitro prior to cloning. The complete wild-type HCMV gene complement was reconstructed by reference to the original clinical sample. Characterization of viruses generated from repaired BACs revealed that RL 13 efficiently repressed HCMV replication in multiple cell types; moreover, RL 13 mutants rapidly and reproducibly emerged in transfectants. Virus also acquired mutations in genes UL 128, UL 130, or UL 131 A, which inhibited virus growth specifically in fibroblast cells in wild-type form. We further report that RL 13 encodes a highly glycosylated virion envelope protein and thus {{has the potential to}} modulate tropism. To overcome rapid emergence of mutations in genetically intact HCMV, we developed a system in which RL 13 and UL 131 A were conditionally repressed during virus propagation.

A new strain, CVB 3 /RDVa, has been isolated from RD cells chronically infected with CVB 3 /RD and binds multiple molecules in addition to DAF and CAR.

40|$|For decades, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans {{has been}} {{associated}} with aggressive forms of periodontitis in adolescents. In the middle of the 1990 s, a specific JP 2 clone of A. actinomycetemcomitans, belonging to the cluster of serotype b strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans and having a number of other characteristics, was found to be strongly associated with aggressive forms of periodontitis, particularly in North Africa. Although several longitudinal studies still point to the bacterial species, A. actinomycetemcomitans as a risk factor of aggressive periodontitis, it is now also widely accepted that the highly leukotoxic JP 2 clone of A. actinomycetemcomitans is implicated in rapidly progressing forms of aggressive periodontitis. The JP 2 <b>clone</b> <b>strains</b> are highly prevalent in human populations living in Northern and Western parts of Africa. These strains are also prevalent in geographically widespread populations that have originated from the Northwest Africa. Only sporadic signs of a dissemination of the JP 2 <b>clone</b> <b>strains</b> to non-African populations have been found despite Africans living geographically widespread for hundreds of years. It remains an unanswered question if a particular host tropism exists as a possible explanation for the frequent colonization of the Northwest African population with the JP 2 clone. Two exotoxins of A. actinomycetemcomitans are known, leukotoxin (LtxA) and cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt). LtxA is able to kill human immune cells, and Cdt can block cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells and thus induce cell cycle arrest. Whereas the leukotoxin production is enhanced in JP 2 <b>clone</b> <b>strains</b> thus increasing the virulence potential of A. actinomycetemcomitans, it has not been possible so far to demonstrate such a role for Cdt. Lines of evidence have led {{to the understanding of the}} highly leukotoxic JP 2 clone of A. actinomycetemcomitans as an aetiological factor of aggressive periodontitis. Patients, who are colonized with the JP 2 clone, are likely to share this clone with several family members because the clone is transmitted through close contacts. This is a challenge to the clinicians. The patients need intense monitoring of their periodontal status as the risk for developing severely progressing periodontal lesions are relatively high. Furthermore, timely periodontal treatment, in some cases including periodontal surgery supplemented by the use of antibiotics, is warranted. Preferably, periodontal attachment loss should be prevented by early detection of the JP 2 clone of A. actinomycetemcomitans by microbial diagnostic testing and/or by preventive means...|$|R

The addition of epidermal and platelet-derived growth factors in DME containing high density lipoprotein and transferrin to cells grown on ECM resulted in growth rates comparable to that observed with cultures exposed to 10 % serum and were inhibited 45 % by dexamethasone.

40|$|Enterovirus 71 (EV 71) {{infection}} {{remains a}} public health problem at a global level, particularly in the Asia-pacific region. The infection normally manifests as hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD); however, {{it is capable of}} developing into potentially fatal neurological complications. There is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral substance available for prevention or treatment of EV 71 infection. There has been no research undertaken to examine the possible antiviral activity of heparan sulphate (HS) mimetics against the Human Enterovirus A (HEV-A), in particular EV 71. Therefore, this PhD research began with the aim of investigating the antiviral potencies of HS mimetics against EV 71 infection. Initially, a colorimetric-based method was developed for the titration of EV 71 strains, whereby the viral titre was quantified more precisely. Three soluble HS mimetics including heparin (Hep), HS, and pentosan polysulphate (PPS) were then shown to substantially inhibit a <b>cloned</b> <b>strain</b> of EV 71 from infecting in Vero cells. Further investigations revealed that the compounds most likely exerted their antiviral action through interference with the EV 71 attachment. The role of cell surface HS in mediating viral infection was then studied for several clinical isolates of HEV-A and HEV-B in Vero cells as well as a human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH. The findings revealed that the clinical isolate of EV 71 utilizes low sulphated domains of cellular HS to bind to Vero cells, in contrast to Coxsackievirus B 4 (CVB 4), Coxsackievirus A 16 (CVA 16), and the cloned EV 71. In the neural cells, Hep and PPS significantly prevented both clinical EV 71 and clinical CVA 16 binding and infections, although it could not be confirmed whether the viruses utilize cellular HS to bind to the cells. Finally, an Affymetrix DNA microarray was performed to gain insight into the mechanisms of action of Hep against the clinical EV 71 infection in the neural cells. The results showed many genes with significant down- or up-regulation across the undermentioned conditions: negative control cells, compound control (cells treated with Hep only), virus control (cells treated with virus only), and treatment control (EV 71 -infected cells treated with Hep). Several genes were finally found to be targets for the anti-EV 71 activity of Hep in SK-N-SH cells using a strict multi-level selection procedure. In parallel, the results revealed the significant induction of more than 1000 genes by EV 71 infection with expression fold changes ranged from + 46. 5 to - 10. 7. The findings of this research may suggest new directions for studies of designing molecular drug targets against EV 71 infection...|$|E

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) re-emerges periodically in Africa causing massive outbreaks. In the Maghreb, eco-climatic and entomologic conditions are favourable for WNV and RVFV emergence.

40|$|The natural history, microevolution, and {{patterns}} of interindividual transmission and global dissemination of the JP 2 clone of Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans were studied by population genetic analysis. The JP 2 clone is strongly associated with aggressive periodontitis in adolescents of African descent and differs from other clones of the species by several genetic peculiarities, including a 530 -bp deletion in the promoter region of the leukotoxin gene operon, which results in increased leukotoxic activity. Multilocus sequence analysis of 82 A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, 66 of which were JP 2 <b>clone</b> <b>strains</b> collected {{over a period of}} more than 20 years, confirmed that there is a clonal population structure with evolutionary lineages corresponding to serotypes. Although genetically highly conserved, as shown by alignment of sequences of eight housekeeping genes, strains belonging to the JP 2 clone had a number of point mutations, particularly in the pseudogenes hbpA and tbpA. Characteristic mutations allowed isolates from individuals from the Mediterranean area and from West Africa, including the Cape Verde Islands, to be distinguished. The patterns of mutations indicate that the JP 2 clone initially emerged as a distinct genotype in the Mediterranean part of Africa approximately 2, 400 years ago and subsequently spread to West Africa, from which it was transferred to the American continents during the transatlantic slave trade. The sustained exclusive colonization of individuals of African descent despite geographical separation for centuries suggests that the JP 2 clone has a distinct host tropism. The colonization of family members by JP 2 <b>clone</b> <b>strains</b> with unique point mutations provides strong evidence that there is intrafamilial transmission and suggests that dissemination of the JP 2 clone is restricted to close contacts...|$|R

40|$|In the {{prospective}} study the susceptibility of 41 Escherichia coli strains and 55 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to gentamicin, netilmicin and amikacin was tested at a 2 -year interval (period I April 1998 to March 1999, and period II April to July 2001). Genotyping {{was performed by}} pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and a clone based on 80 % or 90 % similarity was determined {{for each of the}} study bacteria. In 24 (32. 0 %) <b>clones,</b> <b>strains</b> showed no variation over 2 -year interval, supporting the hypothesis on a priori susceptible strains. Transformation from susceptibility in period I to resistance in period II was demonstrated in 5 (6. 7 %) clones, a pattern consistent with the concept of bacterial development of resistance under the influence of antibiotics. However, there were 10 (13. 3 %) <b>clones</b> whose <b>strains</b> exhibited an inverse pattern. Accordingly, two-way transformation of susceptibility took place during the study period. The utilization of the study aminoglycosides had no major impact on the variation of microbial susceptibility. Changes in microbial susceptibility were found to follow some regular patterns, which were not influenced by the study aminoglycosides. Two phenomena were observed: (i) there were stable clones that did not develop resistance in spite of selective antibiotic challenge; and (ii) changes of susceptibility in isolated bacteria from both inpatient and outpatient strains of the same clone were two-way and reversible...|$|R
40|$|Different {{isolates}} {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) vary in the cell tropisms they display, i. e., the range of cell types {{in which they are}} able to establish a productive infection. Here, we report on the phenotypes of recombinants between two molecularly <b>cloned</b> <b>strains</b> of HIV- 1. Our results prove that the envelope glycoprotein gp 120 is solely responsible for the difference in cell tropism between the two parental isolates and that no other genes or sequences are involved in determining the cell tropism of these strains. The region of the envelope involved in the determination of cell tropism includes sequences which encode the V 3 loop of gp 120. Control of cell tropism by this region of the virus env gene is a general phenomenon which applies to many different HIV- 1 isolates...|$|R
40|$|Two {{beta-lactamase}} genes, asbA 1 and asbB 1, encoding AsbA 1 and AsbB 1, respectively, {{have been}} cloned from Aeromonas sobria AER 14 M into Escherichia coli. AsbA 1 was expressed at low but detectable levels in all E. coli laboratory <b>cloning</b> <b>strains</b> tested. AsbB 1 was expressed {{well in the}} E. coli <b>cloning</b> <b>strain</b> DH 5 alpha. However, no enzyme activity could be detected from the same clone when placed in E. coli MC 1061. Ampicillin-resistant mutants of E. coli MC 1061 were obtained that expressed high levels of enzymatically active AsbB 1. Four independent mutants were examined. All four mutations mapped to one locus, designated blpA (beta-lactamase permissive). The blpA locus was distinct from other known loci that {{play a role in}} beta-lactamase expression, i. e., the two loci that affect expression of the Bacteroides fragilis metallo-beta-lactamase and the ampC regulatory genes, ampD, ampE, and ampG. Sequence analysis of asbA 1 and asbB 1 revealed that AsbA 1 was a class C beta-lactamase most closely related to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa chromosomal cephalosporinase and probably represents the common A. sobria cephalosporinase. AsbB 1 was a class D enzyme most closely related to the oxacillin-hydrolyzing enzyme OXA- 1, with 34 % amino acid sequence identity. Purified AsbA 1 was a typical cephalosporinase with a substrate profile that reflected high rates of hydrolysis of cephaloridine compared with benzylpenicillin. Purified AsbB 1 showed strong penicillinase activity, with hydrolysis rates for carbenicillin and cloxacillin 2 to 2. 5 times that for benzylpenicillin. Hydrolysis of imipenem was < or = 1 % of that for benzylpenicillin. Both clavulanic acid and tazobactam strongly inhibited AsbB 1, while sulbactam inhibited the AsbB 1 enzyme less effectively. None of the inhibitors worked well against the AsbA 1 enzyme. The chelators EDTA and 1, 10 -o-phenanthroline did not affect the activity of either enzyme. A. sobria AER 14 M was found to produce both a group 1 cephalosporinase and a novel group 2 d cloxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase that has been designated here OXA- 12...|$|R
40|$|Antigenic {{variants}} of Leptospira interrogans serovars copenhageni and hebdomadis were examined by bacterial restriction endonuclease DNA analysis with EcoRI, XhoI, SalI, BstEII, and HindIII as the digesting enzymes. The antigenic variants were stable <b>cloned</b> <b>strains</b> {{which had been}} cultivated in media containing homologous immune serum. One of the strains examined has been reported elsewhere (R. Yanagawa and J. Takashima, Infect. Immun. 10 : 1439 - 1442) as having an antigenic makeup which more closely resembles serovar kremastos than the serovar hebdomadis parent. The closely antigenically related but naturally occurring serovars icterhaemorrhagiae strain RGA and copenhageni strain M 20 were examined in parallel. No differences could be shown between the hebdomadis parent and any of its mutants. Serovars copenhageni and icterohaemorrhagiae produced patterns which differed in the high-molecular-weight bands only. The Shibaura parent strain {{did not differ from}} copenhageni M 20, but the Shibaura M 1 strain differed from the other mutants and from icterohaemorrhagiae RGA in its high-molecular-weight bands...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{increase}} in availability of {{next generation sequencing}} methodologies has led to extensive analysis of the genome of Clostridium difficile. In contrast, protein expression analysis, crucial to the elucidation of mechanisms of disease, has severely lagged behind. In this study, in-depth proteomic analysis of three strains of varying virulence, demonstrated previously in an animal model, has been undertaken {{against a background of}} the sequenced genomes. Strain B- 1 is a historic, virulent, ribotype 005 <b>clone,</b> <b>strain</b> A represents the emerging hypervirulent 027 ribotype, while strain Tra 5 / 5, ribotype 001, is of low virulence. To undertake a comprehensive overview of the expressed proteome, both 1 D and 2 D gel electrophoresis were used to separate and display the protein content of each isolate. This was coupled to MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry for protein identification. A total of 888 different proteins were characterised by comparative analysis of isolates grown in parallel for 64 hours on blood agar. Of these, only 38...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of parasitism tissue upon treatment with two lignano lactones, namely (-) - cubebin (CUB) and (-) -hinokinin (HNK), was evaluated in the chronic phase of Chagas` disease by quantifying the enzyme beta-galactosidase {{expressed by the}} CL B 5 <b>clone</b> <b>strain</b> of Trypanosoma cruzi. Tissue karyometry was also performed. Treatment with the assessed lignans led to a larger reduction in parasitism tissue in all evaluated organs, compared with benznidazole (BZN). Oral treatment with CUB or HNK was more effective. Karyometry results demonstrated that the infected control animals had increased nuclear area compared with uninfected controls, indicating cellular hypertrophy. Results also revealed that use of CUB or HNK was able to significantly prevent this increase, and a slight decrease in the nuclear area was observed, compared with mice treated with BZN. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CUB and HNK could be considered as potential compounds {{for the development of}} new drugs for treatment of Chagas` disease. CAPESCNPqFAPES...|$|R
40|$|The strong {{restriction}} barrier {{present in}} Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis has limited functional genomic analysis {{to a small}} subset of strains that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Recently, a conserved type IV restriction system termed SauUSI (which specifically recognizes cytosine methylated DNA) was identified as the major barrier to transformation with foreign DNA. Here we have independently corroborated these findings in a widely used laboratory strain of S. Â aureus. Additionally, we have constructed a DNA cytosine methyltransferase mutant in the high-efficiency EscherichiaÂ coli <b>cloning</b> <b>strain</b> DH 10 B (called DC 10 B). Plasmids isolated from DC 10 B can be directly transformed into clinical isolates of S. Â aureus and S. Â epidermidis. We also show {{that the loss of}} restriction (both type I and IV) in an S. Â aureus USA 300 strain does not have an impact on virulence. Circumventing the SauUSI restriction barrier, combined with an improved deletion and transformation protocol, has allowed the genetic manipulation of previously untransformable strains of these important opportunistic pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Numerous DNA {{assembly}} technologies {{exist for}} generating plasmids for biological studies. Many procedures require complex in vitro or in vivo assembly reactions followed by plasmid propagation in recombination-impaired Escherichia coli strains such as DH 5 Î±, which are optimal for stable amplification of the DNA materials. Here {{we show that}} despite its utility as a <b>cloning</b> <b>strain,</b> DH 5 Î± retains sufficient recombinase activity to assemble up to six double-stranded DNA fragments {{ranging in size from}} 150 bp to at least 7 kb into plasmids in vivo. This process also requires surprisingly small amounts of DNA, potentially obviating the need for upstream assembly processes associated with most common applications of DNA assembly. We demonstrate the application of this process in cloning of various DNA fragments including synthetic genes, preparation of knockout constructs, and incorporation of guide RNA sequences in constructs for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) genome editing. This consolidated process for assembly and amplification in a widely available strain of E. coli may enable productivity gain across disciplines involving recombinant DNA work...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work we studied the {{karyotype}} stability during long-term in vitro maintenance in 3 <b>cloned</b> <b>strains</b> of Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and a hybrid between both species. Only the L. (V.) peruviana strain showed an unstable karyotype, even after subcloning. Four chromosomes were studied in detail, {{each of them}} characterized by homologous chromosomes of different size (heteromorphy). Variations in chromosome patterns during in vitro maintenance were rapid and discrete, involving loss of heteromorphy or appearance of additional chromosome size variants. The resulting pattern {{was not the same}} according to experimental conditions (subinoculation rate or incubation temperature), and interestingly, this was associated with differences in growth behaviour of the respective parasites. No change in total ploidy of the cells was observed by flow cytometry. We discuss several mechanisms that might account for this variation of chromosome patterns, but we favour the occurrence of aneuploidy, caused by aberrant chromosome segregation during mitosis. Our results provide insight into the generation of karyotype diversity in natural conditions and highlight the relativity of the clone concept in parasitology...|$|R
