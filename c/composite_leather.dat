40|$|Leather is a {{fibrous protein}} {{consisting}} of collagen in a three dimensionally crosslinked network. Chrome tanning of leather improves {{the appearance of}} leather {{but at the same}} time emits both solid and liquid chrome leather wastes. Scrap rubber recycling using untreated and neutralized leather fibrous particles in natural rubber has been studied. Vulcanization, mechanical, morphological and swelling properties of the natural rubber - scrap rubber <b>composites</b> containing neutralized <b>leather</b> have been discussed. Use of chrome leather particles has been found to improve the consumption of scrap rubber powder in natural rubber formulations. Polymer <b>composites</b> based on <b>leather</b> wastes as fillers are reported to be useful for many applications such as in construction materials, automobile interior moldings, heat and sound insulating boards, shoe soles, flooring materials and moldings with good anti-static properties, air permeability and good appearances...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of the properties of wood fibres <b>leather</b> shavings <b>composite</b> board by using the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and multivariate data analysis. In this study fibreboards were manufactured with different leather amounts by using spruce fibres, as well as vegetable and mineral tanned leather shavings (wet white and wet blue). The NIR spectroscopy was used to analyse the raw materials {{as well as the}} wood leather fibreboards. Moreover, the physical and mechanical features of the wood <b>leather</b> <b>composite</b> fibreboards were determined to characterize their properties for the further data analysis. The NIR spectra were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method. These results demonstrate the potential of FT-NIR spectroscopy to estimate the physical and mechanical properties (e. g., bending strength). This phenomenon provides a possibility for quality assurance systems by using the NIRS...|$|R
40|$|Leather buffing dust {{is a fine}} powder of {{collagen}} fibril {{waste from}} milling and buffing operations and constitutes {{an important part of}} solid wastes generated from chrome tanned leather production processes. It is one of the difficult tannery wastes to manage and current practice of its disposal includes its incineration and disposal in landfill. The scientific literature reports numerous studies on its utilization in composites formulations. Chrome tanned buffing dust has been used as filler for various polymeric matrices with the aim of producing leather-like composites for potential applications such as hand bags, wallets, key chain holder and purses and footwear products such as shoe soles, insole, heels etc. This paper compiles different research works done by researchers regarding <b>composites</b> made from <b>leather</b> industry buffing dust. The characteristics of composites are also presented by making use of previously published studies carried out with different polymer matrices. Reviewed studies reveal that fiber-reinforced composites utilizing buffing dust provide landfill avoidance, energy conservation, decrease depletion of virgin raw material, enable production of low cost composites with improved mechanical properties {{that can be used for}} multifunctional applications and moreover they provide solution to the environmental problems associated with the waste management of the leather industry...|$|R
40|$|Leather {{industry}} is a relatively large source of waste from raw material, so skin waste recovery is a goal of clean technologies. Capitalization of skin waste aims to obtain: chemical auxiliaries, technical articles, hydrolyzed protein, artificial <b>leather,</b> <b>composite</b> building materials, heat sources and collagen biomaterials with applications in medicine, cosmetics, etc. A {{first step in the}} recovery of skin waste is the degreasing operation. Ultrasound is an effective tool to improve the efficiency of the conventional degreasing affecting the chemical substances as well as the treated skin. In addition, the processing time is reduced. Ultrasound is known to enhance the emulsification and dispersion of oils/fat. The usual degreasing methods requires more emulsifier/solvent ratio and process time for emulsification and additional solvent for washing out the emulsified fat. This paper investigates the possibility of recovery through ecological processes of leather waste from finishing operations for further capitalization. The present study aims emulsification and subsequent removal of the fat present in the chamois powder waste from polishing operation with the aid of ultrasound by an aqueous ecofriendly method. The study also took into account the ultrasonic treatment of the leather waste using trichlorethylene as a medium of propagation-degreasing, and realized a comparative analysis of efficiency of fat extraction by Soxhlet method and via ultrasonication. IR-ATR and optical microscopy highlight both morphological and chemical-structural changes of treated materials by different degreasing method...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} {{scarcity of}} resources and raw materials in the wood panels industry, {{it is imperative to}} look for suitable alternatives to the established resources. Therefore a combination of the traditionally used and newly explored sources may reveal highly innovative ways. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide an insight into the behavior of the material and possible new applications of those fiber/particle wood and waste <b>leather</b> <b>composites.</b> For this reason exclusively fibers of spruce were used for the trials. Wet white (WW) leather particles and wet blue (WB) leather particles were mixed with the wooden materials for the production of high density fibreboards. Besides the mechanical properties such as the internal bond (IB) the bending strength (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) was analyzed. Further physical property as thickness swelling after 24 h watering was investigated. To analyze how the density influences the behavior under thermal conditions, fiberboards with the densities 500, 700 and 900 kg/m³ were tested. The results of the material properties were influenced by the leather content of the panels. The results for the UF-bonded HDF boards show enhancement of the transverse IB with increasing wet blue leather content, whereas the other mechanical properties decline meanwhile. The thickness swelling showed higher values compared to the wood fibreboard. The results of this study underline the usefulness of integrating leather shavings to HDF and give an overview of their influence in wood fiber materials. The combination of the natural resource wood fiber and the leather waste products (Wet Blue and Wet White) gives a very interesting new material, its mechanical properties allow a variety of possible application in future applications...|$|R
