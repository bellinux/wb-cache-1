40|$|Recent concern {{regarding}} corporate {{social responsibility}} (CSR) has resulted in voluntary initiatives aimed at bringing companies closer to society, such as <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct,</b> reporting or environmental management systems. These voluntary initiatives present a number of flaws. Some authors and pressure groups argue that, although self-regulation may encourage CSR, it is insufficient to achieve the goal of corporate accountability. This paper focuses on this issue and attempts {{to answer the following}} research questions: Are <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> an appropriate and adequate means of measuring CSR and improving environmental and social corporate performance? Are <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> an effective tool for the true social control of companies?

40|$|Following the {{offshoring}} {{of production}} {{to developing countries}} by transnational corporations (TNCs), unions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have criticised working conditions at TNCs’ offshore factories. This {{has led to the}} emergence of two different approaches to operationalising TNC responsibilities for workers’ rights in developing countries: <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> and global agreements. Despite the importance of this development, few studies have systematically compared the effects of these two different ways of dealing with workers’ rights. This paper addresses this gap by analysing how <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> and global agreements both independently and interactively affect workers’ rights. We do this based on a qualitative study of the Sri Lankan operations of a Swedish TNC in Sri Lanka, and on interviews with union and NGO representatives actively involved in <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> and global agreements. Our results indicate that global agreements independently address all the aspects included in <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct,</b> while also addressing additional, more process-oriented aspects of workers’ rights. Hence, on their own, global agreements seem to comprise the superior approach to promoting workers’ rights. Furthermore, our results indicate that promoting <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> has negative interactive effects on global agreements. Based on these results, we argue that the current focus on <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> is counterproductive for the promotion of workers’ rights...|$|R

5|$|The {{images of}} Uttararama follow a {{different}} style from {{the images of the}} previous Anuradhapura period, and show some significant differences. The identity of the standing image is subject to a certain amount of dispute among historians and archaeologists, some of whom argue that it depicts the monk Ananda rather than the Buddha. Each of the images have been carved in a way that uses a maximum possible area of the rock, and their heights seem to have been decided based on the height of the rock itself. Each statue appears to have had its own image house, as indicated by the remains of brick walls at the site. The Uttararama was where Parakramabahu I held a congregation of monks to purify the Buddhist priesthood, and later drew up a <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> for them. This <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> has been recorded in an inscription on the same rock face containing the images of the Buddha.|$|E

In order to get information about Codes and its impacts a research study about impacts <b>of</b> <b>Codes</b> was <b>conducted</b> in Tirupur India.

40|$|Despite {{increased}} {{academic and}} practitioner interest in <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct,</b> {{there has been}} little research into the actual compliance of suppliers in developing countries with the <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> multinational corporations (MNCs). This paper addresses this lack by analysing Chinese suppliers’ level of compliance with Swedish toy retailers’ <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct.</b> Based on unannounced and unofficial interviews with employees of Chinese suppliers, the study shows that all of the nine studied suppliers breached some of the standards in the toy retailers’ codes, with over two thirds of the suppliers not complying with the majority of the studied standards. While there are different explanations of this lack of compliance, the main explanation seems to be that Chinese suppliers successfully deceive toy retailers’ monitoring organisations by decoupling the formal monitored part of their organisation from the actual operational part of their organisation. The paper concludes with a discussion of how to increase compliance with MNCs’ <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct...</b>|$|R

40|$|Today {{the role}} of {{companies}} as societal actors is subject to a vivid debate due to the ecological degradation and unethical working practices that has resulted from an increased outsourcing of production to developing countries. A commonly used method to increase the sustainability of production is by adopting <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> but implementing these sustainability policies is a complex issue in developing countries {{partly due to the}} top-down design <b>of</b> the <b>codes.</b> However, recent research indicates that the implementation <b>of</b> corporate <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> can benefit from the involvement by local actors. Simultaneously, this increased focus on firm-society relationships has created new avenues for labour unions to use these codes in pressuring the suppliers to improve the situation for the workers. This is opening up a new research field in which we have studied how unions can use these <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> as a strategy to improve workers’ conditions. Thus, this study aims to contribute to the understanding <b>of</b> how <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> {{can be used in a}} bottom-up approach by local actors. Therefore, we have carried out an empirical study of how Indonesian labour unions use <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> to leverage their demands in the textile-and garment industry. Our empirical findings show that unions use <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> on a regular basis. Moreover, our results indicate that the use <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> constitute three main strategies where the codes are used in relation to the supplier, the international buyer or through an international network. To conclude, the choice <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> conduct-strategy is influenced by internal elements such as the <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> conduct-education, the union’s access to international networks as well as the characteristics of issue.
