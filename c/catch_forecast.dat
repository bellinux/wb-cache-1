40|$|The <b>catch</b> <b>forecast</b> is {{important}} for fisheries activities. Previous research has tried to improve forecast accuracy. However the forecast accuracy does not directly correspond to the forecast benefit, and an inaccurate forecast could be more beneficial than accurate one. Herein {{as part of the}} forecast utility, predictability was evaluated using information theory. Mutual information (MI) was used as index of predictability. MI denotes a reduction in uncertainty when a forecast is taken into account. Adding this, hit ratio (HR) and relative entropy (R) were used as consistency indices. HR denotes a frequency for which the predicted values are consistent with the actual values, and R denotes the distance of the probability distribution between the actual and forecasted fishing conditions. As an application, the long-term change-ratio forecasts in 1972 - 2009 (n = 36), short-term change-ratio forecasts (n = 34), and short-term level forecasts (n = 33) in 2004 - 2009 of Pacific saury Cololabis saira fishery were evaluated. The order of MI, HR, and R varied between these forecasts, indicating that forecast predictability and consistency do not correspond. Monitoring multiple indices would improve forecasting systems...|$|E

Here, we base our evaluation of the assessments' performance {{on the quality of the}} advice and on the wider issue of how science is used to produce management advice. At the same time, we consider catch-at-age analyses and <b>catch</b> <b>forecasts</b> in the context of the amount of person-time and expertise available at the relevant working group meetings. The results indicate that, generally, the <b>catch</b> <b>forecasts</b> have been positively biased and that the bias has been driven by three main factors: (i) substantial overestimates of terminal stock size since the late 1990 s, (ii) overestimates of incoming recruitment, and (iii) overestimates of growth. information for other North Sea stocks (haddock, plaice, and sole) suggests that bias is a problem generally, not one unique to cod.

Discarding is the process where part of the catch (usually undersized fish) is thrown back into the sea immediately after being caught. The survival of discarded fish is very low.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{forecasting}} strategy based on stationary wavelet transform combined with radial basis function (RBF) neural network {{to improve the}} accuracy of 3 -month-ahead hake <b>catches</b> <b>forecasting</b> of the fisheries industry in the central southern Chile. The general idea of the proposed forecasting model is to decompose the raw data set into an annual cycle component and an inter-annual component by using 3 -levels stationary wavelet decomposition. The components are independently predicted using an autoregressive RBF neural network model. The RBF neural network model is composed of linear and nonlinear weights, which are estimates using the separable nonlinear least squares method. Consequently, the proposed forecaster is the co-addition of two predicted components. We demonstrate {{the utility of the}} proposed model on hake catches data set for monthly periods from 1963 to 2008. Experimental results on hake catches data show that the autoregressive RBF neural network model is effective for 3 -month-ahead forecasting.

40|$|This work {{presents}} an exploratory {{analysis of the}} potential relationship between offshore shrimp catches and environmental factors at the Gulf of California, using shrimp harvest information from Guaymas, Sonora, and Mazatlán, Sinaloa,México. Multiple correlation {{analysis was used to}} examine the relationships between landings time series and environmental variables, including average rainfall, fluvial discharge, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Niño Multivariate (MEI) Indices. Environmental index series were split for January through June (cold season) and July through December (warm season), since shrimp populations show two reproduction peaks throughout the year. These two spawning seasons give rise to two cohorts: the cold-season (April–June) and the warm-season (October–November), the former sustaining the fishery during the open season (September–March) and yielding 90 % of total catch between September and October. Our findings indicate that the mean PDO index for the cold season accounted for the highest percentage of catch variation, suggesting that conditions during the cold season (January–June) may determine recruiting in the April–June cohort. This information may be used to derive <b>catch</b> <b>forecasts</b> several months in advance...|$|R
40|$|From April, 1929, to September, 1932, {{the early}} life {{history of the}} California sardine (Sardina caerulea) was {{subjected}} to an intensive investigation.

40|$|With its genesis in New England {{during the}} 1800 's, the purse seine fishery for Atlantic menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus, {{expanded}} south {{and by the}} early 1900 's ranged {{the length of the}} eastern seaboard. The purse seine fishery for Gulf menhaden. B. patronus, is of relatively recent development, exploitation of the stock beginning in the late 1940 's. Landings from both fisheries annually comprise 35 - 40 % of the total U. S. fisheries landings, ranking menhaden first in terms of volume landed. Technological advances in harvesting methods, fish-spotting capabilities, and vessel designs accelerated after World War II, resulting in larger, faster, and wider-ranging carrier vessels, improved speed and efficiency of the harvest, and reduction in labor requirements. Chief products of the menhaden industry are fish meal, fish oil, and solubles, but research into new product lines is underway. Since 1955 on the Atlantic coast and 1964 on the Gulf coast, the NMFS has monitored the fisheries for biostatistical data.

40|$|Concern over {{incidental}} catches in commercial fisheries has been increasing, and while simple mitigation strategies have been effective, few effective mitigation strategies {{have been established}} for more complex species interactions. Incidental catches of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (A. aestivalis) in the commercial Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) fishery have received substantial attention on the Northeast U.

This study evaluates the utility of existing species distribution forecasts to predict river herring catches in the southern New England small mesh bottom trawl Atlantic herring fishery, with {{the ultimate goal of}} incorporating incidental <b>catch</b> <b>forecasts</b> into the bycatch avoidance program. Commercial Atlantic herring bottom trawl vessels assisted with field-based evaluation of alewife, blueback herring, and Atlantic herring species distribution forecast models. Vessels were equipped with conductivity, temperature, and depth probes, and sampling occurred throughout the fishery season (January–March). Locations of expected low and high <b>forecasted</b> incidental <b>catches</b> were sampled, as well as locations the captain expected to find low and high {{incidental catches}}. This allowed us to sample within the spatial area the fishery occurs, and to evaluate the forecasted conditions, and predictions, at the spatial scale of the fishery. Catch differences between high and low probability stations were small and variable, as were differences in modeled probability of species presence. No differences were observed between observations at model-predicted stations and captain-selected stations. The sampling provided {{a better understanding of the}} potential effectiveness of distribution forecasts for further reducing incidental catches. Existing models have limited use at the spatial scale of this fishery, but could be improved by developing models with fishery-dependent data. Collaborations between researchers, managers, and the Atlantic herring commercial fleet have improved relationships between the groups, and continued collaboration in the development and evaluation of incidental catch reduction tools is key for further reducing incidental catches...|$|R

40|$|Erratic {{and highly}} {{variable}} catches in the South African chokka squid Loligo vulgaris reynaudii fishery, cause socio-economic hardship {{for the industry}} and uncertainty for resource managers. <b>Catch</b> <b>forecasting</b> can reduce this problem as {{it is believed that}} catch variability is strongly influenced by environmental factors. In this study, data were collected at varying temporal and spatial scales. Data for the hourly time-scale study were collected from 1996 - 1998, aboard commercial vessels, whilst for the longer time-scales, data were extracted for Kromme Bay (a single fishing area) from existing databases (1991 - 1998) that were comprised of compulsory catch returns and oceanographic data. The environment-catch relationship for chokka squid on the inshore spawning grounds was then investigated using multiple correlation and regression analysis, analysis of variance, contingency table analysis and cross-correlation statistical techniques. This simple, direct, 'black box' statistical approach was relatively successful in developing a predictive capability. On a short time-scale (hourly), the regression model accounted for 32 % of the variability in catch, with turbidity the main determinant (13 %). On a daily monthly time-scale, the best prediction model was on a monthly scale, accounting for 40 % of the variability in catch. The principal determinant, bottom temperature anomaly (11 %), was found to lag one month forward. Seasonal and diel catch variations induced changes in the relative importance of turbidity, water temperature and wind direction on catches. A strong, positive relationship was found between easterly winds (which cause upwelling) and catch, particularly in summer. Catch rates, however, decreased with an increase in turbidity. The correlation between temperature and catch was generally negative, however, higher catches were associated with a temperature range of 13 - 18 °C. Highest catch rates were associated with easterly winds, zero turbidity conditions and sea surface temperatures from 15. 0 - 16. 9 °C. Selected case studies (in situ observations) suggested that upwelling and turbidity events act as environmental triggers for the initiation or termination of the spawning process, respectively. A holistic approach is required to improve predictive capability of chokka squid abundance. Although short-term predictability remains essential (i. e. hourly-scale), future research should concentrate on long-term prediction models (e. g., monthly time-scales) involving greater spatial variation, which are the most important for management...|$|R

The group was tasked with carrying out stock assessments and <b>catch</b> <b>forecasts</b> {{and providing a}} first draft of the ICES advice for 2014 for 16 stocks. 4 stocks were listed as “multiyear”. For those stocks, catch information was updated. For the remaining stocks, WGBIE had to finalise a draft advice prepared by WGNEW. Analytical assessments using age-structured models were conducted for {{the northern and southern}} stocks of megrim, the Bay of Biscay sole and nephrops stocks, whereas the two hake stocks and one southern stock of anglerfish were assessed using models that allow the use of only length-structured data (no age data). A surplus-production model, without age or length structure, was used to assess the second southern stocks of anglerfish. No analytical assessments have been provided for the northern stocks of anglerfish after 2006. This is mostly due to ageing problems and to an increase in dis-cards in recent years, {{for which there is no}} reliable data at the stock level. The state of stocks for which no analytical assessment could be performed was inferred from ex-amination of commercial LPUE or CPUE data and from survey information. Four stocks within the remit of the WG went through the benchmarking process in 2014. For the two southern megrim stocks, the inclusion of discards and some modifi-cations in the assessment model settings were carried out. For northern hake, the ret-rospective pattern issue which arose in last year’s assessment was partly addressed and for southern hake, convergence issues of the assessment model were investigated. Three nephrops stocks from the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian waters are scheduled for benchmark assessments at the start of 2015.

40|$|WKFRAME met for 4 days in late March {{to provide}} some {{technical}} guidelines to as-sist ICES expert groups {{in the implementation of}} the ICES MSY concept in advice for 2011. The workshop was attended by scientists from the ICES community, stake-holders from the fishing Industry and environmental interest groups, as well as rep-resentatives from one of ICES clients (EC). The primary area addressed by the group was to provide technical guidelines for the estimation of an exploitation rate based MSY target or if necessary a proxy, which should include; criteria for selection of proxies for Fmsy and criteria for advice when <b>catch</b> <b>forecasts</b> are not available. While the workshop focused on the technical issues related to defining Fmsy proxies, the dis-cussions touched on other issues related to the implementation of an MSY based ad-vice. These issues which include: the role of management plans in relation to MSY based advice, the function and definition of the Btrigger in the ICES implementation of an MSY advice, the definition of Fmsy as a target or limit reference point, and the in-clusion of estimation or implementation errors in the MSY target. The effects of multi species/predator prey interactions on Fmsy targets, requires further consideration. In relation to these issues, for the purposes of generating ICES advice for 2011, practical approaches are proposed by ACOM. With regard to the estimation of Fmsy proxies, the general approach advocated by WKFRAME is to explore the data through a range of methods with different assumptions, to identify the range of plausible candidates. The workshop suggested that EG¿s explore the sensitivity of the estimates of these candidates to uncertainty and assumptions in the model parameters, and finally, where possible, to check the response of the stock to fishing at any proposed target in the long term (through simulation). Technical guidelines in terms of methods, sensi-tivity analyses and things to look out for are detailed in chapter 2 of the report. With regard to the criteria for advice when there is no forecast; the workshop suggests that F advice in relation to putative Fmsy targets should be framed in terms of moving ex-ploitation rates towards the target, rather than specifying a harvest in relation to the current stock status and/or expected short term development of the stock. Thus ad-vice arising from circumstances where there is no short term forecast, has to be seen {{in the context of a}} ¿soft¿ evaluation of stock status relative to crudely estimated prox-ies. There are no new methods or techniques proposed in this report, and indeed the most basic equilibrium based methods are those used in the early years of fisheries science. The implementation of guidelines suggested in this report, require some de-gree of ¿expert judgement¿ and (in the cases of simulation) a caution against over interpretation of the results. This leads ultimately to a conclusion that the move to MSY based advice has to be seen as a stepwise process, which will require data ex-ploration and sensitivity analysis by the EG¿s, and a willingness from both ICES and its clients to work with recursively updated targets.

40|$|The yellow perch, (Perca flavescens), is an {{important}} commercial and sport fish in Indiana waters of Lake Michigan. The population is currently managed by temporary restrictions of commercial harvest. A computer simulation model was developed {{to examine the effects}} of various constant harvest quotas and alewife densities on yellow perch relative numbers. Model design is based on the SLAM II simulation language incorporating a FORTRAN biological subroutine. The age-structured population model includes measured or predicted biological characteristics of the dynamic pool model. Recruitment is based on a preestablished three-dimensional Ricker stock-recruitment function including alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) species interaction as a constant or stochastic factor. Sex-specific natural mortality rates were established through life history parameter analysis and the von Bertalanffy growth factors. Density-dependent growth is incorporated into each year of a model run and fluctuates with the simultaneous density of fish. Constant levels of commercial harvest ranging from 0 to 700, 000 kg were used in 20 -year forecasts. Initial conditions for model runs were 1984 and 1994 trawl CPUE levels when yellow perch were at high and low levels, respectively according to standardized sampling. Response variables were examined as mean <b>catches</b> over each <b>forecast</b> length and included: age 2 fish, spawning stock (z 190 mm), and total catch > age 1. Alewife densities had a tremendous impact on mean catches of the response variables. Highest <b>catches</b> under any <b>forecast</b> period occurred when alewife was considered absent from the system. Catches declined as alewife density was increased as a 20 -year constant under each harvest regimen. Catches of spawning size fish were maintained at highest levels for all forecast periods when harvest was set to zero. Catches of young fish were moderate with this harvest regimen if initial catch conditions were high such as in 1984. Catches of young fish were always higher in the absence of a commercial fishery if initial catch conditions were low such as in 1994. Low to moderate harvest quotas could maintain moderate levels of young fish for the forecast length if initial model conditions were high. However, these quota levels for the 1984 - 2004 forecast length resulted in lower mean catches of spawning size fish as compared to the no commercial fishery regimen. The best case scenario for all response variables when initial catch conditions were low was under a no commercial harvest regimen. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|Fishing {{operations}} {{on any given}} stock rarely generate fishing mortality that is uniform across all ages and sizes. Population-selectivity refers to a scaled version of the age- or size-specific fishing mortality experienced by a fish population. Although {{it is common to}} apply a sigmoid logistic curve for the selectivity produced by many kinds of fishing gear, the general characteristics of population–selection curves have not been well examined. In this study, generalized additive models were fit to sets of selection coefficients taken from 15 recent stock assessments conducted using the virtual population analysis approach. The selection coefficients predicted by the models provided smoothed representations of the shapes and temporal dynamics of selectivity. Four broad types of selectivity were found: increasing, asymptotic, domed, and having a saddle. Four specific cases, each dominated by one type of selection curve, were examined in detail. For all 15 stocks, the population–selection curves were not stable through time but underwent changes in shape, which in some cases were quite radical. Temporal variation in population-selectivity has important implications for the conduct of fisheries modelling activities such as evaluating management strategies and <b>forecasting</b> <b>catch</b> and stock size.

40|$|The prawn (Nephrops norvegicus) {{are common}} around the Irish coast {{occurring}} in geographically distinct sandy/muddy areas were the sediment {{is suitable for}} them to construct their burrows. The Irish Nephrops fishery is extremely valuable with landings in recent years worth around € 30 m at first sale supporting an important indigenous processing industry. The Nephrops fishery “at {{the back of the}} Aran Islands” can be considered the mainstay of the Ros a Mhíl fleet. Without this Nephrops fishery the majority of vessels in the fleet would cease being economically viable (Meredith, 1999). Given these socio-economic realities, good scientific information on stock status to enable sustainable management of the resources are urgently required. This is the eight data point in a time series of UWTV surveys on the ‘Aran grounds’. The survey covers three distinct mud patches; the Aran Ground, Galway Bay and Slyne Head. These have approximate areas of 940, 41 and 26 sq. km respectively. In 2009 this survey was used to develop catch options for the stock using a bias corrected survey estimate as an absolute measure of stock size and recent discard rates and mean weight to <b>forecast</b> <b>catch</b> (ICES, 2009 a). This report details the results of the 2009 survey and updates the catch option table using the most recent survey estimate.
