6000|$|When {{first we}} had the honour to be {{presented}} to Sir Miles Warrington at the King's drawing-room, in St. James's Palace, I confess that I, for one--looking at his jolly round face, his broad round waistcoat, his hearty country manner,--expected that I had lighted upon a most eligible and agreeable acquaintance at last, {{and was about to}} become intimate with that noblest specimen of the human race, the bepraised of songs and men, the good old English country gentleman. In fact, to be a good old country gentleman is to hold a position nearest the gods, and at the summit of earthly felicity. To have a large unencumbered rent-roll, and the rents regularly paid by adoring farmers, who bless their stars at having such a landlord as his honour; to have no tenant holding back with his money, excepting just one, perhaps, who does so in order to give occasion to Good Old Country Gentleman to show his sublime charity and universal benevolence of soul; to hunt three days a week, love the sport of all things, and have perfect good health and good appetite in consequence; to have not only good appetite, but a good dinner; to sit down at church {{in the midst of a}} chorus of blessings from the villagers, the first man in the parish, the benefactor of the parish, with a consciousness of consummate desert, saying, [...] "Have mercy upon us, miserable sinners," [...] to be sure, but only for form's sake, because the words are written in the book, and to give other folks an example--a G. O. <b>C.</b> <b>G.</b> <b>a</b> miserable sinner! So healthy, so wealthy, so jolly, so much respected by the vicar, so much honoured by the tenants, so much beloved and admired by his family, amongst whom his story of grouse in the gunroom causes laughter from generation to generation;--this perfect being a miserable sinner! Allons donc! Give any man good health and temper, five thousand a year, the adoration of his parish, and the love and worship of his family, and I'll defy you to make him so heartily dissatisfied with his spiritual condition as to set himself down a miserable anything. If you were a Royal Highness, and went to church in the most perfect health and comfort, the parson waiting to begin the service until your R. H. came in, would you believe yourself to be a miserable, etc.? You might when racked with gout, in solitude, the fear of death before your eyes, the doctor having cut off your bottle of claret, and ordered arrowroot and a little sherry,--you might then be humiliated, and acknowledge your own shortcomings, and the vanity of things in general; but, in high health, sunshine, spirits, that word miserable is only a form. You can't think in your heart that you are to be pitied much for the present. If you are to be miserable, what is Colin Ploughman, with the ague, seven children, two pounds a year rent to pay for his cottage, and eight shillings a week? No: a healthy, rich, jolly, country gentleman, if miserable, has a very supportable misery: if a sinner, has very few people to tell him so.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{issue of}} whether {{patients}} diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer who harbor KRAS codon 13 mutations could benefit from the addition of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy remains under debate. The aim {{of the current study}} was to perform computational analysis to investigate the structural implications of the underlying mutations caused by <b>c.</b> 38 <b>G.</b> <b>A</b> (p. <b>G</b> 13 D) on protein conformation. Methods: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to understand the plausible structural and dynamical implications caused by <b>c.</b> 35 <b>G.</b> <b>A</b> (p. <b>G</b> 12 D) and <b>c.</b> 38 <b>G.</b> <b>A</b> (p. <b>G</b> 13 D). The potential of mean force (PMF) simulations were carried out to determine the free energy profiles of the binding processes of GTP interacting with wild-type (WT) KRAS and its mutants (MT). Results: Using MD simulations, we observed that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) increased as a function of time for the MT <b>c.</b> 35 <b>G.</b> <b>A</b> (p. <b>G</b> 12 D) and MT <b>c.</b> 38 <b>G.</b> <b>A</b> (p. <b>G</b> 13 D) when compared with the WT. We also observed that the GTP-binding pocket in the <b>c.</b> 35 <b>G.</b> <b>A</b> (p. <b>G</b> 12 D) mutant is more open than that of the WT and the <b>c.</b> 38 <b>G.</b> <b>A</b> (p. <b>G</b> 13 D) proteins. Intriguingly, the analysis of atomic fluctuations and free energy profiles revealed that the mutation of <b>c.</b> 35 <b>G.</b> <b>A</b> (p. <b>G</b> 12 D) may induce additional fluctuations in the sensitive sites (P-loop, switch I and II regions).

5000|$|Subtle {{laughter}} may {{be heard}} from the audience {{at the very beginning}} of Part I, in response to Jarrett's quoting of the melody of the signal bell which announces the beginning of an opera or concert to patrons at the Köln Opera House, the notes of which are G D <b>C</b> <b>G</b> <b>A.</b> Unlike the other parts of this concert, Part IIc, the encore, was based on a precomposed tune, the form and melody of which can be found in certain Real Book compilations as [...] "Memories of Tomorrow". This was and remains common practice for Jarrett. Note, for example, that his encores for performances in [...] (released on Solo Concerts: Bremen/Lausanne) and Tokyo (The Last Solo) are on the same vamp-based tune. He is also fond of closing his solo concerts with Tin Pan Alley standards, particularly [...] "Over the Rainbow".|$|E
5000|$|A capo (short for capotasto) is used {{to change}} the pitch of open strings. Capos are clipped onto the {{fretboard}} {{with the aid of}} spring tension, or in some models, elastic tension. To raise the guitar's pitch by one semitone, the player would clip the capo onto the fretboard just below the first fret. Its use allows players to play in different keys without having to change the chord formations they use. For example, if a folk guitar player wanted to play a song in the key of B Major, they could put a capo on the second fret of the instrument, and then play the song as if it were in the key of A Major, but with the capo the instrument would make the sounds of B Major. This is because with the capo barring the entire second fret, open chords would all sound two semitones (aka one tone) higher in pitch. For example, if a guitarist played an open A Major chord (a very common open chord), it would sound like a B Major chord. All of the other open chords would be similarly modified in pitch. Because of the ease with which they allow guitar players to change keys, they are sometimes referred to with pejorative names, such as [...] "cheaters" [...] or the [...] "hillbilly crutch". Despite this negative viewpoint, another benefit of the capo is that it enables guitarists to obtain the ringing, resonant sound of the common keys (<b>C,</b> <b>G,</b> <b>A,</b> etc.) in [...] "harder" [...] and less-commonly used keys. Classical performers are known to use them to enable modern instruments to match the pitch of historical instruments such as the Renaissance music lute.|$|E
