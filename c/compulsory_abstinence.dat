40|$|Schizophrenia {{accompanied}} by comorbid substance use disorder is common and can complicate treatment. For the patient long-term <b>compulsory</b> <b>abstinence</b> {{can be seen}} as an extremely serious measure. Nevertheless, the measure can be justified both ethically and juridically as part of integrated treatment for psychosis and substance use disorder. We describe a case in which long-term <b>compulsory</b> <b>abstinence</b> kept the patient out of danger, increased her psychiatric stability and strengthened her autonom...|$|E

40|$|Background Smoking is {{the leading}} cause of {{preventable}} death with recent figures indicating that over 13, 000 deaths each year in Scotland are attributable to smoking (ScotPHO 2012). Cigarette smoke is a known carcinogen causing a multitude of diseases not just for the smoker themselves but for those around them. In 2006 the Scottish Government responded to the high mortality rate by implementing new laws that strictly prohibit smoking inside any public premises to reduce exposure to second-hand smoke (Smoking, health and social care (Scotland) Act 2005). Hospitals are required to have smoke-free policies in place and in Scotland this year these laws are set to extend to encompass the entire grounds in addition to buildings, further restricting smokers. No research has been conducted in Scotland on what impact being resistant to smoke-free policies has on the individual, during a period of hospital-generated smoking abstinence. Aims This study would be conducted to identify if individuals who are resistant to a period of <b>compulsory</b> <b>abstinence</b> are represented in a population accessing elective orthopaedic services. Furthermore, how the stress levels of those resistant compare to the accepting group will be assessed, with the intention of determining if a relationship can be inferred between resistance to a period of <b>compulsory</b> <b>abstinence</b> and stress levels. Methods This is a prospective correlational survey study. It would utilise accidental and quota sampling methods to attain an achieved sample from an elective orthopaedic population in a large Edinburgh hospital. Data collection would be conducted using a series of questionnaires, the results of which would be statistically analysed using descriptive statistics. Further analysis by inferential statistics would be conducted using Analysis of variance statistical test. This seminal research would provide findings on the topic that has thus far not been studied in Scotland. The findings will establish if a relationship between resistance towards compulsory smoking abstinence exists and will be a platform for experimental research into the nature of this relationship. This will help develop a knowledge base in this area to inform nursing practice and policy...|$|E
40|$|New-type {{drugs are}} popular with {{adolescents}} and {{could lead to}} psychiatry disorders, but no medications have been proven to be effective for these disorders of new-type drug dependence. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tryptophan on sleeping disorders and mental symptoms in detoxified individuals with new-type drug dependence. This randomized, placebo controlled trial included 80 detoxified individuals with new-type drug dependence, recruited successively from a <b>Compulsory</b> Residential Drug <b>Abstinence</b> Institution in Wuhan, China, from April 2012 to November 2012. Eligible participants were randomly allocated {{to be treated with}} tryptophan (1000 mg/day, n= 40) or placebo (n= 40) for two weeks. The sleeping and mental symptoms were assessed using Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Symptom Check-List- 90 (SCL- 90) at baseline and two weeks. Results were analyzed according to the “intention-to-treat” approach. Forty-five participants completed the two-week study, 24 in the tryptophan group and 21 in the placebo group. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups and the treatment adherence was similar between groups. The reduction in the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) score in the tryptophan group was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (P= 0. 017). However, {{no significant differences were found}} in Symptom Check-List- 90 (SCL- 90) scores (either by individual dimension or the overall score) between groups (all P> 0. 05). The frequency of adverse events were similar and no serious adverse events were reported during the study. Tryptophan was unlikely to be effective for mental symptoms, but could alleviate sleep disorders in short term among detoxified individuals with new-type drug dependence. Future large scale trials are required to confirm findings from this study...|$|R
