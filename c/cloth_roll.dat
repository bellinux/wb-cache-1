One pair serves the two-story living room and the other serves the space with the dining room downstairs and the bedroom upstairs. Each pair creates a nearly uninterrupted expanse of glass reaching {{from the bottom of the}} house to the top. These windows cannot be opened. They are provided with <b>cloth</b> <b>roll</b> shades for protection against the sun.|$|E

The central figure appears to hold only a piece of <b>cloth,</b> <b>rolled</b> open on her lap, while the {{figure on the}} right holds a small dish in her right hand and a very hole-y sponge in her left hand. There seems to be a shawl spread out on her lap.|$|R

50|$|Hervé Fischer (born 1941, France) was {{a student}} of {{sociology}} and taught the sociology of communication and culture at the Sorbonne {{beginning in the early}} 1970s. Initially involved with “Support/Surface,” Fischer did a series of “Essuie-mains” paintings with handprints on <b>cloth</b> <b>rolls</b> as a means of deconstructing the medium of painting. He also began various campaigns, grouped under the title “Hygiene de l’art,” to eradicate art of traditional mores and media, and even invited artists to send him their works, which he tore up and displayed in small plastic bags (“La déchirure des oeuvres d’art”). Around 1974, his projects shifted away from the medium of painting toward more marginal and popular visual idioms, such as stamps and street signs, and into performances in the social realm.|$|R
60|$|It was a peeler, indeed, when I {{reached the}} deck. The ship {{was under a}} fore-course and a close-reefed main-top-sail, canvass that can be carried a long time, while running off; but which, I at once saw, was quite too much for us. An order was given immediately, {{to take in the}} top-sail. Notwithstanding the {{diminutive}} surface that was exposed, the surges given by this bit of canvass, as soon as the clews were eased off sufficiently to allow the cloth to jerk, shook the vessel's hull. It was a miracle that we saved the mast, or that we got the <b>cloth</b> <b>rolled</b> up at all. At one time, I thought it would be necessary to cut it from the yard. Fortunately the gale was steady, this day proving bright and clear, like that which had preceded.|$|R
60|$|They {{tore off}} two strips from the <b>cloths,</b> <b>rolled</b> them up, {{and put them}} in the prisoners' mouths, putting some {{lashings}} across so that they could not get them out; then they put the men so far apart in the boat that they could not touch each other, and lashed them in these positions. This done they again wrapped themselves in their women's garments, and quietly rowed to the shore. They had but little fear of finding anyone here. The natives, if no landing had been effected from the ships, would be all engaged in the work of plundering; while if the English had taken possession of the town they would probably be keeping in their houses. No one was near when they landed, and fastening the head-rope of the boat to a stone they pushed her gently off again.|$|R
5|$|In the 1st {{millennium}} BC, typical ancient Chinese writing {{materials were}} bronzewares, animal bones, and bamboo slips or wooden boards. By {{the beginning of}} the Han dynasty, the chief writing materials were clay tablets, silk <b>cloth,</b> and <b>rolled</b> scrolls made from bamboo strips sewn together with hempen string; these were passed through drilled holes and secured with clay stamps.|$|R
60|$|She was {{standing}} upon {{one of those}} high precipitous banks which, as we before noticed, overhung the road, so that she was placed considerably higher than Ellangowan, {{even though he was}} on horseback; and her tall figure, relieved against the clear blue sky, seemed almost of supernatural stature. We have noticed that there was in her general attire, or rather in her mode of adjusting it, somewhat of a foreign costume, artfully adopted perhaps for the purpose of adding to the effect of her spells and predictions, or perhaps from some traditional notions respecting the dress of her ancestors. On this occasion she had a large piece of red cotton <b>cloth</b> <b>rolled</b> about her head {{in the form of a}} turban, from beneath which her dark eyes flashed with uncommon lustre. Her long and tangled black hair fell in elf-locks from the folds of this singular head-gear. Her attitude was that of a sibyl in frenzy, and she stretched out in her right hand a sapling bough which seemed just pulled.|$|R

The main change was {{the addition of a}} [...] "regulation" [...] chasseur-style saddle <b>cloth</b> and <b>roll,</b> imperial green in color, piped red, with a red and white fringe. The saddle and harness remained Arabic in style. The undress uniform was as for the Chasseurs-à-Cheval of the Guard, but of a dark blue cloth.|$|R

The jigsaw puzzle is {{constructed}} on a green cloth that has a coarse texture to which cardboard jigsaw pieces adhere. The non assembled pieces are also kept on the cloth. When the puzzle needs to be cleared away the entire <b>cloth</b> is <b>rolled</b> around a drum thus keeping both the assembled and non-assembled pieces trapped in position until the cloth is unrolled again.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} writing mediums found in archaeological digs from ancient sites predating the Han period are shells and bones {{as well as}} bronzewares. In the {{beginning}} of the Han period, the chief writing mediums were bamboo (Chinese: 竹簡) and clay tablets, silk <b>cloth,</b> and <b>rolled</b> scrolls made of strips of bamboo sewn together with hempen string passed through drilled holes (册) and secured with clay stamps. The written characters on these narrow flat strips of bamboo were arranged into vertical columns.|$|R
50|$|The magician {{places a}} large metal ball {{on a small}} {{pedestal}} on a table. The ball is then covered with a large silk cloth which the magician holds above the ball. The ball then begins to lift {{into the air and}} move about under the cloth, before appearing out from under <b>cloth</b> to <b>roll</b> along the upper edge of the stretched-out cloth, or along the magician's arms. The ball may also disappear and re-appear as it moves about. The ball is finally coaxed to return to its pedestal and the cloth is removed.|$|R
50|$|When {{some of the}} Queen's escorts {{decided to}} return home, King Suro gave each of them thirty <b>rolls</b> of hempen <b>cloth</b> (one <b>roll</b> was of 40 yards). He also gave each person ten bags of rice for the return voyage. A part of the Queen's {{original}} convoy, including the two courtiers and their wives, stayed back with her. The queen was given a residence in the inner palace, while the two courtiers and their wives were given separate residences. The rest of her convoy were given a guest house of twenty rooms.|$|R
40|$|Creativity is {{innately}} {{brought with}} secret power which can emerge {{at any time}} throughout life and be enhanced if fostered. Properly designed art activities serve as a potential for emergence and the enhancement of children’s creativities in their early childhood educations. Those children who cannot express their emotions through oral language or other activities are provided with such an opportunity to express themselves and reflect their thoughts, emotions and views on daily experiences. Art experiences foster creative thinking by stimulating imagination. There are {{a great variety of}} techniques to be used in art activities, and a lot of various materials and equipments are available. One of the options for material selection is that of waste materials which help children attain new experiences and ideas. Waste materials include boxes, plastic bottles, pieces of <b>cloth,</b> <b>rolls</b> of paper towels, reels, beads, nutshells, tree shells and leaves with different shapes and sizes. Another advantage of using waste materials is that children learn how to recycle these materials while they gain a sense of texture, shape, weight, wideness and space. Furthermore, this kind of an activity fosters creative thinking and enhances visual and tactual perceptions while the children create unique things. In this study, the status and the importance of the use of waste materials in art activities mentioned in early childhood programs including the points to be born in mind while preparing and using such materials will be discusse...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{important}} {{problem in the}} last phase of manufacturing in the textile industry. This involves cutting large lengths of fabric into smaller pieces, which are then wrapped around rolls. The quality of <b>cloth</b> <b>rolls</b> transported to the customer is specified {{by the quality of}} fabric pieces that make up the roll. A piece of fabric falls within a given quality category if some of its characteristics, such as, piece length, the number of critical defects per metre, and the defective score per metre, are compatible with the corresponding quality specifications. Naturally, the selling price per metre of fabric is proportional to the quality category. Thus, it becomes necessary to determine an optimal cutting strategy of very long woven fabric (e. g. 2000 m) into smaller pieces (e. g. each 130 m long at most), which involves a difficult continuous assignment problem of identifying the optimal cutting: locations of pieces overlapping with defects of known lengths and locations. Not only must the scrap be minimized but the overall profit per metre fabric should be maximized. The two objectives may not always support each other due to relative unit selling prices of various quality categories. The solution to this problem has an immediate impact on company profit. The mathematical formulation of the problem involves numerous binary variables as well as continuous variables. A Mutative Simulated Annealing approach is proposed here to solve this problem. The solution technique is tested both on real data obtained from a textile manufacturer and hypothetical data. Results are compared against upper bounds calculated for each objective defined, as well as with a sequential heuristic designed for this problem...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{important}} find was a fist-sized ceramic cylinder seal, likely used to print <b>cloth.</b> When <b>rolled</b> out, the seal shows two speech scrolls emanating from a bird, followed directly {{by a number}} of design elements enframing what has been interpreted as logograms for “king (sideways U shape),” [...] "3 (three dots, according to the Mesoamerican bar and dots numbering system),” and “Ajaw (from the sacred 260-day calendar)", a designation used for both a calendar date and, in keeping with Mesoamerican custom, the name of an Olmec ruler.In addition to the ceramic cylinder seal, two fingernail-sized fragments from a greenstone plaque have been recovered, each containing an incised glyph. Both these glyphs have been linked to well-documented glyphs in other Mesoamerican writing systems, including the Isthmian and Maya scripts.|$|R

6000|$|I {{opened the}} bundle. Everything was there. Not even a match was missing. I shared {{the makings of}} a {{cigarette}} with my cell-mate. When I started to strike a match for a light, he stopped me. A flimsy, dirty comforter lay in each of our bunks for bedding. He tore off a narrow strip of the thin <b>cloth</b> and <b>rolled</b> it tightly and telescopically into a long and slender cylinder. This he lighted with a precious match. The cylinder of tight-rolled cotton cloth did not flame. On the end a coal of fire slowly smouldered. It would last for hours, and my cell-mate called it a [...] "punk." [...] And when it burned short, all that was necessary was to make a new punk, put the end of it against the old, blow on them, and so transfer the glowing coal. Why, we could have given Prometheus pointers on the conserving of fire.|$|R
40|$|A linen cloth {{popularly known}} as the “Holy Face ” or “Holy Sudarium ” has been {{preserved}} in the Cathedral of Oviedo since the ninth century. According to tradition, this linen cloth covered the head of Jesus after the Crucifixion. It was taken to Spain in a chest of relics to escape destruction during the Persian invasion of Jerusalem {{at the beginning of}} the seventh century. Until the scientific investigations conducted in the last 25 years by the Spanish Center for Sindonology, based in Valencia, Spain, very little was known about this cloth and how it may have been used. Saint John mentions the sudarium of Christ when he describes what he and Saint Peter saw in the empty sepulcher where they had buried Jesus on Friday evening: “When Simon Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there, and the cloth (sudarium) that had covered his head, not with the burial <b>cloths</b> but <b>rolled</b> up in a separate place ” (John 20 : 6 - 7). Since 1988, scientists have sought to answer the following questions: Is the Sudarium of Oviedo the cloth mentioned in the Gospel of Saint John, and is this cloth related forensically with the Shroud of Turin...|$|R

40|$|A {{translation}} lattice {{packing of}} k polygons P 1; P 2; P 3; : : :; P k is a (non-overlapping) packing of the k polygons {{which can be}} replicated without overlap at each point of a lattice i 0 v 0 + i 1 v 1, where v 0 and v 1 are vectors generating the lattice and i 0 and i 1 range over all integers. A densest translational lattice packing is one which minimizes the area jv 0 v 1 j of the fundamental parallelogram. An algorithm and implementation is given for densest translation lattice packing. This algorithm has useful applications in industry, particularly clothing manufacture. 1 Introduction A number of industries generate new parts by cutting them from stock material: cloth, leather (hides), sheet metal, glass, etc. These industries need to generate dense non-overlapping layouts of polygonal shapes.

5000|$|Before this, a [...] "cartridge" [...] {{was simply}} a premeasured {{quantity}} of gunpowder together with a ball in a small <b>cloth</b> bag (or <b>rolled</b> paper cylinder), which also acted as wadding for the charge and ball. This early form of cartridge had to be rammed into the muzzleloader's barrel, and either a small charge of gunpowder in the touch hole or an external percussion cap mounted on the touch hole ignited the gunpowder in the cartridge. Cartridges with built-in percussion caps (called [...] "primers") continue to this day to be the standard in firearms. In cartridge-firing firearms, a hammer (or a firing pin struck by the hammer) strikes the cartridge primer, which then ignites the gunpowder within. The primer charge is {{at the base of}} the cartridge, either within the rim (a [...] "rimfire" [...] cartridge) or in a small percussion cap embedded in the center of the base (a [...] "centerfire" [...] cartridge). As a rule, centerfire cartridges are more powerful than rimfire cartridges, operating at considerably higher pressures than rimfire cartridges. Centerfire cartridges are also safer, as a dropped rimfire cartridge has the potential to discharge if its rim strikes the ground with sufficient force to ignite the primer. This is practically impossible with most centerfire cartridges.|$|R
