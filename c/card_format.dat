The Yankees won twice, in 1999 and 2003; while the Red Sox won in 2004. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won).|$|E

In 2001, SmartMedia had achieved nearly 50% use, but, by 2005, SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and SmartMedia's share had plummeted by 2007.|$|E
25|$|The initial MyKad was {{a contact}} card {{solution}} developed and manufactured by IRIS Corporation. Made of PC with the dimensions in the ISO/IEC 7816 ID-1 format (standard credit <b>card</b> <b>format),</b> the initial card had a 32kb EEPROM (Electronically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) embedded chip running on M-COS (MyKad Chip Operating System). In November 2002, the capacity was increased to 64kb.|$|E
25|$|In April 2012, Panasonic {{introduced}} MicroP2 <b>card</b> <b>format</b> {{for professional}} video applications. The cards are essentially full-size SDHC or SDXC UHS-II cards, rated at UHS Speed Class U1. An adapter allows MicroP2 cards {{to work in}} current P2 card equipment. Panasonic MicroP2 cards shipped in March 2013 and were the first UHS-II compliant products on market; initial offer includes a 32GB SDHC card and a 64GB SDXC card.|$|E
50|$|CompactFlash {{became the}} most {{successful}} of the early memory <b>card</b> <b>formats,</b> surpassing Miniature <b>Card</b> and SmartMedia. Subsequent formats, such as MMC/SD, various Memory Stick <b>formats,</b> and xD-Picture <b>Card</b> offered stiff competition. Most of these cards are smaller than CompactFlash while offering comparable capacity and speed. Proprietary memory <b>card</b> <b>formats</b> for use in professional audio and video, such as P2 and SxS, are faster, but physically larger and more costly.|$|R
50|$|NOR-based flash has lower density than newer NAND-based systems, and CompactFlash is {{therefore}} the physically {{largest of the}} three memory <b>card</b> <b>formats</b> introduced in the early 1990s, being derived from the JEIDA/PCMCIA Memory <b>Card</b> <b>formats.</b> The other two are Miniature Card (MiniCard) and SmartMedia (SSFDC). However, CF did switch to NAND type memory later. The IBM Microdrive format, later made by Hitachi, implements the CF Type II interface, but is a hard disk drive (HDD) as opposed to solid-state memory. Seagate also made CF HDDs.|$|R
