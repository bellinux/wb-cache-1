40|$|In 1994, the new {{democratic}} South African government realised the magnitude of its service delivery problem and the urgency with which it needed to solve it. Emphasis was placed on better life for all. The local government, with regard to ensuring better life all, has since adopted the Batho-Pele principles and incorporated them into <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> to deliver {{a better life for}} all. However, recent service delivery reports in the Daily Dispatch and its sister publication Go & Express as well as service delivery protests across the country (including BCM) indicate all is not well. Many hypothesises have been raised as to why municipalities continue to under-perform. However, beyond these hypothesises is <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> management, and its constituents of customer service, complaint management and <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> activities. <b>Customer</b> <b>care</b> in the public sector has long been seen as the work of front-line staff. Others believe it is irrelevant in the public service due to the non-competitive nature of public service. Batho-Pele principles, since its inception in the public sector in South Africa, have been drummed up to put people first. Weary citizens see it differently and this has not escaped Buffalo City Municipality (BCM). BCM, one of the pioneers in the South African local government to have initiated <b>customer</b> <b>care,</b> admits there is institutional inefficiency. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effectiveness of <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> management at BCM. In doing so; the study has narrowed the study to: describing the practice of <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> management in the public sector (BCM included), establishing the components that constitute an integrated <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> management programme at BCM, investigating and describing the conceptual understanding of <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> management at BCM, and exploring and describing the role vision and values statements play in rendering a successful <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> programme at local government level with BCM as the focal point...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{automatic}} analysis of conversations between a customer and an agent in a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> of a <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> service. The purpose of the analysis is to hypothesize themes about problems and complaints discussed in the conversation. Themes are defined by the application documentation topics. A conversation may contain mentions that are irrelevant for the application purpose and multiple themes whose mentions may be interleaved portions of a conversation that cannot be well defined. Two methods are proposed for multiple theme hypothesization. One of them {{is based on a}} cosine similarity measure using a bag of features extracted from the entire conversation. The other method introduces the concept of thematic density distributed around specific word positions in a conversation. In addition to automatically selected words, word bi-grams with possible gaps between successive words are also considered and selected. Experimental results show that the results obtained with the proposed methods outperform the results obtained with support vector machines on the same data. Furthermore, using the theme skeleton of a conversation from which thematic densities are derived, {{it will be possible to}} extract components of an automatic conversation report to be used for improving the service performance.

To accomplish this, firstly, the direct relationship between the individual independent variables was tested and secondly, the indirect relationship between service quality and customer loyalty via customer satisfaction was tested. A combination of simple and multiple regression analysis was applied to test the hypothesised relationships. The results show that employee attributes and <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> key service factors significantly impact customer satisfaction and that <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>customers</b> prioritise service quality dimensions differently.

This research paper investigates how the strategic application of knowledge management within the <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>customer</b> interface, through the support of senior management, can improve service delivery within Johannesburg Water. One-on-one interviews were conducted with selected <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> team leaders, and management from the <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> and the Operations department. Primary data was also extracted from the company‟s information management system (IMS). The Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) were observed within their work environment. Appendix A describes an example of the <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>customer</b> service interface when a customer calls to log a complaint with Johannesburg Water, a Municipal Owned Entity (MOE). Knowledge management when applied as part of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) strategy may be helpful in improving service delivery. <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> management has to invest in its people component of Knowledge Management (KM) strategy in order to have effective processes and effective technologies. Research conducted may be applicable and adapted to other public sector <b>Call</b> <b>Centres.</b> The study conducted indicates that senior management should focus on strengthening the “people” component of KM in order to achieve effective service delivery.

40|$|Summary Much {{has been}} written about the {{negative}} emotional experiences of customer service representatives (CSRs) within large Anglo-Saxon <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> and very little is known about the potential positive emotions involved in this form of employment. Our research, which is based on a case study of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> CSRs within one small-to-medium sized enterprise (SME) in the Greek telecommunications sector, challenges the 'vocal sweatshop' image and constructs a different type of story about <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> We explore the nature of emotion management in this workplace by looking at the context and control of emotional performances and the conditions that would guide positive work feelings. The findings illustrate the ways in which supportiveness, caring and nurturance intertwine to form a 'humane' and 'understanding' workplace. They indicate a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> environment where work feelings are expressed as philanthropic emotions and emerge from the reciprocal social exchange in the workplace. This paper emphasises the positive side of emotion management and suggests that emotions in this study identify with work feelings rather than emotional labour.

When this occurred, simple and timely service routines appeared to follow, which equated to higher quality service and better customer satisfaction. On the other hand, when this did not occur frontline employees were often forced to unwillingly deliver poor service to customers.

30|$|The {{outsourced}} <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> {{industry in}} India and the Philippines considers excellent English language communication {{skills to be}} its core commodity for business success. This is because the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>customer</b> services representatives (CSRs) have to meet high quality communication and business targets when serving Western English speaking customers from around the world. Recruiting, training, appraising and coaching for excellent levels of English in this industry therefore require assessment tools and processes to fit the business requirements and demonstrate impact. Unfortunately {{only a small percentage}} of applicants gain employment in this industry (see The Business Processing Association of the Philippines BPAP Report 2006) due to inappropriate ‘gate-keeping’ entry assessment practices (see Lockwood, 2012). However, the industry invests heavily in training and coaching their CRSs who are meticulously tracked for communication ‘performance’ on the phones on a regular basis. The work of the CSRs involves the delicate balancing of profiling the customer, understanding the request, managing the multiple screens locating product and customer information, and responding professionally and politely within average handling time (AHT) limits. Quality assurance processes are key to the success of the company and these quality measures are used as an important measure in contractual and pricing agreements; they are therefore scrutinized closely and regularly by on-shore management. It is therefore not surprising that being able to measure this highly specialized form of spoken performance validly and reliably has emerged as a significant business imperative in these <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b>|$|R
