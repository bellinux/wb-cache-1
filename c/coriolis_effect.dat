5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect,</b> or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{experimental}} and theoretical works have been addressing {{various aspects of the}} viscous fingering formation in rotating Hele-Shaw cells. However, only a few of them consider the influence of Coriolis forces. The studies including <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> are mostly restricted to the high-viscosity-contrast limit and rely on either purely linear stability analyses or intensive numerical simulations. We approach the problem analytically and use a modified Darcy's law including the exact form of the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> to execute a mode-coupling analysis of the system. By imposing no restrictions on the viscosity contrast A (dimensionless viscosity difference) we go beyond linear stages and examine the onset of nonlinearities. Our results indicate that when <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> are taken into account, an interesting interplay between the Reynolds number Re and A arises. This leads to important changes in the stability and morphological features of the emerging interfacial patterns. We contrast our mode-coupling approach with previous theoretical models proposed in the literature. Copyright 2007 The American Physical Society...|$|R
25|$|Because the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> are neglected, antitriptic flow occurs either {{near the}} equator (irrespective of the motion's lengthscale) or {{elsewhere}} whenever the Ekman {{number of the}} flow is large (normally for small-scale processes), as opposed to geostrophic flows.|$|R
5|$|In general, {{winds are}} strongest {{immediately}} under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect</b> and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E

5|$|The {{motion of}} the fluid is {{sustained}} by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards {{the center of the}} Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect,</b> caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.|$|E
5|$|The polar easterlies, {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold {{prevailing}} winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the equator, {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the equator, and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south. Because the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect</b> initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the equator, where the effect is weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Short-radius {{centrifugation}} {{offers a}} promising and affordable countermeasure to {{the adverse effects}} of prolonged weightlessness. However, head movements made in a fast rotating environment elicit <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects,</b> which seriously compromise sensory and motor processes. We found that participants can adapt to these <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> when exposed intermittently to high rotation rates and, at the same time, can maintain their perceptual-motor coordination in stationary environments. In this paper, we explore the role of inter-sensory conflict in this adaptation process. Different measures (vertical nystagmus, illusory body tilt, motion sickness) react differently to visual-vestibular conflict and adapt differently. In particular, proprioceptive-vestibular conflict sufficed to adapt subjective parameters and the time constant of nystagmus decay, while retinal slip was required for VOR gain adaptation. A simple correlation between the strength of intersensory conflict and the efficacy of adaptation fails to explain the data. Implications of these findings, which differ from existing data for low rotation rates, are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect).</b>|$|E
5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect,</b> except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (<b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect).</b> Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E

5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and <b>coriolis</b> <b>effect.</b> The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect</b> will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect.</b> The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the in-plane free vibration analysis of rotating beams using an exact dynamic stiffness method. The analysis includes the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> {{in the free}} vibratory motion {{as well as the}} effects of an arbitrary hub radius and an outboard force. The investigation focuses on the formulation of the frequency dependent dynamic stiffness matrix to perform exact modal analysis of rotating beams or beam assemblies. The governing differential equations of motion, derived from Hamilton's principle, are solved using the Frobenius method. Natural boundary conditions resulting from the Hamiltonian formulation enable expressions for nodal forces to be obtained in terms of arbitrary constants. The dynamic stiffness matrix is developed by relating the amplitudes of the nodal forces to those of the corresponding responses, thereby eliminating the arbitrary constants. Then the natural frequencies and mode shapes follow from the application of the Wittrick–Williams algorithm.

40|$|International audiencehis {{paper is}} aimed towards {{investigating}} the filtration law of an incompressible viscous Newtonian fluid through a rigid non-inertial porous medium (e. g. a porous medium {{placed in a}} centrifuge basket). The filtration law is obtained by upscaling the flow equations at the pore scale. The upscaling technique is the homogenization method of multiple scale expansions which rigorously gives the macroscopic behaviour and the effective properties without any prerequisite on {{the form of the}} macroscopic equations. The derived filtration law is similar to Darcy's law, but the tensor of permeability presents the following remarkable properties: it depends upon the angular velocity of the porous matrix, it verifies Hall-Onsager's relationship and it is a non-symmetric tensor. We thus deduce that, under rotation, an isotropic porous medium leads to a non-isotropic effective permeability. In this paper, we present the results of numerical simulations of the flow through rotating porous media. This allows us to highlight the deviations of the flow due to <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> at both the microscopic scale (i. e. the pore scale), and the macroscopic scale (i. e. the sample scale). The above results confirm that for an isotropic medium, phenomenological laws already proposed in the literature fails at reproducing three-dimensional <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> in all types of pores geometry. We show that <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> may lead to significant variations of the permeability measured during centrifuge tests when the inverse Ekman number Ek(- 1) is 0 (1). These variations are estimated to be less than 5 % if Ek(- 1) < 0. 2, which is the case of classical geotechnical centrifuge tests.

We first consider a noninteracting gas and show that the competition between the effects of Rashba coupling on the local density of single-particle states and the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> caused by rotation gives rise to a characteristic ring-shaped density profile that survives at experimentally accessible temperatures. Furthermore, Rashba splitting of the Landau levels gives the density profiles a ziggurat shape in the rapid-rotation limit. We then consider an interacting gas under the BCS mean-field approximation for local pairing, and study the pair-breaking mechanism that is induced by the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> on superfluidity, where we calculate the critical rotation frequencies both for the onset of pair breaking and for the complete destruction of superfluidity in the system. In particular, by comparing the results of a fully-quantum-mechanical Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach with those of a semiclassical local-density approximation, we construct extensive phase diagrams for a wide range of parameter regimes in the trap where the aforementioned competition may, e. g., favor an outer normal edge that is completely phase separated from the central superfluid core by vacuum...|$|R
