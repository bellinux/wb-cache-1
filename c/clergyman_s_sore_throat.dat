Materials and method: This double blind clinical trial was performed on 120, ASA-I and II, patients undergoing elective surgery for herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia. Patients in group 1 were gargled 40 mg ketamine in 30 mg saline and in group 2, only 30 ml saline. For third group we did not do any intervention. Postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> was graded at 0, 2, 4 and 24 h after operation on Verbal Analogue Scale (0 - 4).

40|$|ABSTRACT Postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> is {{a common}} {{complication}} after endotracheal intubation. After tracheal intubation, the incidence of <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> varies from 14. 4 % to 50 %. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare between benzydamine hydrochloride gel, lidocaine 5 % gel and lidocaine 10 % spray on the endotracheal tube cuff as regards postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> The present study was carried out on 124 patients admitted to Alexandria university hospitals for lumbar fixation surgery requiring general anesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated into 4 groups. Benzydamine hydrochloride gel, 5 % lidocaine hydrochloride gel, 10 % lidocaine hydrochloride spray, or normal saline were applied on endotracheal tube cuffs before endotracheal intubation. The patients were examined for <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> (none, mild, moderate, or severe) at 0, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after extubation. The results were collected, analyzed and presented in table and figure. The highest incidence of postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> occurred at 6 h after extubation in all groups. There was a significantly lower incidence of postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> in the benzydamine group than 5 % lidocaine gel, 10 % lidocaine spray, and normal saline groups. The benzydamine group had significantly decreased severity of postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> compared with the 10 % lidocaine, 5 % lidocaine, and normal saline groups at observation time point. Compared with the 5 % lidocaine the 10 % lidocaine group had significantly increased incidence and severity of postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> after extubation. Compared with normal saline the 10 % lidocaine group had increased incidence of postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> There were no significant differences among groups in local or systemic side effects. So in conclusion, benzydamine hydrochloride gel on the endotracheal tube cuff is a simple and effective method to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> Application of 10 % lidocaine spray should be avoided because of worsening of postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> where incidence increased but not the severity in relation to 5 % lidocaine gel. Applying 5 % lidocaine on the endotracheal tube cuff does not prevent postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> but its application is better than lidocaine 10 % spray or saline...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the predictors of general practitioner (GP) consultation and antibiotic use in those developing <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> METHODS: We conducted a prospective population-based cohort study on 4461 participants in two rounds (2010 - 11) from 1897 households. RESULTS: Participants reported 2193 <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> illnesses, giving a community <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> incidence of 1. 57 / person-year. 13 % of <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> illnesses {{led to a}} GP consultation and 56 % of these consultations led to antibiotic use. Participants {{most likely to have}} <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> included women and children (e. g. school compared with retirement age); adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) of 1. 33 and 1. 52, respectively. Participants with <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> were more likely to consult their GP if they were preschool compared with retirement age [adjusted OR (aOR) 3. 22], had more days of <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> (aOR 1. 11), reported more severe pain (aOR 4. 24) or reported fever (aOR 3. 82). Antibiotics were more often used by chronically ill individuals (aOR 1. 78), those reporting severe pain (aOR 4. 14), those reporting fever (aOR 2. 58) or children with earache (aOR 1. 85).

These microgranules are a possible alternative treatment for patients with <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Design and setting: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study conducted at eight primary care sites in Australia. Method: Participants with <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> of onset within the past 4 days received either flurbiprofen 8. 75 mg microgranules or non-medicated placebo microgranules. Throat soreness, difficulty in swallowing, <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> pain intensity, <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> relief, oral temperature, and treatment benefits were all assessed at regular intervals. Results: Of 373 patients from eight centres, 186 received flurbiprofen 8. 75 mg microgranules and 187 received placebo microgranules (intent-to-treat population). Throat soreness was significantly reduced over the first 2 hours after the first dose.

DESIGN: Randomised trial of three approaches to sore throat: a 10 day prescription of antibiotics, no antibiotics, or a delayed prescription if the <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> had not started to settle after three days. PATIENTS: 716 patients aged 4 and over with <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> and an abnormal physical sign: 84 % had tonsillitis or pharyngitis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number {{and rate of}} patients making a first return with <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> pharyngitis, or tonsillitis. Early returns (within two weeks) and complications (otitis media, sinusitis, quinsy). Outcomes were documented in 675 subjects (94 %).

More of those initially prescribed antibiotics initially returned to the surgery with <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> (38 % v 27 %, adjusted hazard ratio for return 1. 39 %, 95 % confidence interval 1. 03 to 1. 89). Antibiotics prescribed for <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> {{during the previous year}} had an additional effect (hazard ratio 1. 69, 1. 20 to 2. 37). Longer duration of illness (> 5 days) was associated with increased return within six weeks (hazard ratio 2. 90, 1. 70 to 4. 92).

40|$|AbstractThe European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases {{established}} the <b>Sore</b> <b>Throat</b> Guideline Group {{to write an}} updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test {{can be helpful in}} targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e. g. 3 – 4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> symptoms.

Almost all the patients had recovered by day 8. A high correlation was found between sickness and <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> These data will assist clinicians and others promoting self-care to set realistic expectations regarding recovery from URTI in young adults...|$|R

A number of other releases followed, including the Soar Throat EP, the And We Dont Care compilation and the Poison Idea / No Handle Beer demo (featuring two Poison Idea covers and one original track), but <b>Sore</b> <b>Throat</b> disbanded in 1990 due to internal conflicts.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> is {{a common}} {{complaint}} in patients with endotracheal intubation and has potentially dangerous complications. This randomized controlled trial study investigated the incidence of postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> after general anesthesia when betamethasone gel is applied to a tracheal tube compared with when IV dexamethasone is prescribed.   Materials and Methods: Two hundred and twenty five American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) -class I and II patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery with tracheal intubation were randomly divided into three groups: betamethasone gel, intravenous (IV) dexamethasone, and control groups. In the post-anesthesia care unit, a blinded anesthesiologist interviewed all patients regarding postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> at 1, 6, and 24 hours after surgery.   Results: The incidence of <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> was significantly lower in the betamethasone gel group compared with the IV dexamethasone and control groups, 1, 6, and 24 hours after surgery. In the first day after surgery 10. 7 % of the betamethasone group had <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> whereas 26. 7 % of the IV dexamethasone group and 30. 7 % of the control group had <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> Bucking before extubation was observed in 14 (18. 4 %), 8 (10. 4 %), and 9 (12. 2 %) patients, in the IV dexamethasone, betamethasone gel, and control group, respectively.   Conclusion:  We concluded that wide spread application of betamethasone gel over tracheal tubes effectively mitigates postoperative <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> compared with IV dexamethasone application...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Sore</b> <b>throat</b> is {{a common}} {{condition}} associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection, and recurrent episodes of infection may result in chronic tonsillitis. The current UK and USA guidelines for tonsillectomy use the incidence of <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> episodes as an indication for surgery. However, the mechanism of <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> is poorly described in the literature. Objectives: This review will provide basic information for the clinician regarding: the causes, pathophysiology and neurophysiology of sore throat; the mechanism of inflammation; {{and the role of}} transient receptor potential ion channels as nociceptors involved in <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> The review will present new ideas on the mechanism of ice therapy as an analgesic for post-tonsillectomy pain, and the role of vanilloid and cold receptors...|$|R
