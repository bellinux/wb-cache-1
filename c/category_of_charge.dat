40|$|The {{portable}} {{capillary electrophoresis}} instrument is automated and features three independent channels with different background electrolytes {{to allow the}} concurrent optimized determination <b>of</b> three different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> analytes. The fluidic system {{is based on a}} miniature manifold which is based on mechanically milled channels for injection of samples and buffers. The planar manifold pattern was designed to minimize the number of electronic valves required for each channel. The system utilizes pneumatic pressurization to transport solutions at the grounded as well as the high voltage side of the separation capillaries. The instrument has a compact design, with all components arranged in a briefcase with dimensions of 45 (w) x 35 (d) x 15 cm (h) and a weight of about 15 kg. It can operate continuously for 8 h in the battery-powered mode if only one electrophoresis channel is in use, or for about 2. 5 h in the case of simultaneous employment of all three channels. The different operations, i. e. capillary flushing, rinsing of the interfaces at both capillary ends, sample injection and electrophoretic separation, are activated automatically with a control program featuring a graphical user interface. For demonstration, the system was employed successfully for the concurrent separation of different inorganic cations and anions, organic preservatives, additives and artificial sweeteners in various beverage and food matrices...|$|R

30|$|We {{note that}} the {{successful}} <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> both quartz (Daly et al., 2013) and olivine in this study means that we have charged minerals from the two broad <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> mineral surface <b>charging</b> behavior, as discussed in Kosmulski (2001). Since minerals from both <b>of</b> these surface <b>charging</b> <b>categories</b> have been charged by electrospray, {{it should be possible}} to use electrospray to charge most minerals. Likewise, successful electrospray <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> ordinary chondrites, which are aggregates of minerals, suggests that other multi-phase materials should also be charged. A third advantage <b>of</b> electrospray <b>charging</b> is that it can <b>charge</b> ices <b>of</b> variable composition. Although this study used a mixture of methanol and water for the solvent, other solvent combinations are possible, and using a new solvent is very easy. Thus, electrospray charging facilitates experiments with ices whose composition can be easily controlled and varied.|$|R

40|$|Potential-dependent {{inhibition}} <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> movement components by nifedipine was {{studied in}} intact, voltage-clamped, frog skeletal muscle fibers. Available charge was reduced by small shifts in holding potential (from - 100 mV to - 70 mV) in 2 microM nifedipine, without {{changes in the}} capacitance deduced from control (- 120 mV to - 100 mV) voltage steps made at a fully polarized (- 100 mV) holding potential. These voltage-dependent effects did not occur in lower (0 - 0. 5 microM) nifedipine concentrations. The voltage dependence of membrane capacitance at higher (10 microM) nifedipine concentrations was reduced even in fully polarized fibers, but shifting the holding voltage produced no further block. Voltage-dependent inhibition by nifedipine {{was associated with a}} fall in available charge, and a reduction in the charge and capacitance-voltage relationships and of late (q gamma) charging transients. It thus separated a membrane-capacitance with a distinct and steep steady-state voltage dependence. Tetracaine (2 mM) reduced voltage-dependent membrane capacitance and nonlinear charge more than did nifedipine. However, nifedipine did not exert voltage- dependent effects on charging currents, membrane capacitance, or inactivation of tetracaine-resistant (q beta) charge. This excludes participation of q beta, or the membrane charge as a whole, from the voltage-dependent effects of nifedipine. Rather, the findings suggest that the charge susceptible to potential-dependent block by nifedipine falls within the tetracaine-sensitive (q gamma) <b>category</b> <b>of</b> intramembrane <b>charge...</b>|$|R

40|$|Designed {{as closely}} related to patria potestas, {{guardianship}} was formally understood as an aspect of potestas and a right exercised {{in the interest of}} the protected person until she or he reached puberty. Starting from the Principate, the initial approach to guardianship and to the role of the guardian starts to change. Guardianship potestas tended to shift into a guardianship similar to a charge (munus). Imperial policy then tended to harmonize the three types of guardianship following the model of the guardianship by magisterial appointment, in other words the idea was to coerce the guardian and in particular the testamentary guardian into making difficult for him to avoid the burden, accepting it and managing it efficiently. The purpose of this paper is not to analyse Marcus Aurelius’ generalisation (followed through by successive emperors) of the system of excuses, extended it to all types of guardianship, and forcing guardians to accept the office. This contribution rather focuses on the search for the correct balance between the wards’ interests and the guardians’ capacity to carry out his mandate effectively and efficiently. This is what we can deduct from a study of the rich casuistic dealing with the excuse grounds and from the shift of guardianship towards the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> civilian <b>charges...</b>|$|R

40|$|Both cyclic-voltammetry-based and impedance-based {{experimental}} {{criteria that}} have been developed recently for the oscillatory electrochemical systems are critically appraised with two typical <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> oscillators. Consistent conclusions can be drawn by the two criteria for the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> oscillators that involve the coupling <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transfer mainly with surface steps (e. g. ad- and desorption) such as in the electrooxidation of C, organic molecules. Whereas, impedance-based criterion is not applicable to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> oscillators that involve the coupling <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transfer mainly with mass transfer (e. g. diffusion and convection) such as in the Fe(CN) (6) (3 -) reduction accompanying periodic hydrogen evolution. The mason is that the negative impedance cannot include the feedback information of convection mass transfer induced by the hydrogen evolution. However, both positive and negative nonlinear feedbacks, i. e., the diffusion-limited depletion and convection-enhanced replenishment of the Fe(CN) (6) (3 -) surface concentration, that coexist between the bistability, i. e., Fe(CN) (6) (3 -) reduction With and without hydrogen evolution at lower and higher potential sides respectively, are all reflected in the crossed cyclic voltammogram (CCV).
