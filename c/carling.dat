5|$|The Premier League {{was formed}} in 1992, when {{the members of the}} First Division {{resigned}} from The Football League. These clubs set up a new commercially independent league that negotiated its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The inaugural season had no sponsor until <b>Carling</b> agreed to a four-year deal for £12million that started the following season. <b>Carling</b> introduced new Manager of the Month and Manager of the Season awards for the 1993–94 season, supplementing the existing Football Writers' Association and Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year awards. The first Manager of the Month was awarded to Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson for his achievements in August 1993. The following season, <b>Carling</b> introduced a Player of the Month award, which is presented alongside the Manager of the Month award.|$|E

5|$|Hodgsen sold to <b>Carling</b> O'Keefe in 1979, who {{had been}} {{minority}} owners since 1976. The brewing company's total investment in the team was $5.8 million. At {{the time it was}} rapidly ramping up its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights deals that would reach $11 million annually by 1984. Reports at the time suggest the league became spoiled by the partnership and that when the money dried up in 1987, the transition was difficult. For the Argos, the <b>Carling</b> O'Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{numerical}} procedure {{for the natural}} vibration analysis of plates with openings and <b>carlings</b> based on the assumed mode method is extended to assess their forced response. Firstly, natural response of plates with openings and <b>carlings</b> is calculated from the eigenvalue equation derived by using Lagrange's equation of motion. Secondly, the mode superposition method is applied to determine frequency response. Mindlin theory is adopted for plate modelling {{and the effect of}} openings is taken into account by subtracting their potential and kinetic energies from the corresponding plate energies. Natural and frequency response of plates with openings and <b>carlings</b> subjected to point excitation force and enforced acceleration at boundaries, respectively, is analysed by using developed in-house code. For the validation of the developed method and the code, extensive numerical results, related to plates with different opening shape, <b>carlings</b> and boundary conditions, are compared with numerical data from the relevant literature and with finite element solutions obtained by general finite element tool...|$|R

5|$|The Manager of the Month is an {{association}} football award that recognises the best adjudged Premier League manager each {{month of the}} season.

5|$|The year's {{following}} the <b>Carling</b> O'Keefe era {{were marked by}} increasingly short ownership stints. Canadian businessman Harry Ornest bought the team off <b>Carling</b> O'Keefe for $5 million {{at the end of}} 1988 and then sold to the trio of McNall (60%), Candy (20%), and Gretzky (20%) for the same amount in 1991. Of the three, Candy is best remembered for his emotional investment in the team and a team player award continues in his honour. Given McNall's indictment and Candy's early death, the era was tumultuous and the last in which the club regularly made front page headlines. The now money-losing team was sold to the Labatt Brewing Company through its TSN unit in 1994 for $4.5 million. At the time, Labatt also owned the Toronto Blue Jays. In 1995, Labatt was acquired by Interbrew; The Interbrew years saw two championships but also the worst Argo attendance of the modern era. Interbrew soon lost interest in sports ownership and the team was sold again at the end of 1999 to New York businessman Sherwood Schwarz.|$|E

William Baker and Alan MacDonald served as creative and art directors, respectively, while Michael Rooney and Steve Anderson worked on the choreography and musical arrangements. Display hardware manufacturer Barco provided LED displays for showing graphics as backdrops to the performances. Minogue wore five different costumes, designed by fashion houses such as Balenciaga, Chanel, and Helmut Lang, for the 75 minutes-long show. The total cost of staging the concert was £1 million.|$|E
