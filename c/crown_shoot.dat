40|$|ABSTRACT-Chinaberry (Melia azedarach L.) is a {{beautiful}} tree indigenous to the Himalayas that grows as a native plant in Iran. Symptoms similar to bacterial gall have been observed on the <b>crown,</b> <b>shoot</b> and twig of chinaberry, a recent landscape tree since 2003 - 2004 in Shiraz, Fars province, south of Iran. A gram negative bacterium was isolated from the galls. The isolates did not produce fluorescent pigment on King's B medium, were negative in oxidase, levan production, potato soft rot, casein, gelatin hydrolysis, nitrate reduction, growth at 5 oC, uease production and indol production, but were positive in arginine dihydrolase, catalase, growth at 35 oC, and also produced hypersensitive reaction on tobacco. Wound inoculated bacterial suspension into chinaberry seedlings produced galls from which the bacterium was reisolated. Systemic movement of the isolates into the vascular system of chinaberry was shown by the formation of gall above the inoculation site on the stem. On the basis of biochemical, physiological and pathogenicity characteristics, the isolated bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas meliae. Electrophoretic pattern of cell proteins showed that chinaberry isolates were different from P. syringae, P. viridiflava, P. fluorescens, P. savastanoi.

40|$|A {{number of}} factors which may affect seed {{production}} in Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum Bieb.) cv. Monaro were investigated viz. root system development and its relationship with seed yield; morphological and reproductive characteristics of different genotypes from within the cultivar; the effects of plant density on seed yield; and, the effects of insect pests on seed yield and quality. Caucasian clover is a rhizomatous legume pasture plant with a large root system. A sand bed was used to investigate root system development {{and the relationship between}} the root system and seed yield. During vegetative growth (September to November) root dry matter (DM) accumulated more rapidly than shoot DM, and the root to Shoot ratio was 2. 45 by mid November. However as reproductive growth accelerated the rate of root DM accumulation decreased and by early February the root to shoot ratio was 0. 65. Plants developed primary, secondary and tertiary crowns in this first growing season, with both primary and secondary crowns producing reproductive shoots. The protracted flowering period (four months) was a result of an initial production of reproductive shoots from primary crowns, and an extended production of reproductive shoots from secondary crowns when primary <b>crown</b> <b>shoot</b> production had ceased. There were therefore two flowering peaks. A single primary crown produced an average seed yield of 3. 8 g compared with 0. 81 g seed from an average secondary crown. However as there was only one primary crown but 26 secondary crowns per plant, the total seed yield from secondary crowns reached 21. 1 g per plant. Root DM was highly correlated (R 2 = 0. 80 - 0. 97) with the number of leaves, reproductive shoots and inflorescences, as well as the number of secondary crowns. Seed yield per plant was almost entirely dominated by the number and size of the secondary crowns, which in turn depended {{on the size of the}} root system prior to reproductive development. The seed production potential of three genotypes selected from within cv. Monaro was investigated. The genotypes differed significantly in their morphological and reproductive characteristics, including the number of reproductive stems and inflorescences produced. Genotypes 2 and 12 had seed yields of 3. 65 g and 2. 99 g per plant respectively, which genotype 9 had a seed yield of only 0. 18 g per plant, primarily because it produced very few inflorescences. Poor inflorescence production by some genotypes within a cultivar will limit seed yield and may alter the genotypic composition of the cultivar as seed multiplication progresses. A radial trial was used to determine the optimal density for seed production of the cultivar. Plant density significantly affected leaf number, reproductive stems, inflorescences number and seed yield per plant in that plants at the highest density (38. 2 m- 2) produced about 7 times fewer reproductive stems and over 15 times fewer inflorescences per plant compared with those in the lowest density (3. 1 m- 2). Inflorescence number increased as plant density decreased (R 2 = 0. 82 - 0. 89). The lowest density plants had the greatest reproductive growth per plant but were not capable of creating the highest reproductive production per unit area. Cultivar Monaro showed a parabolic relationship for reproductive production per unit area with plant density, both for inflorescence number and seed yield m- 2. Plants grown at the density of 10. 8 plants m- 2 produced the highest inflorescence number and seed yield per unit area. The number of inflorescences per plant was the most important seed yield component determining final seed yield in cv. Monaro (R 2 = 0. 95). Plant density affected seed yield only through reducing inflorescence number; it had no effect on thousand seed weight, or germination and hard seed percentage. It is probable that plant density affects reproductive development through its effects on root system development in Caucasian clover. A semi-radial trial was also used to examine the effects of plant density on seed production of twelve genotypes from within cv. Monaro. These genotypes demonstrated significant differences in reproductive capability. Genotypes 1, 2, 4 and 12 represented a high or normal reproductive capability group compared with others and these genotypes produced inflorescences across all five densities. Genotypes 3, 5, 8, 9, 13 represented another group which either failed to produce or produced only a small number of inflorescences even at the lowest density. Genotypes 6, 7 and 10 were intermediate. Seed yield per plant at the 10. 8 plants m- 2 density ranged from 0 g for genotypes 5, 8, 9 and 13 to 0. 89 g for genotype 1. Reproductive response to plant density did not differ from that when seeds of the cultivar were sown in the full radial trial. Insect pests, particularly thrips (Thripidae) may reduce seed yield and quality. The insecticide taufluvalinate (Mavrik) was applied at 150 ml ha- 1 either once (just prior to peak flowering) or every 14 days until harvest, beginning at first inflorescence appearance. Both adults and larvae of onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) and red clover thrips (Haplothrips niger) were detected in inflorescences during peak flowering and seed development. The multiple insecticide applications significantly increased seed number per inflorescence and thousand seed weight, therefore increasing seed yield. However the single application had no effect on seed yield or quality...|$|E

Accumu-lation of QRCPE mRNA was higher in oak microshoots derived from <b>crown</b> branch <b>shoot</b> cultures than in oak micro-shoots derived from basal shoot cultures {{at the end of}} the multi-plication and rooting period. Among organs, the highest accumulation of QRCPE transcripts was detected in roots, fol-lowed by stems and leaves, with preferential accumulation in specific organs of ontogenetically older shoots. Although QRCPE mRNA was abundant in oak zygotic and somatic em-bryos, almost no QRCPE mRNA accumulation was detected in nodular callus cells, suggesting a possible role of this gene in embryonic development. In proliferating shoot cultures of two chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) clones, the QRCPE homolog was preferentially expressed in crown-derived shoots. On the other hand, expression analysis of QRCPE in juvenile and ma-ture material from soil-grown oak plants indicated that this gene is expressed from the embryonic to mature phases, but is progressively down-regulated during plant maturation. In vitro culture conditions induced changes in QRCPE transcript abun-dance in both basal and <b>crown</b> <b>shoots</b> in a phase-dependent manner.

Anay and Kornosor (2000) recorded H. postica on alfalfa at Adana in Turkey. This pest occurs at several times of the growing season and reduces forage production in many ways. Heavily infested areas may appear silver or white; most of the leaves are turned into skeletons or completely consumed (Radcliffe and Flanders 1998). If large numbers of larvae or adults survive until harvest, they damage crown buds and stems, retarding regrowth (Fick 1976). Residual effects from severe damage decrease plant vigor, resulting in poor yields in subsequent harvests and lower stand density (Fick and Liu 1976). Several types of control {{have been used to}} decrease the economic damage incurred by this pest such as cultural, chemical, and biological control methods. Increasing concerns for insecticide resistance and environmental safety arising from a frequent use of synthetic insecticides affect the long-term control feasibility of alfalfa weevil management (Regev et al. 1983). Consequently, many alfalfa producers are looking for more environmentally friendly control methods {{all over the world to}} take over this destructive pest.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of three years' {{research}} on seed production of birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Previous work by other researchers has suggested that a protracted flowering period {{is a major factor}} limiting seed production in this legume. The research programme was begun in 1986 with an investigation of the cause(s) of this protracted flowering period. By carefully examining the growth and flowering behaviour of tagged shoots formed at different times of the year, it was identified that the protracted flowering pattern in this plant is caused by the continuous production of shoots with the capacity to flower. The continuous development of new shoots replacing older flowering shoots was the main cause of the long flowering period. Results of the first year's research also showed that seed yield is primarily determined by the number of inflorescences produced. In turn, inflorescence numbers are primarily dependent on the number of shoots available at the time of flowering. It was suggested by the results that manipulation of the number and branching of shoots should be an important management strategy for improving seed production in this plant. The second stage of the study involved a number of hand removal and cutting treatments designed to investigate the possible effects of shoot removal on plant growth and seed production. Hand removal of <b>crown</b> <b>shoots</b> affected branching behaviour in this plant. Removal of young <b>crown</b> <b>shoots</b> at different growth stages resulted in a range of plant structural forms which influenced seed production potential. Cutting treatments, the major effect of which was to remove a section of shoot from the top, showed no obvious beneficial effects on seed yield in birdsfoot trefoil. In the third stage studies were extended to investigate a more practical situation in which plant growth regulating chemicals (paclobutrazol (PP 333), ethofumesate (Nortron) and fatty alcohols (Fatol Super)) were used to manipulate shoot growth and development. Research at this stage involved both widely spaced individual plants and plants grown in a sward to simulate commercially practised situations. Results showed that PP 333 is a promising pre-peak flowering shoot manipulator which acts by promoting branching. Nearly a 40 % increase in seed yield was consistently obtainedin two years' experiments when this chemical were applied during the time from the pre-bud stage to the early flowering stage. Nortron showed its value in sward situations when applied at early plant development stage. However, Nortron was of limited value when it was used as a post-peak flowering shoot manipulator because of its injurious effect on plant growth and flowering. Fatol Super showed some potential as a post-peak flowering shoot manipulator, particularly when applied to spaced plants, but was less effective in sward situations. This reduces its value for use in the narrow row or sward seed production systems currently practiced in New Zealand for birdsfoot trefoil...|$|R

Measurements of total reduced nitrogen and 15 N contained within that nitrogen fraction in roots, <b>crowns,</b> and <b>shoots</b> at each harvest showed large, significant (P ≤ 0. 001) declines in excess 15 N of crowns and roots in both species {{between the first and}} fourth harvests.

Calculations for grass and clover plants clipped four times during the growing season indicated that 100 to 143 % of the nitrogen present in crowns and roots turned over between the first and fourth shoot harvest in both species, assuming nitrogen in those organs was replaced with nitrogen containing the lowest available concentration of 15 N. If other potential sources of nitrogen were used for the calculations, it was necessary to postulate that larger amounts of total nitrogen flowed through the crown and root to produce the measured dilution of 15 N compounds.

40|$|The rooting {{potential}} of four types or origins of Prunus avium cuttings {{from the same}} mature trees (over 20 years-old) was compared using a mist propagation bed during early Summer (June). The cuttings originated from juvenile sucker shoots of the current and previous year, and mature <b>crown</b> <b>shoots</b> (current year's lateral `long-shoots' and multi-year terminal `short shoots'). The morphological differences in inter-node length, stem diameter and leaf area between the four cutting types were highly significant (P = 0. 05), leading to large differences in cutting volume and, so it is argued, to assimilate reserves. Juvenile cuttings rooted well (65 % and 77 % rooting for hardwood and softwood shoots, respectively), while mature cuttings rooted poorly (4 % and 7 % for mature hardwood and softwood cuttings, respectively). Leaf abscission was significantly more frequent in mature hardwood cuttings (16 - 78 %) than in the other cutting types (1. 6 - 9 %) {{at the end of}} the propagation period. Leaf loss resulted from two processes: abscission and leaf rotting. Physiologically (i. e., in carbon assimilation, leaf transpiration and stomatal conductance), the four cutting types were not significantly different early in the post-severance period (day- 4); but, by day- 22, stomatal conductance was lowest in mature hardwood cuttings that still had leaves. At this time, the most physiologically-active unrooted cuttings were from juvenile hardwood and mature softwood shoots. The extent of physiological and morphological variability between cutting types and their probable impact on processes affecting rooting ability is complex and highly interactive. Consequently, it is not possible to explain the causes of the variation in rooting ability between juvenile and mature cuttings, although this study suggests that the constraints to rooting are likely to reflect physiological differences between the different cutting types. It is concluded that, to resolve the debate about factors that affect the rooting ability of juvenile and mature cuttings (i. e., ontogenetic vs. physiological ageing), there is a need to achieve morphological and physiological comparability in the tissues...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{aspects of}} the {{functional}} ecology of naturally established tree seedlings in the boreal forests of North America {{with an emphasis on}} the relationship between light availability and the growth and survival of shade tolerant conifers up to pole size. Shade tolerant conifer species such as firs and spruces tend to have a lower specific leaf mass, photosynthetic rate at saturation, live <b>crown</b> ratio, STAR (<b>shoot</b> silhouette area to total needle surface area ratio), and root to shoot ratio than the shade intolerant pines. The inability of intolerant species such as the pines and aspen to survive in shade appears to be mainly the result of characteristics at the <b>shoot,</b> <b>crown,</b> and whole-tree levels and not at the leaf level. Although firs and spruces frequently coexist in shaded understories, they do not have identical growth patterns and crown architectures. We propose a simple framework based on the maximum height that different tree species can sustain in shade, which may help managers determine the timing of partial or complete harvests. Consideration of these functional aspects of regeneration is important to the understanding of boreal forest dynamics and can be useful to forest managers seeking to develop or assess novel silvicultural systems...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1980 s {{defoliation}} (often {{assessed by}} means of crown transparency) is the most used indicator of tree condition adopted in Europe. It {{has been criticized for}} its subjectivity and scarce relation with meaningful endpoints. Here we collated the results of three different studies carried out in France and Italy to investigate the relationship between defoliation/transparency and other measured indicators of tree growth and health. In a first study, basal area increment (BAI) and mean defoliation of conifers and broadleaves in the French Level II network RENECOFOR were examined for the growing periods 1995 - 2004 (47 plots, 2008 trees) and 2000 - 2009 (63 plots, 3116 trees). A second, similar study was carried out on Picea abies (L.) Karts., in Trentino, Northern Italy, on 13 Level I plots and two growing periods, 2001 - 2005 (136 trees) and 2005 - 2009 (111 trees). The third study was carried out also in Trentino: nine Picea abies trees were randomly selected along an elevation gradient (900 - 1500 m asl) and examined for <b>crown</b> transparency, <b>shoot</b> length, needle weight, chlorophyll fluorescence, and stable isotopes in needles (δ 13 C and δ 18 O). BAI resulted negatively and significantly related to defoliation at both the French and Italian plots, and growth reduction of 0. 73 - 1. 49...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Open {{boreal forests}} present a {{challenge}} in un-derstanding remote sensing signals acquired with various solar and view geometries. Much {{research is needed to}} improve our ability to model the bidirectional reflectance distribution (BRD) for retrieving the surface information using measurements at a few angles. The geometric-optical bidirectional reflectance model presented in this paper considers four scales of canopy architec-ture: tree groups, tree <b>crowns,</b> branches and <b>shoots.</b> It differs from the Li-Strahler’s model in the following respects: 1) the assumption of random spatial distribution of trees is replaced by the Neyman distribution which is able to model the patchiness or clumpiness of a forest stand; 2) the multiple mutual shadowing effect between tree crowns is considered using a negative binomial and the Neyman distribution theory; 3) the effect of the sunlit background is modeled using a canopy gap size distributio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWildland {{fires are}} driven by the heat {{transferred}} from the fire source to the unburned fuel bed and this transfer {{is likely to be}} affected by the spatial heterogeneity of fuel element distributions at different scales from shoot to stand. In a context of theoretical fire modelling, we investigated the impact of a departure from randomness of fuel distributions on the radiative transfer of energy. Our methodology was derived from the approach developed for solar radiation in heterogeneous canopies or clouds and was modified to suit an analysis of fire behaviour. Some fine and coarse fuel distributions for several Mediterranean fuel types were derived from field measurements and plant architecture modelling. A comparison of the average irradiances in different fuels showed whether heterogeneity effects were significant or not. Results showed that both marked spatial variability in fuel distribution (low cover fraction and large clumps) and a high vegetation density were required to provide significant effects. The radiative transfer in heterogeneous maritime pines and in dense shrub stands was significantly affected by heterogeneity, mainly at <b>crown</b> and <b>shoot</b> scales. Less pronounced effects were observed in Aleppo pine stand and light shrubs. In terms of fuel modelling, the 2 -m resolution used in a fire model such as FIRETEC seems to be sufficient for the fuel types investigated here, with the exception of dense small clumps in shrublands. An effective coefficient was proposed for these latter cases...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Lettuce {{stands out}} as the main leafy {{vegetable}} consumed in Brazil, with divergence regarding adaptability to different environmental conditions, which include salinity. The objective of the work was to evaluate the response of lettuce cultivars {{to the use of}} saline wastewater from fish farming. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with four replicates, in a factorial 7 x 4, corresponding to seven cultivars (Regiane, Vera, Isabela, Elisa, Amelia, Lavinia and Angelina) and four salt concentrations (1. 2, 2. 2, 3. 2 and 4. 2 dS m- 1). The evaluated characteristics were: number of leaves, leaf area, <b>crown</b> diameter and <b>shoot</b> fresh and dry matter. Diluted wastewater from fish farming can be used in the preparation of solution for fertigation of lettuce. The cultivars Regiane and Elisa had higher production of leaves and leaf area, while Amélia and Angelina were the most productive in terms of biomass. The cultivars Vera, Isabela, Amélia and Angelina were more tolerant to the salinity of the fertigation solution...|$|R
40|$|Switchgrass is a North American {{perennial}} prairie {{species that}} {{has been used as a}} rangeland and forage crop and has recently been targeted as a potential biofuel feedstock species. Switchgrass, which occurs as tetraploid and octoploid forms, is classified into lowland or upland ecotypes that differ in growth phenotypes and adaptation to distinct habitats. Using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads derived from <b>crown,</b> young <b>shoot,</b> and leaf tissues, we generated sequence data from seven switchgrass cultivars, three lowland and four upland, to enable comparative analyses between switchgrass cultivars and to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for use in breeding and genetic analysis. We also generated individual transcript assemblies for each of the cultivars. Transcript data indicate that subgenomes of octoploid switchgrass are not substantially different from subgenomes of tetraploids as expected for an autopolyploid origin of switchgrass octoploids. Using RNA-seq reads aligned to the switchgrass Release 0 AP 13 reference genome, we identified 1, 305, 976 high-confidence SNPs. Of these SNPs, 438, 464 were unique to lowland cultivars, but only 12, 002 were found in all lowlands. Conversely, 723, 678 SNPs were unique to upland cultivars, with only 34, 665 observed in all uplands. Comparison of our high-confidence transcriptome-derived SNPs with SNPs previously identified in a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) study of an association panel revealed limited overlap between the two methods, highlighting the utility of transcriptome-based SNP discovery in augmenting genome diversity polymorphism datasets. The transcript and SNP data described here provide a useful resource for switchgrass gene annotation and marker-based analyses of the switchgrass genome...|$|R
40|$|Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) has a broad {{geographic}} distribution, with populations {{adapted to}} both cold and warm climates. Despite considerable research on winter hardiness, the mechanisms and genetic control of winter survival are poorly understood. We conducted two experiments designed {{to identify and}} quantify morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits associated with winter hardiness and to estimate the genetic relationship of these traits with winter hardiness. In Experiment 1, ten alfalfa genotypes were planted in June 2000 and in May 2001 at Ames, IA, and traits were measured in August, November, and the following April in each year. Concentrations of palmitate, palmitoleate, linoleate, linolenate and total fatty acids increased in crowns and roots of all genotypes from August to November and declined by April. Winter injury showed a negative phenotypic correlation with concentrations of palmitate, linoleate, linolenate, total fatty acids in both roots and crowns. These data suggest an important role of fatty acids in winter hardiness.;In Experiment 2, we established an F 1 segregating population of 200 individuals {{in the field in}} successive years at Ames, IA and measured agronomic and physiological traits in August and November. Although differences among the individuals in the F 1 population were present 2 for all traits, and transgressive segregation present for many, the population mean tended to fall intermediate to the two parents. Broad sense heritabilities on an entry mean basis were 0. 58 for winter injury, 0. 60 for plant height in November, and ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 63 for <b>shoot,</b> <b>crown,</b> and root mass in August and November. Total fatty acid concentration had an H 2 of 0. 72 in August and 0. 44 in November. Autumn plant height had weak positive genetic correlations with winter injury, in contrast to other research. <b>Shoot,</b> <b>crown,</b> and root biomass in both August and November showed strong negative genetic correlations with winter injury, suggesting that in this population, winter survival was related to plant vigor. Preliminary genetic mapping identified several chromosomal locations associated with most traits. These results suggest that the determinants of winter survival in this population formed from semidormant parents differ from those in populations with nondormant parental genotypes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—As optical {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} provide increasingly detailed canopy reflectance data {{at a variety}} of illumination/view geometries, direct quantitative comparisons between data sets require a flexible model of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) suitable for inversion. Typically, such derivations rely on: 1) complex and computation-ally expensive empirical canopy descriptions, or 2) simplifications for specific canopy types, conditions, or view geometry. More practical would be one general model not requiring significant computing resources, but that provides information on canopy architecture when utilized as an inverse model. The Four-Scale Model, developed by Chen and Leblanc [1], de-scribes canopy reflectance considering four levels of architecture, distributions of tree <b>crowns,</b> branches, <b>shoots,</b> and leaves. A linear kernel-like model has been developed from this, Four-Scale Linear Model for An Isotropic Reflectance (FLAIR). While simplifications are performed, effort has been made not to limit FLAIR to spe-cific canopy characteristics, while maintaining relationships be-tween modeled coefficients and canopy architecture. Comparisons between Four-Scale and FLAIR, and use of FLAIR in the forward mode on multi-angular data sets obtained during BOREAS 1994, allow examination of the suitability, capabilities, and limitations of this model in describing canopy reflectance. As partial validation, this paper compares FLAIR functions to aspects of the Four-Scale model from which they are developed. Examination of how this model reacts to inversion of simulated reflectance data sets demon-strates its ability to simulate and reproduce canopy reflectance, leading toward the retrieval of reasonable. Further valida-tion and examination of this model with field data will be presented in a subsequent paper.
