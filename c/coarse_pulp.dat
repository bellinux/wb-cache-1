The energy consumption of thermomechanical pulping process is very high although theoretically {{a small amount of}} energy is needed to create new fibre surfaces. Mechanisms of refining have been widely studied {{in order to understand the}} high energy consumption of the process, however, phenomena in the inner area of disc gap has had less attention. It is likely that this important position is causing high energy consumption due to the high residence time of pulp located there. The power distribution as a function of the refiner disc gap was calculated in this work. The calculation was based on mass and energy balances, as well as temperature and consistency profiles determined by mill trials. The power distribution was found to be dependent on segment geometry and the refining stage. However, in the first stage refiner with standard refiner segments, a notable amount of power was consumed in the inner area of the disc gap. Fibre-to-fibre refining is likely to be the most important mechanism in the inner area of disc gap from the point of view of energy consumption. In this work the inter-fibre refining was studied using equipment for shear and compression. Fibre-to-fibre refining was found to be an effective way to refine fibres from <b>coarse</b> <b>pulp</b> to separated, fibrillated and peeled fibres if frictional forces inside the compressed pulp were high enough. It was proposed that high energy of today’s thermomechanical pulping process could derive from too low frictional forces that heated pulp and evaporated water without any changes in fibre structure. The method to calculate power distribution and results of fibre-to-fibre refining experiments may give ideas for developing today’s thermomechanical pulp refiners’ or for developing totally new energy saving mechanical pulping processes...|$|E

In the food industry these exoenzymes are used in the production of fruit juices, fruit nectars, fruit purees and in the extraction of olive oil among many others. [...] The role these enzymes play in these food applications is to partially breakdown the plant cell walls and pectin. In addition to the role they play in food production, cellulases are used in the textile industry to remove excess dye from denim, soften cotton fabrics and restore the color brightness of cotton fabrics. [...] Cellulases and hemicellulases (including xylanases) are also used in the paper and pulp industry to de-ink recycled fibers, modify <b>coarse</b> mechanical <b>pulp</b> and for the partial or complete hydrolysis of pulp fibers. [...] Cellulases and hemicellulases are used in these industrial applications due to their ability to hydrolyze the cellulose and hemicellulose components found in these materials.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results of investigation on the wear of alumina-based composites containing submicrometre particles of other phases in different conditions of work. Three types of phases were used as additives: tungsten carbide, yttria stabilized zirconia and metallic tungsten. The above mentioned phases were used separately or simultaneously as mixes. Two types of tests were performed- the Dry Sand Test and the Miller Test in wet <b>pulp.</b> <b>Coarse</b> silicon carbide grains were used as an abrasive medium in both cases. The results indicate that the optimal wear susceptibility in given work environment could be achieved by the addition of different type of additives...|$|R

Fresh cider is raw apple juice that has not undergone a filtration process to remove <b>coarse</b> particles of <b>pulp</b> or sediment. Apple juice is juice that has been filtered to remove solids and pasteurized so that it will stay fresh longer. Vacuum sealing and additional filtering extend the shelf life of the juice." [...] This still leaves unfiltered apple juice that is no longer raw in a gray area, presumably cider but not labeled as such. The addition of sweeteners or reconstitution from concentrate are left even grayer.|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} furnish in {{newsprint}} production is {{dictated by the}} raw material costs, production cost and the final quality demanded by printers. In addition to the raw material costs, energy cost {{is a major factor}} in papermaking economy. Modern newsprint machines have combinations of roll and shoe presses to increase web dryness to approximately 50 % after wet pressing and thus keeping drying cost as low as possible. Thermomechanical pulp and deinked pulp are commonly used for producing newsprint nowadays. The increasing use of deinked pulp and filler in newsprint production has improved press dewatering. However, {{there is a lack of}} published research on the effects of the nip types, furnish and filler distribution in the web on sheet dewatering and sheet structure after wet pressing. The dynamic wet pressing simulator at NTNU-PFI was used for the pressing experiments. A single sided dewatering setting was used. The wet pressed samples were freeze dried in liquid nitrogen after pressing. The cross-sections of the freeze dried samples were imaged in a SEM and the cross-sectional structures were quantified. The cross-section images were split into top, middle and felt or dewatering side layers based on equal solids per layer per line length. The Euclidean distance maps generated by ImageJ software were used to quantify the distribution of fines, pores size, porosity and thickness of the sample. To understand the filler, fibre and MFC interactions, images for surface characterization were acquired using FE-SEM. 3 D images for DIP and TMP samples pressed with shoe pulse were acquired using x-ray micro-(computed) tomography (X-μCT) for visual assessment of the densification across the sheet’s thickness. In addition, the surface roughness was quantified. As expected, deinked pulp (DIP) dewaters more easily than thermomechanical pulp (TMP) when pressed with a roll pulse. The in-plane moisture flow (crushing) in DIP samples started at higher peak pressure and higher solids content compared to the TMP samples. The TMP samples showed higher springback after wet pressing compared to DIP samples. When both TMP and DIP samples were designed to have a higher amount of small pores at the dewatering side’s surface layers, the samples with the <b>coarser</b> TMP <b>pulp</b> could achieve similar dryness as DIP samples when pressed with higher nip pressure. In addition, the DIP samples with the higher number of small pores at the dewatering layer also yielded lower dryness after pressing with roll pulse. The effect of filler (ground calcium carbonate, GCC) distribution in the paper’s zdirection on final dryness and sheet structure after the wet pressing with a roll pulse was also studied. The distribution of filler did not affect the maximum dryness after wet pressing (40 %) for sheets containing identical (13 %) amount of filler. However, the samples with more filler in the dewatering layer dewater more easily and yield the 40 % maximum achievable dryness after wet pressing at a lower pressure. As a result, the samples with more filler in the dewatering layer yielded higher thickness as compared to samples with filler distributed evenly in the z-direction. In the study on wet-pressing using two different shoe press pulse profiles, the samples made from TMP and DIP yielded identical after-press solids content. More water was pressed out of the TMP samples as compared to DIP samples since TMP samples had lower initial solids content. The wet webs with more porous structure in the dewatering layer yielded higher dryness after wet-pressing. This is a major advantage, as higher dryness after wet-pressing implies a reduction of steam consumption in the dryer. This study also showed that the shoe press pulse with high peak pressure at the end yielded higher solids content and apparently higher bulk after the wet-pressing compared to the shoe press pulse with high peak pressure in the beginning. Higher filler content in newsprint increases the risk of linting at the printing press. Recent advances in technology and research in producing microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) should enable the production of MFC with acceptable energy cost in the near future. MFC can be used to improve the strength properties of the paper. Optimal selection of MFC quality and filler content can improve the optical properties while maintaining or enhancing the surface strength of the sheets. Different qualities of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) were blended with TMP and ground calcium carbonate (GCC). The addition of MFC decreased the drainage rate of the pulp suspension but improved the strength properties. Wet pressing experiments showed that optimal use of MFC and filler could enhance the strength and optical properties without reducing the solids content after wet pressing. Field emission SEM revealed that the MFC particles adsorbed onto filler particles and fibres. The MFC binds the filler-MFC-fines aggregates to the fibre network, thus partly filled the pore network. As a result, MFC addition increased the air resistance and internal bonding of the sheet. PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Engineerin...|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} morning the tap {{at the bottom}} of the boiler was turned, and the syrup came out bright and clear,--about the colour of sherry wine. The scum descended unbroken on the surface of the liquor; and when the copper was nearly empty the tap was closed, and the scum and what little liquor remained was taken out. The bright syrup was now again poured into the boiler, the fire re-lighted, and the syrup was kept boiling, to evaporate the water and condense the syrup down to the point at which it would crystallize. It required many hours' boiling to effect this, any scum which rose to the surface being carefully taken off with a skimmer. At last it was found that the syrup on the skimmer began to crystallize, and Mr. Hardy pronounced it to be fit to draw off into the large washing tubs to crystallize. A fresh batch of canes was now crushed, and so the process was repeated until all the canes were cut. It took a fortnight altogether, but only five days of this were actually occupied in cutting and crushing the canes. As the sugar crystallized it was taken out,--a dark, pulpy-looking mass, at which the young Hardys looked very doubtfully,--and was placed in a large sugar hogshead, which had been procured for the purpose. In the bottom of this eight large holes were bored, and these were stopped up with pieces of plantain stalk. Through the porous substance of these stalks the molasses or treacle slowly drained off. As the wet sugar was placed in the cask, layers of slices of plantain stems were laid upon it, as the spongy substance draws the dark colouring matter out from the sugar. The plantain grows freely in South America, and Mr. Hardy had planted a number of this graceful tree near his house; but these had not been advanced enough to cut, and he had therefore procured a sufficient quantity from a friend at Rosario. It was three months before the drainage of the molasses quite ceased; and the Hardys were greatly pleased, on emptying the hogshead and removing the plantain stems, to find that their sugar was dry, and of a very fairly light colour. The sugar-canes did not require planting again, as they will grow for many years from the same roots; and although the canes from old stools, as they are called, produce less sugar than those of the first year's planting, the juice is clearer, and requires far less trouble to prepare and refine. Before another year came round, the boys made a pair of wooden rollers of eighteen inches in diameter. These were covered with strips of hoop iron, nailed lengthways upon them at short intervals from each other, thereby obtaining a better grip upon the canes, and preventing the wood from being bruised and grooved. These rollers were worked by a horse mill, which Mr. Hardy had ordered from England. It was made for five horses, and did a great deal of useful work, grinding the Indian corn into fine flour for home consumption and for sale to neighbouring settlers, and into <b>coarse</b> meal, and <b>pulping</b> the pumpkins and roots for the pigs and other animals.|$|R
40|$|Summary of conclusions:(1) The {{injection}} of spleen or gland <b>pulp</b> (of <b>coarse</b> or fine grain) into the jugular vein {{can be carried}} out with but little risk provided microscopical examination proves that such material is not contaminated with bacteria or micrococci (2) The presence of an Endocarditis verrucosa, due to the {{injection of}} such material, was only noted in one instance, and that was a case of a double injection into the jugular vein of 20 c. c. spleen pulp. (3) The highest percentage of artificial infection, calculated on both deaths and immunity due to such injections, was obtained by the intrajugular method (vide Table A). (4) Of the intrajugular injections, the most certain method of transmission was noticed after the injection of coarse-grained spleen pulp, and coarse-grained spleen and gland pulp (mixed) (vide Table B). (5) The percentage of survivals amongst the animals treated by intrajugular injections, arranged according to the amount of material used, was as follows :- In the dose of: 40 c. c. 	Nil survived	out of 1 treated	 0 % 25 c. c	 2 survived	Out of 7 treated	 28 % 20 c. c	 13 survived	Out of 41 treated	 32 % 15 c. c. 	 3 survived	Out of 9 treated	 33 % 10 c. c. 	 16 survived	Out of 31 treated	 51 % 30 c. c	 9 survived	Out of 13 treated	 70 % 5 c. c. 	 24 survived	Out of 34 treated	 71 % (6) The results of the intrajugular injections in the different experiments, arranged according to the immunity conferred, vary from nil to 100 per cent. (vide Table C). (7) The highest percentage of transmission was obtained by the addition of peptone to the material injected (compare Table D). (8) The material which transmitted the disease in the majority of cases was taken from cattle suffering from East Coast fever, which had been killed from the 25 th day onwards after the infestation of ticks, or fourteen days onwards after the first rise of temperature (vide Table E). (9) The inoculation was either succeeded by (a) a typical East Coast fever reaction, ending in death, and accompanied with the presence of plasma bodies; or (b) by typical East Coast fever reactions, accompanied with parasites, and ending in recovery; or (c) by mild or irregular reactions, accompanied with the presence of parasites, and ending in recovery; or (d) by reactions indicative of East Coast fever, but without plasma bodies; or (e) by irregular reactions; or (f) by no reactions (vide Summary of Experiment and Tables). (10) Of animals inoculated in various ways, and exposed to tick infestation or natural infection, the least mortality occurred amongst those which had shown plasma bodies in the lymphatic glands {{as a result of the}} injection (vide Table G). (11) An observation of fundamental importance is the fact that an animal which contracted the disease from ticks (viz., in the natural way) contracted it a second time and died when exposed to natural infection on the veld. In other words, animals which have recovered from a natural attack, due to tick infestation, may contract the disease again, although this seems to be a rare exception. (12) A further fact of importance is the observation that five animals which contracted the disease from the injection, accompanied with the presence of plasma bodies in the lymphatic glands, and recovered, again contracted East Coast fever when exposed to natural infection, of which three died and two recovered. (13) In the foregoing experiments, 224 animals were used in all, of which 180 were injected either once only, or twice within sixteen days, and forty-four were injected repeatedly. (a) Of the 180 animals, nineteen died, chiefly from accidents resulting from inoculation, the cause of death being septic pneumonia, due to embolism with contaminated material. Thirty-nine contracted the disease from the inoculation and died. Forty-seven contracted the disease from injection and recovered. Of these forty-seven, three died before they could be tested, three died of relapses, that is to say, again contracted the disease in the field (breakdowns in immunity), two showed relapses and recovered, and six died of other causes after the critical period of the test had elapsed. Twelve did not react typically to the injection, and died of other causes before they could be tested, or before the critical period of the test had elapsed. Sixty-three animals which did not react typically to the inoculation were tested by the infestation of ticks and exposure to natural infection; twenty-eight contracted the disease and died, three contracted the disease and recovered, and thirty-two proved to be immune. Of the thirty-five, eight died later of other causes. (b) Of the forty-four animals which were injected repeatedly, fourteen died, chiefly from accidents resulting from inoculation, the cause of death being septic pneumonia, due to embolism with contaminated material. Seven did not react typically to the injection, and died of other causes before they could be tested, or before the critical period of the test had elapsed. Twenty-three did not react typically to the injection, and were tested by the infestation of ticks or by exposure to natural infection, of which fifteen contracted East Coast fever and died, and eight proved to be immune; of these eight, two died later of other causes. (14) The final result amongst the inoculated animals that were exposed to tick infestation and natural infection is :- One hundred and thirty exposed, of which forty-six died of East Coast fever from tests, and eighty-five survived the critical period of the test, the net result of animals which survived injection and tests being eighty-four out of one hundred and seventy, or 50 per cent. (15) For the present, a practical method of inoculation, which can be reasonably expected to confer immunity to the extent of 60 to 70 per cent., would consist in the injection of a quantity of not less than 5 c. c. of spleen or of a mixture of spleen and gland <b>pulp</b> (<b>coarse</b> grain) taken from an animal in the last stage of the disease, mixed with peptone and injected intrajugularly. This method can be applied in all cases of emergency as a last resource, that is to say, in cases where there are no opportunities for dipping, or moving the cattle, the artificial immunization can be adopted in order to save the greatest possible number of animals.
