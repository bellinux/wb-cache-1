Clark Spence & Co.'s trading segment at this stage included exports of natural vein graphite (plumbago), gems, hides, Sappan wood, ebony, coffee, coconut oil, <b>coir</b> <b>yarn,</b> bristle fibre, arrack, [...] and citronella oil to United Kingdom, Continental Europe, United States of America and Australia; and imports of Burmese rice and coal for steamer ship bunkers.|$|E

There is little economic inequality in Lakshadweep and the poverty index is low. Coconut fibre extraction and production of fibre products is Lakshadweep's main industry. There are five coir fibre factories, five production demonstration centres and seven fibre curling units run {{by the government of}} India. These units produce coir fibre, <b>coir</b> <b>yarn,</b> curled fibre and corridor mattings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCoir yarns were {{coated with}} three natural {{anti-microbial}} agents - Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL), neem oil and tulsi oil for improving its hydrophobicity, tensile strength and biological resistance. Microbial degradation study was performed with A. niger as test organism. The {{results indicated that}} coating of <b>coir</b> <b>yarns</b> was capable of increasing tensile strength by 17 % and reducing moisture absorption by 34 %. Microbial activity of CNSL coated <b>coir</b> <b>yarns</b> was reduced to 95 %.

The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the tile industry has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces hosiery and <b>coir</b> <b>yarns,</b> while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|R

40|$|Technological {{backwardness}} is {{a crucial}} fact of Kerala's industrial life. The major industries in Kerala, coir processing, handloom weaving, and beedi-making are marked {{by the use of}} low productive technologies. Further, development of industry in the State, among other factors, thus crucially hinges on technological modernisation. Technological change is, however, not merely a matter of finding new machines for old. It involves several other important social questions. As these questions could be expected to unfold with many a detail only on micro-examination, the study particularly focused on three villages in southern Kerala, which are important centres of <b>coir</b> <b>yarn</b> production.

40|$|Coir is a ligno-cellulosic fibre, {{cheap and}} abundantly {{available}} in Sri Lanka as {{a byproduct of}} the coconut industry. Coir-geotextiles, which are manufactured from coir, {{have been identified as}} good geotextile material to be used for soil reinforcement in soil erosion problems until sustainable vegetation is established. Because of this reason coir based geotextiles have the potential to be an exportable product. It has become necessary to scientifically study the properties of coir fibres and coir-geotextiles in great detail to meet the suitability requirements of the export market as well as the local market. Mechanical and physical properties including tensile properties, initial modulus, length, mass and diameter of brown and white coir fibre obtained from Kurunegala District have been used in the evaluation. Moisture absorption characteristics of coir fibres were also evaluated. Results show that there is a direct relationship between the length and tenacity as well as extension at break of retted brown coir fibre. This relationship is not significant in unretted white coir fibre, which is a longer fibre with a higher in tenacity and extension at break. Wet tensile strength and wet extension at break of coir fibres were found to be greater than the tensile strength in the conditioned state. In seawater immersion, coir fibres did not lose strength after 24 hours at room temperature. During a 24 hours period coir fibres did not lose strength significantly in the pH 5 - 9 range at ambient temperature. At different NaOH concentrations and different time periods at 25 °C, coir fibres were immersed in alkaline medium to find out whether the strength was affected. After 30 min in 10 % NaOH brown coir showed highest strength but white coir fibre showed highest strength in 25 % NaOH concentration after 30 min immersion. It was attempted to apply the idealized staple fibre <b>yarn</b> model to <b>coir</b> <b>yarns.</b> For this purpose coir-yarn initial modulus was calculated using results of strength tests for coir fibres and <b>coir</b> <b>yarns.</b> Calculated initial modulus is greater than experimentally obtain results but deviate considerably from the actual situvation. The durability of coir fibres was investigated by immersing in distilled water, acid medium, alkaline medium and saline solution at ambient temperature {{over a period of time}} and the results showed that brown coir fibre and white coir fibre had similar losses in strength in acidic medium after 3 months. White coir fibre lost strength significantly after 3 months in distilled water (pH= 5. 89) treatment. But both coir fibres do not lose strength significantly during 3 months time in alkaline medium or saline water. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis of selected treated coir fibres was carried out to investigate the effect on surface structure of fibres. This analysis explained the results of tensile strength tests between brown and white coir fibres and untreated and treated conditions...|$|R
