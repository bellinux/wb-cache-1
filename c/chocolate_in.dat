25|$|The first {{documentary}} evidence of <b>chocolate</b> <b>in</b> Spain {{comes from a}} delegation of Dominican monks led by Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, who travelled to the Iberian Peninsula in 1544 to visit Prince Philip, future Emperor Philip II. During the meeting, gifts of sweetgum, corn, and cocoa are documented. It also refers to a chocolate milkshake that was served, this being the first documented case {{of the presence of}} <b>chocolate</b> <b>in</b> Spain. The Dominican monks' familiarity with this type of food may have facilitated the transmission of cocoa from the monasteries of Mesoamerica to Spain. Studies show that, prior to the reception, Father Aguilar would be the first in Spain to prepare jars of chocolate for the Abbot of the Piedra Monastery, Don Antonio de Alvaro.|$|E

25|$|Besides Nestlé, {{a number}} of notable {{chocolate}} companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree's of York set up and began producing <b>chocolate</b> <b>in</b> 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868. In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey's chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate {{tempering}} machines (or temperers) {{with computer}} controls {{can be used}} for producing consistently tempered <b>chocolate.</b> <b>In</b> particular continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40–50°C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26–30°C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate is {{associated}} with festivals such as Easter, when moulded chocolate rabbits and eggs are traditionally given in Christian communities, and Hanukkah, when chocolate coins are given in Jewish communities. Chocolate hearts and <b>chocolate</b> <b>in</b> heart-shaped boxes are popular on Valentine's Day and are often presented along with flowers and a greeting card. In 1868, Cadbury created Fancy Boxes – a decorated box of chocolates – {{in the shape of}} a heart for Valentine's Day. Boxes of filled chocolates quickly became associated with the holiday. Chocolate is an acceptable gift on other holidays and on occasions such as birthdays.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} <b>chocolate</b> <b>in</b> Spain {{is part of}} the culinary history of Spain as {{understood}} since the 16th century, when the colonisation of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica, until the present. After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However {{it was only in the}} 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.|$|E
25|$|He {{attempted}} to plant cocoa in the Iberian Peninsula {{but the result}} was a complete failure, leading to the realisation that cultivation was best in latitudes between 20 degrees north and 20 degrees south. The expansion and the need to seek a favorable climate for growing new food meant that cocoa trees flourished in Fernando Poo (in Spanish Guinea) and from there spread across the African continent. At that time preparation of sweets and confectionery was largely in the hands of pharmacists who used <b>chocolate</b> <b>in</b> various secret recipes and pharmaceutical applications. The nutritional use of chocolate was debated in those early times, and possible medicinal uses of cocoa were investigated from the beginning: an example {{can be found in the}} Badianus Codex, written in 1552.|$|E
25|$|The {{chocolate}} {{industry is}} a steadily growing, $50billion-a-year worldwide business centered on the sale and consumption of chocolate. It is prevalent {{throughout most of the}} world. Europe accounts for 45% of the world's chocolate revenue and the US$20billion. Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. The U.S. companies, such as Mars and Hershey's alone, generate $13billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production. Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans. The high cost of <b>chocolate</b> <b>in</b> the Ivory Coast also means that it is inaccessible to the majority of the population, who are unaware of what it tastes like.|$|E
