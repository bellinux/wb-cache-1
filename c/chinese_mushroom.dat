40|$|China {{is a major}} {{country for}} {{mushroom}} production and its export targets the Asian and Japanese markets in particular. The Japanese vegetable import amounted to $ 2. 21 billion and mushrooms were the leading imports, comprising 14 to 18 {{percent of the total}} value of Japanese vegetable imports (Dyck & Ito, 2001, p 64). The high consumption attracts exporters around the world. More than 10 kinds of imported mushrooms can be found, besides the domestic and the Chinese. In the Japanese market by the year 2000, Chinese mushrooms had a great price advantage. The low price strategy adopted by the <b>Chinese</b> <b>mushroom</b> exporters was able to win market access and approval by the Japanase consumers. After the year 2006, Japan began to increase its trade protectionism which led to a decrease in the price advantage of many exports in its domestic market. In this study, Porter‘s Five-Forces is used as the theoretical basis and SWOT 1 as the analytical method to explore the competitive factors of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>mushroom</b> in the Japanese market. The conclusions for necessary competitive strategies will be identified by analyzing the questionnaires collected from experts. The conclusions are: If the <b>Chinese</b> <b>mushroom</b> exporters want to maintain and further develop their products in the Japanese market, they will have to maintain certain competitive advantages of their product, they must seek for better product quality by upgrading their production technologies...|$|E

40|$|Adjusting and {{controlling}} the relative humidity (RH) inside package {{is crucial for}} ensuring the quality of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) of fresh produce. In this paper, an improved kinetic model for predicting the RH in MAP was developed. The model was based on heat exchange and gases mass transport phenomena across the package, gases heat convection inside the package, and mass and heat balances accounting for the respiration and transpiration behavior of fresh produce. Then the model was applied to predict the RH in MAP of fresh Lentinula edodes (one kind of <b>Chinese</b> <b>mushroom).</b> The model equations were solved numerically using Adams-Moulton method to predict the RH in model packages. In general, the model predictions agreed well with the experimental data, except that the model predictions were slightly high in the initial period. The effect of the initial gas composition on the RH in packages was notable. In MAP of lower oxygen and higher carbon dioxide concentrations, the ascending rate of the RH was reduced, and the RH inside packages was saturated slowly during storage. The influence of the initial gas composition on the temperature inside package was not much notable...|$|E
40|$|Ganoderma tsugae (a <b>Chinese</b> <b>mushroom</b> Songshan lingzhi) {{cultivated}} in Taiwan is extensively used in Chinese traditional medicine to treat different diseases. To determine whether G. tsugae has anti-inflammatory effects on bronchoalveolar inflammation in vivo, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of G. tsitgae products, YK 01 and YK 07, on bronchoalveolar inflammation using an air-way sensitization and challenge mouse model. Female BALB/c mice were weekly sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) {{three times and}} challenged with aerosolized OVA twice. Differential cell counts 66 of infiltrating leukocytes, inflammatory mediators, cytokines in bronchoalvelor lavage fluid (BALF) of OVA-challenged mice were examined after continuously consuming G. tsugae diets for 5 weeks. We found that supplementation of G. tsugae significantly decreased total infiltrating leukocytes and lymphocyte percentage in BALF in the experimental groups. Supplementation of G. tsugae also significantly reduced inflammatory mediators in BALE including histamine, prostaglandin E- 2, eotaxin, and protein levels, however the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL) - 1 and IL- 6, in BALF did not significantly change. T These results suggest that both G. tsugae supplementation diets YK 01 and YK 07 might alleviate bronchoalveolar inflammation via decreasing the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the secretion of inflammatory mediators into the local tissues of lungs and airways. Further, {{these results indicate that}} the relief of bronchoalveolar inflammation in an airway sensitization murine model provides a possible therapeutic application for G. tsugae in allergic asthma.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to assist the Government of Lesotho, and more particularly the Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC), in making a realistic assessment of the potential for growing mushrooms commercially in Lesotho. As mushroom cultivation would be new to Lesotho, specialised technical assistance was requested from FAO to advise on the general prospects for launching this industry in the country, and also to make a preliminary evaluation of an existing proposal for a joint venture project for Agaricus (button mushroom) production and processing. During the implementation of the project, an assessment was made of the outlook for developing Agaricus mushroom production for processing, with a view to utilising the facilities of the Basotho Fruit and Vegetable Canners more efficiently. This assessment was based on a study of the availability and cost of production and management inputs (many of which would have to be imported or acquired), as well as a detailed design of a mushroom farm to enable the calculation of unit production costs under prevailing local conditions and a profitability comparison of different methods of mushroom processing for export. The full analysis showed that, whilst intensive Agaricus mushroom growing and processing in Lesotho is technically possible, investment in such an undertaking would carry the risk of not being commercially feasible, considering the estimated cost and selling price levels, along with current conditions of saturation on the international market. It was therefore recommended that LNDC give due consideration to the analysis of projected production costs and the current situation on the international market for processed Agaricus mushrooms, when reviewing the existing joint venture proposal for a establishing a commercial mushroom production and processing plant in Lesotho. Certain factors contributing to the estimated cost disadvantage for Lesotho vis--vis other established producers are likely to remain constant, while others could change in time. Should there be an improvement in international markets for processed button mushrooms, coupled with a cheap and steady local supply of cereal straw and/or chicken manure for compost making become available, intensive production of Agaricus mushroom could be reconsidered. However, qualified management and skilled manpower, would have to be assured. Some efforts were made to assess whether another mushroom species - Lentinus edodes, the "Shiitake" or black <b>Chinese</b> <b>mushroom</b> - could offer some potential for cultivation in Lesotho. Shiitake keeps better and is less susceptible to temperature, humidity and disease than Agaricus and there is an increasing European market for both the fresh and dried product. Wheat straw and chicken manure are not used in the cultivation of Shiitake and the essential raw materials, such as sawdust and corncobs, may also be more cheaply and readily available locally. The outlook for Shiitake growing in Lesotho - from the market and economic point of view - may be somewhat more favourable, and may merit further investigation. It would not, however, be advisable to treat Shiitake production as the main prospect for diversification of export processing in Lesotho...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{production}} of oak mushrooms has steadily increased in Korea, but the mushroom market is plagued {{with a wave}} of falling prices and intensified competition as imports of <b>Chinese</b> oak <b>mushrooms</b> increase. Imported <b>Chinese</b> oak <b>mushrooms</b> are mostly grown on sawdust blocks, which are costly in Korea because of higher labor costs and log prices. Mushroom farmers, therefore, strive to seek ways to compete with <b>Chinese</b> oak <b>mushrooms,</b> and the use of broad-leaved tree species is under consideration to promote sawdust-based mushroom cultivation. Korean oak mushrooms are expected to be more competitive when they are grown on sawdust rather than log while imports of <b>Chinese</b> <b>mushrooms</b> are still limited due to difficulties sustaining freshness. However, there are some obstacles such as the acquisition of superior strains of mushroom to promote sawdust cultivation of oak mushroom. Thus, The study investigated the status of production and sales of oak mushroom and the intent of mushroom farmers toward mushroom culture in wooden trays by conducting a questionnaire survey involving mushroom farmers in the two cities in Gyeonggi Province. Results of the study revealed that there were differences in production volume and revenue per oak log between mushroom farmers in the two areas. Many farmers showed distrustful reactions towards strains distributed because of frequent loss and damages caused by purchased strains. It is, therefore, necessary to encourage farmers to increase productivity by standardizing culture techniques and supplying good strains of mushrooms. More farmers in Hwasung City are interested in mushroom cultivation in wooden trays, but farmers in Yongin City were less enthusiastic about mushroom cultivation in wooden trays after witnessing failures of other farmers. The findings of the study signifies the need for introducing effects of mushroom culture in wooden trays among mushroom farmers, and developing superior strains of mushrooms to promote mushroom growth using wooden trays...|$|R
