5|$|As Belle {{is walking}} down the road, she runs into The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why she <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind. After {{a moment of silence}} between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into an ordinary man, but becomes furious and shakes off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more important to him than she is. Belle admonishes him for not believing she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after the}} start of the second half of extra time Cardiff made their final substitution, {{replacing}} McNaughton with Darcy Blake. Two minutes later Kuyt made a run from deep in the Liverpool half, his initial shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded towards him. As the ball <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> he shot again and the ball went past Heaton and into the Cardiff goal to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. Cardiff were struggling after the goal with a number of their players suffering from cramp. Nevertheless, they had a chance in the 111th minute, when a Gunnarsson long throw was only half-cleared by Liverpool, but they were unable to convert the chance. Towards the end of the half Cardiff began to exert more pressure on Liverpool. Turner, who had been moved into the striker position won a corner for Cardiff, which was punched away by Reina for a throw-in. Cardiff won another from the throw, which found Kiss, whose shot was cleared off the line of the Liverpool goal by Kuyt for another corner. The subsequent corner was headed on by Gunnarsson to Turner, who beat Kuyt to the ball and put his shot past Reina into the Liverpool goal to level the score at 2–2. Turner was shown a yellow card for removing his shirt during the celebration of the goal. Liverpool won a corner with a minute remaining but they were unable to score and the referee brought extra time to an end with the scores level, resulting in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] "For this commandment that I command {{you this}} day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth, {{and in your}} heart," [...] a Midrash related the commandments to the human body. The Midrash taught that [...] bears out [...] "For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh." [...] Rabbi Hiyya taught {{that the law is}} a salve for the eye, an {{emollient}} for a wound, and a root-drink for the bowels. The law is a salve for the eye, as [...] says, [...] "The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes." [...] The law is an emollient for a wound, as [...] says, [...] "It shall be health to your navel."

[...] Another Midrash read [...] "For this commandment that I command you this day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth," [...] together with [...] "For they are life to those who find them," [...] to teach that the commandments are life for those who speak them aloud. The Midrash related that a disciple of Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob used to run through all of his study in a single hour, and when once when he fell ill, he forgot all that he had learned, because he did not speak the words out loud. When, however, Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob prayed for him, all his learning <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Another Midrash read [...] together with [...] to teach that the commandments are life to those who tell them to others. Another Midrash read [...] together with [...] "For they are life to those who find them," [...] to teach that the commandments are life to those who carry out the commandments completely, for Deuteronomy repeatedly says, [...] "all the commandment" [...] ( [...] , kol ha-mitzvah), which the Midrash taught means until one completely carries out all the precepts. And the Midrash taught that the conclusion of [...] "health to all their flesh," [...] refers to all the parts of the body, demonstrating the force of [...] "For this commandment that I command you this day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart." ...|$|E
