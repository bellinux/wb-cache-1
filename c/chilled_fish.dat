The primary objective of this research is to assess how Sri Lanka’s fish exports affected fish exports from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda (Lake Victoria region). Although the results show no significant price competition between the Lake Victoria region and Sri Lanka, the Lake Victoria countries are clearly worse off now that Sri Lanka is a major supplier of <b>chilled</b> <b>fish</b> to the E. U. A comparison of the two periods 2001 – 2004 and 2007 – 2009 finds that in the former period, past imports of Lake Victoria fish had a positive impact on present imports, indicating that importers developed a preference for Lake Victoria fish during this time; in the latter period, this effect no longer existed. Most important is the change in the responsiveness of imports from Lake Victoria to real aggregate expenditures on imported fish in the E. U. The results show that a lesser share of aggregate expenditures is allocated to the Lake Victoria region and that the region now benefits less from an increase in aggregate expenditures.

40|$|Liquid ice or binary ice is a {{new food}} {{chilling}} technique that requires less time to chill products and acts more uniformly than other types of ice. The practical advantage of binary ice is its pumpability. Moreover, {{on account of the}} microscopic size of the ice crystals, the main benefit of binary ice is its ability for rapid <b>chilling</b> of <b>fish</b> and to provide lower fish temperature, which in turn slows down both enzymatic and bacterial spoilage activity and hence maintains the fish in better quality.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of slaughtering by immersion in liquid ice on the quality of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) vs the commercial slaughter method by immersion in ice plus water. Quality was estimated by physico-chemical and sensory parameters immediately after death and during ice storage. Liquid ice reduced the time taken by fish until complete immobilisation; however the lowest temperature (≅- 2. 2 °C) attained by the liquid ice tank caused the appearance of cloudy eyes that significantly reduces the commercial value of the fish. © Springer-Verlag 2001.

Bacterial growth and shelf life models were validated under dynamic storage conditions with independent variable temperature experiments.

The growth data of pseudomonads, established as the specific spoilage organisms of aerobically stored gilt-head seabream, combined with data from previously published experiments, were used to model the effect of temperature on pseudomonad growth using a Belehradek type model. The nominal minimum temperature parameters of the Belehradek model (Tmin) for the maximum specific growth rate (μmax) and the lag phase (tLag) were determined to be − 11. 8 and − 12. 8 °C, respectively.

40|$|Atlantic cod is an {{important}} species for food production in Norway, and over the last couples of decades; Atlantic cod farming has gradually evolved as an industry in Norway. The harvesting procedures of farmed fish have gained major attention both in the aquaculture industry, research institutions and various organizations dealing with animal welfare issues. According to the legislations, the fish must be stunned before or {{at the same time}} as they are killed and remain unconscious until death supervenes. Adequate handling practices, methods of killing, and equipment are therefore needed. The overall aim of this study was to propose a ‘best practice’ processing line for stunned, bled, gutted, and chilled farmed Atlantic cod, which allows for good fish welfare, low handling stress, efficient bleeding, effective chilling, and maintenance of the intrinsic product quality as produced by farming. Different stunning and killing methods were tested: electrical stunning, AQUI-S TM anaesthesia, percussion stunning and carbon dioxide sedation with or without live <b>chilling.</b> <b>Fish</b> welfare and stress response of Atlantic cod exposed to the different stunning/killing methods were studied. Fish quality was assessed post rigor to assess possible connection between stunning methods and quality of the product. According to the EEG and ECG measurements, both AQUI-S TM anaesthesia (68 ml/l,) or euthanasia, electrical stunning in seawater (170 Hz 33 % duty cycle) and electrical stunning in air (107 Vrms for 15 sec) proved to be efficient stunning methods for cod. The fish can be rendered unconscious for a prolonged period of time. Doses of > 30 ml/l AQUI-S TM should be used for batchwise stunning of cod. Live chilling without an anaesthetic cannot be used as a sedation method for Atlantic cod. Furthermore, live chilling in seawater slurry cannot be recommended, since strong aversive reactions occurred immediately after transfer to the chilling tank. Carbon dioxide sedation at medium levels (245 - 284 mg/l) might be applicable as a potential sedation method for cod. At lower carbon dioxide levels (63 - 80 mg/l), adequate sedation was not achieved. Carbon dioxide sedation at high levels (330 - 550 mg/l) might be applicable, but further research is needed. However, carbon dioxide sedation at very high levels (400 - 1400 mg/l) the welfare of the fish seemed to be compromised. Percussion stunning proved to be a good killing (stunning) method based on handling stress assessments. Based on the quality assessments either of the bleeding methods, gill cutting and direct gutting, can be successfully applied for Atlantic cod. Despite the fact that pre-rigor filleting has several advantages like increased freshness and lower transportation costs, pre-rigor processing also presents problems. As seen in this study fillets cut post rigor were superior to fillets cut pre rigor in terms of various quality properties such as fillet colour, water content, water holding capacity. The shape of pre-rigor processed fillets was different from traditional post-rigor fillets. In terms of chilling efficiency, live-chilling of cod is as effective as traditional chilling using flake ice after gutting. The results do not indicate better freshness of superchilled cod (gutted or filleted) compared to cod stored in ice after 7 days. However, after 14 days of storage the potential advantages of superchilling of gutted cod became more prominent with lower microbiological activity, better maintenance of freshness compared with traditional ice stored cod. Assessments of fish welfare are difficult, and the only reliable assessments were ECG and EEG measurements, but these measurements are not applicable in the industry. Fish behaviour and assessments of Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) might be usable, but needs to be used with caution. Obtaining relevant blood parameters and interpretation of these related to both fish welfare and stress at the time of harvest can be complicated. Our results consistently showed that perimortem handling stress did not cause inferior flesh quality, and indicates that farmed cod can be processed with little risk of reducing product quality. This study has shown that Atlantic cod is not easily excitable, and is more resistant to handling stress than several other fish species. However, this fact should not neglect attention to handling practices since gentle handling is a pre-requisite for adequate fish welfare. Based on the results from this thesis a processing line for farmed Atlantic cod is suggested and presented in the thesis PhD i bioteknologiPhD in Biotechnolog...|$|R
