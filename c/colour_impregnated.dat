40|$|Study results {{obtained}} {{by the use of}} permethrin impregnated cloths against the dengue haemorrhagic fever vector Aedes aegypti (L) are reported and discussed. Field trials were carried out in sub-district of Ungaran, Semarang regency. Houses were provided with cloths made of 65 % polyester fiber 35 % combed cotton, brown <b>colour</b> <b>impregnated</b> with permethrin 25 %EC with a dosage of 0. 40 ga. i. /m 2 installed on the wall close to resting or breeding places of Ae. aegypti in the houses. Entomological data collected during the period 1987 - 88 showed residual permethrin activity for about 1 to 2 months and population density of Ae. aegypti indoor was slightly decreased. </p...|$|E
40|$|Tasmanite is an oil-shale {{known to}} occur in the Permocarboniferous (1) of the North and North-Western districts of Tasmania. The shale is of {{sedimentary}} origin and is brownish grey in <b>colour,</b> being largely <b>impregnated</b> with spores which have been named by Newton as Tasmanites punctatus Newt. (2). On distillation the shale yields an artificial petroleum which is claimed to be C:btained from these spores (3). T•hus it is chiefly for its economic importance rather than palreo-botanical that it has been engaging the attention of investigators ·from time to time...|$|R
5000|$|My {{work has}} become an {{investigation}} into perception, specifically what one sees, and how one experiences the act of seeing. I have been recording colour and light, and their fleeting playfulness. I am intrigued {{by the way they}} can appear but also dissolve from our vision. Light and colour are central to my work, but journey and silence have always been the fundamental starting points…I sometimes experience an instant of acute beauty during which something (ordinarily hidden) is briefly illuminated. This sublime glimmer of colour or light is fleeting, unlikely to be seen or experienced again. I am attempting to document light’s ephemeral nature, noticing subtle <b>colours,</b> which <b>impregnate</b> both our true vision and that of the outside world. By observing and experiencing existence so intently, it becomes hard to look past light’s trickeries, its transient and weightless nature...I want my work to be experienced rather than read, and I like to play with ideas that almost don't exist in physical reality.

40|$|The optical {{properties}} and degradation of fir wood treated by different inorganic salts, which are components of waterborne wood preservatives, were studied {{before and after}} wet-thermal accelerated ageing (T= 85 °C, RH= 65 %, for 30 days) using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The <b>colour</b> of all <b>impregnated</b> samples {{was due to the}} same chromophoric structures, thus revealing that the primary reactions leading to colour changes are essentially very similar. These chemically treated as well as standard (non-treated, unaged) and reference (treated only with distilled water, unaged/aged) samples have a significant absorption band at 358 nm, along with a shoulder near 265 nm of various intensity. The broad band at higher wavelength is attributed to the chromophoric structures derived especially from lignin, i. e. quinones, stilbenes, charge transfer complexes causing a bathochromic shift and other conjugated carbonyl structures. Coniferaldehyde is also a major contributor to this absorption. The band at 265 nm belongs to chromophores arising predominantly from carbohydrate degradation products, i. e. furan derivatives, quinone-type derivatives, catechol structures. Catechol structures (colourless) form coloured complexes with transition metal cations (Cu 2 +, Fe 3 +) or are oxidized to form highly coloured benzoquinone structures. Alkaline solutions of borax cause the reduction of conjugated and non-conjugated carbonyls and the degradation of coniferaldehyde. Generally, after ageing, the samples show higher absorptions in the visible region of the spectra in comparison with the unaged ones, which explains their yellowing and loss of brightness after the action of elevated temperature and moisture...|$|R
