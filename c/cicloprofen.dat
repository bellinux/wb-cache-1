40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} radiometric method {{to determine the}} individual enantiomers of <b>cicloprofen</b> has been developed. “C-Cicloprofen was converted to its L-leucine diastereoisomers. which were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantified by measuring the radioactivity in the area corresponding to each individual diastereoisomer. This technique has also been {{used to measure the}} enantiomers of unlabeled <b>cicloprofen</b> by condensing with “C-labeled L-leucine. By using the radiometric method, a unique biotransformation process. the inversion of the (-) -enantiomer of a-methylfluorene- 2 -acetic acid to its (+) -enantiomer. has been demonstrated in the rat and monkey. The rate of (-) - to (+) - inversion was found to be faster in the rat than in the monkey. After single or repeated oral administration of the racemic modification or the (-) -enantiomer of <b>cicloprofen</b> to both species. the ratio of (+) - to I-) -enantiomers of <b>cicloprofen</b> in plasma, urine, or bile increased with time. At 5. 22. and 48 hr after oral administration of a single 50 -mg/kg dose of the (-) -enantiomer. “C-cicloprofen in rat plasma contained 20. 50. and 79 %. respec-tively. of the (+) -enantiomer. After receiving the same dose of (-) -enantiomer. monkey plasm...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{reactive}} zinc {{was prepared}} by electrolysis of a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution containing naphthalene and a supporting electrolyte in a one-compartment cell {{fitted with a}} platinum cathode and a zinc anode. This highly reactive electrogenerated zinc (EGZn/Naph) was used for transformation of ethyl 2 -bromoacrylate into the corresponding organozinc compound, {{which can not be}} achieved by the use of usual zinc metals. Reaction of the organozinc compound thus prepared various aryl halides in the presence of 5 % or palladium catalyst gave the corresponding cross-coupling products in high yields. These cross-coupling reactions were successfully applied to a synthesis of, the precursor of anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen, naproxen, <b>cicloprofen</b> and suprofen...|$|E
