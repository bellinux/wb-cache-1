By different {{laser cladding}} parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties under the comparative analysis, {{to make a}} more detailed discussion of laser cladding power and scanning speed {{on the quality of}} laser cladding. Different process parameters on the microstructure of <b>cladding</b> <b>layer</b> and the <b>cladding</b> <b>layer</b> of particle distribution and the tissue distribution of species. We get to the study that type and distribution of the <b>cladding</b> <b>layer</b> microstructure and tissue distribution of tungsten carbide hard phase. We get regular pattern that technological parameter has an effect on the quality of <b>cladding</b> <b>layer.</b> We can {{came to the conclusion that}} the best cladding process parameters is in the power of 3. 0 KW and cladding speed 1000 mm/min...|$|R
