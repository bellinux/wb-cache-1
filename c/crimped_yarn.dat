This paper shows {{that it is necessary}} to experimentally measure material constants of yarns for having good input parameters of the model. Effects of yarn Poisson's ratio, transverse and shear modulus on impact behaviors of a simple <b>crimped</b> <b>yarn</b> and a complete fabric have been carried out. The effect of the Poisson's ratio can be negligible in both impact cases: on a single <b>crimped</b> <b>yarn</b> and a complete fabric. The same conclusion has been proven for the effect of the transversal modulus except the cases of its so low values that can cause yarn early damage. The shear modulus of a yarn appears to be an important material parameter that mainly influences the ballistic performance of a two-dimensional plain-woven fabric. When using a very high value of a shear modulus of yarn, a crimped single yarn is broken immediately after contact with projectile in pure shearing mode...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} to {{determine}} yarn bending and torsional rigidities was proposed in this paper. Measuring methods of yarn bending and yarn torsion were reviewed. The proposed method {{is a combination}} of theoretical modeling, instrumentation and statistical analysis. One major feature of this method is that bending and torsional rigidities of a naturally curved yarn, like those yarns in knitted fabrics, can be measured. With the aid of modeling, a recently developed <b>Crimped</b> <b>Yarn</b> Length Measurement Instrument (CLI) is able to measure both bending and torsional rigidities at the same time. The CLI generates a large amount of data points for the force and extension relationship during the decrimping of the curved yarn, multiple regression analysis was applied to determine bending and torsional rigidities. In this way, the experimental errors can be minimized and hence more representative results can be obtained. Experimental results from the new proposed method were compared with those measured by the KES-F bending tester and the KES-YN yarn torsion tester; good agreement was evident in testing results from both methods. The advantages of the proposed method were discussed including the capability of measuring the yarn bending rigidity at higher curvature. This is part 1 of the paper in which crimped nylon monofilament was used for the study. The measurements of bending and torsion moduli of crimped short staple spun yarn unraveled from knitted fabric will be further studied in Part 2. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

In this work, a 3 D finite-element {{model of}} the {{ballistic}} impact of a multi-layered plain-woven aramid fabric style 720 (Kevlar ® 129 fibre, 1420 denier, 20 × 20 yarns per inch) impacted by a 6. 7 -mm spherical projectile was built at the mesoscale in Abaqus/Explicit by modelling individual <b>crimped</b> <b>yarns.</b> Material properties and yarn geometry for the model were obtained from reported experimental observations.

40|$|Braided {{composite}} materials {{are currently being}} evaluated for wing skin stiffeners on commercial aircraft. These carbon-fiber/epoxy materials allow for low-cost manufacturing while maintaining high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. The proposed braid architecture consists of axial carbon fiber yarns and braider carbon fiber yarns making 60 deg to 70 deg angles {{with respect to the}} axial yarns. These 2 -D triaxial braids are produced as long, continuous tubes, which are flattened, cut, and stacked to produce the desired part thickness and shape. When infiltrated with epoxy resin and cured under a compaction pressure, the fiber <b>yarns</b> become <b>crimped,</b> allowing for higher fiber packing. Although high fiber packing is desirable, <b>yarn</b> <b>crimping</b> (especially in the axial fiberyarns) is undesirable. Significant axial <b>yarn</b> <b>crimp</b> angles (greater than 10 deg) have been measured in braided composites. Comparable levels of crimping have been found to produce significant compressive strength reductions in laminated composites consisting of planar fiber sheets. Thus, axial <b>yarn</b> <b>crimping</b> is suspected of producing significant reductions in compressive strength allowables for braided composites. The objective of this research is to quantify the reduction in compressive strength as a function of axial <b>yarn</b> <b>crimp</b> severity. Since crimp severity can be reduced by lowering the compaction pressure during curing, the resulting compressive strengths may be used to determine optimum processing conditions. A 'cure-on-the-loom' manufacturing process was developed to produce braided composites with controlled levels of crimping. This method allowed for controlled levels of tension to be placed on the axial yarns and maintained during the curing process. With increasing tension, the crimp severity in the axial yarns was reduced. Thus, varying crimp severities were produced ranging from conventional levels (greater than 10 deg) to virtually straight axial yarns. Test results indicate that a 30 % increase in compressive strength is obtainable by eliminating axial <b>yarn</b> <b>crimping.</b> Further compression testing is underway to quantify the relationship between crimp severity and compressive strength. Additional testing is planned to investigate the effect of crimping on the open-hole compressive strength, often considered a more significant design allowable...|$|R

Yarn {{count of the}} thread was taken instead of the thread ticket number value to minimize the approximation errors occurring in ticket number calculations. Fabric thickness was measured following the test standard of BS 2544, methods for determination of thickness of textile materials (British standards institution 1987). Yarn counts of threads were measured using ASTM D 1907, standard method of test for yarn number by the skein method (ASTM International 1997). Thread consumption and average thread tension were measured using MLT Wesco tension and length meter with the accuracy up to 1  mm and 0.1 cN respectively.

Experimental work on three fabrics, made from 100 % cotton, with different pile ratios and yarn densities was conducted during wet processing. Areal density, dimensional stability, <b>yarn</b> <b>crimp</b> and <b>yarn</b> densities were investigated at three {{different stages of}} wet processing namely greige state, bleached state and dyed state. Results showed an increase in dimensional contractions as pile ratio was increased. Fabric dimensions were measured after each processing stage, and the widthwise contractions were between 2. 4 % and 7. 9 % for all the fabrics whereas the lengthwise contractions were between 9. 7 % and 14. 6 %. Areal density was determined using two methods thus by manual measurement and also by calculation. The measure and calculated result both showed that the areal density for each fabrics increased during all stages of wet processing. Generally warp crimp was higher than weft crimp for all the three fabrics, at all three stages of fabric ion. Weft crimp was between 2 % and 7 % whereas warp crimp was between 6 % and 14 %. The measured and calculated results were compared and analyzed using regression analysis methods, and {{it was found that}} there was a correlation between the measured and the calculated results.

Knitting is also gaining importance for composite materials performing. Basically two principles are in use [1 - 3]. i) Weft knitting gives structures of for example traditional sweaters types suitable for structures taking impact loads. ii) Warp knitting gives the traditional tricot structures and the non <b>crimped</b> insert <b>yarn</b> DOS-fabrics extensively used for composite materials fabrication. In the knitting process do hooked needles pick up yarns and form closed loops. The stability of the loop formation depends on the bending of the fibres and type of friction on the needles during the different stages of the knitting process. The characteristics of static friction when the yarn is drawn by the needles into the machine, sliding friction in the loop formation and release after loop formation are of vital importance for the final product. The complexity of the yarn behaviour, the far from ideal mechanical and tribological behaviour of the fibres are mastered by many knitters. The history of knitting indicate the same kind of phenomena as indicated by the history of the steam engine: ”Science owes more to the steam engine than the steam engine owes to science”, lord Kelvin. The knitting process has however been modelled from first principles using models for friction of fibres on positively curved surfaces and simultaneous plastic deformation. A method and fixtures based on earlier work by Andersson et. al adopted for tests of the stress build up in fibres on knitting needles in order to study the knitting process in a tensile testing machine have been developed [3 - 5].

In contrast to unidirectional composites, the yarn interlacing pattern in textile composites causes heterogeneous strain fields with large strain gradients around the <b>yarn</b> <b>crimp</b> regions. In addition, depending on the local constraints that are imposed by the surrounding plies, the deformation behaviour of the laminate inner layers may vary {{from that of the}} surface layers, which are relatively more free to deform, compared to the inner layers. In order to validate the above hypothesis, the local strains on the composite surface were measured using digital image correlation technique (LIMESS).

40|$|The use of {{traditional}} two-dimensional (2 D) fibre preforms can {{be associated with}} poor out-of-plane and interlaminar mechanical performance, particularly in response to impact loads. Such preforms comprise multiple plies which necessitate labour-intensive ply cutting and assembly steps. 3 D woven textiles, due to the incorporation of through-thickness yarns, have been found to exhibit superior out-of-plane mechanical properties whilst simultaneously reducing ply-assembly time and cost (single-piece preform construction). Their delamination resistance and damage tolerance have been extensively investigated over the last number of years; however, there is a paucity of published work on their in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical properties when compared to their 2 D counterparts. Thus, this research details a comprehensive mechanical characterisation of an orthogonal 3 D woven composite in comparison with a suitable 2 D laminate. Composite panels have been manufactured with Henkel’s Loctite BZ 9130 benzoxazine resin by means of the EADS-patented vacuum assisted process (VAP®). In-plane compressive performance, impact damage resistance, damage tolerance, and out-of-plane tensile behaviour have been evaluated for both reinforcement architectures. Coupons were subjected to an energy level of 6 Joules per millimetre of laminate thickness by means of a drop-weight impact tower. Damage resistance was quantified as a function of impact damage area using penetrant-enhanced x-radiography (PEXR). Combined loading compression (CLC) tests were performed to complement compression after impact (CAI) testing which was conducted to evaluate the materials’ damage tolerance. Furthermore, out-of-plane tensile (OPT) testing has been performed on cruciform coupons using a novel test method. The experimental data revealed a 7. 5 % higher compressive strength for the 2 D material, which was expected due to the presence of <b>crimp</b> and <b>yarn</b> misalignments within the 3 D woven material. In contrast, the 3 D material performed better than the 2 D laminate for all other tests with 13 % lower damage area, 15. 5 % higher residual compressive strength and 36. 8 % higher mean out-of-plane tensile strength. It can thus be concluded that the incorporation of through-thickness yarn components can lead to significant improvements in damage resistance and tolerance by arresting the growth of delamination and limiting the growth of localised damage. Furthermore, when loaded in the out-of-plane direction, as with the OPT test configuration, much of the load is borne by the z-binder bundles rather than the much weaker fibre-matrix interface (as is the case with 2 D laminates), and consequently, the OPT strengths are higher in the 3 D woven composites. Limitations of this test method have been identified and recommendations for further development are presented in the concluding remarks...|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{geometric}} representation of fabrics {{is essential for}} modelling of mechanical and physical properties of textiles and textile composites. It is also advantageous {{to be able to}} generate those models quickly and easily. Recent developments in TexGen which automate the creation of models for 3 D orthogonal, angle interlock and layer-to-layer fabrics and sheared 2 D fabrics are described. Micro-Computed Tomography data of 3 D fabrics has been used to identify geometrical characteristics which have formed the basis for implementation of refinements to the idealised fabrics generated automatically in TexGen. In 3 D orthogonal textiles local geometrical variations, particularly in <b>yarn</b> cross-section, surface <b>crimp</b> and binder <b>yarn</b> path are apparent at different levels of compaction. The “refine” option in TexGen‟s 3 D wizard automatically adjusts these features to achieve compaction to a specified thickness, using yarn volume fraction as a constraint. For sheared textiles a generic 2 D plain weave fabric was used to identify key geometric features. Yarn rotation has been identified as one of these and the geometric description of the sheared fabric considers yarn rotations in terms of two elliptical cylinders crossing each other at an oblique angle. The rotational angle is derived mathematically from the tangential contact between yarns. Variations in yarn height {{along the length of the}} yarn have also been identified and both of these features are incorporated into a refine function for sheared textiles. Compatible voxelised mesh and periodic boundary conditions for the sheared domain have also been implemented. The models have been used to generate manufacturing data: permeability data for the 3 D fabric and coefficient of thermal expansion for the sheared 2 D fabric...|$|R
