This interchange with I-95 (to east of Baltimore city) is a fully directional interchange where the carriageways of both routes <b>crossed</b> <b>over</b> each other onto the opposite side, then <b>crossed</b> <b>over</b> each other again; {{at the site of}} each crossover, left-hand entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for directional flyovers. In 2008, interchange reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the left-hand entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining left-hand entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were now on the right, and I-95's opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695's still did).|$|E
