40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{development}} of Savings and Credit Cooperatives in Mekelle Zone. The fundamental objective {{of this study is to}} asses and documents the evolution, performance and challenges of SACCOs in Mekelle Zone. A randomly selected seven sample SACCOs were taken to investigate the status, and their outreach performance based on the commonly accepted growth dimensions: governance, service delivery, financial performance and institutional capacity. A review of relevant documents and interview schedule were prepared and administered with randomly selected members and various committee members. Employee based SACCOs have laid the foundation in the development of SACCOs in Mekelle. SACCOs have shown a noticeable increase in number size diversity of membership post the over through of the command economy. They have increased from 8 prior the end of the command economy to 24 at present. The average membership per SACCO was 127 at the end of June 2006 / 7. Women share of membership was 33. 3 percent. They have expanded in their type of membership base to include some community based members such as: small traders and women traders working in the zone. Regarding governance of the SACCOs, they have a well-developed by law that portrays the hierarchical relationship of various committees giving the ultimate ruling power to the general assembly. How ever absenteeism and inactive and inactive participation is commonly observed in the SACCOs. Besides, women have been under represented in committees and general assembly meetings are not usually conducted on schedule. The SACCOs offer limited financial service. The types of the saving products offered by all SACCOs under the present survey are limited to shares, <b>compulsory</b> <b>deposits</b> and voluntary deposits. They have exhibited substantial growth in the amount of saving they mobilize and deposit per member. The SACCOs offer loans to their members mainly for construction of dwellings, purchase of house furniture, educational fees, medical and hospitalization expenses with repayment period ranging between 2 and 3 years. The Interest rate the SACCOs charge is not adequate to cover fund cost, operating expenses, acceptable range of profit margin and inflation. The SACCOs have exhibited substantial growth in the amount of loan they disburse. They have achieved good repayment performance As far as financial performance is concerned, the saving amount in relation to the total assets for the SACCOs was found to be with in the range of standard of excellence set by WOCCU. On the other hand, the members share to total assets was less than the standard of excellence in majority of the SACCOs. In terms of institutional capital to total asset, they have not maintained the standard of excellence. The SACCOs data under study reveals no delinquency so far. Majority of the SACCOs, have maintained the standard of excellence set on operating expense to total asset ratio; on the other hand, the net income to assets was compared unfavorably to the standard of excellence 10 percent. This is due to the lowest service price they charge to members. Even though the SACCOs are endowed with well educated members, they lack training and education opportunities. They gave little emphasis on training committee members. They also are constrained lack of office, office equipment and facilities. The factors that that limit the SACCOs’ growth identified in the study were: inadequate support and weak regulation and supervision, limited expansion in size and type of membership, inadequate efforts to enhance self governance, limited saving and loan products offered by SACCOs, absence of non financial services, inadequate service charges, poor financial performance, absence of training and educational opportunities, lack of office, office furniture and equipment, and poor record handling and inappropriate information system. Finally the study has proposed various interventions to be undertaken by stakeholders such as: training intervention, enabling the SACCOs be self reliant, active regulatory measures, diversified membership, diversified products, regularly revised service price, and developing appropriate information system...|$|E

40|$|This study {{compares the}} access of group and {{individual}} farmer-clients {{to the credit}} services of microfinance institutions in Enugu State, Nigeria. The {{study was designed to}} ascertain specifically the factors that determine access, the reasons for differences in the levels of access by the respondents as well as their perceptions {{of the effects of the}} credit guidelines of MFIs on their levels of access. A total of 72 respondents, 36 individuals and 36 groups, were randomly selected for the study. Multiple regression analysis, Levene’s test for equality of means as well as Likert Rating Scale were used for data analysis. Regression result showed that years of experience in farming, size of farm, credit history, size of income from farming, value of collateral, interest rate, <b>compulsory</b> <b>deposit</b> requirement and distance to MFIs affected access for both group and individual clients. Levene’s test for equality of mean scores of the group and the individual clients were statistically significantly (p> 0. 05) different. Likert Rating result indicate that MFI credit guidelines such as minimum deposit requirement, interest rate and loan size were perceived as constraints by group clients while individual clients perceived, in addition to these, provision of acceptable surety as hindrances to their access to MFI credit. Group lending option scored better than the individual option suggesting that insistence on group formation still remains a better approach to accessing MFI credit...|$|R

40|$|Microfinance, the {{provision}} of small individual and business loans, has witnessed dramatic growth, reaching over 150 million borrowers worldwide. Much of its success {{has been attributed to}} overcoming the challenges of information asymmetries in uncollateralized lending. Yet, very {{little is known about the}} optimal contract structure of such loans [...] there is substantial variation across lenders, even within a particular setting. This paper exploits a plausibly exogenous change in the liability structure offered by a microfinance program in India, which shifted from individual to group liability lending. The analysis finds compelling evidence that contract structure matters: for the same borrower, required monthly loan installments are 6 percent less likely to be missed under the group liability setting, relative to individual liability. In addition, <b>compulsory</b> savings <b>deposits</b> are 19 percent less likely to be missed under group liability contracts.

40|$|Abstract: The {{focus of}} this paper is a {{comparison}} between the Japanese Fiscal Investment and Loan Program (FILP), a huge government credit program, and the German system of policy-based finance. We have found the German system to be quite {{different from that of the}} Japanese counter-part. While the German institutions provide loans mainly through private banks, leaving the loan default risk with them, the Japanese government banks lend to companies or households directly. We discuss the advantag-es and the disadvantages of these two systems, the major advantage of the German system being that it offers a better mix of public and private risk taking. We also discuss the reform of the FILP due to come into force in April 2001, which will abolish the <b>compulsory</b> <b>deposit</b> of postal savings and government pension funds to the Trust Fund Bureau of Ministry of Finance and thus to the FILP system, and introduce policy cost analysis. These measures will lead to better accountability of the institutions in-volved and improve the process of decision-making. In addition, we also consider the guarantee systems which supplement and substitute public sector loans. Analysis reveals that in Japan there are moral hazard prob-lems within this framework. Apart from this, we also look at the role of public financial institutions outside their role in policy-based lending and investment. We argue that nowadays, in the absence of clear public tasks for postal savings in Japan, the savings banks and especially the Landes-banks in Germany, it is difficult to justify public guarantees for these insti-tutions. Therefore, measures should be taken to either clearly define their public sector tasks, to clearly limit the activities of these institutions or to abolish the government guarantees. 1 The authors are grateful for helpful comments by Werner Pascha, Takahashi Yôichi, an anonymous referee and the editors on earlier drafts of this paper.
