5|$|Hashimoto ordered I-58 northward {{looking for}} {{additional}} ships to attack. She picked up {{reports of the}} atomic bombing of Hiroshima in intercepted radio transmissions on 7 August but Hashimoto continued to hunt for Allied ships south of Bungo Strait. On 9 August she launched two kaitens against a convoy, and Hashimoto claimed a destroyer probably sunk. On 12 August he launched his remaining kaitens and claimed a merchant ship probably sunk. I-58 surfaced in Bungo Strait on 15 August, where Hashimoto learned of the Gyokuon-hōsō signaling the Japanese surrender {{and end of the}} war. She traveled up the Inland Sea and arrived at Hirao where Hashimoto emotionally informed his crew {{of the end of the}} war. After the war, it was confirmed Indianapolis was the only ship I-58 had sunk. It was the last Japanese naval success of World War II. When Hashimoto <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war, he learned that his entire family had been killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 7 August.|$|E
25|$|Lewis <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war {{to share}} a cottage in Wargrave {{with some of his}} service friends; they were Noël Coward's {{audience}} for his reading of his first play, The Rat Trap. Lewis began his career in insurance with Sedgwick and Collins, brokers with Lloyd's of London. During 1919 and 1920, despite his resignation from flying, Lewis began writing about aviation safety while he began his career as an insurance broker. He also wrote Wings Over the Somme 1916–1918, his memoir of his war experiences. At some point during this time, Lewis also served as the Recorder of Chesterfield.|$|E
500|$|Inspired {{partially}} by Debra, {{and partially}} by {{his desire to}} be a better family man than Arthur, Dexter considers giving up killing people. After convincing his wife Rita (Julie Benz) to go safely out of town, Dexter searches for Arthur, eventually tracking him down and capturing him. Dexter insists he is not like Arthur, but Arthur insists they are both the same. Right before he is killed with a framing hammer, Arthur tells Dexter [...] "It's already over." [...] Disposing of Arthur's body on his boat afterwards, Dexter comes to realize that his love for his family is starting to outweigh his need to kill, and he begins to hope for a future without killing. But upon returning home, he finds a message from Rita that she <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> airport because she forgot her identification. Dexter returns her phone call, only to find that Rita's cell phone and bags are in the house. Dexter hears Harrison crying in the bathroom and finds Rita dead in the bathtub. Harrison sits in a pool of Rita's blood on the bathroom floor, in the same manner that Dexter was left in a pool of his mother's blood during his youth, which gave Dexter his murderous tendencies.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara related a {{story about}} how to give to the poor. A poor man lived in Mar Ukba's {{neighbor}}hood, and every day Mar Ukba would put four zuz into the poor man's door socket. One day, the poor man thought that he would try to find out who did him this kindness. That day Mar Ukba <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> house of study with his wife. When the poor man saw them moving the door to make their donation, the poor man went to greet them, but they fled and ran into a furnace from which the fire had just been swept. They did so because, as Mar Zutra bar Tobiah said in the name of Rav (or others say Rav Huna bar Bizna said in the name of Rabbi Simeon the Pious, and still others say Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai), it is better for a person to go into a fiery furnace than to shame a neighbor publicly. One can derive this from [...] where Tamar, who was subject to being burned for the adultery with which Judah had charged her, rather than publicly shame Judah with the facts of his complicity, sent Judah's possessions to him with the message, [...] "By the man whose these are am I with child." ...|$|E
