[...] The local settlers resented Bradburn's efforts to withhold land titles {{from those who}} had squatted in unauthorized areas. [...] They were further angered by his attempts to enforce <b>customs</b> <b>laws</b> which had been largely ignored. [...] The hard feelings escalated when Bradburn, following Mexican law, refused to return runaway slaves to their owners in the United States. [...] After receiving a hoax letter claiming that armed men were marching on Anahuac to retrieve runaway slaves, Bradburn arrested local lawyers William Barret Travis, Patrick Churchill Jack. Settlers were outraged that Travis did not receive some of the protections offered by the United States Bill of Rights, even though these rights were not guaranteed in Mexico. [...] A large force of Texians marched on Anahuac to secure Travis's release. [...] The resulting confrontation forced Bradburn's expulsion from Texas and encouraged other immigrants to take armed action against Mexican soldiers. [...] As {{a result of his}} actions, Bradburn was [...] "one of the most maligned men in historical accounts of" [...] Texas in the 19th century.|$|E

2500|$|Julius Caesar {{describes}} Gaul at {{the time}} of his conquests (58–51 BC) as divided into three parts, inhabited by the Aquitani in the southwest, the Gauls of the biggest central part, who in their own language were called Celtae, and the Belgae in the north. Each of these three parts was different in terms of <b>customs,</b> <b>laws,</b> and language. He noted that the Belgae, were [...] "the bravest of the three peoples, being farthest removed from the highly developed civilization of the Roman Province, least often visited by merchants with enervating luxuries for sale, and nearest to the Germans across the Rhine, with whom they are continually at war". Ancient sources such as Caesar are not always clear about the things used to define ethnicity today. While Caesar or his sources described the Belgae as distinctly different from the Gauls, Strabo stated that the differences between the Celts (Gauls) and Belgae, in countenance, language, politics, and way of life was a small one, unlike the difference between the Aquitanians and Celts. The fact that the Belgae were living in Gaul means that in one sense they were Gauls. This may be Caesar's meaning when he says [...] "The Belgae have the same method of attacking a fortress as the rest of the Gauls." ...|$|E
