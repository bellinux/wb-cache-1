5000|$|A tree tent is a <b>camping</b> <b>tent</b> {{designed}} to be set above the ground, usually attached to or supported by the neighboring trees. Like a tent, {{it must be a}} complete enclosure that can house a camper and his or her gear while suspended off the ground. [...] Like tree houses, a tree tent may be accessed via a rope ladder and provide a sheltered environment for recreation and various outdoor activities. The portable nature of this type of shelter provides for more versatile location choice than a conventional tree house or a <b>camping</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|E

50|$|She {{achieves}} that {{by exploring}} different architectural interiors, from church and bedroom to <b>camping</b> <b>tent</b> and elevator. How she decides which spaces to visit involves both conceptual thinking and intuitive process. Once {{she finds a}} location {{that she wants to}} work with, Venables goes back with her camera and takes pictures from different angles. Venables is always aware of how her view of the room changes as she moves around. By taking pictures of all possible angles, Venables has a more intimate understanding of the three-dimensional space she is in. She successfully conveys this awareness in her final production.|$|E

5000|$|... 2010 - {{a five-year-old}} girl was {{bitten by a}} coyote while she was walking {{with her parents and}} their dog in Vernon, British Columbia. [...] An eastern coyote bit a {{sleeping}} sixteen-year-old girl on the head twice in her tent while she was camping with her parents at Cape Breton Highlands National Park in Ingonish, Nova Scotia. She was taken to a hospital for stitches and treatment to prevent any rabies. Two teenage Boy Scouts were bitten a coyote while they were sleeping outside their <b>camping</b> <b>tent</b> near Pole 3 in Port Aransas, Texas.

40|$|Are the {{chemicals}} applied to your <b>camping</b> <b>tent</b> {{to protect you}} from fire actually harming you and the environment? Commercially available camping tents are required to meet a flammability standard, which is most often done through application of flame retardant chemicals. Many flame retardant chemicals have been demonstrated to leach from products, accumulate in people, persist in the environment and, potentially, have toxic effects on humans and wildlife. In this study, we measured human exposure to flame retardants in camping tents through experimental simulations using five leading brands of backpacking tents. Data collected from this exposure study and from the published literature on toxicity and hazard were then used to formulate a guide for industry {{that can be used to}} help them make more informed decisions about the use of flame retardants in their products...|$|E

50|$|Little Horseshoe Park {{became the}} site of a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) base {{beginning}} in May 1933.

5000|$|From the 1900s, Freshwater was {{a popular}} working-men-only <b>camp.</b> <b>Tents</b> soon gave way to huts with names like [...] "The Ritz" [...] and [...] "Shark Bait".

30|$|Almost half (49.5 %) of the {{subjects}} within our sample were displaced from their homes. Approximately 35 % were housed within <b>camp</b> <b>tents</b> (about 170 <b>camp</b> <b>tents</b> were installed by National Civil Protection), {{and the majority of}} these subjects complained about a loss of privacy. More than 10 % of our sample organized temporary accommodations, individually, with camper vans and tents close to their damaged property. Only a minority (less than 9 %) of subjects remained at their homes within small rural villages that were close to L’Aquila; however, these villages experienced were less damage. Approximately 30 % of subjects (mainly students who were not residents of the town) went back home and were commuting; they had to come back to L’Aquila frequently for their studies. About 10 % relocated with relatives and friends or to hotels on the Abruzzo Adriatic Sea coast.|$|R

5000|$|The Hoerikwaggo Trails {{were four}} hiking trails on the Cape Peninsula Mountain Chain ranging {{from two to}} six days, {{operated}} by South African National Parks (SANPARKS) between the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront and Cape Point.
