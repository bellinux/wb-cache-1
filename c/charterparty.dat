If the exporter needs the whole (or a very substantial part) of the ship's cargo capacity, the exporter may need to charter the vessel, and he will enter into a <b>charterparty</b> agreement with the shipowner.|$|E

The invitation to Nordisk’s founding meeting in Copenhagen said {{the purpose of the}} association would be “to work in the interest of shipping”. A key reason for its establishment was to organize shipowners in a common effort to avoid unreasonable <b>charterparty</b> clauses imposed by charterers in the prevailing poor market. This included working to develop standardized charter parties. One of the documents Nordisk worked on was the Baltcon <b>charterparty,</b> which became the first document of BIMCO in 1908.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of trouble is taken, by {{draftsman}} of voyage <b>charterparties,</b> to apportion risks of delay between owners and charterers at loading and discharge. Care must be taken over the commencement of laytime, {{the circumstances in which}} notice of readiness can be tendered, and exceptions and interruptions to laytime and demurrage. The complexities of demurrage alone have been judicially described as 'hideous': and no doubt the same sentiments can equally apply to laytime. This careful apportionment of delay risk can be entirely upset if the delay occurs before laytime is triggered. If charterers are held to have committed a breach of an independent term, preventing the laytime from running, damages will be for detention and neither layime nor demurrage provisions will be triggered. Charterers will lose the benefit of their laytime, and neither side will enjoy the convenience of the liquidated damages provided by the demurrage regime. This article considers two problems in this regard which could arise from recent decisions of the courts; first, the widening of safe port and safe berth obligations to encompass delay, and secondly, the implication of such terms into <b>charterparties.</b> Whatever view may be taken of these developments generally, neither is desirable in the contect of careful risk apportionment. To date, the courts have to some extent embraced the first, while fortunately restricting the second...|$|R

5000|$|Hong Kong Fir Shipping hired {{out their}} elderly ship, [...] the [...] "Hong Hong Fir", under a two-year time {{charter-party}} to Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha. It was to sail in ballast from Liverpool {{to collect a}} cargo at Newport News, Virginia, and then to proceed via Panama to Osaka. A term in the <b>charterparty</b> agreement required the ship to be seaworthy and to be [...] "in every way fitted for ordinary cargo service." [...] However the crew were both insufficient in number and incompetent to maintain her old-fashioned machinery; and the chief engineer was a drunkard. On the voyage from Liverpool to Osaka, the engines suffered several breakdowns, and was off-hire {{for a total of}} five weeks, undergoing repairs. On arrival at Osaka, a further fifteen weeks of repairs were needed before the ship was seaworthy again. By this time, barely seventeen months of the two-year time-charter remained. Once in Osaka, market freight rates fell, and Kawasaki terminated the contract citing Hong Kong's breach. Hong Kong responded that Kawasaki were now the party in breach for wrongfully repudiating the contract.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to analyze}} the safe port warranty under the English law. The issues of safe port warranty have always been considered as those that require lengthy legal analysis in practise. This statement seems to be valid even today. In accordance with the recently published data, ship incidents at port have constituted the largest loss claims in the latest years. From this perspective, the matters of the safe port warranty should form a subject of charterers and shipowners interest. However, some authors claim {{that there is an}} obvious lack of accurate understanding of the warranty in question within the shipping industry. Therefore, the present paper has tried to bring a light on some core problems such as: 1) what is the essence of the safe port obligation? And how the safety of the port can be determined 2) where the breach of the contractual obligation in question lies? 3) how does the warranty operates in terms of the voyage <b>charterparties...</b>|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to critically assess the current status of the legal regime governing the international carriage of goods by sea, with the main focus being on the implied terms which form the foundation of international shipping law in general, and on the doctrine of deviation in particular. This will include a critical review of the rule against unjustified deviation in contracts of affreightment by posing the following questions: (i) Is the rule against unjustified deviation still relevant in the modern context of international carriage of goods by sea? In light of: The development of transport vessels, liberty clauses, different types of <b>charterparties,</b> and held cover clauses? (ii) Should the rule against unjustified deviation be treated any differently from other implied shipping terms? Is the rule against deviation an absolute obligation? Should unjustified deviation amount to fundamental breach of a contract? Should there not be some degree of flexibility in the judicial approach to the law on deviation? (iii) Do we need harmonisation, unification and interpretation of deviation rules? It is hoped that in attempting to answer these questions some light may be shed on this important area of shipping law...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the mortgage of the ship as a security in shipping finance, <b>charterparty</b> has increasingly developed its role {{as one of the}} important securities which the creditor will commonly take it as a supplemental security to secure the sum of loan granted to the shipowner. The <b>charterparty</b> is considered as a major source of income of the shipowner which will generate the cash flow to sustain the business. The law governing the assignment of <b>charterparty</b> as a security varies from country to country therefore the perfection or requirement in order to acquire the legal protection and the rights given to the assignee are subsequently different. The choice of law to govern the assignment of <b>charterparty</b> may create a difficulty when the enforcement is brought to a court of the country other than the country of governing law. This thesis illustrates the different of the law governing the assignment of <b>charterparty</b> by giving the comparison between Norwegian and English laws.

40|$|This {{report is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the ISPS-code and voyage chartering, and investigate how the code affects the charterer and owner. The SOLAS convention was amended in 2004 {{as a result of}} the new terror threat, and the ISPS-code was then added to the convention as an annex. The new code affects different parties involved in voyage chartering, and everyone has to adapt to the new routines. Furthermore, some parts of voyage chartering are more vulnerable than others. Laytime is an essential part of a ships voyage, and a vast amount of money is linked to a vessel’s portstay. A violation of the ISPS-code allows the designated authorities in charge of maintaining the protection of ships and port to intervene and investigate the cause of non-compliance during the vessels portstay. Thus, the laytime can be directly affected by the ISPS-code. The question is who is responsible for the delays and in turn the economic risk of an ISPS related delay or cancellation of voyage? As a result of our investigation, we concluded that the ISPS-code is related to the seaworthiness of a vessel. If the obligations of the security requirements are not met, the vessel can be classified as non-seaworthy. In most voyage <b>charterparties,</b> such as GENCON 94, there is a clause that states that the owner shall provide a seaworthy ship. In English jurisdiction, the owner’s responsibilities to provide a seaworthy ship is even a so called implied term. Hence, a breach of the ISPS-code is directly linked to the seaworthiness of the ship, and the owner is responsible for the delays caused by lack of ISPS documents and certificates...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{the disputes}} which arise between the contractual parties or other injured parties {{in connection with}} the operation of the ship when ice risks materialises. A more open Arctic Ocean represents a considerable potential for increased shipping in and throughout the region. However, the opening of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and the changing Arctic besides bringing tremendous opportunities, also poses immense challenges. Extreme cold environments are perhaps the most demanding and challenging for both the crew and the vessel. At present, most trans-Arctic voyages take place in summer along the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route is mostly used for science and tourism purposes. In addition, it has been indicated that the NSR is the shortest route, connecting Europe with East Asia via the seas of the Arctic Ocean and as compared with the route via the Suez Canal, the NSR makes it possible to transport cargoes from Europe to the Far East. Transportation time is reduced by nearly 40 per cent. Besides, as opposed to the Gulf of Aden, piracy cases have not been registered in the regions beyond the Polar Circle, which makes the Northern Sea Route very attractive for navigation. The topic must be seen in the light of these new opportunities and challenges of Arctic Shipping. The aim of this thesis is to examine the legal issues related to the risks caused by ice to a vessel and her performance. These risks will most often materialise in long delays, deviation and heavy hull damage to the ship. In this respect, it is essential to see what are the legal issues and how is the liability allocated between the shipowner and the charterer, as well as who are the other parties directly affected by such risks and these parties’ rights. Further problems are related to the insurance coverage and the legal relationship between the shipowner and the insurer and also between the charterer and his insurers. The <b>charterparties</b> discussed are limited to time and voyage charters...|$|R
40|$|As oil {{became a}} {{globally}} traded product traders learnt {{to maximize their}} profits by moving energy commodities around the globe. Globalisation and technological development, besides having a durable positive effect on international maritime trade often triggers enormous risks. As much as financial institutions and big trading companies are trying to reconcile national differences between sourcing and consumption countries by minimising political risks, these transactions are never entirely risk free. Traders, ship-owners and bankers often ignore the implications that could stem from their engagements in profitable but not always straightforward obligations. Oil trading is very complex business. Usually, trading volumes are very high and require substantial financial resources and a strong logistic system that could manage potential risks. A chain of participants involved in execution of one sale contract includes numerous parties such as ship-owners, brokers, insurers, inspection specialists, port agents, financial institutions and experienced support staff. As a result, {{there are a number}} of risks that do not appear on the surface of transactions and arise as a consequence of negligence of contractual details or general misinterpretation. Often, these errors are caused due to mismatches between multiple contracts, <b>Charterparties,</b> letters of credits or, simply, a result of dishonest behaviour of partners. Traders do not work in ideal world where contract executions follow their exact mechanism, there are no last minute changes and documents always arrive on time to the discharge ports. That’s why the Letters of Indemnity are a great instrument that can remove a lot of barriers on the way of the traders. They facilitate timely delivery of cargoes to their receivers, reduce operational costs and as result, increase profit margins of traders. Hence, a Letter of Indemnity creates liabilities that fall beyond the framework of the sale contract and beyond the standard insurance coverage for ship-owners. Often, Letters of Indemnity generate liabilities under parties who might not have had an original unilateral contract. The biggest issues arise when the Letter of Indemnity is being called upon, and traders have to secure the claim of the carrier. Yet, they are used by traders on every day basis as market dynamics imposes its own rules on the entire industry...|$|R
