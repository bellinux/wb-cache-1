25|$|Bräde or svenskt brädspel ("Swedish tables") is {{a variant}} played in Sweden. Players starts with all 15 of their {{checkers}} on opposite {{corners of the}} board, and play around counter-clockwise. Besides bearing off, {{there are several other}} ways to win, such as arranging all of one's checkers in certain pre-determined patterns, or by hitting so many checkers that one's opponent <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> them in again. Additional points are awarded for a victory while one's opponent has checkers on the bar. Brädspel is played without the doubling cube. Interest in brädspel experienced a resurgence following the recovery of a 17th-century board from the wreck of the Vasa.|$|E

Bart tries to get the shock {{bracelet}} remote control, but Sideshow Bob already has it and throws it out of the window, gags Bart with a piece of tape, picks him up and prepares to kill him with a knife, bent on killing him once again. However, Sideshow Bob realizes he is accustomed to Bart's face and he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> himself to do it. With that, Sideshow Bob tries to take his leave, but gets zapped continuously by his shock bracelet (because of birds pecking the remote after it had landed in their nest).|$|E

He <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> himself to kill it, and so he and Ares take it to be raised by the only {{friendly}} rat they know: Ripred. After this, the two return to Regalia, where Nerissa has just been crowned queen due to the crown princess's apparent death. The flier Andromeda, human Howard, Ares, and Gregor are tried for treason because they failed to kill the Bane. They are saved, though, by Nerissa, who explains how it is good Gregor was not heartless enough to kill a baby. Shortly thereafter, Gregor is trying to finally face the reality of going home without Boots when she is suddenly returned to the palace, having been saved in turn by Luxa, Temp, and an unnamed moth. The two then return to the surface world.|$|E

60|$|To {{ascertain}} whether, and in what, two phenomena resemble or differ, is not always, therefore, so easy a {{thing as}} it might at first appear. When the two can not be brought into juxtaposition, or not so that the observer is able to compare their several parts in detail, he must employ the indirect means of reasoning and general propositions. When we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> two straight lines together, {{to determine whether they}} are equal, we do it by the physical aid of a foot-rule applied first to one and then to the other, and the logical aid of the general proposition or formula, “Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.” The comparison of two things through the intervention of a third thing, when their direct comparison is impossible, is the appropriate scientific process for ascertaining resemblances and dissimilarities, and is the sum total of what Logic has to teach on the subject.|$|E

6000|$|There was a {{small garden}} within the castle {{not far from the}} prison, and after some time Elizabeth was {{permitted}} to walk there. The gates and doors, however, were kept carefully closed, and all the prisoners, whose rooms looked into it from the surrounding buildings, were closely watched by their respective keepers, while Elizabeth was in the garden, to prevent their having any communication with her by looks or signs. There were a great many persons confined at this time, who had been arrested on charges connected with Wyatt's rebellion, and the authorities seem to have been very specially vigilant to prevent the possibility of Elizabeth's having communication with any of them. There was a little child of five years of age who used to come and visit Elizabeth in her room, and bring her flowers. He was the son of one of the subordinate officers of the Tower. It was, however, at last suspected that he was acting as a messenger between Elizabeth and Courteney. Courteney, it will be recollected, had been sent by Mary back to the Tower again, so that he and Elizabeth were now suffering the same hard fate in neighboring cells. When the boy was suspected of bearing communications between these friends and companions in suffering, he was called before an officer and closely examined. His answers were all open and childlike, and gave no confirmation to the idea which had been entertained. The child, however, was forbidden to go to Elizabeth's apartment any more. He was very much grieved at this, and he watched for the next time that Elizabeth was to walk in the garden, and putting his mouth to a hole in the gate, he called out, [...] "Lady, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> you any more flowers." ...|$|E

After employing the regression model, the results confirm that independent variable (inflation) does not statistically influence the dependent variable (Per Capita Income) in three countries which are India, Brazil and South Africa. However, in the other two countries (China and Russia) the findings affirm the independent variable (Inflation) does statistically influence the dependent variable (Per Capita Income).

Compared with other methods, the PWE has great advantages in solving more than one-dimensional PC as well as various lattice types. Nevertheless, the conventional PWE cannot accurately solve coupling between the structure and resonant shunting circuits of the PPC-C since only taking one-way coupling from displacements to electrical parameters into consideration. A two-dimensional PPC-C model of orthorhombic lattice is established to demonstrate the whole solving process of PWE-PPC-C. The PWE-PPC-C method is validated by Transfer Matrix method as well as Finite Element method. The dependence of band gaps on circuit parameters has been investigated in detail by PWE-PPC-C. Its advantage in solving various lattice types is further illustrated by calculating the PPC-C of triangular and hexagonal lattices, respectively...|$|R
