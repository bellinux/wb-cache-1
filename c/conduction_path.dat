Application of an electric field at the GaN surface in an ambient atmospheric environment is shown to lead to local formation of gallium oxide {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the <b>conduction</b> <b>paths,</b> resulting in the strong suppression of subsequent current flow. Current-voltage measurements for Schottky diodes in which local <b>conduction</b> <b>paths</b> have been suppressed in this manner exhibit reverse-bias leakage currents reduced by two to four orders of magnitude compared to those in Schottky diodes not subjected to any surface modification process. These results demonstrate that the dislocation-related current leakage paths are the dominant source of leakage current in Schottky contacts to n-type GaN grown by molecular-beam epitaxy, and elucidate the nature of a microscopic process for their suppression.

In scanning a laser beam to induce local changes of the temperature and the electronic/conduction properties, simultaneously the current change of the device (under the constant bias voltage) at each scanning step was recorded to visualize {{the distribution of the}} current <b>conduction</b> <b>paths.</b> The results reveal that in the memory devices using polymer-stabilized Au nanoparticles, the current transport paths during the writing mode or the subsequent reading mode (of the "on" state) are localized, and that once the localized current transport paths are established in the writing mode, the current transport in the subsequent reading mode (of the "on" state) would basically follow the same <b>paths.</b> The established <b>conduction</b> <b>paths</b> would be eliminated in the erasing process and be re-established in the next writing process. Yet, the current <b>conduction</b> <b>paths</b> established for the "on" state are somehow random and vary from writing to writing. Results of this work might have significant implications to operation or applications of such memory devices.

50|$|The {{basic idea}} is that a dielectric, which is {{normally}} insulating, {{can be made to}} conduct through a filament or <b>conduction</b> <b>path</b> formed after application of a sufficiently high voltage. The <b>conduction</b> <b>path</b> can arise from different mechanisms, including vacancy or metal defect migration. Once the filament is formed, it may be reset (broken, resulting in high resistance) or set (re-formed, resulting in lower resistance) by another voltage. Many current paths, rather than a single filament, are possibly involved. The presence of these current paths in the dielectric can be in situ demonstrated via conductive atomic force microscopy.|$|E

40|$|Attractive negative-$U$ {{interactions}} between electrons facilitated by strong electron-phonon interaction {{are common in}} highly polarizable and disordered materials such as amorphous chalcogenides, {{but there is no}} direct evidence for them in large-band-gap insulators. Here we report how such negative-$U$ centers are responsible for widespread insulator-to-metal transitions in amorphous HfO$_ 2 $ and Al$_ 2 $O$_ 3 $ thin films with a 10 $^ 9 $-fold resistance drop. Triggered by a static hydraulic pressure or a 0. 1 ps impulse of magnetic pressure, the transition can proceed at such low pressure that there is very little overall deformation (strain~ 10 $^{- 5 }$). Absent a significant energy change overall, the transition is attributed to the reversal of localized electron-phonon interaction: By reversing the sign of $U$, trapped electrons are destabilized and released, thus clearing <b>conduction</b> <b>paths</b> previously blocked by charged traps. The results also suggest that Mott insulators when disordered may become Anderson insulators with strong electron-phonon interactions regulating incipient <b>conduction</b> <b>paths,</b> a novel finding of technological significance for electronic devices...|$|R

5000|$|The {{whole process}} is {{outlined}} in Figure 6. The process happens in different steps here too. In the first phase, the pn junction between the MT1 terminal and the gate becomes forward-biased (step 1). As forward-biasing implies the injection of minority carriers {{in the two}} layers joining the junction, electrons are injected in the p-layer under the gate. Some of these electrons do not recombine and escape to the underlying n-region (step 2). This in turn lowers {{the potential of the}} n-region, acting as the base of a pnp transistor which switches on (turning the transistor on without directly lowering the base potential is called remote gate control). The lower p-layer works as the collector of this PNP transistor and has its voltage heightened: actually, this p-layer also acts as the base of an NPN transistor made up by the last three layers just over the MT2 terminal, which, in turn, gets activated. Therefore, the red arrow labeled with a [...] "3" [...] in Figure 6 shows the final <b>conduction</b> <b>path</b> of the current.|$|E
5000|$|Triggering in this {{quadrant}} {{is similar}} to triggering in quadrant III. The process uses a remote gate control and is illustrated in Figure 7. As current flows from the p-layer under the gate into the n-layer under MT1, minority carriers {{in the form of}} free electrons are injected into the p-region {{and some of them are}} collected by the underlying n-p junction and pass into the adjoining n-region without recombining. As in the case of a triggering in quadrant III, this lowers the potential of the n-layer and turns on the PNP transistor formed by the n-layer and the two p-layers next to it. The lower p-layer works as the collector of this PNP transistor and has its voltage heightened: actually, this p-layer also acts as the base of an NPN transistor made up by the last three layers just over the MT2 terminal, which, in turn, gets activated.

5000|$|The {{elimination}} of {{a layer of}} packaging was achieved {{through the development of}} the Thermal Conduction Module (TCM), a flat ceramic module containing about 30,000 logic circuits on up to 118 chips. The TTL chips (which were not compatible with the TTL chips sold on the open market by many manufacturers) were joined face-down (sometimes called [...] "flip chip") to the TCM with an array of 11 × 11 solder pads. The TCM contains 33 metalized layers which distribute signals and power.

50|$|There {{are many}} factors {{that come into}} play when using R-values to compute heat loss for a {{particular}} wall. Manufacturer R values apply only to properly installed insulation. Squashing two layers of batting into the thickness intended for one layer will increase but not double the R-value. (In other words, compressing a fiberglass batt decreases the R-value of the batt but increases the R-value per inch.) Another important factor to consider is that studs and windows provide a parallel heat <b>conduction</b> <b>path</b> that is unaffected by the insulation's R-value. The practical implication {{of this is that}} one could double the R-value of insulation installed between framing members and realize substantially less than a 50% reduction in heat loss. When installed between wall studs, even perfect wall insulation only eliminates conduction through the insulation but leaves unaffected the conductive heat loss through such materials as glass windows and studs. Insulation installed between the studs may reduce, but usually does not eliminate, heat losses due to air leakage through the building envelope. Installing a continuous layer of rigid foam insulation on the exterior side of the wall sheathing will interrupt thermal bridging through the studs while also reducing the rate of air leakage.|$|E

This MCM features a complete modular structure, i. e., each stack {{can be removed}} from the package without damaging the structure. The interconnection to the PCB is through the Column Grid Array (CGA) technology. Because of its high-density nature, large power dissipation from multiple layers of circuitry is anticipated and CVD diamond films are used in the assembly for heat conduction enhancement. Since each stacked layer dissipates certain amount of heat, designing effective heat <b>conduction</b> <b>paths</b> through each stack and balancing the heat dissipation within each stack for optimal thermal performance become a challenging task.
