50|$|The {{beginnings}} of smelting {{go back to}} the start of mining in the Upper Harz in the Early Middle Ages. In medieval metallurgy, so-called nomadic smelting (Wanderverhüttung) predominated. The smelting sites were only used for a few weeks and followed the logging of the requisite wood. For the charcoal that was needed for the reduction of the ore, oak and beech wood were especially well-suited. The billets of wood were located near the smelting sites. The low shaft kilns (Schachtöfen) were built of natural rock and earth from the vicinity, and were by no means simple in their construction. They could only be used for a few days of <b>continuous</b> <b>furnace</b> campaign. Fixed buildings were not erected. Over 200 slag sites and smelting sites have been archaeologically recorded from this smelting period. Since the 1980s the mining archaeology team of Lothar Klappauf and Friedrich-Albert Linke have carried out excavations and undertaken a considerable amount of archeological and archaeometallurgical research. The high medieval smelting technology of the 10th to 12th centuries at the Rammelsberg was well established and complex. The wood dweller (Silvani), i.e. those who were doing the smelting in the woodlands, were able to produce copper, lead and silver from the poly-metallic ores of the Rammelsberg.|$|E

The effectiveness of air/oxidant staging on reducing NOx emissions was investigated for combustion in air and 02 /C 02 mixtures. The fate of recycle NO in combustion with different oxidants and combustion conditions was also investigated. <b>Continuous</b> <b>furnace</b> operations with stable flames and a comparable operating temperature to that in air were established for 02 /C 02 combustion, without major operational problems related to burner ignition, flame stability, coal firing and the effect of oxidants switching, both in unstaged and staged conditions.

A continuous flame could not be sustained by the direct replacement of combustion air with 02 /C 02 mixture with the same O 2 concentration as air (21 : 79 - 02 /C 02).

Texture {{control in}} oxide superconductors {{has been studied}} intensively since the {{discovery}} of High temperature superconductivity. Efforts to induce texture with laser heating have been widely published in the literature, using systems, which usually made no use of external heating to avoid microcrack formation due to excessive thermal stress around the laser incidence area. The typical cylindrical geometry, most often used in Laser Float Zone Melting (LFZ) hindered the development of appropriate heating devices, thus efforts were launched in order to design a Laser Zone Melting system where the effect of external heating of the superconductor could be ascertained {{in order to obtain}} textured superconducting material in planar geometries. A number of papers have thus appeared in the literature based on Laser Zone Melting of Bi- 2212.
