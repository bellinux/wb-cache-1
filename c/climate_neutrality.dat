25|$|In October 2011, Dr. Linda Brady, Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG), {{signed the}} American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), {{pledging}} the University {{to develop a}} comprehensive plan to achieve <b>climate</b> <b>neutrality.</b> This action {{was the culmination of}} years of effort by faculty, students and staff to have UNCG emerge as a local and national leader in sustainable practices. It was also the primary reason for development of the campus Climate Action Plan (CAP), led by the UNCG Sustainability Coordinator, Trey McDonald and involving a team of more than 50 UNCG students, staff and faculty. The CAP team was divided into six working groups around specific focus areas – University Administration, Infrastructure Energy Use, Transportation, Materials Management, Water, and Academics and Outreach – and the final Plan was officially adopted on July 31, 2013.|$|E
50|$|University {{and college}} leaders have taken action to reduce campus carbon {{emissions}} in the following ways: purchasing renewable energy credits, installing micro-wind turbines, retrocommissioning HVAC systems, install geothermal or solar hot water systems, building cogeneration electrical plants on campus, upgrading lighting on campus, establishing campus green teams, providing free public transportation for students, staff, and faculty, providing financial incentives for carpooling, implementing car-sharing and/or bike-sharing programs, and implementing campus shuttle services. Student clubs and organizations are active in raising awareness in various aspects of carbon <b>neutrality.</b> <b>Climate</b> change, sustainability practice, natural resource conservation, clean energy, and environmental policy are common focuses of student groups working toward carbon neutrality.|$|R
5000|$|The Quarantine Speech {{was given}} by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt on October 5, 1937 in Chicago (on the {{occasion}} of the dedication of the bridge between north and south outer Lake Shore Drive), calling for an international [...] "quarantine" [...] against the [...] "epidemic of world lawlessness" [...] by aggressive nations {{as an alternative to the}} political <b>climate</b> of American <b>neutrality</b> and non-intervention that was prevalent at the time. The speech intensified America's isolationist mood, causing protest by non-interventionists and foes to intervene. No countries were directly mentioned in the speech, although it was interpreted as referring to Japan, Italy, and Germany. Roosevelt suggested the use of economic pressure, a forceful response, but less direct than outright aggression.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} soil texture on water use {{efficiency}} (WUE) was analyzed for six crops cultivated on loam and clay soils. Results were obtained after a long-term study, {{carried out in}} a lysimetric set-up, in conditions of experimental <b>neutrality</b> (<b>climate,</b> agro-techniques, and variety were the same for each crop) with the sole exception of the soil texture, which was the variable to be studied. In the case of potato, corn, sunflower, and sugar beet, WUE was reduced significantly when crops were grown in clay soil. The reductions ranged from 22 % to 25 %. The decrease of WUE in clay soil was coupled with significant reductions in yield and in ET, except {{in the case of}} the corn crop. The reduction in WUE in corn depended solely on the yield decrease. A 10 % decrease in WUE values was also observed for the soy-bean and tomato grown in clay soil, but it was not statistically significant. Different causes which may reduce the WUE values observed in the clay soil are discussed. It seems coherent to hypothesize that, during the active growing phase, a deficit in water uptake occurs in the plants growing in the clay soil. This hypothesis is consistent with the observations of stomatal conductance, daily evapotranspiration, and leaf surface. In conclusion, the operative development of this study is outlined...|$|R

Power Shift, a national youth climate activism summit, was held at the University of Maryland in November 2007 with 6,000 individuals in attendance.|$|E
40|$|My art {{is based}} on the {{argument}} that visual culture has a profound effect on society, and in turn, on our environment. The radical changes that will be necessary to produce a sustainable society and avoid a future of social inequality and climate catastrophe must be mirrored by equally radical changes in visual culture. These changes involve shifting the sociological sites for art to put culture back into service for the local, participatory communities that are our brightest promise in achieving a sustainable society. In an age beset by unprecedented economic, social, and ecological challenges no problem can be more vital. As plutocracies like the US and India militarize borders to keep out those dangerously tired, hungry and poor from the ravages of climate change, it is our responsibility, as citizens, to do anything we can to prevent these global apartheids. [i] The Anthropocene is a geologic term that describes the current epoch as one in which human activity has encompassing and massively cascading effects on the environment. [ii] The unintended warming of the planet by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is the most salient manifestation of the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene is only defined as such because of the sheer scale of human undertakings. The destructive consequences of the Anthropocene are simultaneously no one’s fault and everyone’s fault. Each of us is a participant in the cumulative effect. In contrast to the seemingly modest mechanisms of climate change, the impacts are already, and will continue to be, huge. It is estimated that 350, 000 people die from climate change related deaths each year. Over the next ten years, it is expected that 5 million will die from the impacts of climate change. [iii] Analogously, the impact of visual culture on human behavior is magnified by the ubiquity of visual media. In art, no one is responsible for the predominant messages of visual culture, which are escapism and diversion. [iv] But when we choose to produce or consume media that do not confront the pressing issues of our day, we are complicit to the process of diversion. The systems of escapism we choose to engage with might seem trivial or lofty, but they produce, when aggregated, a society that can ignore the rampant injustices perpetrated in our name. The destructiveness that characterizes the Anthropocene, like ocean acidification and mass species extinctions, {{is the result of a}} structured alienation between the rhythms and cycles of ecosystems and the constructed habits and desires of human processes. [v] This dissonance requires us to constantly intervene into the earth’s metabolism to synthetically revitalize the land on which we depend. Industrially scaled monocultures are only maintained through ecologically damaging synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified crops. Our interruptions into the organic processes in which the earth replenishes itself is known as the metabolic rift. [vi] The metabolic rift designates both the primary decoupling between ourselves and our environment and the long-range consequences of that originary fission. Soil depletion, caused by monocultures and a lack of crop rotation, are an example of the initial split. The use of synthetic fertilizers, which create dead zones in marine ecosystems and directly damage human health, are a second order consequence of the metabolic rift. And finally, the rising obesity and failing health of a population raised on the processed fruits of GMO monocultures may be seen as a third order consequence of the metabolic rift. [vii] The rift between the needs of the environment and our use of it also has a corollary in art. Western art, like agriculture, has become isolated from metabolic lifecycles. Like the genetically modified corn that covers swaths of the Midwest, art has to be heavily processed before it can be consumed. Anyone can make visual stuff but that raw material is not valued as art until it has thoroughly travailed art’s institutions. To be considered palatable, our society’s art must be encouraged by teachers, accepted into galleries by curators and gallerists, and deemed valid by critics and collectors. The processing of visual works into officiated art strips away intention and value in favor of trends, in the first order, and encourages self-censorship and commodification in the second and third order. It is reflexive to state that visual culture, as an endogenous element of society, has an effect on that society. It can also be conclusively posited that society has consequences on the environment that sustains it. From these premises, we can say that there is a causal link between culture and the environment, via society. From the perspectives of the Anthropocene and the metabolic rift, it is also arguable that the degradation of visual culture is analogous to environmental decimation. If the problems facing art both look like and produce ecological disruptions, it follows that a radical art practice can produce environmental solutions by mimicking those solutions. There are three key elements of viable remedies to the planetary crisis that can easily be applied to art. First, all actions must be taken from a position that is scientifically informed on the consequences of those actions. Secondly, sustainable societies and cultures necessitate a greater level of participation from the public. Finally, we need to suture the metabolic rift by strengthening our local communities. The first step towards sustainability is knowledge. The concept map that forms the foundation of this exhibition is a graphically organized representation of the factors and mechanisms of climate change as described in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s authoritative Fourth Assessment Report and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Inventory of U. S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. The sprawling and inclusive network is intended to provide a tool for the analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of the problem of climate change. The allegorical characters that act out the concept map are playful visual aids. They emphasize that scientific understanding must be made accessible to the general public to be efficacious. The process of enlightenment must also be accompanied by grassroots participation and organization. This installation is a loose collage of the spaces, events, and goals of a variety of local activist groups. It is arranged as a community center would be, to suggest the potential role activist art can play within local movements. Many of the elements in the installation are participatory (eat some food, take some seedlings, browse the books, or become a propagandist) in order to encourage participation in the activities that inspired the installation. If you agree with the intention of this exhibition, think about joining one (or several) of the local organizations highlighted in it. Many of these organizations directly reduce carbon footprints through lifestyle changes. More importantly, they are working to build the robust movements that can demand <b>climate</b> justice and <b>neutrality.</b> A more informed and active public will naturally repair the metabolic rifts between art and society and society and the environment. My involvement with community groups here in Lincoln is productively and self-sustainingly intertwined with my artistic practice. Many of the objects I produce, such as the ideological plates, propaganda rack, and cycling hats, have been built with a specific organization in mind. Once these objects have been used as art objects, they can be recycled back into functional objects and used to further the goals of the organizations that grew them. These interactive sculptures can then fertilize those grassroots environments and inspire more action. The socio-environmental challenges that we confront, and the urgency with which we face them, are without precedence or comparison. The need to do something, almost anything, to mitigate this headlong disaster has given me an appreciation for the frustrations, imperfections, and humble rewards of grassroots activism, human-powered transportation, and growing one’s own food. In the same fashion, by putting art in service of the ideal of a humane humanity, I have learned to appreciate the simple, ham-handed, and imperfect visual media that characterize movement-building communities. These blemished aesthetics, which have informed my own work, resonate with the local, participatory, and informed communities that are our best hope for the future.

5000|$|The Climate Neutral Network is “an {{initiative}} {{led by the}} United Nations Environment Programme {{to promote}} global action to de-carbonize our economies and societies." [...] The initiative involves universities, colleges, and other academic institutions worldwide and its aim is {{to work together in}} order to transform so that they can have a zero emission future. Like the Presidential Climate Commitment, the Climate Neutral Network is designed with the premise that colleges and universities are vital components in addressing climate change [...] "because they can model <b>climate</b> <b>neutrality</b> on their campuses, and they can teach their students skills and knowledge they need to address the climate crisis." ...|$|E
5000|$|The ACUPCC text can be {{summarized}} in two sections: the statement, and the plan. The statement is a four-paragraph declaration that outlines the scientific knowledge regarding global climate change that the signatories accept as fact. It goes on to describe the perceived or predicted institutional and social benefits of taking steps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. The text proposes that by acting to limit their carbon footprint, universities and colleges can act as leader institutions in their communities, and similarly better serve their students and their educational needs. It concludes that, {{in accordance with the}} many resultant institutional benefits expected, leaders of educational institutions ought to commit to the steps outlined in the plan. The plan is a three-part outline of certain steps signatory institutions should take [...] "in pursuit of climate neutrality." [...] The three parts of the plan involve developing a comprehensive plan, choosing from a menu of 'tangible actions' to initiate while developing a comprehensive plan, and issuing regular reports to AASHE regarding institutional progress. Comprehensive plan development under the ACUPCC follows three milestones. By the two-month milestone, signatories commit to having created formal institutional structures (and where appropriate, departments) {{for the express purpose of}} guiding the development of the plan as well as implementation of the other elements of the commitment. By the one-year milestone, signatories commit to having completed a greenhouse gas inventory, in accordance with the GHG protocol, with accordances in place to update the figures on a bi-yearly basis. The two-year milestone builds upon the greenhouse gas inventory, requiring that signatories create a comprehensive action plan for achieving <b>climate</b> <b>neutrality.</b> This action plan must include certain minimum elements: a target date for complete <b>climate</b> <b>neutrality,</b> intermediate institutional goals and target dates, steps to integrate <b>climate</b> <b>neutrality</b> and related concerns with educational curriculum and research, and institutional mechanisms for tracking intermediate goals above and beyond the specific structures outlined by the ACUPCC. The menu of possible actions includes conforming to LEED Silver standards or greater, purchasing Energy Star products, and encouraging and fostering use of public transportation. Finally, the reporting section of the three-part plan requires signatory institutions to make the details of their plans, inventories, and progress publicly available through AASHE. The final one-sentence paragraph of the text mentions the need to spread the knowledge contained in the commitment and recruit more signatories through institutional diplomacy.|$|E
50|$|A related recent {{concern is}} energy {{cannibalism}} where energy technologies {{can have a}} limited growth rate if <b>climate</b> <b>neutrality</b> is demanded. Many energy technologies are capable of replacing significant volumes of fossil fuels and concomitant green house gas emissions. Unfortunately, neither the enormous scale of the current fossil fuel energy system nor the necessary growth rate of these technologies is well understood within the limits imposed by the net energy produced for a growing industry. This technical limitation is known as energy cannibalism and refers to an effect where rapid growth of an entire energy producing or energy efficiency industry creates a need for energy that uses (or cannibalizes) the energy of existing power plants or production plants.|$|E
