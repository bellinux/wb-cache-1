40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{explore the}} effects of various kinds of skip {{connections}} in stacked bidirectional LSTMs for sequential tagging. We investigate three kinds of skip <b>connections</b> connecting <b>to</b> LSTM cells: (a) skip <b>connections</b> <b>to</b> the gates, (b) skip <b>connections</b> <b>to</b> the internal states and (c) skip <b>connections</b> <b>to</b> the cell outputs. We present comprehensive experiments showing that skip <b>connections</b> <b>to</b> cell outputs outperform the remaining two. Furthermore, we observe that using gated identity functions as skip mappings works pretty well. Based on this novel skip connections, we successfully train deep stacked bidirectional LSTM models and obtain state-of-the-art results on CCG supertagging and comparable results on POS tagging.
