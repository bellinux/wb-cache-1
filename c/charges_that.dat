5|$|In {{a highly}} publicized scandal, Beecher was tried on <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> he had {{committed}} adultery with a friend's wife, Elizabeth Tilton. In 1870, Elizabeth had confessed to her husband, Theodore Tilton, {{that she had had}} a relationship with Beecher. The charges became public when Theodore told Elizabeth Cady Stanton of his wife's confession. Stanton repeated the story to fellow women's rights leaders Victoria Woodhull and Isabella Beecher Hooker.|$|E

50|$|Some feminists {{are opposed}} to pornography, arguing {{that it is an}} {{industry}} which exploits women and is complicit in violence against women, both in its production (where they <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (where they <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment). They <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> pornography contributes to the male-centered objectification of women and thus to sexism.|$|R
5|$|Moran joined Virginia Reps. Gerry Connolly and Bobby Scott {{in asking}} Attorney General Eric Holder for a Department of Justice {{investigation}} into allegations of voter fraud in Virginia following <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> a contractor to the Republican Party of Virginia was caught discarding completed voter registration forms in a Harrisonburg, Virginia dumpster.

5|$|While the Spruce Production Division {{was quickly}} demobilized after the war, {{there was some}} post-war {{controversy}} over the cost of its operations. Disque, by then a brigadier general, spent months answering to <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> his division had wasted taxpayers' money. Congress was particularly critical of the $4million spent on an unfinished railroad located in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. Disque responded that {{it was to be}} used for transporting spruce lumber. Eventually, the charges proved to be unfounded.|$|E

As chair of the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee, Wheeler announced in August 1941 he would investigate “interventionists” in the motion picture industry. He questioned why so many foreign-born men were allowed to shape American opinion. [...] "Critics <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> the Committee was motivated by animus to Jewish studio heads." [...] Representing the Studios was 1940 Republican Presidential candidate Wendell Willkie who <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Wheeler and other critics sought to impose {{the same kind of}} censorship that Nazi Germany was enacting all over Europe. Wheeler also led the attack on Roosevelt's Lend Lease Bill <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> if passed [...] "it would plow under every fourth American boy". Roosevelt in response <b>charged</b> <b>that</b> Wheeler's statement was [...] "the damnedest thing said in a generation".|$|R

Model retained command of OB West for eighteen days before Hitler appointed Gerd von Rundstedt as permanent replacement for Kluge, allowing Model to return to the command of Army Group B.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} for assisting Zangi, the Abbasid authorities sought punitive measures against Ayyub. Simultaneously, {{in a separate}} incident, Shirkuh killed a close confidant of Bihruz on <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> he had sexually assaulted a woman in Tikrit. The Abbasid court issued arrest warrants for both Ayyub and Shirkuh, but before the brothers could be arrested, they departed Tikrit for Mosul in 1138. When they arrived in Mosul, Zangi provided them with all the facilities they needed and he recruited the two brothers into his service. Ayyub was made commander of Ba'albek and Shirkuh entered the service of Zangi's son, Nur ad-Din. According to historian Abdul Ali, it was under the care and patronage of Zangi that the Ayyubid family rose to prominence.|$|E

Gravel denied later press <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> he had promised but not delivered on other committee chairmanships. As Speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislature's committees and feuded with Alaska State Senate president Robert J. McNealy.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{was married}} five times. He wed Virginia Cherrill on February 9, 1934 at Caxton Hall {{registry}} office in London. She divorced him on March 26, 1935, following <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> Grant had hit her. The two {{were involved in}} a bitter divorce case which was widely reported in the press, with Cherrill demanding $1000 a week from her husband in benefits from his Paramount earnings. After the demise of the marriage, he dated actress Phyllis Brooks from 1937. They had considered marriage, and vacationed together in Europe in mid-1939, visiting the Roman villa of Dorothy di Frasso in Italy, before the relationship ended later that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Shiller {{supported}} Danny K. Davis in Davis' unsuccessful primary {{challenge to}} Daley. Daley endorsed Shiller's challenger, Michael Quigley, campaigned with Quigley and sent letters {{in support of}} Quigley. Shiller finished seven votes ahead of Quigley, but a third candidate got 3.4% of the vote, which forced a runoff, the third straight run-off for Shiller and the fourth straight for the 46th ward. In the run-off, Shiller won with 53% of the vote, amid <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> Quigley was a carpetbagger.|$|E

Until these experiments, atomic number was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.|$|E
5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 that {{evolution}} supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes {{and the rule}} of law. He goes on to suggest that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> evolution has led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust {{are more likely to be}} found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.|$|E

5|$|A major crisis {{gripped the}} ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted {{over whether to}} defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> they {{encouraged}} draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E
5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> he held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E
