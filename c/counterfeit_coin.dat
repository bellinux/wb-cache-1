[...] Although {{he may have been}} {{involved}} in earlier highway robberies on 10and12April, he was first identified as a suspect in one event on 10July, as [...] "Turpin the butcher", along with Thomas Rowden, [...] "the pewterer". [...] Several days later the two struck at Epping Forest, depriving a man from Southwark of his belongings. [...] With a further bounty of £100 on their heads they continued their activities through the latter half of 1735. [...] In August they robbed five people accompanying a coach on Barnes Common, and shortly after that they attacked another coach party, between Putney and Kingston Hill. [...] On 20August the pair relieved a Mr Godfrey of six guineas and a pocket book, on Hounslow Heath. [...] Fearing capture, they moved on to Blackheath in Hertfordshire, and then back to London. [...] On 5December the two were seen near Winchester, but in late December, following the capture of John Jones, they separated. [...] Rowden had previously been convicted of counterfeiting, and in July 1736 he was convicted of passing <b>counterfeit</b> <b>coin,</b> under the alias Daniel Crispe. [...] Crispe's true name was eventually discovered and he was transported in June 1738. [...] Jones also suffered transportation, to the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E

Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: George Tzavellas, Irene Papas, Melina Mercouri, Mihalis Kakogiannis, Alekos Sakellarios, Nikos Tsiforos, Iakovos Kambanelis, Katina Paxinou, Nikos Koundouros, Ellie Lambeti and others. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements. Some notable films include The Drunkard (1950, directed by George Tzavellas), The <b>Counterfeit</b> <b>Coin</b> (1955, by Giorgos Tzavellas), Πικρό Ψωμί (1951, by Grigoris Grigoriou), O Drakos (1956, by Nikos Koundouros), Stella (1955, directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis), Woe to the Young (1961, by Alekos Sakellarios), Glory Sky (1962, by Takis Kanellopoulos) and The Red Lanterns (1963, by Vasilis Georgiadis) ...|$|E

Half of the inhabitants of the court were ready to steal anything worth selling if an opportunity offered. She herself had often done so. She had no moral sense of right or wrong whatever, and regarded theft as simply an exercise of skill and quickness, and as an incident in the war between herself and society as represented by the police. As to <b>counterfeit</b> <b>coin,</b> she had passed it again and again, for a man came up once a fortnight or so with a roll of coin for which Mrs. Phillips paid him about a fourth of its face value. These she never attempted to pass in Chelsea, but tramped far away to the North, South or East, carrying with her a jug hidden under her tattered shawl, and going into public houses for a pint of beer for father.|$|E

"I am afraid," [...] {{said the}} Bowery boy, smilingly, [...] "that {{at some time}} you have been enticed {{into one of the}} dives of {{literature}} and had the <b>counterfeit</b> <b>coin</b> of the Bowery passed upon you. The 'argot' to which you doubtless refer was the invention of certain of your literary 'discoverers' who invaded the unknown wilds below Third avenue and put strange sounds into the mouths of the inhabitants. Safe in their homes far to the north and west, the credulous readers who were beguiled by this new 'dialect' perused and believed. Like Marco Polo and Mungo Park--pioneers indeed, but ambitious souls who could not draw the line of demarcation between discovery and invention--the literary bones of these explorers are dotting the trackless wastes of the subway. While it is true that after the publication of the mythical language attributed to the dwellers along the Bowery certain of its pat phrases and apt metaphors were adopted and, to a limited extent, used in this locality, it was because our people are prompt in assimilating whatever is to their commercial advantage. To the tourists who visited our newly discovered clime, and who expected a realization of their literary guide books, they supplied the demands of the market.|$|E

[...] So we lingered, and the {{twilight}} hung about us, strangely clear {{in spite of the}} thickness of the air. As we sat there came into view an apparition unmistakeable from afar as an immemorial vagrant--the disowned, in his own rich way, of all the English ages. As he approached us he slackened pace and finally halted, touching his cap. He was a man of middle age, clad in a greasy bonnet with false-looking ear-locks depending from its sides. Round his neck was a grimy red scarf, tucked into his waistcoat; his coat and trousers had a remote affinity with those of a reduced hostler. In one hand he had a stick; on his arm he bore a tattered basket, with a handful of withered vegetables at the bottom. His face was pale haggard and degraded beyond description--as base as a <b>counterfeit</b> <b>coin,</b> yet as modelled somehow as a tragic mask. He too, like everything else, had a history. From what height had he fallen, from what depth had he risen? He was the perfect symbol of generated constituted baseness; and I felt before him in presence of a great artist or actor.|$|E
60|$|The {{instinct}} of getting, of hoarding, was {{the motive}} {{of all their}} foraging; they had no other idea of property than the bounty of nature; and this was well enough {{as far as it}} went, but their impulse was not to share this bounty with others, but to keep it each for himself. They hoarded nuts and acorns, and hips and haws, and then they wasted them; and they hoarded other things merely from the greed of getting, and with no possible expectation of advantage. It might be well enough to catch bees in hollyhocks, and imprison them in underground cells with flowers for them to make honey from; but why accumulate fire-flies and even dor-bugs in small brick pens? Why heap together mussel-shells; and what did a boy expect to do with all the marbles he won? You could trade marbles for tops, but they were not money, like pins; and why were pins money? Why did the boys instinctively choose them for their currency, and pay everything with them? There were certain very rigid laws about them, and a bent pin could not be passed among the boys any more than a <b>counterfeit</b> <b>coin</b> among men. There were fixed prices; three pins would buy a bite of apple; six pins would pay your way into a circus; and so on. But where did these pins come from or go to; and what did the boys expect to do with them all? No boy knew. From time to time several boys got together and decided to keep store, and then other boys decided to buy of them with pins; but there was no calculation in the scheme; and though I have read of boys, especially in English books, who made a profit out of their fellows, I never knew any boy who had enough forecast to do it. They were too wildly improvident for anything of the kind, and if they had any virtue at all it was scorn of the vice of stinginess.|$|E
