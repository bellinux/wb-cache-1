The temperature is generally {{too hot for}} the larvae to develop {{on the surface of}} the sand and the deeper sand does not have enough oxygen.

40|$|AbstractThe impact {{response}} of civil aircraft subject to different soft soil and <b>concrete</b> <b>ground</b> is investigated. Typical {{finite element model}} of fuselage section {{is built based on}} sound simplification. Several different soft soil and concrete impact surfaces are adopted here. The drop test of civil aircraft is conducted subject to 7 m/s impact velocity. The impact {{response of}} ground and civil aircraft are revealed. Result shows that ground material has great influence on the crashworthiness of civil aircraft. Soft soil ground could dissipate a part of impact kinetic energy, and failure element of <b>concrete</b> <b>ground</b> would be deleted. Ground with larger stiffness would absorb less internal energy and undergo smaller deformation. The relevant civil aircraft would also have larger plastic deformation, and greater initial peak acceleration would be suffered by occupant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this Chapter is to set <b>concrete</b> <b>grounds</b> for two arguments. The first in favor of {{approaching}} the notion of sapient systems from the unlikely per-spective of stupidity. The second, in favor of paying serious attention to the environ-ment where agents endowed with decision autonomy —be they sapient, human or otherwise — interact. Although the paper is ostensibly speculative, some concrete ele-ments are advanced to substantiate both arguments. ...|$|R

40|$|The main {{function}} of the ground floor is to transmit static and dynamic loads and to save performance over required time in environment {{of the influence of}} different agents. Because of the hard exploitation conditions, together with the influence of different agents that destruct the ground floors, they must fulfill some usable requirements. To fulfill the service life requirements that are connected with the <b>concrete</b> <b>ground</b> floors, they must get the proper structure. To estimate the exertion of the analyzed <b>concrete</b> <b>ground</b> floors, it is necessary to take into consideration the complex state of stresses, which takes palace where the floor slab is subjected to pointed loads. The method, which makes possible to include the complex state of stresses in <b>ground</b> <b>concrete</b> slab calculations and to estimate the level of slab stresses in characteristic, analyzed of Wetergaard`s places objected by loads, has been proposed. That is why only some issues, connected with this topic, are presented in this paper. The model of concrete slab exertion, which makes possible to take under consideration the complex state of stresses in the slab at the place of putting the loads, is proposed. On the basis of considerations, analyses and calculations the method of defining the vertical susceptibility of the subsoil in the {{function of the}} subsoil deformation modulus is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Plain cement <b>concrete,</b> <b>ground</b> {{granulated}} {{blast furnace}} slag (GGBS) concrete, and fly ash concrete were designed. Three wet curing periods were employed, which were 2, 5, and 8 days. The drying shrinkage values of the concretes were measured within 1 year after wet curing. The {{results show that the}} increasing rate of the drying shrinkage of concrete containing a mineral admixture at late age is higher than that of plain cement concrete regardless of the wet curing time. With the reduction of wet curing time, the increment of total drying shrinkage of concrete decreases with the decrease of the W/B ratio. The negative effects on the drying shrinkage of fly ash concrete due to the reduction of the wet curing time are much more obvious than those of GGBS concrete and plain cement <b>concrete.</b> Superfine <b>ground</b> granulated {{blast furnace slag}} (SGGBS) can reduce the drying shrinkage of GGBS concrete and fly ash concrete when the wet curing time is insufficient...|$|R
