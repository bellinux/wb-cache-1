40|$|It {{has been}} shown that certain slow {{neurological}} diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also known as "mad cow" disease) could be transmitted through contaminated food intake by animals; therefore, the examination of meat components in commercial feeds is important for the control of the disease in public health. The combination of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLPs) technique was applied to examine the meat components in dog and cat commercial feeds. The partial nucleotide sequence (359 bp) of animal mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb, CYT) gene was amplified by PCR and then digested with restriction enzyme Alu I or Mbo I. In this work, eight brands of commercial dog and <b>cat</b> <b>feeds</b> available in Taiwan were examined. All brands of dog feeds that were tested contained meat from four different animals (cattle, pig, goat and chicken).

There were high concentrations of mycotoxins in both categories of feed, regardless of the notion that PBs are of a higher quality. The concentration of these toxins may contribute to the development of related pathologies in felines...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of substituting wheat bran (WB) by corn gluten feed without steep water (CGF) in <b>cats</b> <b>feeds</b> regarding the nutritional value of the diet, stool characteristics, time of food passage through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), intestinal gas production and concentrations of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in blood and faeces. Twenty eight cats were distributed in a randomized block design with four treatments (0, 2. 6, 5. 3 or 8. 0 % CGF, based on dry matter, substituting for WB) and seven replicates. Substitution of WB by CGF decreased (P 0. 05) the digestibility of other nutrients and apparent metabolizable energy. There was also no effect (P> 0. 05) on faeces moisture, faecal pH and score, food transit time in the GIT, intestinal gas area and SCFA concentrations in faeces, while blood concentrations of propionate were influenced differently by the different feeds and sampling times (P< 0. 05). Thus replacement of up to 8 % of WB by CGF may be done safely in <b>cats</b> <b>feed...</b>|$|R

40|$|On O'ahu, Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacifieus) {{and other}} seabirds nest {{primarily}} on small offshore islets, but fossil {{evidence shows that}} many seabirds formerly bred on O'ahu itself. Predation by introduced mammals is suspected {{to be the primary}} factor preventing shearwaters and other seabirds from reestablishing large nesting colonies on O'ahu. We investigated the effects of predation on Wedge-tailed Shearwaters by comparing three small unmanaged colonies at Malaekahana State Recreation Area on O'ahu, where feral cats are fed by the public, with a large managed colony at nearby Moku'auia Island State Seabird Sanctuary, where predators are absent. During three visits on 19 April, 16 June, and 23 October 2000, we located 69 occupied burrows in three colonies at Malaekahana and 85 occupied burrows in four monitoring plots at Moku'auia. Many more nests produced chicks at Moku'auia (62 %) than at Malaekahana (20 %). Among plots at Malaekahana, reproductive success was lowest (zero) at the colony closest to the <b>cat</b> <b>feeding</b> site. In addition, 44 adult shearwater carcasses were found at Malaekahana near the <b>cat</b> <b>feeding</b> site. Predation, most likely by cats attracted to supplemental food, had a devastating impact on shearwaters at Malaekahana. At one colony there was complete reproductive failure and almost all adults were killed. Populations of long-lived species like seabirds are sensitive to adult mortality, and Malaekahana may act as a sink, draining birds away from other areas...|$|R

40|$|Large <b>cats</b> <b>feeding</b> habits {{have been}} studied through two main methods: scat {{analysis}} and the carcasses of prey killed by monitored animals. From November 2001 to April 2004, we studied jaguar predation patterns using GPS telemetry location clusters on a cattle ranch in southern Pantanal. During this period, we recorded 431 carcasses of animals preyed upon by monitored jaguars. Concurrently, we collected 125 jaguar scats opportunistically. We compared the frequencies of prey found through each method. We also compared the prey communities using Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient. These comparisons allowed us {{to evaluate the use}} of scat analysis as a means to describe jaguar feeding habits. Both approaches identified prey communities with high similarity (Bray-Curtis coefficient > 70). According to either method, jaguars consume three main prey: cattle (Bos taurus), caiman (Caiman yacare) and peccaries (Tayassu pecari and Pecari tajacu). The two methods did not differ in the frequency of the three main prey over dry and wet seasons or years sampled.

40|$|Healthy animals {{normally}} eat sufficient food {{to satisfy}} their energy requirements. It {{is one of the}} jobs of the nutritionist to ensure that all other nutrient needs have been met when animals stop eating because they have met their energy needs. While dogs and cats are members of the biological order Carnivora, scientific observation and research support that differences in their metabolism and nutritional requirements exist. However, the goal in feeding both species is the same; to optimize {{the health and well-being of}} the individual. This approach results in dietary recommendations that will vary from individual animal to animal, based on a variety of factors that include the animal's signalment, occupation and environment. Feeding approaches vary between the two species and within the same species during different physiological life stages. However, the practice of feeding to maintain a lean body condition is a common goal. The maintenance of a lean body condition has been proven to increase both the quantity and quality of life in dogs. Currently, similar data does not exist in cats but is suspected to hold true.

40|$|Cat-scratch {{disease is}} an {{infectious}} disease ranging from very mild localized disease to severe dissiminated disease but self limited {{and is not}} contagious to others. This new zoonotic disease was first reported in Taiwan in 1998. Most of them had history of <b>cat</b> <b>feeding</b> at home. The history of cat bite or scratch is not always clear even when the patients themselves are asked. Palpable swollen lymph nodes are usually noted by the patient. We report an adult woman who had a definite history of being scratched by a cat and then developed ipsilateral axillary and elbow painful lymph nodes swelling associated with fever. The cat scratched site is beneath the right elbow region. Then, she was hospitalized for nine days for antibiotic therapy. During admission period, she was surveyed with gallium scan and SPECT. The focally involved lymph nodes are well demonstrated by scintigraphy in right axillary and elbow lymph nodes. The findings were well correlated with clinical history and symptom. This reminds us gallium inflammatory scan could be a routine scan and is helpful for the diagnosis of cat scratch disease, especially for children or immune system suppressed patients or even for normal healthy adults. Diseases mimicking cat scratch disease in imaging diagnosis are diverse and further clinical laboratory and history reviews are very important for differentiation because of variations...|$|R
40|$|Urban rat infestations have multifactorial {{causes and}} {{may result in}} severe public health and {{environmental}} problems, as well as heavy economic losses. The identification of putative environmental determinants of urban rat infestations and the mapping of areas prone to experiencing such infestations (hot spots) are crucial for effectively addressing intervention efforts.

This was done by modelling 10, 956 citizen-reported rat sightings from 2002 to 2008 using generalized additive models, both at municipality (Madrid) and district (Latina) levels. Increased age and density of housing, and decreased distance to vegetated areas, markets and <b>cat</b> <b>feeding</b> stations were factors associated with an increased risk of rat infestations. Risk maps for rat infestations were also developed and recurrent hot spots of rat activity were identified. Although a better fit to the data was obtained in the model for the smaller scale and possibly more environmentally homogenous study area of Latina, modelling the spatial distribution of rat sightings was useful for identifying factors associated with an increased risk of urban rat infestations, as well as for identifying hot spots of rat activity, providing local authorities with a practical tool for effectively targeting intervention efforts to high-risk situations based on the local environmental contexts...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Goats are {{considered}} very susceptible to infection by Toxoplasma gondii {{and when this}} occurs during pregnancy, it may cause fetal death with subsequent fetal resorption, abortion, mummification, stillborn or the birth of weak goats. The objective of this work {{was to determine the}} occurrence of and identify risk factors for T. gondii infection in goats in different mesoregions in the State of Alagoas. METHODS: The research was conducted on 24 goat breeding farms in 10 municipalities. A total of 454 blood samples were examined for anti-T. gondii antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test. To evaluate the risk factors of toxoplasmosis in goats, questionnaires were applied analyzing the farm's production system and nutritional, reproductive and sanitary management. RESULTS: Disease occurrence was 39 % with 95. 8 % of farms presenting seropositive animals. Significant associations were observed for mesoregion (OR = 0. 23; 95 %CI = 0. 09 - 0. 57), age (OR = 0. 36; 95 %CI = 0. 20 - 0. 64), semi-intensive herd management (OR = 8. 70; 95 %CI = 1. 87 - 40. 43), access of cats to water provided for goats (OR = 3. 38; 95 %CI = 1. 89 - 6. 02) and <b>cats</b> <b>feeding</b> on placental remnants (OR = 2. 73; 95 %CI = 1. 38 - 5. 40).
