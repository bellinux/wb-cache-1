5|$|The <b>Chevron</b> Corporation {{discovered}} the Adar Yale field in 1981, {{shortly before the}} start of the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005). Soon after <b>Chevron</b> had suspended operations in 1984, Sudanese government troops began attacking civilian settlements in the area, burning the houses and driving the people away, and in the late 1990s, Nuer militias from Nasir helped the army in clearing away the people to make way for the roads and infrastructure of the oilfield.|$|E
50|$|The optical {{illusion}} he described in 1889 involves {{the perception of}} the length of a line when the ends are capped by <b>chevrons.</b> Diverging <b>chevrons</b> seem to make the line longer when compared with converging <b>chevrons.</b> There are numerous similar geometrical illusions known now.|$|R
25|$|Their {{body color}} is a grayish green flat color marked by {{five to six}} bold pale gray <b>chevrons</b> {{alternating}} with dark gray to black <b>chevrons.</b> In adults, the dark <b>chevrons</b> are less contrasting than in juveniles. Ricord's iguana's eyes have a dark almost black iris and red sclera.|$|R
5000|$|The army rank {{insignia}} {{consists of}} two winged <b>chevrons</b> (or [...] "stripes"), the dress uniform being red <b>chevrons</b> with a yellow border.|$|R
5|$|<b>Chevron</b> Corporation and Shell Oil Company {{evacuated}} offshore crews {{from the}} Gulf of Mexico on September16 {{in preparation for}} a possible hurricane threat from Hurricane Gordon, even though there was little effect on oil and gas production before that day. The <b>Chevron</b> Corporation expected the number of people working in the Gulf to reduce from 1,700on September16 to 450the next day. Gordon also forced the cruise liner Carnival Sensation, consisting of 2,200passengers and 900crew members, to remain at sea for one day. Residents in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were also advised by radio {{to keep track of the}} approaching hurricane.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chevron</b> {{started to}} pull out of Sudan in 1984 when three of its {{employees}} were killed, finally selling all of its Sudanese interests in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} for sexual dimorphism has been weakened. A 2005 {{study reported that}} previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile <b>chevron</b> anatomy were in error, casting doubt {{on the existence of}} similar dimorphism between Tyrannosaurus rex sexes. A full-sized <b>chevron</b> was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E
5000|$|The school grades {{received}} by students are even today symbolized by military insignias which are worn {{on the traditional}} uniform (Uniforme de tradition), starting with [...] "Sergent-Major" [...] (4 golden <b>chevrons)</b> for {{the top of a}} class, [...] "Sergent" [...] (3 golden <b>chevrons),</b> [...] "Caporal-Chef" [...] (2 red and 1 golden <b>chevrons),</b> and finally [...] "Caporal" [...] (2 red <b>chevrons).</b> Typically, the top ten students of each class during a given quarter would receive such insignias.|$|R
50|$|The rank {{insignia}} {{consists of}} two <b>chevrons</b> pointing up and three <b>chevrons</b> pointing down, with the Singapore coat of arms in the middle.|$|R
5000|$|... "Corporal" [...] (caporal) is a NATO OR-3 level rank. The {{insignia}} is two <b>chevrons</b> of wool (vs. the two gold <b>chevrons</b> of a sergeant).|$|R
5|$|Soon after <b>Chevron</b> {{had closed}} operations, {{government}} troops began attacking civilian {{settlements in the}} area, burning the houses and driving the people away. This resulted in many deaths.|$|E
5|$|It has paired {{blowholes}} on {{a prominent}} splashguard and a broad, flat, V-shaped rostrum. A single median ridge stops {{well short of}} the rostrum tip. A light V-shaped marking, the <b>chevron,</b> begins behind the blowholes and extends back and then forward again.|$|E
5|$|Several major {{corporations}} are headquartered in the Bay Area. Among the Fortune 500 companies {{located in the}} region include technology companies Google, Apple Inc., Hewlett Packard, Intel, Applied Materials, eBay, Cisco Systems, Yahoo!, Symantec, and Oracle; energy companies <b>Chevron,</b> Calpine Corporation, and PG; financial service companies Charles Schwab Corporation, Visa Inc., and Wells Fargo; apparel retailers Gap Inc. and Levi Strauss & Co.; aerospace and defense contractor Lockheed Martin; local grocer Safeway; and biotechnology company Genentech. The largest manufacturers include Tesla Inc., Lam Research, Bayer, <b>Chevron,</b> and Coca-Cola. Oakland {{is the site of}} the fifth-largest container shipping port in the United States and is also a major rail terminus. In research, NASA's Ames Research Center and the federal research facility Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are based in Mountain View and Livermore respectively. In the North Bay, Napa and Sonoma counties are known for their famous wineries, including Fantesca Estate & Winery, Domaine Chandon California, and D'Agostini Winery.|$|E
50|$|Detective I has two silver <b>chevrons</b> above {{a silver}} lozenge; Detective II has three silver <b>chevrons</b> above a silver lozenge; Detective III has three silver <b>chevrons</b> above a silver rocker, {{with a silver}} lozenge in between; the Detective III rank is {{equivalent}} to the rank of Sergeant and the next step is Lieutenant.|$|R
5000|$|Rank badges were {{constructed}} from white herringbone lace sewn into 1-, 2-, or 3-bar <b>chevrons.</b> A crown was worn over the <b>chevrons</b> for staff sergeants.|$|R
5|$|GE and SNECMA {{also tested}} the {{effectiveness}} of <b>chevrons</b> on reducing jet noise. After examining configurations in the wind tunnel, CFMI chose to flight-test <b>chevrons</b> built into the core exhaust nozzle. The <b>chevrons</b> reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness decibels during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.|$|R
5|$|Specht's {{personal}} emblems adorning his aircraft {{included a}} design by Specht of a pencil superimposed on a <b>chevron</b> (termed a winged pencil) as a wry comment on being deskbound following his injuries. His single-engine aircraft with JG 11 sported a green spinner and a Knight's Cross {{painted on the}} cowling after {{he was awarded the}} honour in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Court also {{overruled}} Rowan Cos. v. United States (1981), and United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co. (1982), {{stating that}} the <b>Chevron</b> test {{does not depend on}} whether Congress intended to delegate out general authority over a matter or just specific authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} {{benefits from}} the annual <b>Chevron</b> World Challenge and AT National golf tournaments hosted by Woods. In October 2011, the foundation hosted the first Tiger Woods Invitational at Pebble Beach. Other annual fundraisers have included the concert events Block Party, last held in 2009 in Anaheim, and Tiger Jam, last held in 2011 in Las Vegas after a one-year hiatus.|$|E
50|$|There are neural spines on {{only the}} first eight caudals; it is unknown whether the neural spines are {{replaced}} by a groove further backwards, as in other troodontids. On {{the underside of the}} caudals, the <b>chevrons</b> are plate-like. The <b>chevrons</b> articulating with the first to fifth caudals are much taller than they are long; those articulating with the sixth to ninth caudals are longer than they are tall, although they are still relatively tall; and those articulating with the ninth, tenth, and further caudals are very shallow, and are somewhat flattened. On the caudals towards the back of the tail, the forward and backward projections of the <b>chevrons</b> are roughly equal in length. In these <b>chevrons,</b> the forward projection is blunt, while the backward projection is somewhat bifurcated. Unlike Sinusonasus, where all of the <b>chevrons</b> come into contact with each other, there are some gaps between the <b>chevrons</b> of Jianianhualong.|$|R
50|$|All U.S. Coast Guard petty {{officers}} wear red <b>chevrons</b> and red service stripes {{until the}} rank of chief petty officer, who wear gold <b>chevrons</b> and service stripes.|$|R
50|$|All U.S. Coast Guard petty {{officers}} wear red <b>chevrons</b> and red service stripes, {{until the}} rate of chief petty officer, where both <b>chevrons</b> and service stripes are gold.|$|R
5|$|The {{interests}} in the Lucas operation at Spindletop were purchased by J. M. Guffey and his associates, creating the Guffey Petroleum Company and Gulf Refining Company of Texas. These companies later became Gulf Oil Corporation, which decades later was bought by California's <b>Chevron.</b> Guffey's company became the largest oil producer in the state during the boom period.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 a rock {{coloured}} red, {{orange and}} yellow was unearthed. Although containers of pigments {{have been found}} previously at sites such as Skara Brae, {{this was the first}} discovery in Britain, and possibly in Northern Europe, of evidence that Neolithic peoples used paint to decorate their buildings. It is thought that the primitive paint could have been made from iron ore, mixed with animal fat, milk or eggs. Only a week later a stone with a zigzag <b>chevron</b> pattern painted with a red pigment was discovered nearby.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the storm, 8,000offshore oil workers were evacuated. Despite typical evacuation procedure, <b>Chevron</b> Corporation immediately evacuated their offshore oil staff rather than executing a three phase evacuation plan. On land, 2,500residents and tourists on Grand Isle were also evacuated. In total, as many as 80,000people evacuated from coastal areas leading up to Bob's eventual landfall. In New Orleans, 4,000people checked into the city's 19evacuation centers. The Mississippi River was temporarily closed to shipping by the United States Coast Guard for eight hours before reopening after the storm.|$|E
2500|$|Sergeant (Sgt or PS): Three pointing-down <b>chevrons</b> {{above the}} divisional call sign and {{shoulder}} number. An [...] "acting" [...] sergeant, {{such as a}} substantive constable being paid an allowance to undertake the duties of a sergeant {{for a short period}} of time, displays two pointing-down <b>chevrons</b> above the divisional call sign, and shoulder number. The use of three <b>chevrons</b> by an acting sergeant is technically incorrect. [...] Three <b>chevrons</b> should only be used during a period of temporary (as opposed to acting) promotion or when substantively in the rank.|$|R
5000|$|The rate {{insignia}} for a petty officer, {{first class}} is a perched eagle above three <b>chevrons.</b> On more formal uniforms (dress white and dress blue uniform), the {{symbol for the}} petty officer's rating will be placed between the eagle and the <b>chevrons.</b> On white uniforms, the eagle, rating, and <b>chevrons</b> are dark blue (almost black- {{this has led to}} the eagle being referred to as the [...] "crow" [...] in common practice, and often the entire rating badge is simply referred to as the crow). On navy blue (black) uniforms, the eagle and rating are white, and the <b>chevrons</b> are red, unless the sailor has served in the Navy for 12 years or more with good conduct- then that sailor wears gold <b>chevrons</b> on the dress blue uniform. Gold <b>chevrons</b> are also worn on the collars of the Navy blue coveralls uniform, and on the black garrison cap (only) worn with the Navy service working uniform (often called [...] "peanut butters" [...] or [...] "black and tans"). The Coast Guard does not use golden <b>chevrons.</b> Working uniforms (all variations of the camouflage uniform) and metal rank devices do not have the rating badge symbol.|$|R
5000|$|Under Louis XIV it {{was awarded}} a coat of arms emblazoned [...] "Azure, three <b>chevrons</b> Argent". The Azure perhaps {{suggests}} {{the river and the}} three <b>chevrons</b> a narrow boxed valley.|$|R
5|$|Krokom Municipality {{was formed}} in 1974 and bears arms granted in 1977, {{featuring}} a ram (gumsen) based on a 6000-year-old rock carving at Glösabäcken. The ram seen here {{was included in the}} seal of the legislature of Rödön from 1658. While petroglyphs long predate heraldry, they rarely appear in heraldic armory. Blazon: Argent, a <b>chevron</b> gemel wavy inverted and diminished azure, beneath a ram {{in the manner of a}} rock carving gules.|$|E
5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a <b>chevron</b> or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, 2008, Williams and a {{consortium}} of oil companies led by <b>Chevron</b> Canada signed a deal to develop the Hebron oil field – the second largest oil field {{off the coast of}} the province with an estimated 700million barrels of oil reserves, worth some $20billion in royalties and up to 3,500 jobs from the project. Construction is scheduled to start in 2012, with oil extraction by 2017.|$|E
50|$|Enlisted sailors also wore {{a rating}} badge above their rank <b>chevrons</b> while trade badges were {{displayed}} below. Enlisted <b>chevrons</b> {{on the shore}} uniform were gold colored with a dark green background.|$|R
50|$|Station {{sergeant}} (also {{known as}} Crown sergeant or Staff sergeant) is a police rank senior to sergeant and junior to inspector in some British and Commonwealth police forces. The rank insignia {{is usually a}} sergeant's three <b>chevrons</b> surmounted by a crown, or sometimes four <b>chevrons.</b> The Metropolitan Police (of London), {{which was the first}} force to introduce the rank, originally used four <b>chevrons,</b> but later changed to a crown over three <b>chevrons.</b> A police officer holding the rank will be the senior sergeant in a police station, or in some cases the commander of a smaller sub-divisional police establishment.|$|R
25|$|Eleven <b>chevrons</b> {{were listed}} in the holotype of Huabeisaurus by Pang and Cheng, but {{thirteen}} are visible in pre-reconstruction photographs, and twelve are currently present in the Museum of Shijiazhuang University. These elements correspond to positions covering nearly {{the entire length of}} the preserved caudal vertebral series. The <b>chevrons</b> are generally well preserved, but there is some distortion and damage. The correspondence of <b>chevrons</b> to particular caudal vertebrae is uncertain.|$|R
