5|$|The <b>Concert</b> <b>for</b> Bangladesh– {{originally}} titled The <b>Concert</b> <b>for</b> Bangla Desh– is a live triple album by George Harrison {{and celebrity}} friends, released on Apple Records in December 1971 in America and January 1972 in Britain. The album followed the two concerts {{of the same}} name, held on 1 August 1971 at New York's Madison Square Garden, featuring Harrison, Bob Dylan, Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Leon Russell and Eric Clapton. The shows were a pioneering charity event, in aid of the homeless Bengali refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War, and set the model for future multi-artist rock benefits such as Live Aid (1985) and the <b>Concert</b> <b>for</b> New York City (2001).|$|E

5|$|The concerts were {{attended}} by {{a total of}} 40,000 people, and raised close to $250,000 for Bangladesh relief, which was administered by UNICEF. Although the project was subsequently marred by financial problems – a result of the pioneering nature of the venture – the <b>Concert</b> <b>for</b> Bangladesh is recognised as a highly successful and influential humanitarian aid project, generating both awareness and considerable funds as well as providing valuable lessons and inspiration for projects that followed, notably Live Aid. By 1985, through revenue raised from the <b>Concert</b> <b>for</b> Bangladesh live album and film, an estimated $12 million had been sent to Bangladesh in relief.|$|E
