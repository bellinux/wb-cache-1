6000|$|... "Anderson, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{how many}} tons of steel rails {{they turn out}} at Liege every week? Sir Thomas asks me, just {{as though it were}} the {{simplest}} question in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in, come in," [...] the Prussians answered. [...] "We are all {{friends for}} tonight, for {{we are all}} in equally bad plight. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how matters have gone, up there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for this promptitude, Don Luis, having some need of your services. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what hath befel the Señor Christoval Colon, the Genoese navigator, with whom, they inform me, you have some intimacy?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well, then, Anne spelled with an E, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{how this}} mistake {{came to be}} made? We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy. Were there no boys at the asylum?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. He {{would be}} the heir. How {{pleasant}} it must be to you to find yourself on such affectionate terms with--the heir! And when he comes into his inheritance, who is to be tenant? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|...

60|$|ISABEL. Because--because {{we like to}} {{know about}} real things; and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> and we can't ask {{the man who wrote}} the stories.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, what {{we wanted}} to ask you specially, Johnson, was whether <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what the {{servants}} at the Hall thought about it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|The judge {{leaned back}} in his chair with a {{luxuriance}} in which it was hard to separate the cynicism and the admiration.

6000|$|The {{confined}} entrance was so dark that it {{was impossible}} to make out distinctly what kind of person opened the door; but it appeared to be an old woman.

6000|$|... "She {{has lived}} so {{different}} a life to yourself, Agnes, {{that it is}} no wonder that you should feel at first that you have nothing in common with her.

6000|$|... "Well, I wouldn't cry {{any more}} about it," [...] said Frank consolingly. [...] "Crying won't do any good, you know. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{where to find the}} wood-lane that cuts across to Blackburn Hill?" [...] Maggie could, and gave us minute directions. So, having thanked her, we left her to pursue her disconsolate way and betook {{ourselves}} homeward.|$|E
6000|$|I {{wondered}} what {{the subject of the}} picture was, but waited an opportunity to approach the speaker, while, as I did so, a young man said: [...] "I should rather like to take up your sister's challenge.

6000|$|... "No, our {{vessel was}} a trader bound for Zanzibar. She now lies in {{fragments}} on the shore, {{and we have}} escaped with nothing but the clothes on our backs. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{whether there is a}} town or a village in the neighbourhood? for, as you see, we stand sadly in need of clothing, food, and shelter.

6000|$|... "Hadn't {{you better}} sit down, {{and if you}} want {{anything}} to eat we'll get it you," [...] he said. [...] "Then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what your errand is." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Leger. [...] "Only a {{trace of}} colour, but I don't want to talk of that to-night. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about your journey when you have had supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Prince and {{his party}} kept together, and hurried from the prison {{as fast as they}} could. When the day broke they had gone several miles, and then they stopped to rest. [...] "Where is that Jolly-cum-pop?" [...] said the Prince. [...] "I suppose he has gone home. He is a pretty fellow to lead us into this trouble and then desert us! How are we to find the way back to his house? Course-marker, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> the {{direction}} in which we should go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{precision}} {{of the action}} is my amazement," [...] I replied. [...] "I've noticed this same thing many times. Apparently, darkness is no barrier to action {{on the part of}} these forces. That cone, you will observe, can touch you on the nose, eyelid, or ear, softly, without jar or jolt.

Of course this is not conclusive as argument, {{but at the same time}} it has weight. Whose is the eye that directs this instrument? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> 'Wilbur'?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ray Cohn: [...] "There is {{one other}} question. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> any names of any Communists working on the Manhattan project?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'DEAR DR. EDMUND,--We {{are anxious}} about Herr Harz. We {{think he is}} perhaps not very well to-day. We (I and Christian) should like to know. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> Please shall <b>you?</b> GRETA.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Joe, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> 'bout {{this thing}} or not, jest {{as you have}} a mind. What we've come for is {{to help you get}} clear, an' we're bound to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{not going}} to worry 'bout what you call it," [...] said {{the man who had}} not spoken yet. [...] "We have come here so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what <b>you</b> mean to do." ...|$|R
