The mines exploited a number of veins, the copper-bearing mineral <b>chalcopyrite</b> being the main ore, although some nickel, cobalt and lead were also extracted.

40|$|The topaz-bearing ores {{were found}} from the Akazawa mine,Katashina,Gunma Prefecture,Japan. This {{is the first}} finding of topaz from the mines in Gunma Prefecture. The Akazawa mine is an {{abandoned}} copper mine and the ore deposit lies in the Okunikkou rhyolites (late Cretaceous～Paleozoic). Seventeen minerals {{were found in the}} wastes from the Akazawa mine:chalcopyrite,sphalerite,arsenopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, native sulfur, quartz, topaz, calcite, chlorite, sericite, kaolinite, feldspar, anglesite, goethite and jarosite. The unit-cell dimensions of <b>chalcopyrites,</b> sphalerites, arsenopyrites, pyrites, pyrrhotites, galena, quartzes and topazes were calculated. Galena occurs only in the wastes carrying topaz. Anglesites are formed at the margin or along the cleavage planes of galena. A small amount of sericite and kaolinite occur only in topaz-bearing wastes. Most of gangue minerals are quartz. Two kinds of quartz are found in the topaz-bearing wastes. One is coarse-grained euhedral to subhedral crystals or their fragments. The other occurrence is fine-grained quartz mosaic,surrounding coarse-grained quartz. Some coarse-grained quartzes are partly corroded and are recognized the successively growing after the corrosion. Topaz occurs in a few wastes as the radial aggregates of colorless columnar crystals (usually less than 0. 1 mm in long) around <b>chalcopyrites,</b> sphalerites and galenas. In the quartz mosaic, topazes crystallize between quartz grains and seem to be going to replace quartzes. The OH/(OH＋F) value of topaz was estimated from the unit-cell dimensions and volume (Wunder et al. 1993). The average value was 0. 21 atom. ％ and this is corresponding to 16. 39 wt％ in F contents of the topaz.

The modified random isodisplacement model was used to account for the experimental results; this model has been generalized to mixed crystals containing more than three different atomic species. ^ A reflectivity and photoluminescence study of Cd 1 -xMn xSe and Cd 1 -xZn xSe epilayers was carried out to determine the x-dependence of the energy gap in the zinc-blende modification of these alloys. Spin-flip Raman scattering in epilayers of cubic Cd 1 -xMn xSe, including the range of high-x values not available in bulk, has shown evidence of antiferromagnetic interaction between Mn 2 + ions. ^ The photoluminescence spectra of Zn 1 -xCd xSe/Zn 1 -yMn ySe superlattices show confinement effects and Zeeman shifts which are compatible with theoretical calculations. The k · p based transfer matrix method, which includes the effect of strain, yields information about band offsets. Raman signatures of folded acoustic phonons are observed indicating a high structural quality of the superlattices studied. ^ A spin-flip Raman scattering study of Cd 1 -xMn xTe epilayers grown by Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE) indicated that high quality epilayers of doped diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS 2 ̆ 7 s) can be grown using LPE. ^ Vibrational Raman scattering in AgGaS 2 and AgGaSe 2, I-III-VI 2 <b>chalcopyrites</b> with D 2 d 12 symmetry, is studied.

25|$|The Greenside {{fault is}} a normal fault with an average dip of 70° to the east. A fault plane is not a flat surface and the actual dip of the Greenside fault varies between 58° east and vertical; in one place it was 83° west. As the rock {{fractured}} and the two sides moved against each other, cavities were created, partly filled with broken rock (fault breccia and fault gouge). Hydrothermal circulation of sea water at temperatures of 110130°C, probably during the Carboniferous Period, led to mineralisation of the fault cavities. The metal content {{is believed to have}} been leached out of rocks of the Skiddaw Group, or the underlying granite batholith. The mineralisation of the fault shows some vertical zonation, with baryte (barium sulphate) in the upper part of the vein, and small amounts of both blende (sphalerite, zinc sulphide) and <b>chalcopyrite</b> (copper-iron sulphide) at deeper levels.|$|E

It was up to 59 feet (18m) wide in the highest workings of the Greenside Mine, but averaged about 8 feet (2.5m) wide in deeper workings. The vein contained galena in a mixture of quartz and smashed rock. Galena (lead sulphide) is an ore of lead. The ore from Greenside also yielded 10oz of silver per ton of lead. Higher levels of the vein also contained quantities of baryte (barium sulphate), although at the time this had no commercial value.

Climate factors appear {{to play an important role}} as turquoise is typically found in arid regions, filling or encrusting cavities and fractures in typically highly altered volcanic rocks, often with associated limonite and other iron oxides. In the Southwestern United States turquoise is almost invariably associated with the weathering products of copper sulfide deposits in or around potassium-feldspar-bearing porphyritic intrusives.
