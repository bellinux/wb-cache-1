40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the characteristics of}} scrambling in Japanese within the Principles and Parameters theory (Chomsky 1981 - 1992, and others). In the late 19802 ̆ 7 s, the important hypothesis has been raised that scrambling can be in principle A or A'-movement (e. g. Mahajan 1989). The present work investigates when and why scrambling can be A-movement. A wide range of examples with scrambling is considered, including the comparison of clause-internal scrambling vs. long distance scrambling, scrambling to the sentence initial position vs. scrambling to the intermediate position, as well as long distance scrambling out of a finite clause vs. long distance scrambling out of a <b>Control</b> <b>clause.</b> ^ Chapter 1 gives {{an overview of the}} thesis. The discussion in Chapter 2 leads the conclusion that only clause-internal scrambling to the intermediate position and scrambling out of a <b>Control</b> <b>clause</b> to the intermediate position can be A-movement. It is, therefore, argued that there is an A-position in the intermediate position, between the subject and the indirect object. Chapter 3 considers the status of the intermediate A-position. It is shown that clause-internal scrambling to this position is necessarily A-movement, while scrambling out of a <b>Control</b> <b>clause</b> to this position can be A or A'-movement. This contrast is accounted for in terms of the Case Checking Theory and the Economy of derivation in Chomsky (1989, 1992) and Chomsky and Lasnik (1991). It is argued that A-scrambling is to the Spec of AGRoP. Chapter 4 provides further support for the hypothesis raised in Chapter 3, considering long distance A-scrambling. The data are presented which suggest that the scrambled object can have its Case checked in the matrix clause. Another important goal of this chapter is to examine the structure of a Control construction in Japanese, which has not been adequately discussed in the literature. Provided that a <b>Control</b> <b>clause</b> allows long distance A-scrambling, whereas a finite clause does not, the structural differences are considered in conjunction with the locality requirement on A-movement in Chomsky and Lasnik (1991). ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Aspects of Diraytata Morphology and Syntax as {{it relates}} to lexical categories, predicate arguments, anaphoric binding relations and patterns of argument structure and mapping relations in light of the theory of Lexical-Functional Grammar. Diraytata is one of leastknown languages in the Konsoid chain in the Oromoid subgroup in the Nuclear Southern Lowland East Cushitic group within the Cushitic family. The Ethiopian Languages Research Center (ELRC), of which the candidate is a member, gives priority and encourages its staff to conduct research on the least studied languages. The present thesis goes in line with the research priority of the Center. The data were obtained from informants from two longer fieldtrips to Dirashe Special District. The methods used for data collection were elicitation and group discussion. The thesis has two parts and ten chapters. The first chapter gives a general introduction to the people, the language, previous studies on the language, etc. and the second chapter introduces the theoretical framework. Part I, from chapters 3 to 5, examines the morphology of Diraytata. In chapter 3, the noun morphology has been presented. In Diraytata case and definiteness are inextricably bound up with the focus system and hence inexplicable without a prior exposure to the focus system. The major claim is that the nominative case is inappropriate to designate a subject case in Diraytata and be replaced by non-focalized subject case (NFS). In chapter 4, the adjectives have been considered. Attributive adjectives inflect for gender and number. The predicative adjectives occur in clause final position. It has been argued that the attributive and predicative adjectives in Diraytata are derived from a common categorially unspecified bound stem. In chapter 5, the verb morphology has been discussed. In the first section, we have dealt with inflections. We said that verbs inflect for various grammatical categories such as for agreement, aspect and mood. We posited a phonetically null bound affix "ø" in order to fill the gap in a predicate paradigm. The newly introduced null bound affix "ø" has a third person masculine singular interpretation. In the second section, we have seen the verb derivations: passives, middles and causatives. Part II, from chapters 6 to 9, discusses the syntax. In chapter 6, the phrasal arguments of Diraytata have been examined. We have classified the predicates into three types {{on the basis of the}} types of arguments they select at f-structure. In chapter 7, the clausal complements have been considered. The clausal complements are classified into two: controlled and non-controlled. The latter type does not allow an external controller to <b>control</b> <b>clause</b> internal arguments whereas the former type allows an external controller to <b>control</b> <b>clause</b> internal argument. In chapter 8, the anaphoric binding relation has been discussed. We have divided the anaphors of Diraytata into two: nuclear and non-nuclear anaphors. The nuclear anaphors subsume reflexives and reciprocals. There are two types of reflexive morphemes: ?iss and mašš-. Reciprocity is indicated by the morpheme ?orr. The reflexive and the reciprocal function as an object argument only. On the other hand, the non-nuclear anaphors subsume pronouns designated by PRO. In chapter 9, the argument structure and the Lexical Mapping Theory have been discussed. We have considered the application of LMT to various predicates in Diraytata such as intransitive, transitive, passive, raising and causative predicates. The major claim is that the standard LMT is inadequate to account for the causatives of ditransitive predicates in Diraytata, as such predicates may have more than one OBJ functions that goes contrary to the Function-Argument Bi-uniqueness principle. We have seen that the version of LMT called FMT of Alsina (1996) is appropriate to handle the causatives of ditransitive predicates as the FMT allows more than one OBJ functions. We have proposed the Recipient Suppression operation to the Morpholexical Operations of Bresnan and Kanerva (1989) and Bresnan and Moshi (1990) in order to account for the active intransitive counterparts of the ditransitive predicates. The newly introduced suppression operation takes care of recipient or benefactive deletion in a ditransitive predicate. In conclusion, this study proves that the basic assumptions, the principles and the formal architectures of LFG are generally correct in handling the empirical facts of Diraytata. However, we need to add some operations (e. g. Recipient Suppression) to explain syntactic phenomena more adequately. </p...|$|E

Although both passive and middle verb forms denote situations that logically require an agent, middle verbs, which by hypothesis do not lexically specify an agent, elicited longer processing times than passive verbs in measures of early processing.

40|$|Abstract. Most {{state of}} the art SAT solvers for {{industrial}} problems are based on the Conflict Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) paradigm. Although this paradigm evolved from the systematic DPLL search algorithm, modern techniques of far backtracking and restarts make CDCL solvers non-systematic. CDCL solvers do not systematically examine all possible truth assignments as does DPLL. Local search solvers are also non-systematic and in this paper we show that CDCL can be reformulated as a local search algorithm: a local search algorithm that through clause learning is able to prove UNSAT. We show that the standard formulation of CDCL as a backtracking search algorithm and our new formulation of CDCL as a local search algorithm are equivalent, up to tie breaking. In the new formulation of CDCL as local search, the trail no longer plays {{a central role in the}} algorithm. Instead, the ordering of the literals on the trail is only a mechanism for efficiently <b>controlling</b> <b>clause</b> learning. This changes the paradigm and opens up avenues for further research and algorithm design. For example, in QBF the quantifier places restrictions on the ordering of variables on the trail. By making the trail less important, an extension of our local search algorithm to QBF may provide a way of reducing the impact of these variable ordering restrictions. ...|$|R

In Quickturn Design Sys., Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp., the Delaware supreme court invalidated a no hand poison pill on grounds that a board of directors lacks authority to adopt such devices. In doing so, the court misinterpreted relevant Delaware law. It's unjustifiably called into question the validity of a host of corporate precominitment strategies. Finally, and perhaps most troublingly, it called into question the central tenet of Delaware corporate law; namely, the plenary authority of the board of directors. This article argues that the Delaware supreme court's decision was wrong both as a doctrinal and a policy matter. There simply is no firebreak between the sorts of board self disablement deemed invalid by Quickturn and the host of other precommitment strategies routinely used by corporate boards of directors. The Delaware supreme court's conclusion that the former are invalid for lack of statutory authority thus threatens to invalidate all of the latter.

The financial collaboration between governments {{and the private sector}} through public private partnerships (PPP) can promote a widespread implementation of green initiatives.

40|$|The syntax of participial clauses {{has been}} an {{important}} issue in syntactic theory, especially since Perlmutter (1978) put forth the Unaccusative Hypothesis. This is the object of a lively debate, {{one of the most controversial}} aspects being whether unaccusativity effects are better explained in syntactic or semantic terms (cf. e. g. Sorace 2000). Focusing on Italian, this paper argues that participial clauses are subject to both syntactic and semantic constraints and that, contrary to the claims of semanticist approaches to unaccusativity (à la Van Valin 1990), the former take precedence over the latter. Demonstrably, an Aktionsart constraint requiring that the predicate involved be telic operates in a different fashion for the two classes of unaccusatives vs. unergatives. This fact, however, becomes clear only once a commonplace is refuted: Italian unergatives are not altogether ungrammatical in participial clauses, as currently assumed in the wake of Perlmutter (1989). They are so only within a syntactically defined subset thereof, that of noncontrolled participial constructions, while in the complementary subset of <b>controlled</b> participial <b>clauses,</b> occurrence of unergatives is syntactically allowed and semantically constrained. This indicates that the two constructions obey distinct syntactic conditions. Formalization of these, carried out in Relational Grammar, automatically solves a number of problems, within Italian and across Romance. Most notably, it affords a natural solution to the problem of the voice of Romance participial constructions. It also allows a proper understanding of the Romance facts under discussion against the background of a cross-linguistic typology of alignment systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|Most {{approaches}} to obligatory control phenomena analyse it as {{a variant of}} raising or as a variant of non-obligatory control. This article argues for a third option, that obligatory control is where the distribution of movement and PRO overlaps. In support of this, a variety of effects are shown to consistently uncover two types of obligatory control complements. The first has properties strongly reminiscent of movement: the relevant positions are non-distinct and can share a single case. The second class instead resembles non-obligatory control: the lower position bears an independent case and can denote a superset of the higher position. That these are indeed structurally different {{is evidenced by the}} fact that manipulating the embedded context allows these types of obligatory control to be differentiated reliably. For instance, when a superset reading of the lower position is induced, the properties associated with movement are filtered out (Landau 2008). Inherent case on the lower position is another diagnostic of this type, because movement from an inherent case position to a θ-position is shown to be severely constrained. Obligatory <b>control</b> into finite <b>clauses,</b> finally, can be used to distinguish movement from PRO, because PRO is incompatible with subject-verb agreement...|$|R

The Japanese causative represents in a very pure form {{the problem of the}} morphology/syntax interface. Consequently, the causative construction {{is one of the most}} theoretically significant aspects of Japanese grammar, its three subtypes having attracted more attention and inspired more theoretical proposals than almost any other construction. Analyses of the causative have had a major influence on many foundational aspects of syntactic theory, including <b>control,</b> case marking, <b>clause</b> structure, theta-theory and argument structure, and the morphology-syntax interface. All of these issues have received extensive treatment in the literature, and this chapter will touch on many of them. We will, however, focus on the importance for linguistic theory of a single problem posed by the construction: In what component of th...|$|R
