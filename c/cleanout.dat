50|$|The most typical use for {{coiled tubing}} is {{circulation}} or deliquification. A hydrostatic head (a column of fluid {{in the well}} bore) may be inhibiting flow of formation fluids because of its weight (the well {{is said to have}} been killed). The safest (though not the cheapest) solution would be to attempt to circulate out the fluid, using a gas, frequently nitrogen (Often called a Nitrogen Kick). By running coiled tubing into the bottom of the hole and pumping in the gas, the kill fluid can be forced out to production. Circulating can also be used to clean out light debris, which may have accumulated in the hole. Coiled tubing umbilicals can convey hydraulic submersible pumps and jet pumps into wells. These pumps allow for inexpensive and noninvasive well <b>cleanouts</b> on low-pressure CBM (coal bed methane) gas wells. These umbilicals can also be run into deviated wells and horizontal laterals.|$|R
50|$|While an {{external}} French drain can operate {{for ten years}} or more {{without the need for}} maintenance, it is prone to clogging without any warning and can eventually lead to a flooded basement. When there is no filter fiber, sediments can make their way through the stone as years pass and clog the drain, and when the filter fabric is present, that can instead clog with sediments. It may be wise to provide <b>cleanouts,</b> much as is done with sanitary sewers, to provide access for inspection with a camera snake. Also, a French drain that is not installed with a sump pump counts on gravity alone to drain foundation water, and if the house is not located on a hill or near a steep incline, finding this slope can be problematic. Additionally, maintenance on {{an external}} French drain involves expensive exterior excavation, which includes removal of walkways, shrubberies, porches, gardens, and anything else along the perimeter.|$|R

50|$|Because it is a {{localized}} low-point in the plumbing, sink traps {{also tend}} to capture heavy objects (such as jewelry) that are inadvertently dropped into the sink.

The project will occupy approximately 25 net acres ofsurface area located within the Kapoho Section ofthe Kilauea Lower East Rift Geothermal Resource Subzone. Each drilling site will be engineered to support the drilling equipment and to keep drilling effluent contained on site and separate from any natural drainage. Each wellpad will have drilling mud pits, sumps with gently sloped walls used to temporarily store drilling wastes which typically consist of rock cuttings, waste drilling mud, cement particles, lost-circulation material and other drilling mud additives, and other waste drilling liquids. The high porosity of the volcanic soils and rock in the site area results in rapid downward percolation of rainwater. Berms will be provided to contain possible spills in areas where chemicals are handled. Catch basins, culverts, ditches, and berms will be provided for drainage control. In accordance with the requirements of the Department of Health NSP, geothermal emissions will be vented through an approved abatement device during well/pipeline <b>cleanouts.</b> Noise will be generated during well drilling, construction, and operational phases of the project.

CAU 543 sites are located in Areas 6 and 15 of the Nevada Test Site (NTS), which is {{approximately}} 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. CAU 543 consists of the following seven Corrective Action Sites (CASs) (Figure 1) : CAS 06 - 07 - 01, Decon Pad; CAS 15 - 01 - 03, Aboveground Storage Tank; CAS 15 - 04 - 01, Septic Tank; CAS 15 - 05 - 01, Leachfield; CAS 15 - 08 - 01, Liquid Manure Tank; CAS 15 - 23 - 01, Underground Radioactive Material Area; and CAS 15 - 23 - 03, Contaminated Sump, Piping. All Area 15 CASs are located at the former U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Farm, which operated from 1963 to 1981 and was used to support animal experiments involving the uptake of radionuclides. Each of the Area 15 CASs, except CAS 15 - 23 - 01, is associated with the disposal of waste effluent from Building 15 - 06, which was the primary location of the various tests and experiments conducted onsite. Waste effluent disposal from Building 15 - 06 involved piping, sumps, outfalls, a septic tank with leachfield, underground storage tanks, and an aboveground storage tank (AST). CAS 15 - 23 - 01 was associated with decontamination activities of farm equipment potentially contaminated with radiological constituents, pesticides, and herbicides. While the building structures were removed before the investigation took place, all the original tanks, sumps, piping, and concrete building pads remain in place. The Area 6 CAS is located at the Decontamination Facility in Area 6, a facility which operated from 1971 to 2001 and was used to decontaminate vehicles, equipment, clothing, and other materials that had become contaminated during nuclear testing activities. The CAS includes the effluent collection and distribution systems for Buildings 6 - 605, 6 - 606, and 6 - 607, which consists of septic tanks, sumps, piping, floor drains, drain trenches, <b>cleanouts,</b> and a concrete foundation.

50|$|Alternately if moving sink to {{an island}} sink, install the P-trap below {{the floor of the}} island and vent {{off the top of the}} drain.

In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum trap arm be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g. 1.25 inch pipe needs a 2.5-inch trap arm, 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch trap arm etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a <b>cleanout</b> is required on both the vent and the drain. The reason for this is in the event of a plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the vent, possibly plugging the vent (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Coal {{particles}} <b>cleanout</b> {{which is}} regarded as the key technology in the operation of coal bed methane (CBM) wells, play an important part in making steady production. In oil wells, Sand <b>cleanout</b> is operated by circulating a liquid or a multiphase fluid into the wellbore to bring sand particles to the surface. Although the sand <b>cleanout</b> operations have been applied successfully in most wells with high efficiency and negligible leakage, it would leak working fluid into coal bed formation, destroy the structure of coal bed and jam the formed channel of gas production. In this paper, a new continuous vacuum <b>cleanout</b> technology has been developed to effectively remove coal particles in CBM wells by employing a jet pump. The Concentric Tubing String (CTS) which is assembled by 3. 5 inch tubing and 1. 5 inch tubing is also introduced in, because there is no CCT technology in China at the moment. Detailed structure and principle of the coal particles <b>cleanout</b> technology system are described, while a theoretical model is formulated to optimally design the system based on the coal particles settling experimental data and jet pumping theory. It has been shown from field applications that the coal particles <b>cleanout</b> technology makes significant improvements in achieving high efficiency and preventing leakage in CBM wells. Moreover, the new technology reduces the skin damage and increase the production compared to non-vacuum CBM wells...|$|E
