5|$|Video game enthusiasts took an {{interest}} in gaming <b>crossovers</b> which feature characters from multiple franchises in a particular game. An early example of this type of fighting game was the 1998 arcade release , featuring comic book superheroes as well as characters from other Capcom games. In 1999, Nintendo released the first game in the Super Smash Bros. series, which allowed match-ups such as Pikachu versus Mario.|$|E
5|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having {{to cross the street}} before entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In many older stations, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine <b>crossovers.</b> Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E

5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} <b>crossovers</b> and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby 2 is {{the sequel}} to Destruction Derby. Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, the goal is to earn points by destroying or spinning the other competitors during the race; Stock Car, a typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and Destruction Derby, based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which the goal is to inflict as much damage as possible. A new feature called the pit stop was added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major difference from the original game is track obstacles such as jumps and <b>crossovers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no <b>crossovers</b> or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E

5|$|In the post-classic era, a {{significant}} trend in noir <b>crossovers</b> has involved science fiction. In Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville (1965), Lemmy Caution {{is the name}} of the old-school private eye in the city of tomorrow. The Groundstar Conspiracy (1972) centers on another implacable investigator and an amnesiac named Welles. Soylent Green (1973), the first major American example, portrays a dystopian, near-future world via a self-evidently noir detection plot; starring Charlton Heston (the lead in Touch of Evil), it also features classic noir standbys Joseph Cotten, Edward G. Robinson, and Whit Bissell. The film was directed by Richard Fleischer, who two decades before had directed several strong B noirs, including Armored Car Robbery (1950) and The Narrow Margin (1952).|$|E

3000|$|The <b>crossover</b> {{operation}} recombines {{the genes}} of two selected chromosomes to generate a new <b>crossover</b> child to be formed in the next generation. It aims to take the best features of each parent and mix the remaining features in forming the offspring (Asghari and Nezhadali 2014). If the new individuals that are called offsprings inherit good features from their parent, the chance of their survival will increase. The process is continued until the termination criterion is reached. Afterward, the best result is selected as the optimum solution. In the <b>crossover</b> operation, the mating of chromosomes is necessary for offspring production. There are various types of <b>crossover</b> operation including one-point <b>crossover,</b> two-point <b>crossover,</b> integrated <b>crossover,</b> cut and slice <b>crossover,</b> semi-integrated <b>crossover,</b> etc. In one-point <b>crossover,</b> two chromosomes are selected randomly from a single point and exchange the considered numbers which results in two other chromosomes. The original chromosomes are known as parents and the resulted chromosomes are called offspring. The <b>crossover</b> for parent chromosomes is indicated by [...] P_c probability; {{it means that the}} <b>crossover</b> operation will happen with [...] P_c probability. If the <b>crossover</b> does not happen, the chromosomes results will be mostly like the parents.|$|R
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a {{spin-off}} from the established BBC medical drama Casualty, and premiered on 12 January 1999. It {{is set in the}} same hospital as Casualty, in the fictional city of Holby, and featured occasional <b>crossovers</b> of characters and plots with both Casualty (which featured dedicated episodes broadcast as Casualty@Holby City) and the show's 2007 police procedural spin-off HolbyBlue. Its first executive producers were Young and Johnathan Young, who were succeeded by Kathleen Hutchison from 2002 to 2004, Richard Stokes from 2004 to 2006, McHale from 2006 to 2010, Belinda Campbell from 2010 to 2011, Johnathan Young from 2011 to 2013, and Oliver Kent from 2013. Since the show's initial development, it has become a weekly fixture in the schedule. Holby City airs once a week, all year round, and each series now contains 52 episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{tracks of}} this station {{continue}} {{south of the}} station, down to 25th Street, to allow trains to be stored south of the station during off-peak hours; the tail tracks are seven blocks long, enough to store two 11-car trains each, since the delivery of the R188 train cars was to add 66 more cars to the fleet of the 7 service. There are also two diamond <b>crossovers,</b> one north and one south of the station. The storage tracks at this location were constructed due to the Corona Yard in Queens lacking any space to hold any more trains, and expanding the yard is very difficult due to its location next to the Flushing River. A new storage yard elsewhere would be prohibitively expensive, as it would cost {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars.|$|E

40|$|<b>Crossover</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in GA-based search. There have been many empirical comparisons of different <b>crossover</b> operators in the literature.

5|$|The Baltimore Beltway {{was first}} planned in 1949 by Baltimore County; the state {{eventually}} {{took over the}} project and it {{became part of the}} Interstate Highway System planned in 1956. The length of the route from MD 2 south of Baltimore clockwise to U.S. Route 40 (US40) northeast of the city opened in stages from 1955 to 1962, providing an Interstate bypass of Baltimore. It was the first beltway in the United States to be built as part of the Interstate Highway System. Plans were made to finish the remainder of the route, with a diversion to the Windlass Freeway and the Patapsco Freeway, opened in 1973, following the cancellation of a more outer route that was to partly follow what is today MD702 (Southeast Boulevard). The Outer Harbor Crossing over the Patapsco River, which was dedicated to Francis Scott Key, who wrote The Star-Spangled Banner, and its approaches were finished in 1977, completing the route around Baltimore. The approaches to the bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was originally proposed to run under the river; in subsequent years, they were upgraded to a four-lane configuration compliant with Interstate Highway standards, allowing for this portion of route to be signed as I-695 rather than MD695. There are future plans for I-695 that include high-occupancy toll lanes to ease traffic. In addition, the northeastern interchange with I-95 has been reconstructed to accommodate express toll lanes that were added to I-95 (completed in 2014, but construction is in progress in 2016 to remove I-695's carriageway <b>crossovers</b> here).|$|E
25|$|Passive <b>crossovers</b> are {{commonly}} installed inside speaker boxes and {{are by far}} the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive <b>crossovers</b> may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive <b>crossovers</b> may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24dB per octave. Passive <b>crossovers</b> can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive <b>crossovers,</b> like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, active <b>crossovers</b> may be preferable. Active <b>crossovers</b> may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active <b>crossovers,</b> usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, dynamic range compression and limiting) control.|$|E
