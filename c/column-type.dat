In the case of the <b>column-type</b> splash caused by the acrylic resin, the water flow does not exfoliate and the film flow rising up along the surface of sphere, which is considered to create the <b>column-type</b> splash.

30|$|When the Si wafer {{resistivity}} was varied, etched surfaces exhibited {{different types}} of morphologies, including sponge, mountain and <b>column-type</b> morphologies. The sponge-type structured sample exhibited the largest surface area per unit volume. Silicon nanocrystallites with sizes ranging from 5.3 to 2.0 [*]nm were confirmed in the porous layers.|$|E
30|$|Similarly, in sample 4 with a column-like surface morphology, it {{is evident}} that {{vertical}} etching occurred only after the critical etching depth had been reached, and as a result, most of the nanocrystallites were located {{at the bottom of the}} etched column holes. The PS samples with a <b>column-type</b> surface morphology in this experiment showed a 10 -μm-etched depth with most nanocrystallites present at the lower inside of the pores. Owing to such a geometrical reason, the intensity of PL light generated at the lower part of the holes, i.e., nanocrystalline regions, might be reduced through absorption before exiting the top surface of the PS samples. Consequently, the PL intensity of sample 3 with a mountain-type structure was higher than that of the samples with sponge and <b>column-type</b> structures.|$|E

Next, computed curves are used to model the thermoelastic behavior of a global representative volume element of the braided fabric composite. Finally, the thermoelastic behavior of the support in real working conditions is estimated using results previously obtained. For both unidirectional composite and braided fabric composite, a good agreement is obtained between estimated and measured values at several temperatures...|$|E

30|$|The {{intensity}} of photoluminescence from sample 1 {{was lower than}} those of the samples with ‘mountain’- or <b>column-type</b> surface morphologies. In particular, etching occurred simultaneously along the horizontal and vertical directions on the samples with mountain-type surface morphologies. Nanocrystallites contributing to the photoluminescence were located over the etched surface of sample 3 [30]. In other words, nanocrystallites were spread widely over the etched area and easily contribute to the photoluminescence of sample 2 or 3. In contrast, sample 1 had a wide size distribution, and most were present considerably deep {{from the surface of the}} porous layers. As a result, the PL intensity is relatively lower and spreads into the IR region.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} with the open invited track for the GdR MACS Young PhD researchers. It {{concerns}} applied {{research in the field}} of automotive control, in particular on the control of Electric Power Steering systems (EPS) to reduce the production costs. This study is meant to design a new control strategy with less available outputs (especially without torque sensor) and preserved steering performance. Thus, two approaches could be considered: first, a driver torque estimation coupled to a conventional controller; second, a control strategy not using the driver torque information. Moreover, from the obtained controller design, an analysis of the new system shall be developed in order to draw conclusions on an appropriate mechanical structure. For this purpose, the study is performed on a <b>column-type</b> EPS system for which a model is expressed by Newton's law of motion. This model is validated using experimental data obtained on a prototype vehicle. Then, the control objectives are defined and potential designs of the controller are discussed, with a reminder on driver torque estimation method.

40|$|An {{experimental}} apparatus for three-dimensional sensitivity {{mapping of}} a handheld magnetic probe {{with a permanent}} magnet and a Hall sensor was developed. To optimize the shapes and sizes of the magnets, the sensitivity mappings of two types of magnets, column- and cone-type magnets, were evaluated by the experimental apparatus. The longitudinal sensitivities of column and cone types are 8 and 9 mm, respectively, for 5 μL of magnetic nanoparticles. The measured longitudinal sensitivities agree well with the sensitivities calculated by the finite element method. Furthermore, the maximum lateral resolutions of column and cone types are 4. 1 and 3. 7 mm, respectively. In terms of the directionality, the sensitivities of column and cone types of the angle of 90 ° {{with respect to the}} probe axis fall approximately to 72 % and 50 % at 6 mm distance from the probe head, indicating that the cone type has high directionality due to its sharp shape. The measurement of sensitivity mapping revealed that the characteristics of the cone-type magnet are superior to that of the <b>column-type</b> magnet for the identification of sentinel lymph nodes...|$|E
40|$|Volatile {{compounds}} with fruity {{characteristics were}} produced by Ceratocystis fimbriata {{in two different}} bioreactors: columns (laboratory scale) and horizontal drum (semi-pilot scale). Coffee husk was used as substrate {{for the production of}} volatile compounds by solid-state fermentation. The production of volatile compounds was significantly higher when horizontal drum bioreactor was used than when column bioreactors were used. These results showed that this model of bioreactor presents good perspectives for scale-up and application in an industrial production. Headspace analysis of the solid-state culture detected twelve compounds, among them: ethanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate, and isoamyl acetate. Ethyl acetate was the predominant product in the headspace (28. 55 µmol/L/g of initial dry matter). Activated carbon, Tenax-TA, and Amberlite XAD- 2 were tested to perform the recovery of the compounds. The adsorbent columns were connected to the <b>column-type</b> bioreactor. All compounds present in the headspace of the columns were adsorbed in Amberlite XAD- 2. With Tenax-TA, acetaldehyde was adsorbed in higher concentrations.

40|$|The vortex-induced motion (VIM) is a {{critical}} issue in mooring and riser system design for <b>column-type</b> deepwater platforms. As regards to deep-draft semi-submersibles (DDS), even though VIM is mainly excited by vortex shedding around columns, the large-volume pontoons beneath the columns are also responsible for the wake interference, implying a non-negligible influence on VIM behavior. An experimental study and three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed to analyze the pontoon effect on the VIM of two semi-submersibles and a four-column structure without pontoons. The numerical results using Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) are in good agreement with the experimental measurements obtained from the towing model tests. The present investigations indicate that the resonant phenomenon is observed for all configurations. However, the four-column structure without pontoons shows the most significant transverse responses and yaw motions at both 0 °- and 45 °-incidences owing to the largest fluctuating lift forces induced by the well-established wake. Additionally, the negative values of work done by the pontoons at all reduced velocities confirm their damping effect on the VIM response...|$|E
40|$|ABSfRACf: Worldwide {{there is}} a need for the renewal of {{infrastructure}} because of age, deterioration, misuse, lack of timely repair and maintenance, use of improper materials and/or techniques in the original construction, and even changing needs. Notwithstanding the need for retrofit and repair methods for <b>column-type</b> structural elements, {{there is a}}lso a need for new techniques that would increase the confining action of concrete, as well as enhance the load-carrying capacity and ductility of such structures from a strengthening, rather than a seismic, viewpoint. This study investigates the use of carbon-fiber-reinforced jackets applied to concrete stub columns through the use of tow-sheet-type fabric forms. The primary emphasis is on the investigation of orientation and thickness effects of the composite wraps on the load-carrying efficiency and enhanced ductility of the new struc-tural elements. It was seen that the predominant use of hoop reinforcement provides sig-nificant enhancement in concrete strength through confining action and also offers the potential for fabrication of concrete shell-type elements that would enable reinforcing ac-tion without the use of steel and the attending problems of corrosion.

40|$|The LHC, the new superconducting {{particle}} accelerator presently under construction at CERN, {{makes use of}} some 1200 dipole magnets for orbit bending and 500 quadrupole magnets for focusing/defocusing of the circulating high-energy proton beams. Two or three <b>column-type</b> support posts sustain each cryomagnet. The choice of a convenient material for these supports is critical, because of the required high positioning accuracy of the magnets in their cryostats and stringent thermal budget requirements imposed by the LHC cryogenic system. A glass-fibre/epoxy resin composite has been chosen for its good combination of high stiffness and low thermal conductivity over the 2 - 293 K temperature range. Plies of long glass-fibres are stacked optimally yielding the best mechanical behaviour. However, heat leaks from the supports {{are influenced by the}} thermal characteristics of the composite, which in turn depend on the orientation of the fibres. To study the dependence of the thermal conductivity on fibre's orientation, we performed high precision thermal conductivity measurements of various samples of glass-fibre/epoxy resin composite.

40|$|Entrainment {{can make}} an {{important}} contribution to recovery in the flotation of fine particles. This paper presents an experimental study into the recovery by true flotation and by entrainment, of colloidal silica and alumina particles with a size range from 40 to 160 nm in diameter. The flotation experiments were carried out in a small laboratory <b>column-type</b> cell with fine bubbles with typical average diameter of about 150 mum. No wash water was used. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and Dowfroth 250 were used as the collector and frother, respectively. The particle concentration in the pulp was about 1 % by weight. In these experiments the total recovery of particles was low, typically 54 % after 50 min. Four techniques, including three previously described in the literature and one newly developed in this study, were used to assess the true flotation due to the bubble-particle collection mechanism, and the entrainment. All employed techniques show that the proportion of the colloidal particles recovered by true flotation was quite high, varying from about 79 - 86 % of the total recovery. The paper also discusses the mechanisms of minimising the entrainment of the colloidal particles in the laminar flow flotation regime with fine bubbles. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|D-lactate is {{a natural}} {{component}} of many fermented foods like yogurts, sour milk, cheeses, and pickles vegetable products. D-lactate in high concentrations is toxic for children and people with short bowel syndrome and provokes encephalopathy. These facts convincingly demonstrate a need for effective tools for the D-lactate removal from some food products. The main idea of investigation is focused on application of recombinant thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha “tr 6,” overproducing D-lactate: cytochrome c oxidoreductase (EC 1. 1. 2. 4, D-lactate cytochrome c oxidoreductase, D-lactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome), DLDH). In addition to 6 -fold overexpression of DLDH under a strong constitutive promoter (prAOX), the strain of H. polymorpha “tr 6 ” (gcr 1 catX/Δcyb 2, prAOX_DLDH) is characterized by impairment in glucose repression of AOX promoter, devoid of catalase and L-lactate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activities. Overexpression of DLDH coupling with the deletion of L-lactate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity opens possibility for usage of the strain {{as a base for}} construction of bioreactor for removing D-lactate from fermented products due to oxidation to nontoxic pyruvate.

40|$|The anammox process, as an {{alternative}} to conventional nitrogen removal technologies, has abstracted much attention in recent years. In this study, two <b>column-type</b> reactors using different support materials—net type acrylic fiber (Biofix) and polyester nonwoven—were used for anammox treatment. The nonwoven reactor was operated at 35 ℃ and the Biofix reactor at 25 ℃ (peak summer temperature, 31. 5 ℃). Over 330 days of operation, the nitrogen loading rates of the Biofix and nonwoven reactors were increased to 3. 6 kg-N/㎥/d and 4. 0 kg-N/㎥d and T-N removal efficiencies reached to 81. 3 % and 86. 3 %, respectively. A protein substance was shown to be the most abundant extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the anammox sludge with almost three times more in the granular sludge of the Biofix reactor than in the granular sludge of the nonwoven reactor. Considering the EPS levels and observation by scanning electron microscopy, the anammox granules in the Biofix reactor were denser than that in the nonwoven reactor. Results of DNA analyses indicated that the KSU- 1 strain might prefer relatively low nutrient levels, while the KU 2 strain might be better suited for the high media concentration. Other kinds of bacteria were also identified with the potentials for consuming the dissolved oxygen in the influent and facilitating anammox bacteria surviving under aerobic conditions...|$|E
