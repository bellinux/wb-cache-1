40|$|Classical {{mathematics}} {{is a form}} of mathematics that has a large range of application; however, its application has boundaries. In this paper, I show that Sperber and Wilson’s concept of relevance can demarcate classical mathematics’ range of applicability by demarcating <b>classical</b> <b>logic’s</b> range of applicability. Furthermore, I introduce how to systematize Sperber and Wilson’s concept of relevance into a quasi-classical logic that can explain <b>classical</b> <b>logic’s</b> and <b>classical</b> mathematics’ range of applicability...|$|R
40|$|Russell O'Connor {{presents}} an alternative method of {{bridging the gap}} between constructive and <b>classical</b> <b>logics</b> to facilitate integrated reasoning in particular for interactive theorem provers. Instead of adding classical axioms (like {{the principle of the}} excluded middle x∨¬x) to a constructive logic, the author proposes the opposite. He interprets constructive logics as an extension to <b>classical</b> <b>logics</b> by adding two new logical connectives + and Σ for constructive disjunction and constructive existential quantification...|$|R

25|$|If-then {{arguments}} posit logical sequences {{that sometimes}} include objects of the mind. For example, a counterfactual argument proposes a hypothetical or subjunctive possibility which could or would be true, but {{might not be}} false. Conditional sequences involving subjunctives use intensional language, which is studied by modal logic, whereas <b>classical</b> <b>logic</b> studies the extensional language of necessary and sufficient conditions.|$|E
25|$|This axiom schema was tacitly used in {{the early}} days of naive set theory, before a strict axiomatization was adopted. Unfortunately, it leads {{directly}} to Russell's paradox by taking φ(x) to be ¬(x∈x) (i.e., the property that set x is not a member of itself). Therefore, no useful axiomatization of set theory can use unrestricted comprehension, at least not with <b>classical</b> <b>logic.</b>|$|E
40|$|Symmetry {{had been}} well studied in <b>classical</b> <b>logics</b> and {{constraint}} programming. Krishnamurthy showed that some tricky formulas admit short proofs when augmenting the propositional logic resolution proof system by the symmetry rule. But In Artificial Intelligence, we usually manipulate incomplete information {{and need to}} include uncertainty to reason on knowledge with exceptions and non-monotonicity. Several non classic logics are introduced for that purpose. Here, we are interested to extend the notion of symmetry to that non <b>classical</b> <b>logics</b> such as preferential logics and X-logics...|$|R
50|$|The set of theorems of a deviant logic can {{differ in}} any {{possible}} way from <b>classical</b> <b>logic's</b> set of theorems: as a proper subset, superset, or fully exclusive set. A notable {{example of this}} is the trivalent logic developed by Polish logician and mathematician Jan Łukasiewicz. Under this system, any theorem necessarily dependent on <b>classical</b> <b>logic's</b> principle of bivalence would fail to be valid.

25|$|Like many folk theories, our folk {{theory of}} truth {{is useful in}} {{everyday}} life but, upon deep analysis, {{turns out to be}} technically self-contradictory; in particular, any formal system that fully obeys Capture and Release semantics for truth (also known as the T-schema), and that also respects <b>classical</b> <b>logic,</b> is provably inconsistent and succumbs to the liar paradox or to a similar contradiction.|$|E
25|$|He {{also showed}} that neither the axiom of choice nor the {{continuum}} hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory, assuming these axioms are consistent. The former result {{opened the door for}} mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between <b>classical</b> <b>logic,</b> intuitionistic logic, and modal logic.|$|E
25|$|The {{title of}} the episode refers to the {{principle}} or law of noncontradiction, {{also known as the}} principle or law of contradiction: it is the second of three laws of thought in <b>classical</b> <b>logic</b> known as the three classic laws of thought. It states that contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time, and that therefore something cannot be both true and false, or be and not be.|$|E
40|$|AbstractClassical {{mathematical}} logic includes {{a lot of}} “implicational paradoxes” as its logic theorems. This paper uses the property of strong relevance as the criterion to identify implicational paradoxes in logical theorems of <b>classical</b> mathematical <b>logic,</b> and enumerates logical theorem schemata of <b>classical</b> mathematical <b>logic</b> that do not satisfy the strong relevance. This quantitative analysis shows that <b>classical</b> mathematical <b>logic</b> is by far not a suitable logical basis for automated forward deduction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe offer a view on how {{probability}} {{is related}} to logic. Specifically, we argue against the widely held belief that standard <b>classical</b> <b>logics</b> have no direct way of modelling the certainty of assumptions in theories and no direct way of stating the certainty of theorems proved from these (uncertain) assumptions. The argument rests on the observation that probability densities, being functions, can be represented and reasoned with naturally and directly in (<b>classical)</b> higher-order <b>logic...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{extension}} to <b>classical</b> separation <b>logic</b> which allows reasoning about virtual memory.

25|$|Logic is {{the study}} of the {{principles}} of valid reasoning and inference, as well as of consistency, soundness, and completeness. For example, in most systems of logic (but not in intuitionistic logic) Peirce's law (((P→Q)→P)→P) is a theorem. For <b>classical</b> <b>logic,</b> it can be easily verified with a truth table. The study of mathematical proof is particularly important in logic, and has applications to automated theorem proving and formal verification of software.|$|E
25|$|In <b>classical</b> <b>logic</b> Aristotle's three laws, namely, the {{excluded}} middle (p or ¬p), non-contradiction ¬ (p ∧ ¬p) and identity (p iff p), {{are regarded as}} the same, due to the inter-definition of the connectives. Moreover, traditionally contradictoriness (the presence of contradictions in a theory or in a body of knowledge) and triviality (the fact that such a theory entails all possible consequences) are assumed inseparable, granted that negation is available. These views may be philosophically challenged, precisely {{on the grounds that}} they fail to distinguish between contradictoriness and other forms of inconsistency.|$|E
25|$|T-norms are a {{generalization}} {{of the usual}} two-valued logical conjunction, studied by <b>classical</b> <b>logic,</b> for fuzzy logics. Indeed, the classical Boolean conjunction is both commutative and associative. The monotonicity property ensures {{that the degree of}} truth of conjunction does not decrease if the truth values of conjuncts increase. The requirement that 1 be an identity element corresponds to the interpretation of 1 as true (and consequently 0 as false). Continuity, which is often required from fuzzy conjunction as well, expresses the idea that, roughly speaking, very small changes in truth values of conjuncts should not macroscopically affect the truth value of their conjunction.|$|E
40|$|AbstractInteraction nets are graph {{rewriting}} systems {{which are}} a generalisation of proof nets for <b>classical</b> linear <b>logic.</b> The linear chemical abstract machine (CHAM) is a term rewriting system which corresponds to <b>classical</b> linear <b>logic,</b> via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. We can obtain a textual calculus for interaction nets which is surprisingly similar to linear CHAM based on the multiplicative fragment of <b>classical</b> linear <b>logic.</b> In this paper we introduce a framework based on the linear CHAM to model interaction net reduction.

25|$|Gentzen {{asserted}} a sharp {{distinction between}} his single-output natural deduction systems (NK and NJ) and his multiple-output sequent calculus systems (LK and LJ). He {{wrote that the}} intuitionistic natural deduction system NJ was somewhat ugly. He said that the special role of the excluded middle in the classical natural deduction system NK is removed in the classical sequent calculus system LK. He said that the sequent calculus LJ gave more symmetry than natural deduction NJ {{in the case of}} intuitionistic logic, as also in the case of <b>classical</b> <b>logic</b> (LK versus NK). Then he said that in addition to these reasons, the sequent calculus with multiple succedent formulas is intended particularly for his principal theorem ("Hauptsatz").|$|E
25|$|The ignorance fallacy is {{sometimes}} confused (or combined) with logically valid contrapositive arguments. Contrapositive arguments rightly utilize the transposition rule of inference in <b>classical</b> <b>logic</b> to conclude something like: To {{the extent that}} C implies E then Not-E must also imply Not-C. In other words, if a cause always leads to an effect, then absence of the expected effect is evidence of absence of the cause. For example, if the causal proposition that If it's raining outside then the streets will be wet is assumed, then it can be assumed that if the streets are not wet then it is not raining outside. The inference that it cannot be raining outside because the streets are not getting wet is exactly as true, or perhaps exactly as untrue, as the original proposition. The statements are logically equivalent.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} many logics for artificial intelligence {{is that they}} are nonmonotonic. This means that adding a formula to the premises can destroy some of the consequences. There may exist formulae that can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the consequences: they respect monotonicity. We consider three preferential logics for which we analyze the class of formulae which respect monotonicity. For each of the three logics we show that this class is equal to the class of formulae preserved under going to more preferred models, and we provide syntactic characterizations of these classes. Keywords: nonmonotonic reasoning, monotonicity, preferential logics 1 Introduction Over the past decades, many non-classical logics for Artificial Intelligence have been defined and investigated. The need for such logics arose from the unsuitability of <b>classical</b> <b>logics</b> to describe defeasible reasoning. These <b>classical</b> <b>logics</b> are monotonic, which [...] ...|$|R
500|$|In {{a famous}} paper of 1936 with Garrett Birkhoff, the first work ever to {{introduce}} quantum logics, von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a propositional calculus substantially {{different from all}} classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics. The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, {{the need for the}} new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (e.g., one horizontally and the other vertically), and therefore, a fortiori, it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added in between the other two, the photons will, indeed, pass through. This experimental fact is translatable into logic as the non-commutativity of conjunction [...] It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of <b>classical</b> <b>logic,</b> [...] and , are not valid for quantum theory.|$|E

2500|$|Paraconsistent logics are propositionally {{weaker than}} {{classical}} logic; that is, they deem fewer propositional inferences valid.

In some sense, then, paraconsistent logic is more conservative or cautious than <b>classical</b> <b>logic.</b> It is due to such conservativeness that paraconsistent languages can be more expressive than their classical counterparts including the hierarchy of metalanguages due to Alfred Tarski et al.
