5|$|The {{calls of}} the two species are not similar. The <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greater melampitta is a double or triple note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and {{is reminiscent of the}} black pitohui. The <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy notes or chirped whistles, both of which are repeated at intervals.|$|E

5|$|The basic <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{chestnut}} sparrow is a subdued chirp, {{with two}} recorded variations: a scolding threat call, rendered chrrrrit or chrrrrreeeerrrrrrrr and a chew chew flight call. Displaying males give a high twittering trill, rendered as tchiweeza tchiweeza tchi-tchi-tchi-tchi- see-see-see-seeichi.|$|E
5|$|The <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E
5|$|The <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great spotted {{woodpecker}} is a sharp kik, {{which may}} be repeated as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. The {{great spotted woodpecker}} drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. The {{question}} as to <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church is not a practical but a theological issue. The church can easily keep itself busy with activities that seem important. However, are these activities really the motivation behind God’s call to the church? This article investigates <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church as perceived from various relationships: church and world, church and culture and church and church. Church and world addresses the age-old argument {{that the church is}} in the world but not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. The church does have an obligation in the world towards politics and ecology. Another factor addressed in the article {{is the way in which}} the church copes with the secularised society. Regarding culture, the premise is that the church has no obligation towards culture. Culture merely becomes a means to an end for the church. The church wants to exist in a ‘free culture’, as Barth suggests. When discussing <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, an ecclesiology of some sorts is in fact presented. This is reflected in the paragraph on church and church. The church is always seen in relationship with God’s intention with the community He assembles. This might be <b>the</b> true <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church: to be a community that calls others to community...|$|R

5|$|The main <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American white ibis is a honking sound, {{transcribed}} as urnk, urnk, or hunk, hunk. The call {{is used in}} flight, courtship or when disturbed. Birds also utter a muted huu-huu-huu call while foraging, {{and make}} a squealing call in courtship. Young in the nest give a high-pitched zziu as a begging call.|$|E
5|$|The pale crag martin's {{flight is}} slow, with rapid wing beats {{interspersed}} with flat-winged glides, {{and it is}} more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian crag martin. It is a quiet bird; the song is a muffled twitter, and other calls include a trrt resembling the <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common house martin, a nasal vick, and a high pitched twee contact call.|$|E

5|$|The usual <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nelicourvi weaver is a high-pitched, very {{distinct}} chizz-chizz-chizz, {{which is}} more metallical and rasping when the birds are in feeding groups. Other calls that can be heard when the birds are at the nest include tsrrreee, tiang-tiang, and chet. The song, which is produced while being at the nest sounds like chiz-chizz-chswriissssiszz.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E
5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E

The little {{bee-eater}} and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> honeyguide sounds like two bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.|$|E

The natterjack was last recorded on the headland in the 1950s before its extinction, probably {{as the result}} of a lack of suitable ponds. The project has been a great success, and today there are thriving populations at various locations.

5|$|The black currawong is {{commonly}} {{confused with the}} clinking currawong, but the latter species has a white rump and larger white wing patches. The black currawong has a heavier bill and a characteristic call unlike the clink-clink <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinking. The forest and little ravens are similar in size but lack the white wing patches, and instead have entirely black plumage and white, rather than yellow eyes. The black currawong {{is unlikely to be}} mistaken for the closely related pied currawong as the latter does not reach Tasmania, but it has a longer and deeper bill and lacks the white rump and undertail coverts.|$|E

The play is also credited with keeping a Major League Baseball team in the city of Seattle, as it helped garner support for a new taxpayer-funded stadium for the Mariners.
