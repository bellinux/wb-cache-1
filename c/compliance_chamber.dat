During diastole, however, regurgitant coronary flow to the left ventricle decreases {{the efficacy of the}} left ventricle–coronary artery shunt. We investigated whether augmented coronary compliance would improve net forward shunt flow. MethodsIn 11 anesthetized pigs a specially designed stent was placed through the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Through an arterial graft, it was connected to the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. A blind stump of the right internal thoracic artery (15 cm) was anastomosed to the distal left anterior descending coronary artery to serve as added coronary <b>compliance</b> <b>chamber.</b> Blood flow was measured in the coronary artery just distal from the left ventricle–coronary artery shunt, {{as well as in the}} shunt and in the <b>compliance</b> <b>chamber</b> entrance-exit. ResultsThe left ventricle–coronary artery shunt decreased the net forward midcoronary flow to 53 % ± 18 % (mean ± SD) of native flow (8 ± 4 vs 16 ± 5 mL/min at baseline, P <. 01). The augmented compliance did not significantly increase net forward coronary flow (61 % ± 25 % of native flow, P <. 01 vs baseline and P =. 21 vs left ventricle–coronary artery shunt with normal compliance). The increase in systolic forward flow (53 ± 23 vs 37 ± 19 mL/min with normal compliance) was accompanied by a similar increase in diastolic regurgitant flow (− 26 ± 20 vs − 16 ± 16 mL/min).

Although this could be alleviated by heart transplantation, there is a chronic shortage of donor hearts and so mechanical solutions are being considered. Currently, many Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) are being developed worldwide in an effort to increase life expectancy and quality of life for end stage heart failure patients. Current pre-clinical testing methods for VADs involve laboratory testing using Mock Circulation Loops (MCLs), and in vivo testing in animal models. The research and development of highly accurate MCLs is vital to the continuous improvement of VAD performance. The first objective {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a mathematical model of a MCL. This model could then be used in the design and construction of a variable <b>compliance</b> <b>chamber</b> to improve the performance of an existing MCL as well as form the basis for a new miniaturised MCL. An extensive review of literature was carried out on MCLs and mathematical modelling of their function. A mathematical model of a MCL was then created in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. This model included variable features such as resistance, fluid inertia and volumes (resulting from the pipe lengths and diameters); compliance of Windkessel chambers, atria and ventricles; density of both fluid and compressed air applied to the system; gravitational effects on vertical columns of fluid; and accurately modelled actuators controlling the ventricle contraction. This model was then validated using the physical properties and pressure and flow traces produced from a previously developed MCL. A variable <b>compliance</b> <b>chamber</b> was designed to reproduce parameters determined by the mathematical model. The function of the variability was achieved by controlling the transmural pressure across a diaphragm to alter the compliance of the system. An initial prototype was tested in a previously developed MCL, and a variable level of arterial compliance was successfully produced; however, the complete range of compliance values required for accurate physiological representation was not able to be produced with this initial design. The mathematical model was then used to design a smaller physical mock circulation loop, with the tubing sizes adjusted to produce accurate pressure and flow traces whilst having an appropriate frequency response characteristic. The development of the mathematical model greatly assisted the general design of an in vitro cardiovascular device test rig, while the variable <b>compliance</b> <b>chamber</b> allowed simple and real-time manipulation of MCL compliance to allow accurate transition between a variety of physiological conditions. The newly developed MCL produced an accurate design of a mechanical representation of the human circulatory system for in vitro cardiovascular device testing and education purposes. The continued improvement of VAD test rigs is essential if VAD design is to improve, and hence improve quality of life and life expectancy for heart failure patients...|$|E

The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between AC and IABC performance.

The model consisted of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a <b>compliance</b> <b>chamber,</b> a peripheral resistor and two open reservoirs. Two Datascope Driving systems were used to operate the LVAD and intra-aortic balloon. We studied the effect of arterial compliance on the effectiveness of IABC at different levels of mean pressure (55, 75 and 95 mmHg) and heart rates (80, 100, 120 bpm). Three indices were used to evaluate IABC performance: the reduction of systolic and end-diastolic ""arterial"" pressure and the augmentation of diastolic pressure, induced by the IABC. A 22 % decrease in AC (1. 8 - 1. 4 ml/mmHg) lead to a 30 - 40 % increase in the indices of IABC performance, independently from pressure. In conclusion, arterial compliance significantly affects IABC efficacy and it could be considered as a further clinical criterion to decide IABC application. © 2002 IPEM.

The severity of aortic regurgitation was assessed by color flow mapping; 17 patients had grade 2, 10 had grade 3 and 5 had grade 4 aortic regurgitation. Regression equations for pressure half-time area versus planimetry mitral valve area were calculated separately for the aortic regurgitation (r = 0. 88) and the nonaortic regurgitation group (r = 0. 86); analysis of covariance revealed a significant (p < 0. 001) {{difference between the two}} groups leading to overestimation of planimetry area by the pressure half-time method in the aortic regurgitation group. The mitral valve areas in the group without regurgitation were best calculated with the expression 239 /T 1 / 2 (r = 0. 77) as compared with a best fit of 195 /T 1 / 2 (r = 0. 85) for the aortic regurgitation group. To elucidate the mechanisms affecting pressure half-time in aortic regurgitation, an in vitro model of mitral inflow in the presence of varying regurgitant volumes and different ventricular <b>chamber</b> <b>compliances</b> was used. Aortic regurgitation shortened directly measured pressure half-time proportional to the regurgitant fraction but an increase in left ventricular compliance could offset this effect. Finally, in a mathematic model of mitral inflow the competing effects of aortic regurgitation and <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> could be confirmed. In conclusion, aortic regurgitation results clinically in a significant net shortening of pressure half-time leading to mitral valve area overestimation. However, the effect is moderate and individually unpredictable because of changes in <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance...</b>|$|R
40|$|The `biomimetic` {{approach}} to tissue engineering usually {{involves the use}} of a bioreactor mimicking physiological parameters whilst supplying nutrients to the developing tissue. Here we present a new heart valve bioreactor, having as its centrepiece a ventricular assist device (VAD), which exposes the cell-scaffold constructs to a wider array of mechanical forces. The pump of the VAD has two chambers: a blood and a pneumatic chamber, separated by an elastic membrane. Pulsatile air-pressure is generated by a piston-type actuator and delivered to the pneumatic chamber, ejecting the fluid in the blood chamber. Subsequently, applied vacuum to the pneumatic chamber causes the blood chamber to fill. A mechanical heart valve was placed in the VAD`s inflow position. The tissue engineered (TE) valve was placed in the outflow position. The VAD was coupled in series with a Windkessel <b>compliance</b> <b>chamber,</b> variable throttle and reservoir, connected by silicone tubings. The reservoir sat on an elevated platform, allowing adjustment of ventricular preload between 0 and 11 mmHg. To allow for sterile gaseous exchange between the circuit interior and exterior, a 0. 2 mu m filter was placed at the reservoir. Pressure and flow were registered downstream of the TE valve. The circuit was filled with culture medium and fitted in a standard 5 % CO(2) incubator set at 37 degrees C. Pressure and flow waveforms were similar to those obtained under physiological conditions for the pulmonary circulation. The `cardiomimetic` approach presented here represents a new perspective to conventional biomimetic approaches in TE, with potential advantages. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis investigated {{the role of the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the regulation of normal mechanical function of the isolated heart, with the focus of the work resting on the calcium release channel, the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and the SR calcium pump, the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). This was performed by characterising left ventricular mechanical function in an isolated working heart model in the face of pharmacological manipulation of the above intracellular SR proteins. The following were the aims of this project. 1. Characterisation of ex vivo working heart left ventricular mechanical function using miniaturised single and multi-segment pressure-conductance technology 2. Characterisation of working heart mechanical function under conditions where SR calcium cycling is altered; i) perfusion with elevated extracellular calcium and beta-adrenergic stimulation to induce SR calcium loading and ii) in a rabbit coronary artery ligation model of left ventricular dysfunction. Following this, the influence of acute perfusion of the compound K 201 in healthy hearts and in the above experimental conditions was investigated. 3. Investigation of the specific contribution of SR calcium uptake to normal left ventricular contractility and relaxation by specific pharmacological blockade of SERCA in the isolated working heart. Hearts from male New Zealand White rabbits were cannulated via the aorta and a pulmonary vein ostium and perfused in working heart mode. Contractile function and changes in left ventricular volume during the cardiac cycle were assessed using a 3 F pressure-conductance catheter inserted into the left ventricle via the aorta. The isolated working heart was found to produce a maximal stroke volume under identical loading conditions and pacing frequency using a volume of air within the <b>compliance</b> <b>chamber</b> of 15 ml of air. Using an atrial filling pressure of 7. 4 mmHg and an afterload of 60 mmHg the preparation was also found to have stable function in working mode for 60 - 90 min with < 10 % decline in cardiac output. To assess the effect of the compound K 201 on cardiac mechanical function isolated working hearts were perfused with increasing concentrations of K 201 (0. 3, 1. 0 and 3. 0) for 4 min at each concentration. When normalised to control hearts paced at equivalent rates 0. 3 microM K 201 led to a significant increase in end diastolic pressure (EDP) but did not alter other indices of mechanical function. 1. 0 and 3. 0 microM K 201 led to a significant decline in a number of indices of cardiac contractility and relaxation. At 3. 0 microM depression of mechanical function was of a sufficient extent as to cause cessation of forward flow (aortic flow) in 3 of the 8 hearts studied. In a subset of experiments where heart rate was kept constant via electrical stimulation of the right atrium, exposure to 1. 0 microM K 201 led to a decline in mechanical function that was of a similar degree to that of unpaced hearts. High calcium loading conditions were simulated by raising extracellular calcium concentrations from 2. 5 mM to 4. 5 mM, followed after 5 min by addition of 150 nM isoproterenol (ISO). Addition of ISO led to a transient improvement in all indices of mechanical function lasting approximately 20 s. In hearts perfused with 4. 5 mM extracellular calcium and ISO only (n= 11) mechanical function declined thereafter such that by 600 s post-ISO addition aortic flow had ceased in all but 5 of the 11 hearts in this group. In contrast, hearts perfused with K 201 30 s after addition of ISO (n= 9) all maintained aortic flow and demonstrated significantly improved contractile function post-ISO in comparison to hearts not perfused with K 201. K 201 also led to a preservation of left ventricular peak pressure and stroke volume when applied 300 s post-ISO. Despite being detrimental to mechanical function in healthy hearts K 201 preserved function in a pharmacological model of high calcium loading. Left ventricular dysfunction was surgically induced in rabbits by coronary artery ligation. Ex vivo mechanical function was assessed 8 weeks post-op using a 3 segment multi-segmental pressure-conductance catheter inserted into the left ventricle with each segment delineating 3 discrete functional regions within the ventricular chamber; apex, mid and base. Hearts were paced at 200 beats/min throughout. 8 week ligation hearts exhibited a significantly reduced ejection fraction and higher end systolic volumes in comparison to sham operated controls. Assessment of regional mechanical function in 8 week ligation hearts revealed that a significantly greater proportion of total stroke volume and stroke work was performed by the mid segment vs. the apex, while regional function was similar between all segments in the sham operated controls. Treatment with 1. 0 microM K 201 led to a decline in systolic function and impairment of relaxation (decreased dP/dtmin and increased tau) in sham operated control hearts similar to that shown in chapter 3. In contrast, aside from dP/dtmax which was significantly reduced from baseline, K 201 had no significant effect on mechanical function in 8 week ligation hearts. No region specific effects of K 201 were detected, as the percentage contribution of each region to total stroke volume and stroke work remained unchanged in both groups after treatment with K 201. The effects of K 201 on mechanical function in hearts with left ventricular dysfunction appear to be altered in comparison to both healthy and sham operated hearts. SR calcium uptake was inhibited in an isolated working rabbit heart model using the specific pharmacological SERCA 2 a inhibitor thapsigargin (TG). Hearts were paced at 220 beats/min throughout the investigation. The experimental endpoint for TG treated hearts was reached when hearts no longer produced an aortic flow. Hearts perfused in working heart mode with the thapsigargin vehicle for 60 min acted as controls. At the end of each experiment left ventricular tissue samples were homogenised in a protease-phosphatase inhibitor cocktail and stored for subsequent analysis. A significant decline in systolic and diastolic functional parameters was evident 5 min after addition of TG, with no significant changes demonstrable in the vehicle control group at this timepoint. In TG treated hearts function had declined even further by the endpoint. In a subset of TG treated hearts end systolic and end diastolic volumes were shown to decline over time, indicative of imparied left ventricular filling and diastolic abnormalities. Analysis of SERCA uptake by Elliott et al. (2009) using tissue homogenates from the current investigation revealed {{that at the time of}} aortic flow cessation SERCA activity was < 10 %, suggesting that SR calcium uptake may decrease to very low levels before working heart function fails...|$|E

Methods and Results. We measured pulmonary capillary wedge (PCW) pressure (Swan-Ganz catheter), LVEDV (two-dimensional echocardiography), and cardiac output (C 2 H 2 rebreathing) during lower body negative pressure (LBNP,- 15 and- 30 mm Hg) and rapid saline infusion (15 and 30 ml/kg) in seven athletes and six controls (Vo 2 max, 68 ± 7 and 41 ± 4 ml/kg/min). Orthostatic tolerance was determined by progressive LBNP to presyncope. Athletes had steeper slopes of their SV/PCW pressure curves than nonathletes (5. 5 + 2. 7 versus 2. 7 + 1. 5 mI/mm Hg, p< 0. 05). The slope of the steep, linear portion of this curve correlated significantly with the duration ofLBNP tolerance (r= 0. 58, p= 0. 04). The athletes also had reduced chamber stiffness (increased <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance)</b> expressed as the slope (k) of the dP/dV versus P relation (chamber stiffness, k= 0. 008 ± 0. 004 versus 0. 031 ± 0. 004, p< 0. 005; <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance,</b> l/k= 449. 8 + 283. 8 versus 35. 3 +± 4. 3).

Our {{objective}} was to compare the Doppler pressure half-time, Doppler continuity equation and two-dimensional echocardiographic planimetric methods of estimating mitral valve area in Lutembacher syndrome. Background. Fluid dynamics theory predicts that mitral pressure half-time varies inversely with mitral valve area and directly with net <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> and the peak early diastolic transmitral gradient in pure mitral stenosis. The effects of an atrial shunt on these interrelations have not been investigated. Methods. Correlation and agreement between mitral valve area estimates obtained by the three methods and that obtained by cardiac catheterization was ascertained in 11 patients with Lutembacher syndrome. Results. Valve areas determined by planimetry and the continuity equation method correlated and agreed well with catheterization measurements (r = 0. 83 and 0. 81, respectively). The pressure half-time method consistently overestimation mitral valve area; the extent of overestimate was greater in patients with larger atrial shunts. The hemodynamic pressure half-time was independent of the mitral valve area, <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> and the peak transmitral gradient. It was dependent on {{the magnitude of the}} atrial shunt, although the correlation obtained was only fair (r = 0. 61). Conclusions. These findings suggest that the Doppler pressure half-time method is an inaccurate measure of mitral valve area whenever an atrial shunt coexists with mitral stenosis.

An aliasing correction algorithm was used to extend the upper limit of measurable velocity to 184 cm/s. Images were analyzed for jet area (equal to {{the total number of}} image pixels) and jet energy (equal to the sum of all pixel velocities squared), both integrated over all frames of the injection and in single maximal frames. The Doppler flow mapping area and energy measurements were compared with known flow volume and delivered kinetic energy, and the effects of four experimental variables (orifice area, gain setting, <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> and <b>chamber</b> size) were evaluated. Jet area correlated nonlinearly with flow volume and was markedly affected by each of these experimental variables, increasing by 40 to 150 % from the smallest to the largest orifice size, 15 to 94 % with the highest versus the lowest gain setting, 1 to 54 % with greater <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> and 7 to 70 % in the large versus the small chamber. In contrast, jet energy correlated linearly with delivered kinetic energy up to 350, 000 ergs, at which point velocities started to exceed the extended velocity range and second wrap aliasing occurred. The relation was not affected by orifice area, gain or compliance, and was only minimally affected by chamber size. The relations between jet area and injection volume were best described by second degree polynomial equations, and coefficients of determination (R 2) were highest when examining each individual experimental setting separately (R 2 = 0. 91 to 0. 99) rather than when grouping data for all settings of each of the four variables (R 2 = 0. 53 to 0. 91). The relation between jet energy and delivered kinetic energy was best described by linear regression, and examining each individual setting separately (R 2 = 0. 89 to 0. 99) did not improve the fit of the data over grouping data {{for each of the four}} variables (R 2 = 0. 92 to 0. 98). Doppler color flow mapping area measurements have limited ability to predict flow volume because the relation between the two is curvilinear and affected by a number of variables. In contrast, Doppler flow mapping energy measurements in an in vitro setting appear to be linearly related to delivered kinetic energy, are not affected by these variables and may therefore allow Doppler flow mapping quantification of kinetic energy transfer by fluid jets...|$|R

40|$|Influences of {{pericardium}} and actue myocardial ischemia on pulmonary venous flow (PVF) {{dynamics and}} left atrial (LA) function were studied in 13 anestietized open-shest dogs. PVF velcity {{was measured by}} Dopperl flow probe instataneously with LA diameter, left ventricular (LV) segment lengths in control and ischemic regions using ultrasonic dimension gauges. LA and LV pressures were also measured simultaeously with PVF velocity using Miller's micromanometers. Recordings were made at control state and during actue myocardial ischmia produced by occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, with or without pericardium. When the pericardium was opened, the peak velocity of PVF deuring LA contraction (A wave) was increased (28. 9 → 42. 2 cm/sec, p＜ 0. 01) in proportion as LV <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> increaed. Moreover, opening the pericardium, the velocity-time integral of PVF in the systolic phases(S wave) was invreased (12. 6 → 14. 2 cm, p＜ 0. 05), associated with the sift of LA pressure-volume relation to the right. These findings suggested that LV compliance was one of important determinants of the A wave, and {{that the increase in}} the S wace (increase in the reservoir function of LA) by opening the pericardium might be attributed to the increase in LA <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance.</b> After actue myocardial ischemia, PVF I the diastolic phase (D wave) was decreased (12. 3 → 9. 8 cm, p＜ 0. 01), whereas S wace remained unchanged owing to the aufmentation of LA pump function under the myocardial ischemia. In addition, the D wave was significantly correlated with the time constant of LV pressure decline during the isocolumetric relaxation period (r＝- 0. 535, p＜ 0. 01). These results indicate that LV and LA compliances altered by the existence of pericardium play an important role for determining A and S wave on PVF, and also LV diastolic property might be an important determinant of D wave on PVF...|$|R
40|$|The {{heart and}} microvasculature have {{characteristics}} of a complex adaptive system. Extreme challenges faced by these organ systems cause structural changes which lead to global adaptation. To {{assess the impact of}} myocardial interstitial edema on the mechanical properties of the left ventricle and the myocardial interstitium, we induced acute and chronic interstitial edema in dogs. With chronic edema, the primary form of collagen changed from type I to III and left ventricular <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> significantly increased. The resulting functional adaptation allows the chronically edematous heart to maintain left ventricular <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> when challenged with acute edema, thus, preserving cardiac function over a wide range of interstitial fluid pressures. To asses the effect of microvascular occlusions, we reintroduced the Pallid bat wing model and developed a novel mathematical model. We hypothesized that microvessels can switch from predominantly pressure-mediated to shear-mediated responses to ensure dilation during occlusions. Arterioles of unanesthetized Pallid bats were temporarily occluded upstream (n= 8) and parallel (n= 4) to vessels of interest (20 - 65 mm). In both cases, the vessels of interest rapidly dilated (36 + 24 %, 37 + 33 %), illustrating that they responded appropriately to either decreased pressure or increased shear stress. The model not only reproduced this switching behavior, but reveals its origin as the nonlinear shear-pressure-radius relationship. The properties of the heart and microvasculature were extended to characterize a ?Research-Intensive Community? (RIC) model, to provide a feasible solution consistent with the Boyer Commission, to create a sustainable physiology research program. We developed and implemented the model with the aim of aligning diverse goals of participants while simultaneously optimizing research productivity. While the model radically increases the number of undergraduate students supported by a single faculty member, the inherent resilience and scalability of this complex adaptive system enables it to expand without formal institutionalization...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Volume loading is {{commonly}} used to adjust preload and optimise cardiac output. It is difficult to monitor preload at the bedside because filling affects ventricular diastolic function and consequently end diastolic pressure, which is the variable used to monitor preload. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of gradual volume loading on the different components of left ventricular diastolic function [...] -filling velocities, relaxation, and <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> [...] -to identify how excessive loading produces diastolic dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight mongrel dogs, anaesthetised and mechanically ventilated with both the chest and the pericardium closed, were studied during basal conditions (B), during gradual volume loading with physiological saline [...] - 5 ml/kg (VL 5), 10 ml/kg (VL 10), and 15 ml/kg (VL 15) [...] -and during infusion of isosorbide dinitrate (10 g/kg/min) started after the VL 15 load was achieved. Dogs were monitored haemodynamically and by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to assess peak modal velocities of the E and A waves, E/A ratios, and the deceleration time of the E wave. M mode recordings of aligned mitral and aortic valve motion were also obtained to calculate the isovolumic relaxation time. Effects of volume loading on ventricular diastolic function seemed to occur in two phases. Small and moderate volume loads (VL 5 and VL 10) promoted early ventricular filling, increasing E wave velocities, improving the mean (SD) E/A ratio from 1. 95 (0. 3) (B) to 2. 0 (0. 27) (VL 5) and 2. 6 (0. 3) (VL 10) (P < 0. 00005), prolonging the E wave deceleration time, and only slightly increasing ventricular diastolic pressures. These changes suggest an improvement in ventricular compliance. Extreme volume loads (VL 15) produced an abrupt reduction in early ventricular filling, which was transfered to late in diastole, by decreasing E wave velocity, by increasing A wave velocity, and by decreasing E/A ratio from 2. 6 (0. 3) (VL 10) to 0. 8 (0. 05) (VL 15) (P < 0. 00005). The E wave deceleration time was shortened and left ventricular diastolic pressures were much increased, all suggesting a deterioration in <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance.</b> All these restrictive changes were promptly reversed by the perfusion of isosorbide dinitrate. The isovolumic relaxation time steadily increased with volume loading. CONCLUSIONS: Small and moderate volume loads improved ventricular diastolic function by promoting early ventricular filling and increasing ventricular compliance. Extreme volume loads promptly induced a diastolic restrictive pattern, transferring filling to {{the second part of}} diastole (increasing dependence on atrial contraction) and reducing ventricular compliance. These changes in ventricular diastolic function were independent of simultaneously measured haemodynamic systolic performance and were promptly reversed by isosorbide dinitrate, which after extreme loading promoted early filling, myocardial relaxation, and improved <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2005 SAE International New {{procedures}} are proposed {{to estimate the}} amplitude-sensitive parameters of hydraulic engine mounts that typically exhibit many nonlinearities. The estimation {{is based on the}} premise that the analyst has access to limited dynamic stiffness test data (say up to 50 Hz), and the detailed laboratory work required for the nonlinear model development would be minimized. By using an analogous mechanical model, a 3 rd/ 2 nd type transfer function is suggested to curve-fit the empirical dynamic stiffness data. Key parameters (such as the inertia-augmented fluid damping and decoupler gap length) are approximated and the effects of some system nonlinearities (such as the vacuum-induced asymmetric <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance)</b> are quantified, leading to a quasi-linear model. For the sake of illustration, transient predictions for a free decoupler mount are made; simulations match well with measurements.

40|$|BackgroundExperimental {{modeling}} of arteriovenous hemodialysis fistula (AVF) hemodynamics is challenging. Mathematical modeling struggles to accurately represent the capillary bed and venous circulation. In vivo animal models are expensive and labor intensive. We hypothesized that an in vitro, physiologic {{model of the}} extremity arteriovenous circulation with provisions for AVF and distal revascularization and interval ligation (DRIL) configurations could be created as a platform for hemodynamic modeling and testing. MethodsAn anatomic, upper extremity arteriovenous model was constructed of tubing focusing on the circulation from the subclavian artery to subclavian vein. Tubing material, length, diameter, and wall thickness were selected to match vessel compliance and morphology. All branch points were constructed at physiologic angles. The venous system and capillary bed were modeled using tubing and one-way valves and <b>compliance</b> <b>chambers.</b> A glycerin/water solution was created to match blood viscosity. The system was connected to a heart simulator. Pressure waveforms and flows were recorded at multiple sites along {{the model for the}} native circulation, brachiocephalic AVF configuration, and the AVF with DR without and with IL (DR no IL and DRIL). ResultsA preset mean cardiac output of 4. 2 L/min from the heart simulator yielded a subclavian artery pressure of 125 / 55 mm Hg and a brachial artery pressure of 121 / 54 mm Hg with physiologic arterial waveforms. Mean capillary bed perfusion pressure was 41 mm Hg, and mean venous pressure in the distal brachial vein was 17 mm Hg with physiologic waveforms. AVF configuration resulted in a 15 % decrease in distal pressure and a 65 % decrease in distal flow to the hand. DR no IL had no change in distal pressure with a 27 % increase in distal flow. DRIL resulted in a 3 % increase in distal pressure and a 15 % increase in distal flow to the hand above that of DR no IL. Flow through the DR bypass decreased from 329 mL/min to 55 mL/min with the addition of IL. Flow through the AVF for both DR no IL and DRIL was preserved. ConclusionsThrough the construction and validation of an in vitro, pulsatile arteriovenous model, the intricate hemodynamics of AVF and treatments for ischemic steal can be studied. DR with or without IL improved distal blood flow in addition to preserving AVF flow. IL decreased the blood flow through the DR bypass itself. The findings of the AVF as a pressure sink and the relative role of IL with DR bypass has allowed this model to provide hemodynamic insight difficult or impossible to obtain in animal or human models. Further study of these phenomena with this model should allow for more effective AVF placement and maturation while personalizing treatment for associated ischemic steal. Clinical RelevanceThe complications of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) -associated steal with its concurrent surgical treatments have been clinically described but have relatively little published, concrete hemodynamic data. A further understanding of the underlying hemodynamics is necessary to prevent the occurrence of steal and improve treatment when it occurs. Specific objectives are to study the blood flow through an AVF with varying anatomic and physiologic parameters, determine what factors {{contribute to the development of}} arterial steal distal to an AVF, and create optimal interventions to treat arterial steal from an AVF when it occurs. The long-term goal is creation of AVF tailored to patient-specific parameters, resulting in higher rates of functional fistulas with decreases in fistula-related complications. The ability to study fluid dynamics using a unique, in vitro, upper extremity pulsatile arteriovenous circulation simulator creates the ideal platform for this work...|$|R
40|$|Overt cardiac failure usually {{presents}} {{with constant}} clinical features as {{consequences of the}} reduced pump action, {{associated with an increased}} adrenergic drive, independent of the underlying disease. However, the study of left ventricular function, before and during the phase of cardiac insufficiency, shows that different pathophysiological mechanisms are responsible for the symptoms and signs of reduced cardiac action. It is possible to recognize that cardiac failure is caused primarily by: (1) early severe depression of the inotropic state, i. e. dilated cardiomyopathies; (2) late inadequate level of ventricular hypertrophy, with normal contractility, i. e. aortic stenosis; (3) early inadequate level of hypertrophy and slightly reduced inotropic state, i. e. mitral insufficiency, and (4) late inadequate level of hypertrophy and severe progressive reduction in contractility, i. e. aortic insufficiency.

40|$|Aims This {{investigation}} {{sought to}} discern the relative accuracy of Doppler predictions of pressure drops in regurgitant jets across {{a broad spectrum of}} conditions, using an in vitro pulsatile flow model. Methods and results We studied the accuracy of Doppler pressure gradients derived from regurgitant jet peak velocities using the simplified Bernoulli equation (SBE) using an in vitro flow model of atrio-ven-tricular valve regurgitation. We observed overall a good correlation (r = 0. 89, P, 0. 0001) with actual pressure gradient, when there is normal fluid viscosity and the jet is free of wall interaction. However, we observed various degrees of underestimation of pressure gradient by Doppler when regur-gitant chamber size was reduced (P = 0. 0003), when fluid viscosity was increased (P, 0. 0001), or in the presence of wall interaction (P, 0. 0001). <b>Chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> had no effect on the accuracy of pressure gradient prediction (P = 0. 36). Significant underestimation error in pressure gradient prediction by Doppler of up to 43. 2 % was observed. Conclusion When jet impingement or wall interaction are present, or when viscosity is increased, caution should be used in applying the SBE to a regurgitant jet, as significant underestimation in pressure gradient prediction may occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{conductance}} catheter technique enables continuous ventricular volume measurements {{based on}} the electrical conductance of blood within the ventricular cavity. However, ventricular excitation also produces a measurable electrical signal within the ventricular cavity. This study was undertaken to investigate {{the relationship between the}} ventricular electrogram and conductance volume measurements in a physical model of the left ventricle without parallel conductance. The ventricular electrogram was simulated with an ECG signal, ECGinput connected to two ring electrodes within the model ventricle. Conductance volume measurements were made with and without ECGinput. The difference between these measurements, GECG(t), represented the conductance volume due to ECGinput. GECG(t) varied {{as a function of the}} first-derivative of ECGinput with respect to time (r 2 = 0. 92, P< 0. 001). GECG(t), This primarily affected volume measurements during ventricular depolarisation; during this phase the volume measurement error varied widely between – 12 % and + 9 %. As a re-sult, end-diastole could not be reliably identified on the pressure-volume loop. The accuracy of conduc-tance volume measurements during late diastole and early isovolumic contraction are substantially affected by the ventricular electrogram. This may result in a significant error in end-diastolic volume estimates, which has important implications for the quantitative assessment of ventricular function including, in particular, the assessment of <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the changes in left {{ventricular}} diastolic function that occur in patients with chronic severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the absence or presence of prolonged therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. METHODS AND RESULTS. Left ventricular function data (cineangiography plus Millar, frame-by-frame analysis) and right ventricular volumes (radionuclide angiography) were obtained at baseline and after an average follow-up of 12. 4 months in 42 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 % or less. After baseline measurements, the patients were randomized to placebo (n = 16) or enalapril (10 mg BID, n = 26). In the placebo group, the changes in left ventricular function were characterized by increases in end-diastolic (159 +/- 43 to 170 +/- 44 mL/m 2) and end-systolic (119 +/- 38 to 128 +/- 49 mL/m 2) volumes accompanied by a downward and rightward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation. In contrast, decreases in end-diastolic (166 +/- 43 to 156 +/- 47 mL/m 2) and end-systolic (125 +/- 43 to 111 +/- 42 mL/m 2) volumes accompanied by a slight upward and leftward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation were noted in the enalapril group. These changes in left ventricular volumes were significantly different between groups (both P <. 005) but were not attended by changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, in time constant of isovolumic pressure decrease, or in right ventricular volumes. However, the chamber stiffness constant beta decreased from 0. 044 +/- 0. 027 to 0. 032 +/- 0. 019 mL- 1 /m 2 in the placebo group, whereas it increased insignificantly in the enalapril group (0. 040 +/- 0. 028 to 0. 041 +/- 0. 028 mL- 1 /m 2). These changes in chamber stiffness constant beta between baseline and follow-up were significantly different between placebo and enalapril groups (P <. 05). Another index of <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance,</b> delta V/delta P, also confirmed the presence of opposite changes in left ventricular <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> in the placebo group and in the enalapril group. The mean diastolic wall stress increased with placebo but not with enalapril (+ 51 versus - 13 kdyn/cm 2; P <. 04) whereas left ventricular mass and the indexes of left ventricular sphericity tended to improve in the enalapril group. The changes in plasma levels of norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and arginine vasopressin were, however, comparable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS. The data indicate that in patients with severe systolic left ventricular dysfunction, the progressive left ventricular dilatation was accompanied by a decrease in left ventricular chamber stiffness; enalapril therapy was able to prevent or partially reverse these changes and tended to reduce left ventricular mass and ventricular sphericity. Those changes were suggestive of partial reversal of left ventricular remodeling by enalapril administration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLeft {{ventricular}} filling (as assessed by Doppler echocardiography) {{has previously been}} shown to depend in a complex fashion on ventricular diastolic function (compliance and relaxation) {{as well as other}} variables, such as atrial pressure and compliance, ventricular systolic function and mitral valve impedance. To study the effect of isolated physiologic alterations on individual Doppler indexes, a mathematic model of mitral flow was analyzed. By varying one physiologic variable at a time, it was shown that mitral velocity acceleration is affected directly by atrial pressure and inversely by the ventricular relaxation tune constant, with relatively little impact of <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance.</b> Deceleration rate was directly influenced by mitral valve area, atrial pressure and ventricular systolic dysfunction and inversely affected by atrial and ventricular compliance relations, with little impact of relaxation unless it was so delayed as to be incomplete during deceleration. Peak velocity was directly affected most strongly by initial left atrial pressure, and lowered somewhat by prolonged relaxation, low atrial and ventricular compliance and systolic dysfunction. Strikingly different filling patterns emerged when the primary physiologic alterations were accompanied by simultaneous compensatory changes in atraal pressure designed to maintain stroke volume constant. Low ventricular compliance with preload compensation produced characteristic E waves with very short acceleration and deceleration times and high peak velocity. Thus, mathematic analysis of {{ventricular filling}} helps to explain the physical and physiologic basis for the transmitral velocity curve...|$|R

Aqueous fluid production was measured by in vivo confocal microscopy after transcorneal iontophoretic introduction of fluorescein. Intraocular pressure (IOP), outflow, and anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>compliance</b> were determined from pressure measurements in response to fluid infusions using micropipettes. Aqueous fluid volume and [Cl−] were assayed in samples withdrawn by micropipettes. In wild-type mice (CD 1 genetic background, age 4 – 6 wk), IOP was 16. 0 ± 0. 4 mmHg (SE), aqueous fluid volume 7. 2 ± 0. 3 μl, fluid production 3. 6 ± 0. 2 μl/h, fluid outflow 0. 36 ± 0. 06 μl/h/mmHg, and compliance 0. 036 ± 0. 006 μl/mmHg. IOP was significantly decreased by up to 1. 8 mmHg (P < 0. 002) and fluid production by up to 0. 9 μl/h in age/litter-matched mice lacking AQP 1 and/or AQP 4 (outbred CD 1 and inbred C 57 /bl 6 genetic backgrounds). However, AQP deletion did not significantly affect outflow, [Cl−], volume, or compliance.
