50|$|Tryptophan 7-halogenases are FADH2-dependent, {{meaning they}} require an FADH2 {{cofactor}} {{in order to}} carry out their reaction. Flavin reductases are responsible for the conversion of FAD to FADH2. For sustained activity in an in vitro setting, tryptophan 7-halogenases thus require either excess FADH2 or the presence of a flavin reductase. Since flavin reductase is itself NAD(P)H-dependent, a recent work studying RebH used a <b>cofactor</b> <b>regeneration</b> system wherein glucose dehydrogenase reduces NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H, which RebF (RebH's native flavin reductase partner) uses to reduce FAD to FADH2 for subsequent use in RebH’s active site.Mechanistically, the flavin-dependent halogenases are similar to flavin-containing monooxygenases. In the first step, FADH2 is oxidized by molecular oxygen, generating a high-energy flavin hydroperoxide.|$|E

The bio-recognition membranes have mono-layer architecture and consist of enzyme cross-linked with albumin and of the cofactors NAD (for FDH-based sensor) or NAD and glutathione (for rFDH-based sensor). This architecture of the biosensor allows the determination of formaldehyde without adding NAD and glutathione to the analyzed sample at every analysis and conducting measurements on the same transducer without <b>cofactors</b> <b>regeneration</b> since the bio-membrane contains it at high concentration (100 mM for NAD and 20 mM for glutathione).

The relative standard deviation of the intra-sensor response did not exceed 4 % and 10 % for rFDH- and FDH-based sensors, respectively.

Although 5 -HTP has therapeutic effects in various symptoms, efficient method of producing 5 -HTP has not been established. In this study, we developed a novel <b>cofactor</b> <b>regeneration</b> process to achieve enhanced synthesis of 5 -HTP by using modified l-phenylalanine 4 -hydroxylase of Chromobacterium violaceum. For the synthesis of 5 -HTP using Escherichia coli whole cell bioconversion, l-tryptophan and 5 -HTP degradation by E. coli endogenous catabolic enzymes should be considered. The tryptophanase gene was disrupted using the λ red recombination system, since tryptophanase is postulated as an initial enzyme for the degradation of l-tryptophan and 5 -HTP in E. coli. For regeneration of the cofactor pterin, we screened and investigated several key enzymes, including dihydropteridine reductase from E. coli, glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis, and pterin- 4 α-carbinolamine dehydratase from Pseudomonas syringae. Genes encoding these three enzymes were overexpressed in an E. coli tryptophanase-deficient host, resulting in the synthesis of 0.74  mM 5 -HTP in the presence of 0.1  mM pterin and the synthesis of 0.07  mM 5 -HTP in the absence of regeneration of pterin.

Of the <b>cofactor</b> <b>regeneration</b> approaches, enzyme-coupled {{system has been}} developed and is particular preferred for enzymatic reactions. Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) as the coupled enzyme has been widely applied in NAD(P)H regeneration (Gao et al. 2013; Ye et al. 2010), due to its advantageous features of accessibility and practicability (Hall and Bommarius 2011). For enzyme coupling, construction of fusion protein has been developed as an effective method for <b>cofactor</b> <b>regeneration,</b> where two coding genes are combined by a short linker sequence to yield a single polypeptide exhibiting at least two functions (Calam et al. 2016; Farrow et al. 2015; Suehrer et al. 2014).

In addition, the active sites of different enzymes for consecutive reactions can be brought {{in close proximity to}} accelerate the processing of intermediate through channeling (Castellana et al. 2014).

The pervaporation procedure {{turned out to be the}} most gentle method of acetone removal which only causes negligible damage to the whole cell biocatalysts. It was also applied for continuously operated biotransformation processes. For the knowledge of whole cell biocatalysts it is desirable to quantify intracellular concentrations of cofactors during a biotransformation process. A new method for quantification of several intracellular metabolites was developed and now transferred to biotransformation processes with recombinant E. coli. The concentrations of intracellular cofactor concentrations were determined during the reduction of methyl acetoacetate and 2, 5 -hexanedione with substrate-coupled <b>cofactor</b> <b>regeneration</b> by oxidation of 2 -propanol...|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of industrially {{relevant}} enzymes depend upon nicotinamide cofactors, which are too expensive to be added in stoichiometric amounts. Existing NAD(P) H-recycling systems suffer from low activity, or the generation of side products. H 2 -driven <b>cofactor</b> <b>regeneration</b> {{has the advantage of}} 100 % atom efficiency and the use of H 2 as a cheap reducing agent, in a world where sustainable energy carriers are increasingly attractive. The state of development of H 2 -driven cofactor-recycling systems and examples of their integration with enzyme reactions are summarized in this article. The O 2 -tolerant NAD+-reducing hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha is a particularly attractive candidate for this approach, and we therefore discuss its catalytic properties that are relevant for technical applications. Many industrially relevant enzymes depend upon expensive nicotinamide cofactors which must be recycled for enzyme applications to be economically viable. Here we review the state of development of H 2 -driven enzymatic <b>cofactor</b> <b>regeneration</b> which has 100 % atom efficiency and uses H 2 as a cheap reducing agent. We show the O 2 tolerant NAD+-reducing hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha to be an attractive candidate. © 2013 FEBS...|$|E
