50|$|Streetlamps are {{designed}} to illuminate the surrounding area at night, serving {{not only as a}} deterrent to criminals but more importantly to allow people to see where they're going. The <b>colour</b> of streetlamp <b>bulbs</b> differ, but are generally white or yellow.|$|R
5000|$|Bulbs: LED rope lights feature bulbs {{that are}} {{available}} in different <b>colours</b> and the <b>bulbs</b> themselves generate the colours. In contrast, incandescent rope lights typically feature bulbs that come with a coloured filter that is applied around the bulb. Therefore, when an LED rope light is switched off, it appears colourless, while incandescent bulbs will still appear coloured.|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to enquire into the {{morphological}} variations which leads to evolutionary divergence of populations of Urginea indica Kunth. In particular, there were considerable morphological variations within the species. The thirty two cytotypes showed distinct morphological differences in shape, size and <b>colour</b> of <b>bulb</b> and leaf, the length of inflorescence and flower colour. The morphological complexity is accompanied by high degree of cytological variations. Preliminary measurements of reproductive, characters have shown that no noteworthy results may be obtained in this characters except pedicel length but the vegetative character deviated significantly. Flowering and blooming time varied that also played a role in isolation of these populations. These morphological differences have a genetic basis and would be worthy in recognizing them as a separate sub specific taxon...|$|R
40|$|Four {{new species}} of the Mouse Spider genus Missulena Walckenaer, 1805 (family Actinopodidae) are {{described}} from Western Australia based on morphological features of adult males. Missulena leniae sp. n. (from the Carnarvon and Yalgoo biogeographic regions), Missulena mainae sp. n. (Carnarvon), Missulena melissae sp. n. (Pilbara) and Missulena pinguipes sp. n. (Mallee) represent {{a broad spectrum of}} morphologi-cal diversity found in this genus and differ from other congeners by details of the male copulatory <b>bulb,</b> <b>colour</b> patterns, eye sizes, leg morphology and leg spination. Two of the species, M. pinguipes sp. n. an...|$|R
2500|$|Snowdrops {{have been}} known since early times, being {{described}} by the classical Greek author Theophrastus {{in the fourth century}} BC in his Περὶ φυτῶν ἱστορία (Latin: Historia plantarum, Enquiry into plants). He gave it, and similar plants, the name λευκόἲον (λευκος, leukos [...] "white" [...] and ἰόν, ion [...] "violet") from which the later name Leucojum was derived. He described the plant as [...] "ἑπεἰ τοῖς γε χρώμασι λευκἂ καἱ οὐ λεπυριώδη" [...] (in <b>colour</b> white and <b>bulbs</b> without scales) and of their habits [...] "Ἰῶν δ' ἁνθῶν τὀ μἑν πρῶτον ἑκφαἱνεται τὁ λευκόἲον, ὅπου μἑν ό ἀἠρ μαλακώτερος εὐθὑς τοῦ χειμῶνος, ὅπου δἐ σκληρότερος ὕστερον, ἑνιαχοῡ τοῡ ἣρος" [...] (Of the flowers, the first to appear is the white violet.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} variability, heritability and {{correlations of}} agronomic traits in an onion (Allium cepa L.) landrace and derived S 1 lines after a single selfing generation. Bulbs {{used to develop}} S 1 lines were selected for shape, colour and high number of skins. Fifty-one S 1 lines and the original population were evaluated using an incomplete random block design. The original population and S 1 lines were highly diverse for quantitative and qualitative traits. S 1 lines were significantly different, with transgressive segregation for number and maximum leaf length, bulbing index, bulb weight, diameter, and dry matter content. Variances within S 1 lines were greater than among S 1 lines for all traits. <b>Bulb</b> <b>colour</b> and number of skins responded to selection. Heritabilities for dry matter and soluble solids were 52. 6 % and 36. 1 % respectively. Both traits were highly correlated. The development of S 1 lines allowed the expression of genetic variation and the identification of better genotypes for agronomic traits of interest...|$|R
50|$|Tulipa turkestanica is a herbaceous, bulbous {{perennial}} growing 10 cm to 15 cm tall, with 2 - 4 thin glaucous leaves up to 15 cm long on each stem. The {{margins and}} tips have a pinkish <b>colour.</b> The leathery <b>bulb</b> is bright reddish-brown {{and has a}} hairy tunic. Each plant produces between one and twelve star-shaped flowers, grouped in a raceme. The flowers are ivory white to pinkish red, with a yellow to orange basal blotch, which extends to {{about a third of}} the flower. The backs of the outer tepals are greyish red with a whitish fringe and much wider than the inner tepals, which have a thin, green line on the middle of their outside. The filaments are orange, and the anthers are dark violet or yellow with a violet tip, which distinguishes it from T. biflora that has very similar flowers but yellow anthers. It is also slightly smaller and flowers slightly earlier. The flowers only open in direct sunlight. The smell is often described as unpleasant. In the wild, it flowers between March and May, depending on the altitude.|$|R
50|$|Fall {{prevention}} is thus {{an important consideration}} in designing homes for the elderly, {{and one of the}} most critical parts of that design process is supplying strong and effective lighting. Thus, when switched on, lights should react instantaneously, so the user is not surprised by a hidden obstacle as he or she moves into a kitchen or bathroom, for example. In such a case, incandescent light bulbs are preferred over fluorescent lighting, because they react instantaneously while a CFL takes time to warm up and become bright. Incandescent light bulbs also offer much greater illuminance than many other light sources, are relatively low cost and easy to install. Higher lighting levels enable users to see potential hazards before they need to take avoiding action, and so negotiate them safely and easily. Excellent colour rendering (as measured by the Colour rendering index) by such incandescent light also helps users identify <b>colours</b> correctly. Halogen <b>bulbs</b> are also available for greater efficiency, as are rough service bulbs to avoid discriminatory regulations, especially in the EU. No doubt LED lights will become an alternative source of high quality lighting in the future, but in 2013 they remain expensive for domestic use. Rough service bulbs are available in sizes up to 200 watt in all varieties of fittings. Although lifetime is generally lower than for CFLs, they are replaced easily.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bulb</b> <b>colour</b> is an {{important}} consumer trait for onion (Allium cepa L., Allioideae, Asparagales). The bulbs accumulate a range of flavonoid compounds, including anthocyanins (red), flavonols (pale yellow) and chalcones (bright yellow). Flavonoid regulation is poorly characterised in onion and in other plants belonging to the Asparagales, despite being a major plant order containing many important crop and ornamental species. R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factors associated with the regulation of distinct branches of the flavonoid pathway were isolated from onion. These belonged to sub-groups (SGs) that commonly activate anthocyanin (SG 6, MYB 1) or flavonol (SG 7, MYB 29) production, or repress phenylpropanoid/flavonoid synthesis (SG 4, MYB 4, MYB 5). MYB 1 was demonstrated {{to be a positive}} regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis by the induction of anthocyanin production in onion tissue when transiently overexpressd and by reduction of pigmentation when transiently repressed via RNAi. Furthermore, ectopic red pigmentation was observed in garlic (A. sativum L.) plants stably transformed with a construct for co-overexpression of MYB 1 and a bHLH partner. MYB 1 also was able to complement the acyanic petal phenotype of a defined R 2 R 3 -MYB anthocyanin mutant in Antirrhinum majus of the asterid clade of eudicots. The availability of sequence information for flavonoid-related MYBs from onion enabled phylogenetic groupings to be determined across monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species, including the identification of characteristic amino acid motifs. This analysis suggests that divergent evolution of the R 2 R 3 -MYB family has occurred between Poaceae/Orchidaceae and Allioideae species. The DNA sequences identified will be valuable for future analysis of classical flavonoid genetic loci in Allium crops and will assist the breeding of these important crop species...|$|R
40|$|Onion {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} horticultural crops categorized under root crops. A global review of major vegetables shows that onion ranks second under area cultivation. Ethiopia has an enormous potential for production of vegetable crops in general and onion particular and it is also among the most important export crops. Onion {{is one of the}} most important vegetable crops grown in the study area, Fogera. It contributes to the major share of daily cash source. The objectives of this study were: to identify farmers’ evaluation and selection criteria of improved onion varieties disseminated in the study area; to identify intensity of adoption of farmers in the study area. This study interviewe 140 sample households using structured questionnaire and out of the total 140 sample households 10 % were women. In this study, data were collected and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Quantitative data analysis methods were employed mainly with chi-square, F-test and Tobit model using SPSS and Limdep computer soft ware. In farmers’ evaluation and selection criteria of improved onion varieties disseminated in the study area Bombay red ranks first and Adama red ranks second. Early maturity, good yield, large bulb size, and good <b>bulb</b> <b>colour</b> were the most important traits of improved onion identified as a selection and evaluation criteria in the study area. Result of the econometric model indicated that household head’s education status of the household head access credit, participation in extension event (participation in training and field day), participation cooperative society and frequency of visiting out side his/her social system were important variables which had positively and significantly influenced adoption and intensity of adoption of improved onion production package. Where as, farmers' perception towards improved onion production technology had shown negative relationship with adoption and intensity of adoption. All most all farmers who adopted improved onion varieties have not implemented the recommended spacing mainly due to its labour intensive practice. The overall finding of the study underlined the high importance of institutional support in the areas of extension training; strengthening cooperative societies, and improving market condition to enhance adoption of improved onion production package.
