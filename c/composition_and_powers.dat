40|$|Ta_(36) Si_(14) N_(50) {{amorphous}} layers were reactive ion {{etched in}} CF_(4) +O_(2) plasmas. The etch depth was determined {{as a function}} of gas <b>composition,</b> pressure, <b>and</b> cathode <b>power.</b> Adding small amounts of O_ 2 to CF_ 4 increased the etch rates up to approximately 15 % O_ 2 concentration, with etch rates then decreasing with further addition of O_ 2. Etch rates increased with both pressure <b>and</b> <b>power.</b> Etching proceeded only after an initial delay time which depended upon gas <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>power.</b> The delay is probably caused by a surface native oxide which must be removed before etching can commence. The presence of a surface oxide was observed from Auger electron spectroscopy intensity depth profile measurements and is estimated to be 2 nm thick. Under optimal conditions, the etch rate of Ta_(36) Si_(14) N_(50) is about seven times higher than for SiO_ 2, thus providing a high degree of selectivity for integrated circuit processing...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{duration}} of resistance training interventions {{in children who}} are overweight or obese. J Strength Cond Res 23 (4) : 1263 - 1270, 2009 -The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of different durations of resistance training on body <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> in children. The study was a 24 -week longitudinal design involving 31 preadolescent children who were overweight or obese (ages 7 - 12 years), divided into 3 groups and resistance trained 3 times per week. Group 8 (G 8) trained for 8 weeks, group 16 (G 16) trained for 16 weeks, and group 24 (G 24) trained for 24 weeks. All participants were measured at weeks 0, 8, 16, and 24 for body <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>power.</b> Subjects in G 8 and G 16 continued to be tested during the testing weeks after cessation of their training programs. Body <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> bone mineral content were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Significant improvements in body composition were seen in the initial 8 -week training phase, and these improvements were maintained for the subsequent 16 weeks. Significant changes in percent body fat (~ 5 - 7 %) were observed at 8 weeks in all 3 groups. Total fat mass decreased significantly at week 8 in G 16 and G 24 (5. 9 %). By week 24, total fat mass was significantly reduced by 8. 1 % in G 24. Significant improvements were observed in static jump power, which improved by 10. 5 % at week 16 in G 24. These results suggest that an 8 -week resistance training program is sufficient time to significantly change body <b>composition,</b> strength, <b>and</b> <b>power</b> measures in children who are overweight or obese. However, further improvements are realized with longer-duration resistance training programs. On cessation of the training programs, the G 8 and G 16 groups maintained the benefits of the exercise program until the end of the study period...|$|R

40|$|Creatine supplementation {{has been}} widely used for athletes and in some studies it has been proved effective; however, there remain some {{moderator}} variables that still require meta-analysis. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to conduct such an analysis on the effects of creatine supplementation on biochemical, body <b>composition,</b> <b>and</b> physical performance variables. From a total of 120 experimental studies found in databases, only 55 studies (46 %) were considered appropriate and/or contained the necessary information to obtain effect sizes. Creatine supplementation produced biochemical changes, including increases in excretion parameters. Anthropometric variables, body fat percentage, and lean mass were favorably changed by creatine supplementation. Improved peak power, total work, force <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> a maximal repetition (1 RM) were also found following creatine supplementation. There was an evident placebo effect in the variables meta-analyzed; however, there was a clear increase in total work beyond the placebo effect.
