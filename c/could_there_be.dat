Much of the research showing positive effects has been done on animals, with insufficient clinical research on humans. Resveratrol research in animals and humans remains active.|$|E
25|$|Nkrumah's mother {{sent him}} to the {{elementary}} school run by a Catholic mission at Half Assini, where he proved an adept student. A German Roman Catholic priest by the name of George Fischer was said to have profoundly influenced his elementary school education. Although his mother, whose name was Elizabeth Nyanibah (1876/77–1979), later stated his year of birth was 1912, Nkrumah wrote that he was born on 18 September 1909, a Saturday. Nyanibah, who hailed from Nsuaem and belongs to the Agona family, was a fishmonger and petty trader when she married his father. After eight days of his birth, his father named him as Francis Nwia-Kofi after a relative but later his parents named him as Francis Kwame Ngolomah. He progressed through the ten-year elementary programme in eight years. By about 1925 he was a student-teacher in the school, and had been baptised into the Catholic faith. While at the school, he was noticed by the Reverend Alec Garden Fraser, principal of the Government Training College (soon to become Achimota School) in the Gold Coast's capital, Accra. Fraser arranged for Nkrumah to train as a teacher at his school. Here, Columbia-educated deputy headmaster Kwegyir Aggrey exposed him to the ideas of Marcus Garvey and W. E. B. Du Bois. Aggrey, Fraser, and others at Achimota taught that there should be close co-operation between the races in governing the Gold Coast, but Nkrumah, echoing Garvey, soon came to believe that only when the black race governed itself <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> harmony between the races.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the character has been generally negative. Robert A. George of the New York Post has written that Glee has: [...] "the most unpleasant pack of female characters of any show in recent memory", and deemed Terri the [...] "biggest culprit". George called Terri's hysterical pregnancy [...] "Freudian" [...] and wrote: [...] "The Terri-Quinn plot sends {{the message that the}} devious gender will use every trick to lure and trap its mate — including lying about pregnancy." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry commented: [...] "Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, [...] (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan has called Terri [...] "the worst thing about Glee", and opined: [...] "As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig, the character is screechy, unfunny and deeply unpleasant. It's as if Ryan didn't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish, nagging wife from hell." [...] Ryan later deemed Terri the [...] "one big flaw in Glee, commenting that she: [...] "manages to drain all the fun out of Glee every time she appears. Not only is this shrill character intensely annoying, but she makes you wonder whether Will has brain damage. What other explanation <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> for his ending up with this materialistic harpy?". Furthermore, Terri was included in TV Guide list of The Most Loathed TV Characters.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principle}} {{is different from}} [...] change, and change is different from principle. The teachings {{are different from the}} essence , and the essence is different from the teachings. Therefore, the thousand changes and myriad transformations all take place outside the [...] principle, for how <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> any movement in the spirit ? Precisely because it does not move, it can endlessly respond to change. The endless change does not denote the presence of the sage in things, nor is the change of things itself the sage. The myriad sounds cause the bell to reverberate—a reverberation that, although single, encompasses [...] A myriad things stimulate 感 the sage, and the sage also responds 應 out of stillness. Therefore, the [...] sounds {{are not the same as}} the [...] reverberation, and the words [...] are not the same as the wisdom of the sage. (tr. Sharf 2002: 112-113) ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{potential}} {{consequence of}} mind uploading {{is that the}} decision to [...] "upload" [...] may then create a mindless symbol manipulator instead of a conscious mind (see philosophical zombie). Are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it displays behaviors that are highly indicative of consciousness? Are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it verbally insists that it is conscious? <b>Could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> an absolute upper limit in processing speed above which consciousness cannot be sustained? The mystery of consciousness precludes a definitive answer to this question. Numerous scientists, including Kurzweil, strongly believe that determining whether a separate entity is conscious [...] (with 100% confidence) is fundamentally unknowable, since consciousness is inherently subjective (see solipsism). Regardless, some scientists strongly believe consciousness is the consequence of computational processes which are substrate-neutral. On the contrary, numerous scientists believe consciousness {{may be the result of}} some form of quantum computation dependent on substrate (see quantum mind).|$|E
2500|$|The {{competing}} {{version of}} events does not mention the secret letter. Instead, after arriving in Rome, Olybrius was proclaimed emperor several months before Anthemius' death, in April or May 472. Ricimer then besieged the part of Rome where Anthemius was for several months until the lawful Emperor was abandoned by his partisans, captured in a church, and put to death by Gundobad, Ricimer's nephew. This version implies that Olybrius was secretly supported by the Emperor Leo, which explains why Leo sent him there. Three of our sources -- Theophanes, the Paschal Chronicle, and Paullus Diaconus—support this version. Edward Gibbon accepts this implication as fact, although {{none of the three}} sources explicitly state that Leo supported Olybrius. What other reason <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be,</b> Bury asks, then answers his own rhetorical question: [...] "the facts that Anthemius was Leo's chosen candidate, his filius, and that Olybrius was the friend of his foe Genseric, are a strong counter-argument." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 8, [...] "Racism, Sexism and Homophobia", {{examines}} how the modern ideology {{of race and}} the term racist differ from the previous concept of [...] "racialism", and how the sexual revolution represents [...] "seeking the existing order's permission to pursue pleasure at all costs", which undermines Christian principles of marriage, and {{has its roots in}} events in 1968. In Chapter 9, [...] "Sexism is Rational", Hitchens states that the Left's taking up feminist causes since the 1960s has led to the damage and exploitation of women, as well as a decline in marriage. Hitchens says this process is part of revolutionaries' seeking to [...] "destroy and expunge the restraints placed on human selfishness by the Christian religion. The permanent married family is the greatest single obstacle to this". Hitchens concludes that in Britain there is an emerging citizenry [...] "prepared for enslavement, ignorant of its origins, past, rights, traditions, and duties" [...] and that [...] "only in a wholly broken political system <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> such a need for reform, and no reformers ready to address it".|$|E
