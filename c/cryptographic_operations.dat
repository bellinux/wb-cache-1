50|$|Automated Teller Machines {{which can}} read the MM code contain a special MM box and sensor to read and verify the MM code.

During MM code verification, a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>operation</b> is performed to check that the MM code on the magnetic stripe corresponds to the hidden one. The presence of the keyed <b>cryptographic</b> <b>operation</b> means that the correct MM code for a counterfeit cannot be calculated from the magnetic stripe information alone without knowledge of the key - it must be read from the original card itself.|$|R
