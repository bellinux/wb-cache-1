Accessibility instruments are thus able to show what are the best accessible places or opportunities within a city or region, considering one or more specific modes of transportation, timeslots and target groups. In addition to this, the maps, which are produced as the instrument output, are considered as considerably useful when assessing the effects of new developments in a city. The first ever first large scale compendium of accessibility instruments was developed in 2012, under the framework of Cost Action TU1002, and is available.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Knowledge {{representation}} formalisms {{used on the}} Semantic Web {{adhere to}} a strict open world assumption. Therefore, nonmonotonic reasoning techniques are often viewed with scepticism. Especially negation as failure, which intuitively adopts a closed world view, is often claimed to be unsuitable for the Web where knowledge is notoriously incomplete. Nonetheless, it was suggested in the ongoing discussions around rules extensions for languages like RDF(S) or OWL to allow at least restricted forms of negation as failure, as long as negation has an explicitly defined, finite scope. Yet clear definitions of such “scoped negation ” as well as formal semantics thereof are missing. We propose logic programs with <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> <b>scoped</b> negation <b>and</b> discuss two possible semantics with desirable properties. We also argue that this class of logic programs {{can be viewed as}} a rule extension to a subset of RDF(S). ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This article {{reflects}} {{on the future of}} critical perspectives on international business (cpoib) by considering some key developments in the international business (IB) context since the journal’s launch in 2005. The journal’s mission <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> is refreshed in light of these developments. Changes to the editorial team and editorial advisory board are also announced. Design/methodology/approach: A review of some of the key developments in the IB context provides the background and justification for a revised editorial mission <b>and</b> <b>scope.</b> Findings: Given changes in the IB environment, the need for a journal that takes a critically reflexive view on the activities of IB and issues of relevance to IB is found to be of increasing importance. This finding underlines the need for scholars to undertake empirical and conceptual studies that adopt critical perspectives to identify IB practices that are detrimental to stakeholders broadly defined and to offer alternatives.

40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes {{employment}} of {{artificial neural network}} techniques to develop in-network “intelligent computation” and “adaptation” capability for wireless sensor networks to improve their functionality, utility and survival aspects. The goal is to introduce computational intelligence capability for the wireless sensor networks to become adaptive to changes within a variety of operational <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> to exhibit intelligent behaviour. The characteristics of wireless sensor networks bring many challenges, such as the ultra large number of sensor nodes, dense deployment, changing topology structure, and the most importantly, the limited resources including power, computation, storage, and communication capability. All these require the applications and protocols running on wireless sensor network {{to be not only}} energy-efficient, scalable and robust, but also “adapt” to changing environment or <b>context,</b> <b>and</b> application <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> focus among others, and demonstrate intelligent behaviour. Feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a simulation-based case study which entailed a clustering of Iris data using Kohonen's self-organizing map neural network which was embedded across a wireless sensor network...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} century there have been drastic {{changes in the way}} {{products}} are developed and manufactured – manufacturing technologies have advanced {{and at the same time}} global competition has increased tremendously. For companies to survive, the name of the game has been to offer greater product variety, in more frequent intervals, and for a lower price. Mass production has been replaced by mass customization, where the basic rule is that the customers should get exactly what they want, at the time they want it. A partial remedy to concurrently lower cost as well as provide customers with a greater number of variants has been to use platforms*. Platforms in the manufacturing industry have at times been highly advantageous while in other instances they have caused more problems than benefit. Platforms exist in different <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope,</b> <b>and</b> it has been found that companies need to improve their platform management skills in order to increase the general level of competitive advantage. This dissertation proposes that a company can considerably improve the management of its platforms by increasing its holistic understanding of them. To do this, platforms are viewed from different viewpoints that aim to both display the effect a platform has on its surroundings, as well as the effect its surroundings has on it. This approach has been incorporated into a method called the PAMatrix (Platform Assessment Matrix) that uses a synthesis of cross-functional, subjective expert opinion and consensus based decision making. The PAMatrix method uses already existing implicit and explicit knowledge to improve decision making on how to manage each individual platform. First a set of platforms are identified that the company views as key enablers for creating a competitive advantage. The platforms are then assessed from several different viewpoints – each capturing a partial evaluation of the platforms’ status or effect. After an assessment of a viewpoint, each stakeholder individually suggests a specific strategic action plan along with a weight factor of how important the viewpoint is to the overall assessment of the specific platform. Finally, the discrete action plan suggestions are collected and jointly assessed and debated – based on which, a final strategic action plan can be made. The method has been tested in three industrial situations, where its use has been considered beneficial and platform understanding has increased. * In this dissertation, a platform is defined as the set of core assets that are reused to create a competitive advantage. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>context</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of {{the study}} In {{the spirit of the}} growing {{environmental}} awareness in the past decades, we witness nowadays an increasing interest in biodiversity, both locally and world-wide. Biodiversity requires our attention for two reasons. First, it provides a wide range of benefits to mankind and human activities. Second, many human activities have contributed to unprecedented rates of biodiversity loss, which threaten the stability and continuity of ecosystems as well as their provision of goods and services to mankind. Consequently, in recent years much attention has been directed towards the analysis and valuation of the (loss of) biodiversity. The valuation of biodiversity can be approached from an ecological, economic, or combined perspective. This contribution presents an overview of economic and ecological indicators of biodiversity, identifies the underlying valuation approaches, discusses basic concepts and theories, and reviews the respective a...|$|E
