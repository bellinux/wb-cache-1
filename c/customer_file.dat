40|$|In recent years, {{the field}} of {{distributed}} processing, distributed systems, has undergone great change, and has been an area attracting tremendous research and development efforts. This thesis explores the various current methodologies for designing, developing and implementing distributed systems using the Ada programming language, {{and goes on to}} implement a simulation of a distributed store system using the "virtual node" design approach. After a brief introduction on distributed systems in general, an investigation of the basic issues and problems involved in distributing Ada programs coupled with an analysis and comparison of various approaches to developing distributed Ada systems is carried out. It is shown that one of the critical problems of Ada in a distributed environment is its implicit assumption of a single memory processor. A simulation of a distributed system (store system) is carried out using the virtual node method of developing distributed Ada systems. The various stages of this design method including interface task specification are stepped through. A sample run of the. system is given, including the <b>customer</b> <b>file,</b> stock file data and the monitored output of the system. Department of Computer ScienceThesis (M. S. ...|$|E
40|$|The Data Warehousing Institute (TDWI) {{estimates}} that data quality problems cost U. S. businesses more than $ 600 billion a year. The problem with data {{is that its}} quality quickly degenerates over time. Experts say 2 percent of records in a <b>customer</b> <b>file</b> become obsolete in one month because customers die, divorce, marry, and move. In addition, data entry errors, system migrations, and changes in source systems, among other things, generate bucket loads of errors. More complex, as organizations fragment into different divisions and units, interpretations of data elements change to meet the local business needs. However, {{there are several ways}} that the Company should concern, such as to treat data as a strategic corporate resource; develop a program for managing data quality with a commitment from the top; and hire, train, or outsource experienced data quality professionals to oversee and carry out the program. The Organizations can sustain a commitment to managing data quality over time and adjust monitoring and cleansing processes to changes in the business and underlying systems by using the Commercial data quality tools. Data is a vital resource. Companies that invest proportionally to manage this resource will stand a stronger chance of succeeding in today's competitive global economy than those that squander this critical resource by neglecting to ensure adequate levels of quality.

40|$|Response {{modeling}} is a {{very important}} application field of classification methods in direct marketing because the success of a direct-mail campaign is highly dependent on who is being targeted. To date, standard classification models are applied to predict future purchasing behaviour for the complete <b>customer</b> <b>file.</b> In practice, however, companies use mailing budgets, i. e. only a subset of customers will be sent mail. Just those customers with sufficiently high-expected response rates are mailed to. The percentage of the total population that will actually receive the mailing is referred to as mailing depth. Hence, the real classification problem is not to classify all potential recipients as well as possible, but rather to find those customers, within the budget limitation, with the highest probability of response. Therefore, we propose an innovative alternative route to improved overall performance by tailoring the classification method to fit the problem at hand. We adapt binary logistic regression by iteratively changing the true values of the dependent variable during the maximum-likelihood estimation procedure. Those customers who rank lower than the cutoff in terms of predicted purchase probability, imposed by the mailing-depth restriction, will not contribute to the total likelihood. We illustrate our procedure on a real-life direct-marketing dataset comparing traditional response models to our innovative. approach optimising for a specific mailing depth. The results show that for mailing depths up to 48 % our method achieves significant and substantial profit increases...|$|E

40|$|Xeikon is {{a digital}} {{printing}} system that sends digital files {{directly to the}} press, thus eliminating film and plate processing. Technically, Xeikon is a web-fed press using electrophotographic technology to create information that is trans ferred to the substrate. From a marketing perspective, {{it is one of}} the preferred choices for on-demand, variable-data, and short-run printing because it has been proven to be an economical process than traditional offset. In the current printing process, the digital file is prepared as a postscript file and transferred to the Xeikon server and Xeikon Raster Image Processor (RIP) respectively. The computer section at the Xeikon RIP will RIP the file and image the information on the photoconductor drum. The information is then trans ferred to the substrate. Conventionally, the digital file can be changed to improve the tone reproduction in order to make the image suitable for each job. However, the file will be transferred back to the prepress workstation and sent back through the RIPping process. Another possible way to improve the tone reproduction of the image is the adjustment of the dot gain setting in the RIPping process without changing the native digital file. The benefits of this process could include: - Reducing the bottleneck in prepress - Minimizing prepress variables - Protecting <b>customer</b> <b>file</b> integrity Subsequently, this study examined how varying the dot gain setting in the RIPping process can improve the workflow of the Xeikon digital printing sys tem. The printed targets, produced from varying the dot gain setting at the pre press workstation (conventional workflow) and at the Xeikon RIP (proposed workflow), were compared the tone reproduction, dot gain, solid ink density, and gray balance. The time usage of each workflow was also measured. And the sample images were evaluated by a group of 20 observers. The results indicated that varying the dot gain setting at the Xeikon RIP saved the production time. Meanwhile, they showed the different output qualities in terms of tone reproduction, dot gain, and gray balance but the same in terms of solid ink density. However, the image evaluation result showed that the observers accepted images from proposed workflow rather than those from con ventional workflow...|$|E
