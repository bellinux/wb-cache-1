5|$|The <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> {{had counted}} on winning the {{nomination}} by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E
5|$|In comparison, 2008 Presidential {{candidate}} Hillary Clinton {{began to}} disengage from Hsu {{at an earlier}} phase of the scandal when Hsu's long time fugitive status was first revealed. After indications of additional misconduct by Hsu, the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> then decided to refund a total of $850,000 in bundled contributions Clinton {{was the first major}} candidate to give up bundled contributions from associates of Norman Hsu. However, {{it is also true that}} her campaign ignored earlier private warnings about Hsu and that Clinton was the largest recipient of bundled donations from Hsu.|$|E

25|$|After winning West Virginia, the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> {{claimed a}} {{lead in the}} popular vote. However, the math behind this claim relied upon a number of points that were disputed by neutral {{political}} observers and by the Obama campaign. Most problematically, the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> count gave Clinton 328,309 votes and Obama 0 votes in the disputed Michigan primary.|$|E
25|$|Wikileaks has popularised conspiracies {{about the}} Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, such as tweeting an article which {{suggested}} <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> chairperson John Podesta engaged in satanic rituals (which was later {{revealed to be}} false), implying that the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed, suggesting that Clinton wore earpieces to debates and interviews, claiming that Hillary Clinton wanted to drone strike Assange, promoting conspiracy theories about Clinton's health, and promoting a conspiracy theory from a Donald Trump-related Internet community tying the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> to child kidnapper Laura Silsby.|$|E

She was a {{management}} consultant at McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting firm, from mid-1990, when she received her degree from Oxford, to early 1992, when she worked for the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign.</b> Rice worked in McKinsey's Toronto office for a time.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to supporting Clinton {{as a donor}} and fundraiser, Ricketts supported several Democrats running for other offices in the 2016 elections. Ricketts gave personal donations that year to Jan Schakowsky's congressional re-election campaign, Tammy Duckworth's senate campaign, Maggie Hassan's senate campaign, and Russ Feingold's senate campaign. Ricketts also donated to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committeebenefiting both state parties and the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
25|$|During a {{majority}} of the final campaigning, the attacks between the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> and the Obama campaign highly intensified by the candidates as well as the media coverage. Barack Obama began to attack former President Bill Clinton for his comments which were taken as racist. These comments are considered by analyst and historians alike as the turning point of the South Carolina primary and ultimately the cause of Clinton's loss of support from the black community.|$|E

25|$|The {{story was}} {{followed}} by CTV's Washington bureau chief, Tom Clark, who reported that Obama's campaign, not Clinton's, had reassured Canadian diplomats. Clark cited unnamed Canadian sources in his initial report. Media later reported the source as Canadian Ambassador Michael Wilson. There was no explanation at the time for why Brodie {{was said to have}} referred to the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign,</b> but the news report was about the Obama campaign. Robert Hurst, president of CTV News, declined to comment.|$|E
25|$|Although Sanders had not {{formally}} {{dropped out of}} the race, he announced on June 16, 2016, that his main goal in the coming months would be to work with Clinton to defeat Trump in the general election. On July 8, appointees from the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign,</b> the Sanders campaign, and the Democratic National Committee negotiated a draft of the party's platform. On July 12, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton at a rally in New Hampshire in which he appeared with her.|$|E
25|$|Barr is {{best known}} for his role as one of the House {{managers}} during President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial. It was Barr who first introduced a resolution directing the House Judiciary Committee to inquire into impeachment proceedings – months before the Monica Lewinsky scandal came to light. Foremost among the concerns Barr cited at the time was apparent obstruction of Justice Department investigations into <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> fundraising from foreign sources, chiefly the People's Republic of China.|$|E

25|$|In her Senate career, Senator Clinton {{is often}} seen wearing a suit. However, twice in 2006, Clinton was criticized by National Review Online editor Kathryn Jean Lopez for showing {{cleavage}} while speaking in the Senate. Lopez implored Clinton to be more modest. The Washington Post revisited this question based on a new incident in July 2007, which provoked a widespread round of media self-criticism about {{whether it was a}} legitimate topic or not; the <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> then used claimed outrage at the reporting for fundraising purposes.|$|E
25|$|Aside from Florida and North Carolina, {{the states}} which secured Trump's victory are {{situated}} in the Great Lakes/Rust Belt region. Wisconsin went Republican {{for the first time}} since 1984, while Pennsylvania and Michigan went Republican {{for the first time since}} 1988. Stein petitioned for a recount in these states. The <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> pledged to participate in the Green Party recount efforts, while Trump backers challenged them in court. Meanwhile, American Delta Party/Reform Party presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente petitioned for and was granted a partial recount in Nevada.|$|E
25|$|As the {{primaries}} continued, various groups tried {{to negotiate a}} resolution to the standoff between the DNC and the state parties. The <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> advocated first for the results to stand and then for {{a new round of}} voting to take place in Michigan and Florida, while the Obama campaign deferred the matter to the DNC, while expressing a wish that the delegations be seated in some form. On all sides, Democrats worried that a failure to resolve the problem could lead to a rules or credential fight at the convention and low Democratic turnout in the general election in November.|$|E
