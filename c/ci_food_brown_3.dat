40|$|The {{control of}} <b>food</b> <b>browning</b> {{and growth of}} disease-causing {{microorganisms}} is critical to maintaining the quality and safety of food. Tyrosinase is the key enzyme in <b>food</b> <b>browning.</b> The inhibitory effect of methyl trans-cinnamate on the activity of tyrosinase has been investigated. Methyl trans-cinnamate can strongly inhibit both monophenolase and diphenolase activity of mushroom tyrosinase. When the concentration of methyl trans-cinnamate reached 2. 5 mM, the lag time was lengthened from 32 to 160 s and the steady-state activity was lost about 65 %. The IC 50 value was 1. 25 mM. For the diphenolase activity, the inhibition of methyl trans-cinnamate displayed a reversible and noncompetitive mechanism. The IC 50 value was 1. 62 mM, and the inhibition constant (K-I) {{was determined to be}} 1. 60 mM. Moreover, the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphyloccocus aureus and antifungal activity against Candida albicans were tested. The results showed that methyl trans-cinnamate possessed an antimicrobial ability.
