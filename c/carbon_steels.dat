Its applications involving <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E

25|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> {{cookware}} can {{be rolled}} or hammered into relatively thin sheets of dense material, which provides robust strength and improved heat distribution. <b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> accommodates high, dry heat for such operations as dry searing. <b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> does not conduct heat efficiently, {{but this may}} be an advantage for larger vessels, such as woks and paella pans, where one portion of the pan is intentionally kept at a different temperature than the rest. Like cast iron, <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> must be seasoned before use, usually by rubbing a fat or oil on the cooking surface and heating the cookware on the stovetop or in the oven. With proper use and care, seasoning oils polymerize on <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> to form a low-tack surface, well-suited to browning, Maillard reactions and easy release of fried foods. <b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> will easily rust if not seasoned and should be stored seasoned to avoid rusting. <b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> is traditionally used for crêpe and fry pans, as well as woks.|$|R
40|$|The {{metallic}} low {{and intermediate}} level radioactive waste generally consists of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> and stainless steels. The corrosion rate of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> in deep groundwater is typically low, unless {{the water is}} very acidic or microbial activity in the environment is high. Therefore, the assessment of microbially induced corrosion of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> in deep bedrock environment has become important for evaluating the safety of disposal of radioactive waste. Here we studied the corrosion inducing ability of indigenous microbial community from a deep bedrock aquifer. <b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> coupons were exposed to anoxic groundwater from repository site 100 m depth (Olkiluoto, Finland) for periods of three and eight months. The experiments were conducted at both in situ temperature and room temperature to investigate the response of microbial population to elevated temperature. Our results demonstrate that microorganisms from the deep bedrock aquifer benefit from <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> introduced to the nutrient poor anoxic deep groundwater environment. In the groundwater incubated with <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> the planktonic microbial community was more diverse and 100 -fold more abundant compared to the environment without <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> The betaproteobacteria were the most dominant bacterial class in all samples where <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> was present, whereas in groundwater incubated without <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> the microbial community had clearly less diversity.

40|$|Abstract. The {{separator}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parts in PEM fuel cells. Stainless steels are widely used as separator for its good mechanical properties and mass production. However, for a good chemical compatibility, stainless steels need to have high chromium content or surface treatment, which makes separator high cost. Low cost of separator is important for commercial use. In this study, conventional low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> is used as base metal of separator. Low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> is low at cost, but has poor chemical properties for separator. For a good corrosion resistance, low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> needs to be surface treated. To make a uniform surface treated layer on low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> chromium is conventionally electroplated on the steel and thermally nitrided. Surface treated low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> is investigated using microstructure and element analysis tools.
