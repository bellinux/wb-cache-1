40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of immersing beef <b>cheek</b> <b>meat</b> in antimicrobial solutions on the reduction of O 157 :H 7 Shiga toxinâ€“producing Escherichia coli (STEC), non-O 157 :H 7 STEC, and Salmonella enterica. Beef <b>cheek</b> <b>meat</b> was inoculated with O 157 :H 7 STEC, non-O 157 :H 7 STEC, and S. enterica on both the adipose and muscle surfaces. The inoculated <b>cheek</b> <b>meat</b> was then immersed in one of seven antimicrobial solutions for 1, 2. 5, or 5 min: (i) 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{directive}} provides inspection program personnel (IPP) {{with the}} methodology for protecting public health by verifying, documenting, and enforcing {{the requirement that}} there be no visible fecal material, milk, or ingesta on livestock carcasses at or immediately after the final rail, and for verifying that feces, ingesta, and milk are not present on head meat, <b>cheek</b> <b>meat,</b> and weasand meat. This directive also provides IPP with instructions for verifying that visible fecal material are not present on poultry carcasses entering the chill tank.

50|$|In Indonesia {{the soup}} is {{prepared}} in rich savoury broth with spices and ingredients {{similar to other}} Indonesian favourite, sop buntut (oxtail soup). Common sop kambing uses goat meat, also its ribs; however, in Indonesia {{there is a more}} specific sop kambing called sop kepala kambing which uses offals of goat's head, which includes its tongue, ear, lips and <b>cheek</b> <b>meats,</b> eyes and sometimes brain. Another specific sup kambing is called sop kaki kambing which uses goat's trotters.|$|R
40|$|A. This {{directive}} {{is being}} reissued to provide off-line inspection program personnel (IPP) with information regarding how {{to verify that}} cattle slaughter operations are implementing sanitary dressing and process control procedures, and that the procedures they are implementing prevent contamination of carcasses and ensure that insanitary conditions are not created. B. In addition, this directive provides information describing how IPP are to assess the sanitary dressing and process controls cattle slaughter establishments employ in their food safety systems. Such controls are likely to include decontamination and antimicrobial intervention treatments. Establishments should verify {{the effectiveness of these}} controls by sampling and testing for microorganisms of beef manufacturing trimmings, other raw ground beef components (including head meat and <b>cheek</b> <b>meat),</b> and raw ground beef...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was concerned with}} the up-grading of: (i) connective tissue material {{in the form of}} beef membrane, pig rind and turkey skin; (ii) muscle material from low-value cuts and from offals such as beef heart; (iii) heart muscle, by extrusion processing; (i) An emulsified material from beef membrane and beef replaced up to 5 % of lean meat in corn beef and up to 10 % in beefburgers without impairing cooked yield and eating quality. A collagen emulsion paste (CEP) from pig rind replaced up to 5 % of lean meat in ham prepared from diced meat, and between 2 and 5 % in ham prepared from whole muscles without reduction in cooked yield, texture, appearance and eating quality. Turkey skin was minced, chopped and incorporated at 10, 15 and 20 % levels in a mix with turkey leg meat, which was used to make battered and breaded re-formed steaklets. Steaks containing up to 20 % of emulsified skin were similar to control samples in flavour, juiciness and overall acceptability. An antioxidant may be required to prevent rancidity during frozen storage. (ii) Yields of surimi-like material, prepared by water-extraction, sieving and centrifuging, were 16 % from lean of topside of beef (used as control for comparison), 39 % from beef heart, 17 % from pork mechanically recovered meat, 11 % from beef weasand and less than 5 % from beef <b>cheek</b> <b>meat.</b> The beef heart surimi was studied for its gelation properties and for its performance as an ingredient replacing lean meat in frankfurters and in beefburgers at levels between 3 and 15 %. In frankfurters the addition of the surimi reduced cook loss and increased tenderness. For overall eating quality the frankfurters with 7 or 10 % of surimi were preferable, and those with 15 % equal, to those with none. In beefburgers cook loss was decreased from 32 to 25 % by the addition of 15 % surimi. Other results were similar to those for frankfurters, showing that the surimi could be added at 10 to 15 % level without impairing texture or flavour. (iii) Cold extrusion processing of beef heart muscle with the aim of increasing its functionality showed that gelation properties of the material were not improved by extrusion compared to bowl chopping; moreover, the extruded product had a strong odour and dark colour.
