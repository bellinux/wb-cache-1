5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to <b>construct</b> <b>and</b> identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, counting symmetry is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E

MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope.

After the West Side failure, the Jets and Giants entered into a joint venture to build a new $1.6billion facility alongside Giants Stadium, which was torn down after the new venue was completed.

5|$|The {{figure of}} St. Ninian, {{traditionally}} credited with introducing Christianity {{to the region}} of south-west Scotland, is now widely regarded as a later <b>construct</b> <b>and</b> {{may have been the}} result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian. The church known as Candida Casa was dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, which would extend an influence across the Strathclyde region. However, it is clear that Christianity had already gained a foothold across what is now southern Scotland before the sixth century.|$|E

Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future.

5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to <b>construct</b> <b>and</b> only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
5|$|Another {{link between}} Europe and the Mongols was {{attempted}} in 1290, when the Genoese endeavored {{to assist the}} Mongols with naval operations. The plan was to <b>construct</b> <b>and</b> man two galleys to attack Mamluk ships in the Red Sea, and operate a blockade of Egypt's trade with India. As the Genoese were traditional supporters of the Mamluks, this was {{a major shift in}} policy, apparently motivated by the attack of the Egyptian Sultan Qalawun on the Cilician Armenians in 1285. To build and man the fleet, a squadron of 800 Genoese carpenters, sailors and crossbowmen went to Baghdad, working on the Tigris. However, due to a feud between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Genoese soon degenerated into internal bickering, and killed each other in Basra, putting an end to the project. Genoa finally cancelled the agreement and signed a new treaty with the Mamluks instead.|$|E

The ESWPP <b>constructs</b> <b>and</b> dimensions were then validated by content experts from academic institutions. Finally, the findings were analyzed using the Fleiss Kappa reliability analysis to determine the overall approval index for each of the ESWPP <b>constructs</b> <b>and</b> dimensions. Results of the analysis revealed an overall Kappa coefficient value of 0. 989 which indicated a very good level of agreement. The ESWPP <b>constructs</b> <b>and</b> dimensions which were found to be job performance predictors were communication skills, personal qualities, teamwork skills, critical thinking and problem solving skills, technology skills, organizational skills, and continuously learning skills...|$|R
