40|$|The {{organism}} {{for which}} the species name godboldi is proposed is a small flagellate protozoon of the order Pantastomatida (Calkins, 1926). The genus contains one other species, alternans, described by Lemmer mann (1914). The writer is unaware of any cytological work on any descriptive work on the genus other than that of Lemmermann. The form herein alluded to developed in large numbers from a culture of raw sewage from the Plainfield, New Jersey, sewage dis posal plant. A 1 cc. sample of sewage was inoculated into a Petri dish containing 10 cc. of the wheat medium used frequently by the writer (Lackey, 1927).

Pyxidium tardigradum n. sp. on Hypsibius oberhaeuseri (Doy.). on 27 June 1961 from a rock in the department Haute Savoie and had been preserved in a dry condition for nearly fifteen months. After washing, living specimens of three different species of Tardigrada (Hypsibius oberhaeuseri (Doyère), Macrobiotus hufelandii Schultze and Echiniscus spec. were found, together with some eggs of Hypsibius oberhaeuseri and Macrobiotus hufelandii, {{a small number of}} Rotatoria and some dead Oribatid Acari. About twenty Protozoa appeared to be attached to one of the specimens of Hypsibius oberhaeuseri (fig. 1). It was thought of interest to study these protozoan symphorionts. OBSERVATIONS At first the identity of the epizoa could not be determined as they were contracted and in an inactive state. Only nuclei were visible in the cells. The Tardigrade to which these Protozoa were attached, at first was alive; the foremost part of its body was contracted, but the legs moved. The animal was kept in the cavity of a slide partly covered by a <b>cover-glass.</b> The <b>cover-glass</b> was glued to the slide so that it could be placed vertically in a glass-tube with water. This is an easy way to keep such open slides for several days, while the object can be studied regularly, even with oil immersion. After one day the Tardigrade did not move any more but in one of the Protozoa a pulsating contractile-vacuole could be seen. A day later contractile-vacuoles were visible in three or four specimens and two specimen...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous aggregations of flagellates {{are formed}} under the <b>cover-glass</b> because the organisms are {{attracted}} to and remain in regions where the concentration of dissolved oxygen {{is less than the}} saturation concentration under atmospheric partial pressure. These regions of lessened oxygen content arise towards the center of the liquid beneath the <b>cover-glass,</b> owing to the oxygen consumed by the flagellates in respiration not being replaced here by the solution of atmospheric oxygen, as it is along the edges of the liquid. The flagellates, however, are insensitive to the attraction of regions of lessened oxygen concentration when the oxygen concentration throughout the liquid is above a certain value. Therefore, for the aggregations to form, either the initial concentration of dissolved oxygen must be below this limiting value, or an interval of time must first elapse after the making of the preparation until the respiration of the organisms has reduced the oxygen concentration throughout the liquid down to this limiting value. The aggregations will then form because the flagellates have become positively chemotropic to the lower concentration of oxygen {{at the center of the}} liquid. Once established, such an aggregation of flagellates does not remain long in the same form. An area free from flagellates appears at the center of the aggregation so that the organisms lie in a circular band surrounding the clear area. The latter increases in size and its bordering band of flagellates in diameter, the band gradually becoming less circular and more square in shape, if the <b>cover-glass</b> is a square one. The clear central area is a region where the oxygen consumption of the flagellates has reduced the oxygen content to such a low value that the organisms are forced to leave the region. They collect in a band where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is an optimum for them. It is the equilibrium position between the oxygen consumed at the center and that diffusing in from the edges of the liquid. As the consumption at the center is more rapid than the replacement from the edge, the flagellate band moves outwards until it becomes stationary at a position where the rates of consumption and replacement of oxygen are equal. Although the flagellates collect in this manner in regions of optimum oxygen concentration, yet greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen have no injurious effect on them. Concentrations of dissolved oxygen lower than the optimum have the effect of inhibiting the movement of the flagellates. They recover their activity, however, immediately they are given access to dissolved oxygen again. Work done in the past on chemotropism of flagellates will have to be revised in the light of the above facts, since the oxygen content of solutions used has never been taken into account...|$|E

Patterned graft of PIPAAm onto PS dishes {{was carried out by}} electron beam irradiation using <b>cover-glass</b> as a photomask. PVLA was only coated onto PIPAAm-ungrafted domain because of hydrated hydrophilic property of PIPAAm at below the LCST.

PIPAAm-grafted surface exhibited decreasing contact angle by changing temperature from 37 to 20 °C, while PVLA-coated PS and non-treated PS had negligible contact angle changes with temperature alternation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) results showed that PIPAAm-grafted and PVLA-coated PS had smoother surfaces than that of ungrafted PS dishes. After culture for 12 hours, hepatocytes were well attached on PVLA-coated domain. Hepatocytes adherent on PIPAAm-grafted domain were detached by decreasing temperature.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with quantitative aspects of the disk-sphere transformation of the mammalian red cell produced by lecithin (Ponder, 1935 a). This shape transformation, brought about when lecithin is added to mammalian red cells in saline or in plasma, and reversed by washing off the lecithin or by adding an excess of plasma, is very suitable for quantitative study, since, unlike the shape transformations produced by rose bengal and other lysins, it is not soon followed by haemolysis. Exact work on the factors involved, however, has been very difficult, for two reasons. (1) An unrelated disk-sphere transformation occurs whe"n red cells in saline, whether lecithin-treated or not, are placed between a slide and a closely applied <b>cover-glass</b> (Ponder, 1929), and so {{it has not been}} possible to examine the lecithin shape transformation of the cells in saline except in uncovered preparations or in hanging drops.

Two types of elements were designed, to operate at wavelengths of 1. 52 mu m and 0. 633 mu m.

40|$|Fibrin polymerizes {{into the}} fibrous network {{that is the}} major {{structural}} component of blood clots and thrombi. We demonstrate that fibrin from three different species can also spontaneously polymerize into extensive, molecularly thin, 2 D sheets. Sheet assembly occurs in physiologic buffers on both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, but is routinely observed only when polymerized using very low concentrations of fibrinogen and thrombin. Sheets may have been missed in previous studies because they may be very short-lived at higher concentrations of fibrinogen and thrombin, and their thinness makes them very difficult to detect. We were able to distinguish fluorescently labeled fibrin sheets by polymerizing fibrin onto micro-patterned structured surfaces that suspended polymers 10 μm above and parallel to the <b>cover-glass</b> surface. We used a combined fluorescence/atomic force microscope system to determine that sheets were ≈ 5 nm thick, flat, elastic and mechanically continuous. Video microscopy of assembling sheets showed that they could polymerize across 25 -μm channels at hundreds of μm 2 /sec (≈ 1013 subunits/s·M), an apparent rate constant many times greater than those of other protein polymers. Structural transitions from sheets to fibers were observed by fluorescence, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy. Sheets appeared to fold and roll up into larger fibers, and also to develop oval holes to form fiber networks that were “pre-attached” to the substrate and other fibers.

40|$|The {{dark-field}} microscope {{may be used}} to observe directly the characteristics of composite films. The liquid phases, one or both of them containing suspended solid particles as test objects (in these experiments bacteria were used), are spread between slide and <b>cover-glass</b> and examined with any desired lenses. The liquid-liquid interfaces appear as bright lines and the solid particles as shining motes. An interfacial kinetic mechanism has been observed in films of all composition studied. The bacteria are transported along the phase boundary lines in a striking and characteristic manner and quite independently of movements in the adjoining organic or aqueous phases. These movements in the interface are interpreted as essentially due, according to the composition of the films, to local inequalities in interfacial surface tension, or to minute currents from mixing of the two phases across and along their boundary line, or to both forces acting together. The bacteria (non-motile in these experiments) reached the interface by brownian movement or currents or shifts in the position of the boundary line. Once in the interface they tended to remain, and accumulated there, in instances where the liquid-liquid interfacial tension was high at least, in higher concentration than in the contiguous phases. Bacteria could, however, escape from the interface {{in a variety of ways}} detailed above. With liquids which differ markedly in interfacial tension and miscibility with water, these properties may be correlated with the characteristics of the preparation. With cyclohexane-water films, for instance, (immiscible, interfacial tension high), the boundary was less readily drawn out into projections, the interfacial trapping mechanism was more efficient, and brownian movement of bacteria in the interface was less free than with cyclohexanol-water films (miscible, interfacial tension low).

Shortly afterwards Fricke (1934) gave a theoretical treatment of the subject, and showed that for a completely permeable membrane the time for the hemoglobin to decrease to 10 per cent of its original concentration should be 0. 16 second {{in the case of the}} human erythrocyte. The longer times (several seconds) observed when moderate concentrations of saponin are used must accordingly correspond to a state of partial permeability, and in view of the results of the theoretical treatment it is desirable to have complete experimental data. With these this paper is concerned. Methods Human red ceils were used because of their large size, and the rate of escape of the pigment was found, as before, by taking moving pictures of the fading cells and making measurements on the films. In order to get a large number of cells per frame, the magnification was only 264 instead of 860, as in the preliminary measurements, and more attention was paid to obtaining good contrast than to having a high degree of resolution with its attendant disadvantage of small depth of focus.

40|$|Usually the {{diagnosis}} of the infected chickens with leucocytozoon disease has been made by finding gametocyte of Leucocytozoon caulleryi in the blood smear stained by Giemsa's or May-Grunwald's method. But, as the inner part of the gametocyte {{can be observed in}} the unstained wet film of blood, the feature of the gametocyte considerably differs from that of the fixed sample. Method: One drop of blood from an affected chicken is placed on a <b>cover-glass.</b> This is inverted on a slide and the preparation is rimmed with paraffin. Then it is examined with phase-contrast microscopy at 37 ℃. Results and considerations: In macrogametocyte, the nucleus is rather small, usually have a curved or twisted rod shape and is suspended in protoplasm. The protoplasm is rich and filled with the immense number of fine granules. But in an usual smear sample, the nucleus shrinks and is covered with the granules at the time of smearing, and yet the granules are stained in dark purple by Giemsa's method, and hence it is considered that the shape of the nucleus is obscured. In microgametocyte, the nucleus is globular or oval, rather large in size compared with the size of the gametocyte itself, and placed at the nearly central point of the cell. The granules of protoplasm are a little larger in size and less in number than that of the macrogametocyte, and as the most of the granules are attached around the nucleus, these look like a pearl necklace in an optical section. As the nucleus expands at the time of smearing, it extends on nearly the whole surface of gametocyte and the protoplasm is seen indistinctly around it. As the granules are attached to the nucleus, they scatter {{on the surface of the}} nucleus as it expands. Most of the macro- and microgametocyte are covered with the membrane of the host cell. These cell membranes contain semifluid thinner than the protoplasm of the parasite. Some of which contain the granules of various sizes and they present the vivid Brownian motion. But these granules cannot be stained with Giemsa's dye...|$|E
40|$|This report {{gives an}} outline {{of the results of}} {{observations}} on over 1, 100 tissue cultures made during the fall, winter, and spring of 1913 to 1914. The work has been resumed in the fall of 1914 and will be continued along the same and allied lines, confirming the above results with other strains of the same organisms and with other bacteria and bacterial products. Tests should be made with tissue and plasma from other animals, and the known pathogenicity of the organism for the animal and tissue used should always be borne in mind. We {{hope to be able to}} grow on these cultures some of the more strictly parasitic bacteria not developing on ordinary media, as other strict parasites have been grown by other workers, viz., poliomyelitis virus by Levaditi (4), vaccinia by Steinhardt, Israeli, and Lambert (5), and rabies by Moon (6). By comparative studies with various types of cells and various natural and artificial media, clearer ideas as to the exact part of cell plasma in antibody production, by elaborating on the methods of Carrel and Ingebrigtsen (7), Lüdke (8), Przygode (9), and others, should be possible. After this work was begun a reference was found to the use of some pathogenic bacteria in tissue cultures by Pheiler and Lentz (10), but no publication of the results of these observations has been observed. The results here reported may be summarized as follows: Bactericidal Action of Chicken Plasma. —On Bacillus typhosus, very strong—never grows in plasma alone; on Bacillus prodigiosus, very strong—never grows in plasma alone; on Bacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, strong—slight growth in <b>cover-glass</b> preparations; on Bacterium diphtheriticum, moderately strong; on Bacillus coli verus, slight; on Micrococcus aureus, very slight or none. A few pseudodiphtheria bacilli and more diphtheria bacilli survived in plasma stored in the cold for four days. The presence of growing tissue overcomes the bactericidal influence of plasma on diphtheria bacilli and in some instances on pseudodiphtheria bacilli. Bacterium diphtheriticum grows in plasma without tissue only if inoculations are very heavy; and very heavy inoculations of all organisms will probably overcome the bactericidal action of plasma, as it is undoubtedly a quantitative reaction. The bactericidal influence of plasma is overcome by exposure to incubator temperature for twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Bacterium diphtheriticum in light or moderate inoculations grows in tissue cultures only in clusters around the tissue fragments, and never in plasma away from tissue. The growth of this organism has a decided inhibitory influence on tissue activity and growth, especially marked with nervous tissue, but this action may be overcome by the addition of antitoxin to the plasma. Cultures inhibited by diphtheria growth have a tendency to resume growth later, probably due to antitoxin production. Bacterium pseudodiphtheriticum is distinctly less active in tissue cultures than is Bacterium diphtheriticum and never develops in plasma without tissue. The presence of diphtheria toxin in tissue cultures causes this organism to behave as does Bacterium diphtheriticum. Without toxin it has little or no direct influence on tissue growth except in massive doses. Bacillus prodigiosus fails to develop, as a rule, in tissue cultures except where inoculated from hypertonic media, and then it has no decided influence on tissue growth. Micrococcus aureus grows freely in these cultures with or without tissue, and inhibits tissue growth markedly, except as noted with splenic tissue. Bacillus coli verus always grows freely with or without tissue fragments and is uninfluenced by splenic tissue growth. In heavy inoculations it lessens tissue growth. Bacillus typhosus, except with extremely heavy inoculations, fails absolutely to grow in these cultures with or without plasma, unless the bactericidal action of the plasma has been destroyed by incubation. When this is the case it develops freely with especial affinity for the tissue cells either for support or nourishment. It appears to have no toxic action on the tissue cells. Note the sharp differentiation between typhoid and coli verus organisms. Diphtheria toxin has a quantitatively inhibiting action on all tissue growth and on heart tissue pulsations, the action being greatest on nervous tissue and least on heart tissue growth. Tissues affected by toxin tend to recovery if not killed. Antitoxin counteracts the action of toxin. Splenic tissue has little or no effect on the growth of Bacillus coli verus, but has a decided bactericidal action on Bacterium diphtheriticum and Micrococcus aureus, probably due to lymphatic cells and cell products, as seen by the area of cell migration coinciding with the bacteria-free area, by the similar action of splenic extract on cultures, and by the failure of such action in cultures of very early splenic tissue showing no lymphatic cells...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} thirty years, {{microchips}} have doubled in complexity every two years. This increasing complexity required {{that the size of}} the structures written on silicon halve at the same rate. A fundamentally limiting factor to the size of microchip structures is the wavelength of the lithographic projection processes used in their manufacture. Consequently, the wavelengths used to produce microchips have shrunk from 436 nm, at the boundary of the visible spectrum, to 193 nm, in the ultraviolet, between 1975 and 2002. A next generation process aims to use light with a wavelength of 13 nm, in what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). Unlike previous processes, which could use lens systems to project the required patterns onto the microchips, EUVL requires the use of mirror projection systems. The mirrors used are highly aspheric and must be manufactured with unprecedented accuracies, of the order of 0. 1 nm. There are currently no affordable and easy to use systems to measure such mirrors with the required accuracy in optical workshops during manufacture. While the primary push for the development of such a measurement tool has come from the semiconductor industry, {{there are a number of}} other technology branches which could benefit from increased reflector accuracies. These include astronomy at ultra-short wavelengths, plasma physics, and biological microscopy. This thesis describes the construction and use of a novel interferometer to accurately measure the shape of such EUVL mirror substrates. Since tools to measure the surface roughness of these mirrors are readily available, we are concentrating on the measurement of spatial frequencies below 1 mm- 1 for the entire mirror surface. The main advantages of our interferometer over competing instruments are its independence from reference optics, which could introduce significant errors in other types of interferometers, its ability to measure the whole surface of most EUVL optics in one go and the possibility of using a more accurate type of interferometry - heterodyne interferometry - instead of the usual phase stepping. In contrast with a number of methods already available, this instrument is suitable for use in optical workshops, both in terms of cost and ease of use. Although the accuracy of 4 nm reported here for our preliminary measurements falls short of the desired accuracy of 0. 1 nm, several improvements not yet implemented are likely to improve the accuracy of the instrument to desired levels. The most significant source of error at this time is believed to be the sensor. A sensor designed specifically to meet the requirements of our interferometer was still under development at the time of writing. In constructing the interferometer presented here, advances have been made in a number of fields: The novel nature of the interferometer required the development of a unique mathematical tool - an inverse propagation algorithm - to retrieve the shape of the surface under test from the measurement data. This has been achieved using a combination of analytic raytracing and numerical diffraction methods based on the idea of boundary diffracted waves, to obtain a good balance between computational speed and accuracy. A rigorous method for diffraction calculations was also developed and used to confirm the accuracy of the fast hybrid method finally used in the inverse propagation algorithm. The light source constructed is capable of providing a stable set of wavelengths which can be used to perform full-field multiple wavelength heterodyne interferometry at three wavelengths simultaneously. In the absence of a suitable sensor, the light source can also be used to perform sequential multiple wavelength interferometry using phase shifting methods. To ensure a minimum susceptibility to drift and vibrations, several optical mounting structures were re-designed from scratch. The custom designed mounts have been shown to outperform commercially available mounts. Two different types of sensors were tested and compared. A commercially available CCD sensor already allowed us to make measurements coming close to the desired accuracy by using calibration techniques to reduce the influence of a number of systematic error sources. A recently developed sensor, with phase-measuring active pixels, was used to demonstrate new approaches to interferometry: full-field heterodyne interferometry, as well as the beat frequency de-multiplexing of multiple wavelengths, allowing interferometry at several wavelengths simultaneously. An interferometer frame, which allows the stable placement of the mirror and various other components, has been designed and constructed entirely from invar to ensure optimum immunity against temperature fluctuations. Theoretical models were used to show that substrates with numerical apertures as large as 0. 26 may be measured with the desired accuracy, limited only by the optical fibers used. Measurements carried out on the optical fibers showed that the sphericity of the wave fronts produced was in agreement with our theoretical models. By tapering and polishing the fiber ends, it may be possible to measure optics with even larger numerical apertures. Preliminary measurements of a test substrate, performed using phase shifting techniques and a standard CCD, yielded promising results. The measurement resulted in a retrieved mirror shape within 4. 2 nm rms of the nominal mirror shape, and an even smaller deviation from the mirror shape as measured by conventional interferometry techniques. The three main factors thought to limit the instrument's accuracy are the non-uniformity of the features on the CCD, the presence of a <b>cover-glass</b> on the sensor and insufficient a-priori knowledge of the relative positions of the interferometer components. All of these factors can be overcome or reduced, leading to measurements with the required accuracy in the foreseeable future. The result will be an ultra-precise metrology instrument suitable for use in optical workshops. Applied Science...|$|E
