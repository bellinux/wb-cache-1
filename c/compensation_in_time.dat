30|$|Correction of CFO {{has been}} largely {{documented}} for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [5] and FBMC [6]. A coarse CFO <b>compensation</b> <b>in</b> the <b>time</b> domain is necessary prior to a phase tracking in the frequency domain in order to limit ICI. As a different level of frequency offset is associated with each user, these solutions require as many receivers as users and are not suitable for practical implementation. Alternative signal processing methods for CFO <b>compensation</b> <b>in</b> the frequency domain should be developed. Iterative ICI cancellation has been proposed through iterative inversion techniques [7] or turbo processing [8] but is extremely complex to implement. The authors of [9] proposed an interesting method {{in the context of}} an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink network. This method compensates CFO after fast Fourier transform (FFT) using a circular convolution. A good trade-off between performance and complexity is demonstrated. A low complexity CFO compensation method for FBMC - FDMA based on this method has been investigated in this paper.|$|R

Although the absolute coordinates of local tracks from the same target are severely different in the presence of sensor biases, their structural features may be similar. As a result, instead of using the absolute kinematic states only, we employee the structural similarity to define the association cost. When there are missed detections, the structural similarity between local tracks is evaluated by solving another 2 D assignment subproblem.

30|$|In this paper, for a {{class of}} linear {{networked}} iterative learning control (ILC) systems, methods to compensate dropped input data in time or iteration domain are compared. Specifically, the transition matrices of input error at the controller side with the two methods are derived first, respectively. After that, the varieties of eigenvalues and elements in the lower triangular of the transition matrices are analyzed. Through analyzing the varieties, it can be easily found that the two methods guarantee the convergence of input error at the controller side, while only the compensation in iteration domain guarantees the convergence of input error at the actuator side. Due {{to the introduction of}} networks, the convergence of output error is determined by the input error at the actuator side. Hence, a conclusion could be made naturally that the output error converges to zero with compensation in iteration domain, while <b>compensation</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> domain cannot guarantee that.

40|$|In {{industrial}} applications, many {{tasks are}} repetitive. Iterative learning controllers are effective for tracking control in these repetitive tasks. This thesis addresses the tracking control problem of low-bandwidth systems with the Fourier series based iterative Learning Control scheme (FLC). With {{the existence of}} flexible parts and slow response, {{the performance of a}} low-bandwidth system is usually unsatisfactory. The main objective {{of this study is to}} develop the FLC for applications in low-bandwidth systems. In this thesis, the FLC is developed with three improvements: (i) backlash <b>compensation</b> <b>in</b> the <b>time</b> domain parallel to the FLC; (ii) phase-shifting compensation; and (iii) auto-tuning learning gains. Backlash compensation is carried out <b>in</b> the <b>time</b> domain to reduce backlash effects in tracking control. To improve the performance while maintaining the stability with the FLC, phase-shifting should be compensated in the learning process. An algorithm for phase-shifting calculation and compensation is proposed. For a nonlinear system, it is difficult to find learning gains to meet the convergence condition. The auto-tuning gain method is proposed in this thesis to solve the problem in choosing learning gains. Experimental results show the efficiency of the improved FLC in application for a low-bandwidth belt-driven system. To make full use of existing friction in mechanical systems, a newly designed asymmetrical trajectory is proposed. A method of using the FLC for system identification with eliminating quantization error in measurement is also proposed...|$|R

40|$|After {{describing}} qualitatively {{the increasingly}} flexible organization of work hours in Germany, I {{turn to the}} German Socio-Economic Panel to quantify practices and trends, and assess their effects on workers and employers. Measuring flexibility as {{the extent to which}} overtime is compensated with time off, and hence receives no overtime premium, I show that hourly{paid workers have undergone a regime shift towards more flexibility since 1984, while salaried workers have maintained an already high level of flexibility. I find weak evidence that flexibility causes workers to be slightly less satisfied with their work and more satisfied with their leisure. Over the boom and bust cycle of 2004 - 2009, I find that for hourly-paid workers in manufacturing, paid and unpaid overtime hours were equally cyclical, but that the cycle for unpaid overtime led the cycle for paid overtime. The results suggest that while the new practices do free employers to make more cyclical adjustments in hours, they have not eliminated the need for adjustments in paid overtime.

40|$|Since {{restoration}} of motor function in walking and stance {{is an important}} aspect in the rehabilitation of stroke patients, insight in the responsible recovery mechanisms is of great importance. Generally, two recovery mechanisms are distinguished: restitution and compensation. In restitution, the increase in motor function is attributed to a return of original movements and or function of the paretic leg, whereas in compensation the increase in motor function is ascribed {{to the emergence of}} new movement strategies or to secondary adaptations in the non paretic leg to compensate for the decreased motor abilities in the paretic leg. To assess the contribution of the different mechanisms in the recovery of motor function, we need to develop appropriate methods to quantify restitution and <b>compensation</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> Besides, the contributions of the separate recovery mechanisms can also be derived from the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions that focus specifically on using original movement patterns (restitution) or alternative movement strategies (compensation). Robotic rehabilitation devices can well be used in emphasizing the use of certain movement strategies during training, as they can support the movements of the subject during practicing. However, practicing compensatory strategies in the device is only possible if the mechanical design of the device allows for it and if the control of the device provides the flexibility to the subjects in choosing their movement strategy. The latter requires the implementation of “assist-as-needed” algorithms that only provide assistance to the subject when it is needed to successfully fulfill the task...|$|E

30|$|As to data compensation, this {{approach}} can be further divided into two categories: time domain compensation and iteration domain compensation. The former {{is similar to the}} typical method to handle data dropout in general NCSs, which used input data at time instant t- 1 to compensate the lost one at time instant t during kth iteration. Pan earlier considered a class of ILC systems via networks with communication delay and data dropouts first [21]. In the discussion, an event-driven model was used, which implies the dropped data is compensated in time domain. Through the analysis of a variety of element values in the transition matrix of input vector, convergence of the networked ILC systems with data dropout <b>compensation</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> domain was improved. Moreover, this method was then adopted by [22] to consider the problem of ILC over networks for a class of nonlinear systems with random packet dropouts in inputs and outputs simultaneously. This paper proved that under some given conditions, the ILC can guarantee the convergence of the tracking error although some packets are missing. The latter applies the data at the (k- 1)th iteration to compensate the dropped one at the kth iteration at the same time instant t, which was first used by [23]. In this paper, a discrete-time linear ILC system with random input data dropouts was considered. The convergence property of output error was proved by analyzing the element values of system transition matrix. Similar compensation methods were used to deal with the effect of delay or data dropout in input and/or output data of different networked ILC systems in [24, 25].|$|E

40|$|The {{integral}} nonlinearity (INL) is {{used for}} the postcorrection of analog-digital converters (ADCs). An input-frequency-dependent INL model is developed for the postcorrection. The model consists of a static term that is dependent on the ADC output code and a dynamic term that has an additional dependence on the input frequency. The concept of ADC digital output postcorrection by INL is first introduced. The INL model is subtracted from the digital output for postcorrection. The static compensation part is made by adjacent sets of gains and offsets, where each set corrects a range of output codes. The dynamic information, i. e., the frequency dependence of the INL dynamic component is used to construct a set of filter blocks that performs ADC <b>compensation</b> <b>in</b> the <b>time</b> domain. The compensation scheme is applied to the measured data of two ADCs of the same type (Analog Devices AD 9430). Performance improvements in terms of spurious-free dynamic range, signal-to-noise and distortion ratio, intermodulation distortion, and noise are obtained. The dynamic compensation part, due to its frequency dependence, can be generalized; hence, a postcorrection block model can be used for compensating multiple ADCs of the same type.
