Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston was stumped from Wright's leg spin. Yardley was later criticised for not bringing Wright into the attack at an earlier stage, as the Australian tail were dealing well with the English pacemen.

5|$|In 1976, a Gullfisk lost <b>control</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{line and}} derailed near Sjømansskolen, causing the tram to be scrapped. From 1977, Oslo Sporveier also put SM53 trams into service.

Instead, used MBG trams from the Gothenburg Tramway were put into service. The section from Sæter to Ljabru had since the opening had a signaling system that had worked fine with 15- and 20-minute headways, but did not work properly with 10-minute routes. A new system was installed, and proved to work just as poorly as the old system. During 1979, the section was rebuilt to double track, although the short bridge over Nordstrandsveien was kept single tracked.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to inflicting significant casualties on Indonesian forces, the successful Australian ambushes on the Sungei Koemba, and later at Kindau, in May and June allowed 3 RAR {{to dominate the}} border area, while also providing early warning of Indonesian incursions into Sarawak. Following these actions Major General George Lea, the British Director of Operations, ordered a short pause in offensive operations in order to observe the effects. Indonesian mortar attacks on company bases in the 3 RAR area of operation, which had been heavy throughout May and June, ceased soon afterwards. Following the resumption of Claret operations the Australian battalion later followed this up with another profitable mission at Babang on 12 July, contributing to the wider success of the British-Commonwealth forces in slowly asserting <b>control</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E

Kinh had previously been affiliated with the VNQDĐ, whose members took him away. His wife had tried to follow him, so the VNQDĐ captured her as well. French intelligence reports speculated that Kinh had been killed because he would not join his former colleagues. Nhu then led his men through Lâm Thao. The plan was that they would help to consolidate the other unit's <b>control</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town until the afternoon. They were hopeful that the attack in Yên Bái would have been successfully completed by then, and that the mutineers and people of Yên Bái would come to Lâm Thao and stage their forces before attacking the barracks at Phu Tho.

It featured steep gradients on the line up to Royton Junction, which, in October 1908, caused an accident when a goods train ran out of <b>control</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gradient down to the station, killing a fireman. In February 1961, a four-coach runaway train crashed through the buffers at Royton railway station and continued on over High Barn Street. Five houses were damaged.

5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor <b>control,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same side of the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E

The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing {{the same level of}} control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E

With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire.

Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E
