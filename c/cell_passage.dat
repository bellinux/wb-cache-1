5000|$|The {{clock is}} defined as an age {{estimation}} method based on 353 epigenetic markers on the DNA. The 353 markers measure DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides. Estimated age ("predicted age" [...] in mathematical usage), {{also referred to as}} DNA methylation age, has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues (which are used as human analogs for biological testing purposes). Organismal growth (and concomitant cell division) leads to a high ticking rate of the epigenetic clock that slows down to a constant ticking rate (linear dependence) after adulthood (age 20).The fact that DNA methylation age of blood predicts all-cause mortality in later life even after adjusting for known risk factors [...] suggests that it relates to a process that causes aging. Similarly, markers of physical and mental fitness are associated with the epigenetic clock (lower abilities associated with age acceleration).|$|E
5000|$|Horvath's {{development}} of the DNA methylation based age estimation method known as epigenetic clock was featured in Nature magzine.In 2011 Horvath co-authored the first article that described an age estimation method based on DNA methylation levels from saliva. In 2013 Horvath published a single author article on a multi-tissue age estimation method that applies to call nucleated cells, tissues, and organs. This discovery, known as the Horvath clock, was unexpected because cell types differ {{in terms of the}} their DNA methylation patterns and age related DNA methylation changes tend to be tissue specific. In his article, he demonstrated that estimated age, also referred to as DNA methylation age, has the following properties: it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, it correlates with <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> number; it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and it is applicable to chimpanzees. Since the Horvath clock allows one to contrast the ages of different tissues from the same individuals, {{it can be used to}} identify tissues that show evidence of increased or decreased age. Horvath co-authored the first articles demonstrating that DNAm age predicts life-expectancy [...] and is positively associated with obesity, HIV infection, Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, cognitive decline, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, early menopause, Werner syndrome. Using genome-wide association studies, his team identified the first genetic markers (SNPs) that exhibit genome-wide significant associations with epigenetic aging rates.He proposed that slower epigenetic aging rates could explain the mortality advantage of women and the Hispanic mortality paradox.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of infectious measles virus released from latently infected hamster embryo fibroblast cells are described. Low levels of virus were released spontaneously when the cultures were incubated at 37 C; this phenomenon was observed 19 passages after the cells {{had been exposed}} to the virus and has continued through <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> 45. The virus yield could be significantly increased by cocultivation of the hamster cells with BSC- 1 cells or incubation of the latently infected cells at 33. 5 C rather than at 37 C. Measles virus released after cocultivation demonstrated increased cytopathology in cell culture and reduced temperature sensitivity when compared to the virus released at 33. 5 C. After <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> 45, there was an increase in spontaneous release of virus. However, the viruses recovered by cocultivation or temperature release after <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> 45 were nearly identical. These observations suggest a possible mechanism for measles virus activation in cells latently infected with this virus...|$|E

However, there exist only a few in vitro models of both productive HPV infection and neoplastic progression on the same host background. We recently described a unique foreskin keratinocyte cell line (ERIN 59) that contains HPV 59 (a close relative of HPV 18). Early passages of ERIN 59 <b>cells</b> (<b>passages</b> 9 – 13) contained approximately 50 copies of episomes/cell, were feeder cell-dependent, and could be induced to differentiate and produce infectious virus in a simple culture system. We now report that late <b>passage</b> <b>cells</b> (<b>passages</b> greater than 50) were morphologically different from early <b>passage</b> <b>cells,</b> were feeder cell independent, and did not differentiate or produce virus. These late <b>passage</b> <b>cells</b> contained HPV in an integrated form.

Despite a lower viral genome copy number in late <b>passage</b> ERIN 59 <b>cells,</b> expression of E 6 /E 7 oncogene transcripts was similar to early <b>passage</b> <b>cells.</b> We conclude that ERIN 59 cells are a valuable cell line representing a model of progression from HPV 59 episomal infection and virus production to HPV 59 integration and associated oncogenic transformation on the same host background...|$|R

Positive outcomes were obtained after transplantation of neurally induced MSCs in laboratory animals after nerve injury, but this is unknown in horses.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that resistance and susceptibility to the 402 AX testicular teratocarcinoma are under genetic control in the mouse. Under normal culture conditions or when passaged in genetically susceptible hosts, the nullipotent 402 AX cells do not express H- 2 antigens. However, when passaged in genetically resistant animals, the tumor cells become strongly positive for H- 2 antigens in the absence of other indications of differentiation. These studies suggested that H- 2 antigen modulation on teratocarcinoma cells is mandatory for an effective host cell-mediated immune response against this tumor. The present studies further examine the role of H- 2 antigen modulation on teratocarcinoma cells and determine which host cell populations are mediating H- 2 modulation on the tumor cells. Reconstitution of lethally irradiated susceptible hosts with resistant bone marrow extends the mean survival time of the host but does not confer complete resistance. Teratocarcinoma <b>cells</b> <b>passaged</b> in such reconstituted hosts do not express H- 2 antigens. Two lines of evidence suggest that H- 2 antigen modulation is mediated by lymphoid cells: (i) sublethal irradiation of genetically resistant hosts inhibits H- 2 antigen modulation on teratocarcinoma <b>cells</b> <b>passaged</b> in vivo and (ii) immunological priming can overcome the loss of H- 2 modulation that is normally associated with aging in genetically resistant hosts. Genetically susceptible mice can be fully reconstituted for tumor rejection and H- 2 antigen expression on teratocarcinoma cells by reconstitution with genetically resistant bone marrow plus lymphoid cells from tumor-primed resistant hosts. These results: (i) imply the necessity for H- 2 antigens on tumor cells for an effective host cell-mediated immune response against the tumor, and (ii) indicate that host lymphoid cells regulate H- 2 antigen expression on tumor <b>cells</b> <b>passaged</b> in vivo...|$|R

The development of cell lines from the ixodid ticks has provided a valuable surrogate system for studying the biology of TBFVs in vitro. When we infected ISE 6 cells, an Ixodes scapularis embryonic cell line, with Langat virus (LGTV) we observed that the infection proceeded directly into persistence without any cytopathic effect.

In this study, <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> is suggested to be a relevant factor to eNOS expression under cigarette smoking stress. Methods Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were chosen as the research subject with passages ranking from 6 to 9 (6 P to 9 P). After exposure of cigarette smoking extract (CSE) solution, MTT assay and Western blot method were performed to check the cell viability as well as eNOS protein concentration. In these experiments, four concentrations of CSE at 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 % were selected for treatment. Results Our results showed that cells almost died at 4 % of CSE. Besides, eNOS protein mass had a linear decrease under the increase of CSE concentration. In addition, the effect of CSE on eNOS expression was dissimilar between different passages. Conclusions This study indicated that CSE had effect on both cell viability and eNOS expression. Besides, a reduction in protein mass was matched with the decrease of cell viability due to CSE tress. Last but not least, the response of eNOS protein to different concentration of CSE at different passages was disparate, making the hypothesis about <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> related inhibition of eNOS caused by CSE solution...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the influence of EMD on cells at different maturation stages of osteoblast differentiation by testing 6 cell types to determine if cell phenotype plays a role in cell behaviour following treatment with EMD. Six cell types including MC 3 T 3 -E 1 pre-osteoblasts, rat calvarial osteoblasts, human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells, ROS cells, MG 63 cells and human alveolar osteoblasts were cultured in the presence or absence of EMD and proliferation rates were quantified by an MTS assay. Gene expression of collagen 1 (COL 1), alkaline phosphate(ALP) and osteocalcin(OC) were investigated by real-time PCR. While EMD significantly increased cell proliferation of all cell types, its effect on osteoblast differentiation was more variable. EMD significantly up-regulated gene expression of COL 1, ALP and OC in cells early in their differentiation process when compared to osteoblasts at later stages of maturation. Furthermore, the effect of <b>cell</b> <b>passaging</b> of primary human PDL <b>cells</b> (<b>passage</b> 2 to 15) was tested in response to treatment with EMD.

Replication of these PR- 159 viruses and another strain of dengue- 2 virus adapted to Raji cells (16681 -Raji virus) was measured in adherent and nonadherent mononuclear cells. All viruses except the S- 1 PGMK virus replicated in monocytes. Occasional replication of the S- 1 PGMK virus was associated with reversion to parent virus. The addition to the monocyte cultures of low concentrations of homologous dengue- 2 antibody or non-neutralizing heterologous antibody increased the yield of the parent virus as much as 400 -fold. This phenomenon of immune enhancement usually enabled the S- 1 PGMK virus to replicate slowly in monocytes, but the progeny virus produced large plaques similar to the parent virus.

The decrease in invasive potential correlated with extension of elongated processes by the cells, which could hinder their motility. The increase in invasive potential at high seeding density correlated with an increase in enzymic activity of cell-associated plasminogen activator, which could facilitate degradation of the reconstituted basement membrane matrix in vitro, and with an alteration in morphology and F-actin distribution, which could render the cells more motile. Further studies exploring a possible mechanism for the differential growth response of RL 95 - 2 to EGF at high seeding density indicated that early and late <b>passage</b> <b>cells</b> differed in the number and affinity of EGF receptors. The late <b>passage</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited a 5 -fold increase in receptor number over early <b>passage</b> <b>cells</b> and had both high (K(d) of 4. 47 x 10 ⁻¹¹ M) and low affinity receptors (K(d) of 9. 37 x 10 ⁻⁹ M), while the early <b>passage</b> <b>cells</b> had only a single class of high affinity receptors (K(d) of 5. 67 x 10 ⁻¹⁰ M). Thus growth inhibition in the late passage RL 95 - 2 cells correlated with an increase in number of EGF receptors...|$|R
