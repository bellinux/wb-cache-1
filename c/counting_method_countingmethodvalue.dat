Several studies assessing the proliferative capacity of these neoplasms have been published, mainly using the protein Ki- 67. Cell counts must be completed to determine the cell proliferation rate.

The structural reliability assessment which incorporates structural health monitoring (SHM) data {{is capable of}} providing authentic information about in-service performance of the instrumented structure and accommodating uncertainties in the measurement data. Because the peak values of the measurands which illustrate the critical condition/status of the structure are random in nature, {{it is important to}} adopt appropriate statistical <b>counting</b> <b>methods</b> to extract favorable peak values for reliability assessment. Several algorithms, such as the sampling <b>method,</b> the peak <b>counting</b> <b>method,</b> and the pointwise <b>counting</b> <b>method,</b> have been proposed for peak counting. In the present study, different statistical <b>counting</b> <b>methods</b> for the selection of peak data targeted for SHM-based reliability assessment of instrumented bridges are examined and compared, through the application of the above methods for the purpose of constructing peak-stress histograms and formulating probability density functions by use of long-term strain monitoring data from an instrumented bridge.

Viable-population sizes determined {{from the number of}} cells that elongated when incubated with yeast extract and nalidixic acid were compared with those determined by the conventional plate <b>count</b> <b>method.</b> The plate <b>count</b> <b>method</b> accurately determined the number of viable cells in epiphytic P. syringae populations in a state of active growth under conditions of high relative humidity. The plate <b>count</b> <b>method</b> also accurately determined the number of viable cells in P. syringae inoculum, or a growing P. syringae population, subject to desiccation stress under conditions of low relative humidity. In epiphytic populations of P. syringae older than 80 h, however, the plate count underestimated the viable-population size by about two- to fourfold, suggesting that up to 75 % of the P. syringae population was nonculturable. These nonculturable cells may have entered a starvation-survival state, induced by low nutrient availability in the phyllosphere environment. Epiphytic P. syringae populations undergoing rapid size changes due to growth and death under fluctuating environmental conditions in the field should be accurately enumerated by the plate <b>count</b> <b>method.</b> However, the possible underestimation of viable-population size under some circumstances should be considered in epidemiological studies of phytopathogenic bacteria and when genetically engineered microorganisms in terrestrial ecosystems are monitored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Proteins are {{involved}} in many essential processes within cell. Uncovering the diverse function of proteins and their interactions within the cell may improve our understanding of protein functions. Several high-throughput techniques employed to decipher PPI are erroneous and are limited {{by the lack of}} coverage. Computational techniques are therefore sought to predict genome-wide PPI. In this paper, domain structure is used as a feature for computational prediction of PPI and support vector machines (SVM) as a learning system. We have used both, existing <b>method</b> and frequency <b>count</b> (FC) <b>method</b> for feature representation of protein domains and carried our experiment using SVM with different kernels. Both the methods achieved accuracy of about 78 % for RBF kernel. But frequency <b>count</b> <b>method</b> reduced the storage requirement by half. These results indicate that PPI can be predicted from domain structure using frequency <b>count</b> <b>method</b> with reliable accuracy and reduced storage requirement.
