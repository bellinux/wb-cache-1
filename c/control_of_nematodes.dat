To control nematodes, anti-nematicidal agents are used worldwide. These anti-nematicidal agents are very much toxic to human health and environment. Among these, root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp.) {{is one of the}} major pathogens that is widespread, most dangerous and difficult to control [13, 28, 53]. Mung (Vigna radiata) plants have been reported to be infected by different species <b>of</b> <b>nematodes</b> causing serious damage to plant yield worldwide [62]. Different measures for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>nematode</b> infection in plant have been applied by researchers such as soil amendment with oil cakes of neem, castor, mustard and other plant products for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> plant-parasitic <b>nematodes</b> [2, 3, 9, 32, 35, 50, 57, 61, 57]. The life cycle <b>of</b> <b>nematodes</b> consists <b>of</b> five stages, starting from eggs which develop into root-infecting J 2 juveniles that further invades host by attaching to its root and develop permanent feeding sites [51]. There was considerable decrease in root length, shoot length, fresh and dry weight of plants with increase in inoculum level <b>of</b> <b>nematodes</b> (Haseeb and Butool [19]; Pandey [42]). As a biological agent, chitinase can be used to degrade the nematode cell wall, which is made of chitin [6, 11]. With the use of actinomycetal chitinase as a potential weapon, it is comparatively easy to decrease root-knot nematode disease, which affects total yield, production and quality of crops.|$|R

In spite of various soil microorganisms acting as antagonists to root herbivores, it is still largely unknown whether plants can promote antagonistic microorganisms as an indirect defence mechanism. 2. In a greenhouse study we examined whether soil microorganisms could mediate plant defence against plant-feeding nematodes. Growth, nutrient contents and root exudation of three plant species (Plantago lanceolata, Holcus lanatus, Lotus corniculatus) {{and the performance of}} nematodes and fungal communities in the rhizospheres were measured. 3. The plant species differed in their effects on plant-feeding nematodes; however, the addition of soil microorganisms did not enhance nematode control. Nematode addition changed root exudation patterns and rhizosphere fungal community structure in a plant species-specific manner. Glucose levels in the root exudates of all three examined plant species were enhanced, and P. lanceolata root exudates contained higher levels of fumaric acid when nematodes had been added. 4.
