60|$|The {{impression}} I have of {{the present}} mental process in the European communities {{is that while the}} official class and the rentier class is thinking very poorly and inadequately and with a merely obstructive disposition; while the churches are merely wasting their energies in futile self-advertisement; while the labour mass is suspicious and disposed to make terms for itself rather than come into any large schemes of reconstruction that will abolish profit as a primary aim in economic life, there is still a very considerable movement towards such a reconstruction. Nothing is so misleading as a careless analogy. In the dead years that followed the Napoleonic wars, which are often quoted as a precedent for expectation now, the spirit of <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> was near its minimum; it was never so strong and never so manifestly spreading and increasing as it is to-day.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have my own}} {{very strong}} preconceptions here, and since my {{temperament}} is sanguine they necessarily colour my view. I believe that this impulse to <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> can satisfy itself only under the formula that mankind is one state of which God is the undying king, and that the service of men's collective needs is the true worship of God. But eagerly as I would grasp at any evidence that this idea is being developed and {{taken up by the}} general consciousness, I am quite unable to persuade myself that anything of the sort is going on. I do perceive a search for large forms into which the prevalent impulse to devotion can be thrown. But the organised religious bodies, with their creeds and badges and their instinct for self-preservation at any cost, stand between men and their spiritual growth in just the same way the forestallers stand between men and food. Their activities at present are an almost intolerable nuisance. One cannot say [...] "God" [...] but some tout is instantly seeking to pluck one into his particular cave of flummery and orthodoxy. What a rational man means by God is just God. The more you define and argue about God the more he remains the same simple thing. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, modern Hindu religious thought, all agree in declaring that there is one God, master and leader of all mankind, in unending conflict with cruelty, disorder, folly and waste. To my mind, it follows immediately {{that there can be no}} king, no government of any sort, which is not either a subordinate or a rebel government, a local usurpation, in the kingdom of God. But no organised religious body has ever had the courage and honesty to insist upon this. They all pander to nationalism and to powers and princes. They exists so to pander. Every organised religion in the world exists only to exploit and divert and waste the religious impulse in man.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of full adult employment with a minimal service sector put heavy burdens on urban households. By the 1980s {{both the public}} and the government recognized the burdens on urban households and the associated drain on the energies of workers, managers, and professionals. After 1985 more money was budgeted for housing and such municipal services as piped-in cooking gas. But state encouragement of the private or <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> sector had greater effect. Unemployed urban youth were permitted and sometimes advised to set up small restaurants or service establishments. Peasants were permitted to come into cities to sell produce or local products. Municipal authorities seemed to ignore the movement of substantial numbers of rural people into the urban service sector as peddlers, carpenters, and other skilled workers or, occasionally, as domestic workers. In the mid-1980s the Chinese press reported an influx of teenage girls from the country seeking short-term work as housekeepers or nannies. Like other rural migrants, they usually used ties with relatives or fellow villagers resident in the city to find positions.|$|E

Although it is frequently referred to as a "new " idea that "began " iu Denmark in the 1970 s (see McCamant & Durrett, 1988), socialized neighborhood design is anything but new, as Dolores Hayden's book, The Grand Domestic Revolution (1981), makes strikingly clear. In this highly readable chronicle, Hayden recounts the fascinating story of a two-generation movement of turn-of-the-century American feminists who strived to build neighborhoods with <b>collective</b> <b>services</b> such as conunon kitchens, dining rooms, laundries, day care centers, and the like. Their efforts, though similar to those of today's co-housing activists, were not motivated by the need to renew a sense of conununity or increase togetherness. Rather, these early feminists worked to create <b>collective</b> <b>services</b> in order to free women from the chains of domestic servitude.

40|$|Major "redevelopment" {{projects}} are being planned and {{undertaken by the}} Boston Housing Authority to reverse the "cycle of deterioration" threatening the existence of most of Boston's largest and oldest public housing developments. This thesis focuses on the West Broadway and Franklin Field Developments which have together been earmarked by State and Federal governments to receive a total of nearly $ 50 million for "redevelopment" programs. The central problem concerning this thesis {{is the lack of}} design and programmatic principles with which to apply not only the information generated by recent housing research but that of the <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> needs, capacities and responsibilities existing for present and future communities in public housing. The physical and social contexts as the West Broadway Development are examined as the bases for design and programmatic "propositions" generated to define the following "organizational elements": circulation hierarchy, residential clustering, service supports and facilities, and service facility clusters. The propositions are intended to provide explicit definition to existing and potential levels of resident organization and <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> responsibilities, levels which are seen as essential where residents are destined to become increasingly more involved in the management, maintenance and security of their non-private living environment. The "propositions" are then applied to the Franklin Field development to evaluate their generalizability outside a specific context. The application served both to illuminate a number of new opportunities for and constraints upon the use of the propositions and to distinguish general 'service zones' which represent relatively distinct sets of security and maintenance problems and associations between household clusters. A compilation of relevant excerpts from recent housing research literature is presented in the Appendices to supplement the analyses, and propositions forwarded for each of the main "organizational elements" as highlighted in the main chapters. by Rad Collier Acton.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{collective}} approach for harnessing the idle resources (cpu, storage, and bandwidth) of nodes (e. g., home desktops) distributed across the Internet. Instead of a purely peer-to-peer (P 2 P) approach, we organize participating nodes {{to act collectively}} using collective managers (CMs). Participating nodes provide idle resources to CMs, which unify these resources to run meaningful distributed services for external clients. We do not assume altruistic users or employ a barter-based incentive model; instead, participating nodes provide resources to CMs for long durations and are compensated in proportion to their contribution. In this paper we discuss the challenges faced by collective systems, present a design that addresses these challenges, and compare it with previous approaches. We show that the <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> model is a useful alternative to the pure P 2 P models. It provides more effective utilization of idle resources, has a more meaningful economic model, and is better suited for building legal and commercial distributed services...|$|E
40|$|E-home related home-services (including homecare {{and home}} healthcare) in China is {{urgently}} needed. The population of aged people over 80 is increasing 5 % {{every year in}} China, and to year 2050, one fourth of whole population or 0. 4 billions people in China are aged staying at home. Meanwhile the government cannot afford with a national elderly care system like most western countries as Sweden. This is because China has had one-child/one-family policy since 1970 ’s, and this radical policy has made China step in aged society very quickly within only 20 years, while the same process took 40 - 80 years in western countries. Even worse, China becomes aged society when the country is still poor and under developing with GDP per capita less than 1000 $, comparing to western countries with 5000 – 10000 $ when they became aged society. E-home provides China with a unique, and maybe the most effective solution to the problem. By applying effective IT&C at home, elder people are facilitated to manage their own daily life. If needed, they can always call help from their <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> centre that is located in their resident area and the <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> centre can provide with both homecare (cleaning, shopping, reparation, baby care etc.) and home healthcare (legitimate medical care). Elder people can be also monitored (if wished by all partners) {{both at home and}} out door by bearing sensors that can send singles directly to related care providers (including their children and relatives if wished). E-home will greatly increase the security of elder people, release great worry from both their children and elder people themselves, and can be afford by most people.

This project will continue to 2006, and one of the outputs will be a sustainable software platform which is based on a systemic study of social psychological factors involved in the home healthcare.

40|$|In our cities, both "land-use regulation" and "territorial {{collective}} services" {{have traditionally}} been guaranteed {{through the efforts of}} public administrations. In more recent times, greater space has been taken by different forms of private land-use regulation and <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> provision, that is, by "contractual communities". These contractual communities are territory-based organisational forms (prevalently - but not only - residential ones) by which members join {{on the basis of a}} contract unanimously accepted, and in light of the benefits it will guarantee them. The contract establishes a set of commitments (e. g., rules of cohabitation) and rights (e. g., the availability of a package of services) for the members. The literature on contractual communities (particularly on that specific form of contractual community that is represented by homeowners associations) so far consists largely of profoundly critical writings that raise numerous concerns about the phenomenon. Some other writers, on the contrary, have taken a wholly positive, acritical approach toward contractual communities. In this book a middle path is explored, one that aims to take a serious look at the phenomenon of contractual communities, and avoids taking an overly alarmist view while steering clear of equally unwarranted apologies. In the case of contractual communities there are both problems and opportunities. There is a genuine need for honest questioning and realistic responses. In this perspective the book propose a revised idea of the state role (and of the law role) that permits ample leeway for all possible forms of contractual community. The idea is that cases in which coercive action by a public agency was deemed indispensable have been unjustly overstated; whereas the potential of voluntary self-organising processes has been seriously understate...|$|E
40|$|Aims of the {{research}}: Our research aims {{to address}} children’ situations throughout their different living environments, with holding {{account of the}} various dimensions of their wellbeing. As such, the issue of continuity (or discontinuity) constitutes a key factor for wellbeing: consistency. Theoretical Framework: Our research relies on a socio-ecological approach to child wellbeing, {{with a focus on}} institutional issues. Methodology: Data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews from 50 parents and 33 professionals residing/or working inside one of four contrasted areas of the Brussels Region. These two groups of proxi were treated as experts. Content analyses were performed on each group. Ethical considerations: Conditions regarding participants’ consent, their freedom of speech, and the preservation of their anonymity were guaranteed. Main findings: Preschool services typically organize and unfold their activities around diverse learning experiences, which relate to four main issues of: rules and structure, peer socialization, autonomy, and self-expression. Through the experience of childcare, children are slowly sensitized to these issues, rendering the transition to preschool smoother; professionals do count on it. Yet our results show the increasing number of children experiencing preschool as their first <b>collective</b> <b>service.</b> Thus they face not one but all four issues at once: the transitional period can easily become a prolonged period of discomfort. An additional issue concerns the knowledge of French as a second/ or new language: in our study, most families not inclined to use childcare were not proficient in French. Implications for practice and/or policy: A better home/school transition could be addressed through quality practices relying on adapted training and curricula, generalized adaptation periods and relevant parents’ implication, but also through supportive policies such as guaranteed access to preschool from 2, 5 years old and lower child/staff ratios among early preschool classes. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{main purpose}} of this study was to compare the attitudes toward obese persons scale (ATOP) scores of the {{students}} in Physical Education and Sports School in terms of classes and some variables. Materials and Methods: Causal comparative Research method was used in this study. The study was performed 330 students (age: 22. 33 ± 2. 31) including 117 female and 213 male. In order to determine the attitudes toward obese persons ATOP scale developed by Alison et al. (1991) and validated for Turkish population (T-ATOP) by Dedeli et al. (2014) was used. All result was summarised by means of descriptive statistical techniques. Independent Sample T Test, Anova Test and Pearson Correlation Test were used for the suitable situation (Accepted significance level: p 0. 05. As a result of the Anova test, the T-ATOP scores of the four classes showed significant differences F(3, 326) = 6. 51, p< 0. 05. In relation to this result the T-ATOP scores of 4. class students was significantly higher than the other classes. This shows that 4. Class students have more positive attitudes towards obese than the other class. Conclusion: The main significant result of this study was that as the classes get higher, the attitude towards overweight and obese people changed positively. It can be considered that the students of Physical Education and Sports School have positive attitudes towards overweight and obese persons by being informed about the mechanism of obesity through their courses which directly or indirectly related to obesity during their undergraduate education. In addition to this courses, it can be thought that in the last year of undergraduate education, such as the practice of <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> application, internship, coaching practice, it is possible to create a chance to practice the theoretical knowledge practically, which may lead to students becoming more understanding of overweight obese persons they meet and to explain the sudden change of attitude in the positive direction...|$|E
