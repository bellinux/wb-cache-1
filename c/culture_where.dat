5|$|Nepenthes rajah, like {{virtually}} all {{species in the}} genus, is a scrambling vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (≤30mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. rajah does not produce runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue <b>culture,</b> <b>where</b> numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E
5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A <b>culture</b> <b>where</b> food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.|$|E

25|$|These {{differences}} {{could be}} explained by the collectivistic-individualistic culture continuum. In this case, these differences could reflect the extent of social networking typically seen in each culture. In an individualistic culture, this social networking is more diversified than in the collectivistic <b>cultures,</b> <b>where</b> family is generally the center of the network. Additionally, these differences could reflect the closeness of the interpersonal relationships in collectivistic <b>cultures,</b> <b>where</b> it can be difficult for individuals to recognize when the social sharing occurs because they are so often together.|$|R

25|$|Chimpanzees {{have been}} {{commonly}} stereotyped in popular <b>culture,</b> <b>where</b> {{they are most}} often cast in standardized roles as childlike companions, sidekicks or clowns. They are especially suited for the latter role on account of their prominent facial features, long limbs and fast movements, which humans often find amusing. Accordingly, entertainment acts featuring chimpanzees dressed up as humans have been traditional staples of circuses and stage shows.|$|E
