5|$|In children, the {{penicillamine}} test may be used. A 500 mg oral dose of penicillamine is administered, {{and urine}} <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours. If this {{contains more than}} 1600 μg (25 μmol), it is a reliable indicator of Wilson's disease. This test has not been validated in adults.|$|E
5|$|Suillus sibiricus is {{reportedly}} edible, {{but it is}} without any commercial or culinary value. It is one of over 200 species of mushrooms frequently <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> consumption in Nepal.

5|$|The {{issue of}} whether birds should {{continue}} to be actively <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> research {{has been the subject of}} some debate among ornithologists (examples of this can be found in the lively exchanges between Remsen and Bekoff & Elzanowski, between Vuilleumier and Donegan, and between Dubois & Nemesio and Donegan).|$|E

5|$|A choice edible species, Boletus aereus {{is highly}} {{appreciated}} in Southern Europe for its culinary qualities, {{and is considered}} by many to be gastronomically superior to Boletus edulis. In the vicinity of Borgotaro in the Province of Parma of northern Italy, the four species Boletus edulis, B.aereus, B.reticulatus (formerly known as B.aestivalis), and B.pinophilus have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed Fungo di Borgotaro. Here, these mushrooms have been collected and exported commercially for centuries. Throughout Spain, it is one of the wild edible fungi most commonly <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> the table, particularly in Aragon, where it is harvested for sale in markets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collects}} in the Book of Common Prayer {{are mainly}} translations by Thomas Cranmer (d. 1556) from the Latin prayers for each Sunday of the year.

At Evening Prayer the Collect of the Day {{is followed by a}} <b>Collect</b> <b>for</b> Peace which differs from the version used at Morning Prayer, and a <b>Collect</b> <b>for</b> Aid against Perils, which starts with the well known phrase; [...] "Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night...".|$|R

5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E
5|$|Corals are <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> the {{aquarium}} trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> {{interior}} furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but others argue {{that they were not}} completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the speeches, there are fifty-six prologues (openings of speeches). They were <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> the Library of Alexandria by Callimachus, who believed them genuine. Modern scholars are divided: some reject them, while others, such as Blass, believe they are authentic. Finally, six letters also survive under Demosthenes's name and their authorship too is hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, {{but this is}} not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to make it easy to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> the pet trade; but there is no evidence that populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
5|$|Polyozellus {{multiplex}} is edible, and is <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> sale in Asian {{countries such}} as Korea, Japan, and China. In North America, it is sometimes collected recreationally, and commercially. The taste is described as mild, and the odor as mild or aromatic. Mycologist David Arora claims the flavor to be inferior to Craterellus. Fruit bodies may be preserved by drying.|$|E

5|$|Route 413 {{begins at}} the state line, midway along the BurlingtonBristol Bridge, as a {{continuation}} of PA413. As the road descends from the bridge, a toll booth spans {{the width of the}} road though a toll is only <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> westbound traffic. The highway heads southward, heading along Keim Boulevard, and becomes maintained by Burlington County. For eastbound traffic, a right-in/right-out intersection with Veterans Drive is present while for westbound traffic, an exit for Reed Street is located before the toll booths. South of here, an oblong traffic circle, bisected by the River Line railroad, is found and has intersections with West Broad Street.|$|E
5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E

5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1867, and {{originally}} included a drawbridge section at its north end for tall ships to pass, {{though this was}} later replaced by the current swing bridge section. In 1980, woodworm threatened {{the safety of the}} bridge, which needed major repairs to avoid closure. Tolls were <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> foot and cycle traffic until 2013.

5|$|The largest {{recorded}} {{pitcher of}} N.rajah, measuring 41cm, {{was found on}} March 26, 2011, {{during a trip to}} Mesilau organised by The Sabah Society.

It was <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> preservation at Mesilau Headquarters. Another trap measuring 40cm was spotted on the same day. The previous record for a N.rajah pitcher was 38cm.|$|E
5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required a liver transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi <b>collected</b> <b>for</b> the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E
