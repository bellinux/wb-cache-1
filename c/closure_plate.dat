40|$|The ITER Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive (ECH&CD) Upper Launcher, whose {{preliminary}} design was approved in 2009, {{is on its}} way towards the final design. The design work is being done by a consortium of several European research institutes in tight collaboration with F 4 E. The main focus is the finalization of the design of all components for the First Confinement System (FCS), which forms the vacuum and Tritium barrier. The FCS comprises structural components as well as the external waveguide components in the port cell. Structural components of the FCS include the flange seal, backend frame and <b>closure</b> <b>plate.</b> The external waveguide components include the isolation valve, CVD diamond windows, miter bends and straight waveguides. Because finalizing of the design of these components is directly influenced by the layout of many in-vessel components, the design work includes also further development of the entire launcher. This paper summarizes the most recent status of the design work on the structural components of the launcher FCS, which are the support flange, the socket, the <b>closure</b> <b>plate</b> and feed-throughs for waveguides and cooling pipes. The design work includes the engineering layout of these components in accordance with system requirements, load specifications and Quality and Safety classification. An outline of the overall design of the launcher will be presented. The design progress was based on a set of related analyses, of which particular results are given.

During plasma operations, the IVVS is located beyond the vacuum vessel, with shielding blocks envisaged to protect components from neutron damage and reduce shutdown dose rate (SDR) levels. Analyses {{were conducted to}} determine the effectiveness of several shielding configurations. The neutron response of the system was assessed using global variance reduction techniques and a surface source, and shutdown dose rate calculations were undertaken using MCR 2 S.

For engineering feasibility, shielding blocks at bioshield level are to be avoided, however the port cell SDR field requires further consideration.

40|$|The {{design of}} the ITER ECRH system {{provides}} 20 &#xa 0;MW millimeter wave power for central plasma heating and MHD stabilization. The system consists of an array of 24 gyrotrons with power supplies coupled {{to a set of}} transmission lines guiding the beams to the four upper and the equatorial launcher. The front steering upper launcher design described herein has passed successfully the preliminary design review, and it is presently in the final design stage. The launcher consists of a millimeter wave system and steering mechanism with neutron shielding integrated into an upper port plug with the plasma facing blanket shield module (in-vessel) and a set of ex-vessel waveguides connecting the launcher to the transmission lines. Part of the transmission lines are the ultra-low loss CVD torus diamond windows and a shutter valve, a miter bend section and the feedthroughs integrated in the plug <b>closure</b> <b>plate.</b> These components are connected by corrugated waveguides and form together the first confinement system (FCS). In-vessel, the millimeter-wave system includes a quasi-optical beam propagation system including four mirror sets and a front steering mirror.

The firing test was being conducted {{to investigate a}} previous electrical malfunction. A number of cracks were found associated with the fuel closure plate/injector assembly (Fig 1). The firing test failure generated a flight constraint to the launch of STS- 133. A team comprised of several NASA centers and other research institutes was assembled to investigate and determine {{the root cause of}} the failure. The JSC Materials Evaluation Laboratory was asked to compare and characterize the outboard circumferential electron beam (EB) weld between the fuel <b>closure</b> <b>plate</b> (Titanium 6 Al- 4 V) and the injector (Niobium C- 103 alloy) of four different RCS thrusters, including the failed RCS thruster. Several metallographic challenges in grinding/polishing, and particularly in etching were encountered because of the differences in hardness, ductility, and chemical resistance between the two alloys and the bimetallic weld. Segments from each thruster were sectioned from the outboard weld. The segments were hot-compression mounted using a conductive, carbon-filled epoxy. A grinding/polishing procedure for titanium alloys was used [1]. This procedure worked well on the titanium; but a thin, disturbed layer was visible on the niobium surface by means of polarized light. Once polished, each sample was micrographed using bright field, differential interference contrast optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a backscatter electron (BSE) detector. No typical weld anomalies were observed in any of the cross sections. However, areas of large atomic contrast were clearly visible in the weld nugget, particularly along fusion line interfaces between the titanium and the niobium. This prompted the need to better understand the chemistry and microstructure of the weld (Fig 2). Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was used to confirm the chemical composition of the variations in contrast in these areas. Niobium alloys generally require exposure to more aggressive chemical reagents than titanium alloys for etching because of niobium s chemical resistance; therefore, the titanium portion of the sample was etched first. A five second immersion in Kroll s reagent revealed a general microstructure on the titanium portion of the sample; however, the titanium heat affected zone closest to the weld, was over-etched due to higher concentrations of refined grains and an increase in eta-phase. The Kroll s etchant also revealed some microstructure in the weld nugget itself; the niobium portion of the sample remained unetched...|$|E

Horses were fed 0 or 20 g live yeast daily from 8 to 24 months of age. Growth <b>plate</b> <b>closure</b> was evaluated by dorso- palmar X – ray imaging at baseline, second study at 12 months of age and finally at 24 months of age. Blood and urine samples were taken at the same time to evaluate bone and mineral metabolism parameters, serum phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, serum hydroxyproline. Calcium, magnesium and phosphorus urinary fractional excretion were calculated. Closure scales of distal radius growth plate data were compared using the Wilcoxon´s test; bone markers were compared using Student´s t-test. Baseline radiographs showed that in 84 % of foals the distal metacarpi were half closed or fully closed at 8 months; thus subsequent evaluations were limited to the distal radius. At 12 months of age, a positive but nonsignificant elevation in calcium urinary fractional excretion was observed in the supplemented group. At 24 months of age, radiographs showed a non-significant but positive effect in the live yeast group, with more than 50 % of foals having closed distal radius growth plates.

Cryogenic commissioning began mid-September, 1989, and continued to Cooldown, January 3, 1990. Cryogenic commissioning followed the construction and installation of the piping. The checkout was serial and problems found 'as we were going along'. There was a clear message to work in parallel and certify subsystems in advance of their need. Typical problems were VJ line external bellows and ball valves that were not He leak tight. The early preparations concentrated on the relief (singular) of the LAr 100, 000 I dewar (sound familiar?). About one month was lost to the refurbishing of valves. After commissioning the dewar they accepted four LAr transfers for a total of 15, 000 gallons, each in the range of 0. 4 - 0. 6 ppm O{sub 2 } measurement with equipment accurate to +/- 0. 1 ppm. As I watched, tests were concluding that qualified the Barrel calorimeter as having LAr with 0. 6 +/- 0. 1 ppm O{sub 2 } to the delight of those making the measurement. There was real satisfaction in the recent HV measurement that only 55 of 40, 000 channels had shorts. The ratio is essentially that predicted from the early module testing experience and another reason to celebrate. Twelve of the twenty-four Barrel feedthroughs flanges (one end, total is forty-eight) had been fitted with Pre-Amps and that installation seemed to be going very well. There are hermetic feedthroughs at the PV wall, a length of manganin wire in the vacuum space to a warm hermetic feedthrough flange that is double 'O' ring sealed in the vacuum vessel <b>closure</b> <b>plate.</b> The Pre-Amps mount directly to the atmospheric side of these feedthrough flanges.

The inside-the-LAC vessel instrumentation (RTD's and TC's) was sparse and had no redundancy. They would have provided more instrumentation and/or redundancy knowing what they know now. I asked questions designed to determine the time and effort necessary to pump the cryostat free of, especially, water. There didn't seem to be a clear answer to the question with the explanation that there was lots of pumping in support of the leak checking and the water was pumped along the way.

For any dog that was determined to have preexisting dysplasia, the least affected hip was selected for surgical intervention, since preexisting soft tissue laxity resulting from hip dysplasia is a known risk factor for dislocation after canine THA (Hayes et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the performance of male turkeys reared in either a low or high intensity lighting regimen. Turkeys were also subjected to the following four litter treatments: 1) hardwood shavings intensively managed; 2) hardwood shavings unmanaged; 3) rice hulls intensively man-aged; and 4) rice hulls unmanaged. Male turkeys reared in high intensity light (20 lx) had significantly heavier body weights, poorer feed to gain ratios, shorter tarsometatarsal bones, earlier growth <b>plate</b> <b>closure,</b> heavier testes, and were less active during the times of behavioral observations than male turkeys reared in low intensity light (2. 5 lx). The width of the tarsometatarsal bone, mortality, and the incidence of leg abnormalities and tibial dyschondroplasia were unaffected by lighting. Poor litter conditions or type of litter (hardwood shavings vs. rice hulls) {{had no effect on}} the performance of male turkeys.

40|$|AbstractStiffness {{properties}} of ski-boots in forward/backward flexion are fundamental in characterizing {{their level of}} performance considering {{that they have to}} transmit control loads from the skier to the skis. Despite their importance, the mechanical characterization of the ski-boots still lacks of a standardized laboratory method. Ski-boot behavior can be influenced by several factors in addition to their construction, such as buckles level of closure and environmental temperature. The aim of the present work was to measure the “in-vivo” bending moment and the shell/tibia angle at two temperature conditions and two levels of buckles <b>closure.</b> A force <b>plate,</b> a portable dynamometric ski plate and two biplanar electrogoniometers allowed measuring the above mentioned parameters during simulated forward flexions as well as during real skiing on the slope of an expert skier. This allowed producing synchronous data of ski-boot hinge bending moment and of shell/tibia angle during skiing sessions that were not yet available in the literature. Resultsconcerning the relationship between ankle bending moment and shell/tibia angle didn’t show a correspondence between simulated flexions and real skiing: these findings will require further investigations to lead to possible standard laboratory test procedures simulating the real skiing...|$|R
