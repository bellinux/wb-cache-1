This was associated with a casting defect hidden behind a surface skin of sound metal at the thickest part of the section where the flanges met the web. This was described by the accident report as a large honeycomb, or drawhole, which measured 3½ ins (c 90 mm) across at the face, and narrowed to about l½ ins (c 40 mm). inside , 2⅜ ins (c 60 mm) in extreme depth and 6ins (c 150 mm). in extreme length, extending inwards and downwards ...but not within 1 ½ ins of the outer face of the joint flange. The total capacity of the hole, measured by filling it with water, was 15 ½ cubic inches (about 250 ml) and, as the metal immediately round the hole was not sound, this amount does not measure the actual extent of the flaw. [...] There were other signs of poor foundry practice when the girder had been cast; honeycombing elsewhere, a <b>cold</b> <b>shut</b> (incomplete fusion between different streams of filling metal), and residual stresses in the girder web (as a consequence of which, when sample cores were being drilled for testing, the web (but not the flanges) fractured along the line of holes.
