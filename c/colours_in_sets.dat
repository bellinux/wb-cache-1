40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to Polish and Slovenian verbs. The text {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part {{presents}} the inventory of verbal units paraphrased with adjectives of colour. Verbs are concentrated around adjectives of <b>colour</b> <b>in</b> two <b>sets</b> (Polish & Slovenian). For example for adjective biały in their paraphrase the following verbs are mentioned: bielić; pobielić – pobielać; rozbielić – rozbielać; wybielić – wybielać; zabielić – zabielać. The Slovenian data consist the following lexems connected with adjective bel ‘biały’: beliti; obeliti, pobeliti, razbeliti, ubeliti. The second part of the article contains a derivational characteristic of chosen verbs. Functions of verbal prefixes are stressed. The shape of prefixes and their functions show many similarities in both languages. The third part concerns Semantic and Syntactic problems. The Predicate Argument Structure of causative predicates is taken under consideration. The causatives with adjectives of <b>colour</b> <b>in</b> paraphrase tend to express propositional arguments in nominalization...|$|R

40|$|Apparently-random {{distributions}} of <b>colours</b> <b>in</b> a discrete <b>setting</b> {{have been used}} by many artists and craftsmen in the past century. Manual colourisation is a tedious and difficult process. Automatic colourisation, on the other hand, tends not to not look ‘random’ to a human, as randomly-generated clusters and patterns stimulate human perception and break the appearance of randomness. We propose an algorithm that minimises these apparent patterns, making the distribution of colours look as if they have been distributed randomly by a human. We show that our approach is superior to current solutions, especially for small numbers of colours. Our algorithm is easily extendible to non-regular patterns in any coordinate system...|$|R

40|$|Colour naming {{consists}} of successfully finding the correspondence between colours as named by humans and the colour coordinates used by machine displays. Its successful implementation {{is crucial for}} human– machine interaction tasks, e. g. for the communication between service robots and humans. However, significant variability among human groups makes a general {{solution to this problem}} notoriously difficult. Qualitative models are appropriate in this context because they are robust in the presence of such variability. This paper contributes an approach to adapt the qualitative colour description (QCD) model to specific groups of users by gathering experimental data from them using a simple web interface. A classifier based on the geometric mean statistic is applied to adjust the correspondence between colour names and HSL coordinates in order to further approximate the QCD model to the common human colour understanding within the group. The usability of the resulting adapted model is evaluated by naming the predominant <b>colour</b> <b>in</b> a <b>set</b> of images extracted from Google searches. Results show that the refined QCD model can be used successfully to provide reference and grounding in human–machine communication. Finally, the elementary <b>colours</b> <b>in</b> the refined QCD wheel are also compared to other <b>colour</b> wheels <b>in</b> the literature.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a variation of}} the prototype combinatorial optimization problem known as graph colouring. Our optimization goal is to colour the vertices of a graph with a fixed number of <b>colours,</b> <b>in</b> a way to maximize the number of different <b>colours</b> present <b>in</b> the <b>set</b> of nearest neighbours of each given vertex. This problem, which we pictorially call palette-colouring, has been recently addressed as a basic example of a problem arising in the context of distributed data storage. Even though it has not been proved to be NP-complete, random search algorithms find the problem hard to solve. Heuristics based on a naive belief propagation algorithm are observed to work quite well in certain conditions. In this paper, we build upon the mentioned result, working out the correct belief propagation algorithm, which needs {{to take into account the}} many-body nature of the constraints present in this problem. This method improves the naive belief propagation approach at the cost of increased computational effort. We also investigate the emergence of a satisfiable-to-unsatisfiable 'phase transition' as a function of the vertex mean degree, for different ensembles of sparse random graphs in the large size ('thermodynamic') limit...|$|R

40|$|KUV 23182 + 1007 was {{identified}} as a blue object in the Kiso UV Survey in the 1980 s. Classification-dispersion spectroscopy showed a featureless continuum except for a strong emission line in the region of He II 4686 ˚A. This is a hallmark of the rare AM CVn class of cataclysmic variable star, so we have obtained a high-S/N blue spectrum of this object to check its classification. Instead, the spectrum shows a strong quasar-like emission line centred on 4662 ˚A. Comparison with the SDSS quasar template spectra confirms that KUV 23182 + 1007 is a quasar with a redshift of z = 0. 665. The Kiso Ultraviolet Survey (Noguchi, Maehara & Kondo 1980; Kondo et al. 1984) identified 1186 objects with blue <b>colours</b> <b>in</b> a <b>set</b> of fields observed using the 1. 0 m Schmidt telescope of Kiso Observatory.

Answering a conjecture of S. Thomassé, we express the exact value of r(H_n,m) (using Ramsey-numbers for finite digraphs), where H_n is Henson's countable universal homogeneous K_n-free graph. In turn, we deduce a new partition property of H_n regarding balanced embeddings of bipartite graphs: for any finite bipartite G with bipartition A,B, if the vertices of H_n are partitioned into two infinite classes then there is an induced copy of G in H_n such that the images of A and B are contained in different classes.
