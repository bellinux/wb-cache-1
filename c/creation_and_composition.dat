We present a new technique for allowing our physically-simulated planar biped characters to imitate human behaviors. Our contribution is twofold. We developed an optimization method that transforms any (either motion-captured or kinematically synthesized) biped motion into a physically-feasible, balance-maintaining simulated motion. Our optimization method allows us to collect a rich set of training data that contains stylistic, personality-rich human behaviors.

40|$|Blazars {{are thought}} to possess a {{relativistic}} jet that is pointing toward {{the direction of the}} Earth and the elect of relativistic beaming enhances its apparent brightness. They radiate in all wavebands from the radio to the gamma-ray bands via the synchrotron and the inverse Compton scattering process. Numerous observations are performed but the mechanism of variability, <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of jets are still controversial. We performed multi-wavelength monitoring with optical polarization for 3 C 66 A, Mrk 421, CTA 102 and PMN J 0948 + 0022 to investigate the mechanisms of variability and research the emission region in the relativistic jets. Consequently, an emergence of new emission component in flaring state is suggested in each object. The most significant aspect of these results is its wide range of sizes of emission regions from $ 10 ^{ 14 }- 10 ^{ 16 }$ cm, which implies the model with a number of independent emission regions with variety sizes and randomly orientation. The "shock-in-jet" scenario can explain high PD and direction of PA in each objects. It might reflect the common mechanism of flares in the relativistic jets.

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Siri {{is a small}} {{language}} {{intended to}} simplify the design and implementation of programs with graphical user interfaces such as those available for the Apple Macintosh. The interfaces for such programs are usually based on three concepts: accurate and appealing visual metaphors, interaction by direct manipulation, and immediate reflection {{of changes in the}} data. Programs based on these concepts are called reactive, after Alan Kay 2 ̆ 7 s Reactive Engine [Kay 69]. A well-designed reactive program maintains an internal model that is kept consistent with an end user model. The end user 2 ̆ 7 s model is created and modified by direct manipulation, using an input device such as a mouse to alter a visual representation. This puts the user in control, rather than the computer. Implementing reactive programs is difficult, due to computational mechanisms that are rarely supported in existing programming languages. Siri addresses these needs in a simple and uniform way. The declarative nature of Siri bypasses many issues of control flow; dependency networks and constraint satisfaction will transparently sequence updates. Siri 2 ̆ 7 s single abstraction mechanism, the constraint pattern, supports multiple object views simultaneously; seperate hierarchies for visual layout, encapsulation, and class/subclass; and multiple concurrent objects. In addition, Siri will provide a straightforward framework for <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of Siri programs using direct manipulation. 2 ̆...|$|E

40|$|Implementing a new {{information}} technology (IT) system often requires an enterprise to adopt many changes {{in order to}} exploit the full set of capabilities generated by the new system. However, the new IT system itself can often act {{as a barrier to}} change rather than as an enabler. The challenge in making sure that the new IT system serves as an enabler, rather than a barrier, to change requires the concurrent performance of three sets of activities with the aim of exploiting the synergies among them: redesign processes, develop and implement the system through a mix of internal talent and external suppliers, and involve the user community. Product Data Management (PDM) technology represents {{a substantial portion of the}} rather sizeable investment by industry in IT systems over the last decade. The selection, development, and deployment of PDM solutions were studied in the context of the aerospace industry, wherein data management (DM) is critical due to high product complexity and long system life cycles. A study of current PDM-related implementation experiences in nine different aerospace company sites highlights the difficulty in reaching PDM technology's full potential to deliver customer value.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the need to fast access resources, {{distributed}} almost everywhere on the planet, found in Web services a suitable solution for rapid and low cost <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of distributed applications. The benefits of this paradigm soon became clear also {{to the members of}} the GIS community who saw in this technology an effective way to rapidly share data between distributed and heterogeneous sources and to achieve spatial interoperability. Nevertheless, despite sharing the same philosophy, geospatial services standards and traditional Web services standards are quite different. In fact, although both types of services adopt XML as the underlying language to encode messages, metadata, schema and interfaces, the other core technologies are quite different and this aspect is crucial when trying to use another of the basic characteristics that make Web services such a widespread and adopted solution: the services composition. While this functionality is of interest to both W 3 C and the geographic community and a quite wide amount of work has been done towards the possibility of combining traditional Web services and geographic services, literature presents solutions where a standardized approach is not yet completely guaranteed, when different services are used in a composite application. This chapter will cover the issues mentioned above and highlight efforts made to try to overcome the corresponding challenges. In particular, it will also refer to a specific side effect of the service composition, related to the management of the large and flexible amount of data returned by a geographic service, which can cause bottlenecks when performance considerations are not taken into account in the design phase...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} ideas and the built works of four architects from different historical periods in order to distinguish and clarify {{some of the ways}} that the material qualities of architectural settings can be made manifest. Presenting a contextual approach to the understanding of material qualities, it counters two attitudes that prevail in contemporary architectural theory and practice: that design is either the <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of autonomous shapes (known as ‘form’), or the elaboration of the materials’ intrinsic qualities. A critique of this divided understanding is presented in the Introduction, together with a brief survey of its history, origins, examples, implications, and shortcomings. In the following four chapters, works of Vitruvius, Alberti, Le Corbusier, and Peter Zumthor are examined in order to describe and exemplify an alternative understanding that challenges the prevailing form-or-matter choice. Each of these figures is among the most prominent architects of their epochs and has been subject of extensive research. Nevertheless, the ways building materials are understood, treated, and defined in their works have not been given due attention. Moreover, certain convictions have prevailed in the available accounts, which have evaluated them from the viewpoint of a form-matter duality. This dissertation critically reviews these assumptions, and investigates and interprets the ways the materials are treated. While offering a theoretical investigation, it thereby adds a new dimension to the knowledge of their works and contributes to the historiography of the scholarship on these prominent figures. It shows that in these cases the ‘formal’ or ‘material’ questions were understood as two of the many aspects of buildings that bring to visibility the exchange of qualities between the building and its encompassing environment. In the settings they described and designed, forces are exchanged between a material and its milieu, revealing the latent qualities of the material and the setting over time. Demonstrating the presence and persistence of the notions of force, exchange, opposition, equilibrium, and environment (in the sense of the surrounding totality that consists of both natural and human influences), this research reveals the hitherto overlooked history of an environmental understanding of material qualities. ...|$|E
