However, the Council {{has been criticized for}} lacking teeth to act as a real check on potential legislative abuses.

Nevertheless, it forms part of the statutory framework for the People's Action Party [...] government's internationally lauded efforts in managing minority issues in multiethnic Singapore.

40|$|Communal {{violence}} {{is one of}} the deadliest forms of political violence in Nigeria. Research has yet to identify and explain the variation in spread and intensity of violence ‘within’ <b>communal</b> <b>conflicts.</b> This article analyses violence and non-violence in two almost contiguous neighbourhoods located in the city of Jos in central Nigeria that share ethnic, religious, and socio-economic similarities. It shows that structural factors such as geography, demography, or intervention by security forces do not predict non-violence. Rather, preventing killings during <b>communal</b> <b>conflicts</b> was contingent on civilian agency such as leadership, social control over internal youth, and refusal to collaborate with external armed groups. Drawing on narrative interviews, the article explores motivations for violence prevention and finds that knowledge concerning the organization of violence and lived experience in conflict zones were important factors that gave leaders the ability and confidence to persuade mobilized men not to start killings. These findings have important implications for the protection of civilians in <b>communal</b> <b>conflicts...</b>|$|R

Claims of [...] "sorcerer" [...] witches and [...] "supernatural" [...] witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often {{had nothing to do with}} <b>communal</b> <b>conflict,</b> but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.|$|E

40|$|Do {{different}} types of inequality spur violence with different targets? This article explores whom violent movements choose to target when they take to arms, by comparing civil conflicts, which target the state, to <b>communal</b> <b>conflicts,</b> which target other ethnic groups. Different types of ethnic group disadvantage relate to conflict through different mechanisms. Political exclusion is expected to promote the choice to target the central government rather than other ethnic groups, while economic disadvantages should {{increase the risk of}} both civil and <b>communal</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The different expectations stem from two important differences between political and economic horizontal inequalities: only the government has the authority to change the political distribution, while there can be many avenues to economic redistribution; and blame is more straightforwardly assigned to the government for political than for economic disadvantages. Statistical analysis of 155 politically relevant ethnic groups in Africa (1991 – 2009) provides support for both propositions...|$|R

40|$|Common {{notions about}} {{the source of}} <b>communal</b> land <b>conflict</b> in Africa have long {{explained}} it as growing out of conditions of environmental scarcity. This article argues instead that the institutional structure {{of the legal system}} is central to understanding which countries are prone to experience <b>communal</b> land <b>conflict.</b> When competing cus-tomary and modern jurisdictions coexist in countries inhabited by mixed identity groups, the conflicting sources of legal authority lead to insecurity about which source of law will prevail. Because the source of law is contested, con-flict parties cannot trust the legal system to predictably adjudicate disputes, which encourages the use of extrajudicial vigilante measures. Using new data on communal violence in West Africa, this argument is examined for the period 1990 – 2009. The results show that in countries where competing jurisdictions exist, <b>communal</b> land <b>conflict</b> is 200 – 350 % more likely. These findings suggest that researchers should consider the role of legal institutions and processes in relation to social unrest and collective violence...|$|R

The 96. 67 % of the respondents agreed that farmland was destroyed. Loss of material resources were, however, more widespread among farmers. Income loss had the highest relative incidence (92. 4 %) among the farmers, followed by loss of yields (81 %), household resources (46. 5 %) and farm stored products (37. 3 %).
