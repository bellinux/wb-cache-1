40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the degree to which students from an American-style Business School in Lebanon expect the managerial behaviors that they are taught in the classroom to actually be applied by managers in the Lebanese workplace. Broadly categorized as accountability, gender equity, religious tolerance, <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>transparency,</b> the authors found little indication that such expectations existed. Even when they could be identified such as with racial equality, their relative strength was so weak that they were barely above neutral on a 10 -point scale. What was perhaps most troubling was that expectation for the elimination of bribery and corruption actually declined as students matriculated through the curriculum. At least for the time being, it appears that Lebanese business students do not anticipate encountering American-style management practices, which have formed the core of the Business courses, when they enter the workforce.

30|$|Classroom {{assessment}} {{tasks and}} environment {{are central to}} supporting student learning, yet are under-studied at the tertiary level, especially in China’s test-driven culture. This study explores the relationship between students’ perceptions of assessment tasks and classroom assessment environment, within the university context of teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) in China. A questionnaire was designed and administered, based on Dorman & Knightley’s (2006) Perceptions of Assessment Tasks Inventory (PATI) and Alkharusi’s (2011) scale, {{in order to measure}} students’ perceptions of the classroom assessment environment. PATI includes five subscales: congruence with planned learning, authenticity, student <b>consultation,</b> <b>transparency,</b> <b>and</b> diversity. Alkharusi’s scale comprises two subscales: learning-oriented classroom assessment environment and performance-oriented classroom assessment environment. Participants were 620 university students from three universities in China. The factor analysis findings identified the original five-factor PATI, and Alkharusi’s two-factor scales within this Chinese research context. Multiple regression analyses exploring the interrelationship showed that congruence with planned learning, authenticity, student <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> significantly predicted the learning-oriented classroom assessment environment, explaining 48  % of the variance. Congruence with planned learning <b>and</b> student <b>consultation</b> negatively, <b>and</b> diversity positively, predicted the performance-oriented classroom assessment environment, explaining 12  % of the variance. The findings highlight the two core values in classroom assessment tasks: congruence with planned learning <b>and</b> student <b>consultation</b> in mediating the classroom environment. This study addresses the research gap in our limited understanding of the relationship between classroom assessment tasks and assessment environment, and aids teachers in structuring their day-to-day classroom assessment practices in support of their students’ learning.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effects of}} the Skills Development Act 97 of 1998 on transforming municipal management training and development. The pre- 1994 education and training was premised on the policy of separate development. This policy prevented the majority of the people, mainly blacks, from receiving adequate training and development. Resultantly, training and development in South Africa have assumed significance since the adoption of a constitutional democracy, especially at the local government sphere which constitutes the coalface of service delivery. Investment in human resources training and development at management level is imperative for institutions to gain strategic and operational advantage. Analysis and interpretation of data in this study were undertaken through official document analysis, interviews and structured questionnaires. The major findings of the study indicate that according to the first objective the majority of respondents are qualified as they possess higher education qualifications due to the assistance of the municipality, with nearly half currently involved in furthering their studies. As far as the second objective is concerned, the researcher found out that the majority disagree with the statement that opportunities are created to motivate employees to use the workplace as an active learning environment to acquire new skills. Further analysis and interpretation of data show that according to the third objective the majority of respondents do not undertake crucial management courses relevant to the workplace. Final data analysis and interpretation of the fourth objective reveal that the majority of respondents are not aware of the support and financial investment in education, training and development of municipal officials, due to aspects such as lack of <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>transparency.</b> Public Administration <b>and</b> ManagementM.

40|$|Grounded in the {{qualitative}} tradition, {{the aim of}} this study was to explore how principals perceive the processes governing, tensions inherent in and consequences, of the secularisation of public schools in South Africa, against the backdrop of the old apartheid system. Principals are key informants who bridge the gap between the political arena and the individuals who are affected at the implementation level and therefore provide a valuable lens through which the process of secularisation can be explored. Eight principals, who had been in this position of leadership for at least eight years, participated in semi-structured interviews, which were then subjected to a thematic content analysis. Principals perceived the process as characterised by a lack of <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>transparency,</b> with no clear guidelines provided to them and no follow-through from the education ministry. They also perceived tensions in the manner in which principals continued to embrace Christian principles in the management of their schools. Tolerance and respect of different religions were identified as positive outcomes of secularisation but these were perceived to have been offset by the negative consequences of a moral collapse, an ungovernable school and a loss of identity among the students. Through exploring the nature of key socialising agents, in the educational arena, it became evident that the participants often conceptualised themselves as martyrs and perceived parents as morally neglectful. The changing role of the school, as an agent of religious education, was also explored. Overall, all the principals strongly agreed that despite the good intentions of the government in fostering a democratic society, the impact of secularisation had resulted in some unintended effects, including a negative impact on the moral development of the students. In sum they perceived that the negative consequences of secularisation outweighed the promises of the government’s overall secularisation vision...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{strategies}} being employed by post-conflict countries in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We argue that to attain these goals, these countries will need to alter the way they undertake development planning. Rather than design strategies to achieve best outcomes with limited resources, reaching the MDGs will require that governments identify what resources are {{needed in order to}} meet the agreed ambitious objectives. In post conflict circumstances, as evident in Liberia and Sierra Leone (the two countries we examine), three particular challenges to achieving the goals stand out: a history of economic reversals, extremely weak institutional capacity, and popular distrust of government. We argue that rather than treat these features as a limiting factor on development, they should be integrated within development strategies, by including them among the needs to be met as part of an MDG strategy and by adopting strategies that draw on considerably more ambitious models of <b>consultation,</b> information dissemination <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> than are presently being employed...|$|R

40|$|Background Drugs {{policy is}} made in a {{politically}} charged atmosphere. This is often not seen to be conducive to the ideals of evidence-based policymaking. In the UK over recent years {{the efficacy of the}} 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) {{has been one of the}} most widely discussed and debated areas of UK drug policy. Since inception, the MDA 1971 has remained relatively stable with very few drugs moving up or down the scale and until recently, and with very few exceptions, there has been little public debate on the nature of the system. This changed in the run up to the cannabis reclassification in 2004 from class B to class C, through the reverse of this decision in 2009 and the fallout between the Government of the time and leading members of the Advisory Council of the Misuse of Drugs. Methods Based on wide-ranging survey of the literature and secondary analysis of various official publications and academic commentaries, this paper considers what the cannabis episode can tell us about the current state of UK drug policy governance. Results Previous research on drug policy governance has suggested that policy goals should be clearly articulated so as to avoid confusion over what constitutes evidence, decision-makers should be ‘evidence-imbued’ and there should be widespread <b>consultation</b> with, <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> of, stakeholder engagement. The interpretation here is that recent changes to cannabis legislation reveal that these aspects of good governance were called into question although there were fleeting moments of good practice. Conclusion The use of evidence in drug policy formulation continues to be bedevilled by political stalemate and reluctance to countenance radical reform. Where evidence does play a role it tends to be at the margins. There are, however, potential lessons to be learned from other policy areas but this requires a more pragmatic attitude on behalf of decision-makers...|$|R
