25|$|Of {{paramount}} {{importance to the}} designers was {{that the story of}} the film be treated as sacrosanct – nothing the player <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the game can ever alter, contradict or in any way run contrary to what happens in the film. David Yorkin, Bud's son, and David Leary worked on the game's script, initially writing it as a linear game. However, the designers wanted the game to feature a great deal of random elements, with the idea being that no two playthroughs would be the same, and no walkthrough would be able to cover every possible eventuality or every possible combination of random events. The game presents the player with fifteen suspects, but only two are always replicants (Clovis and a cook named Zuben). Which of the other thirteen characters is a replicant is randomized every time the player plays the game, and their behavior is different each playthrough based upon {{whether or not they are}} human. Due to the random nature of the game, the script swelled to 500 pages, and the quality assurance people had to play through the game 2,500 times to experience every possible variation.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

500|$|Even the {{characters}} have Virgilian counterparts, with Booth being comparable to Aeneas and Miss Mathews Fielding's version of Dido. Fielding does not {{shy away from}} such comparisons, but embraces them with {{his use of the}} line [...] "Furens quid Foemina possit" [...] (translated as [...] "what a woman <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> frenzy"), in Book IV, Chapter Five; this line is directly taken from the Aeneid. Likewise, Fielding's bailiff misstates Virgil's [...] "dolus an virtus, quis in hoste requirat" [...] (translated as [...] "whether deceit or valour, who would ask in the enemy") when he says [...] "Bolus and Virtus, quis in a Hostess equirit" [...] in Book VIII, Chapter One. However, these are not the only quotes, and Fielding cites many passages of Latin and Greek while not providing direct translations for them. To these Virgilian parallels, Samuel Richardson claimed that Fielding [...] "must mean Cotton's Virgil Travestied; where the women are drabs, and the men scoundrels." ...|$|E

The song alongside [...] "Hang with Me" [...] {{were among the first}} songs to be recorded for the Body Talk series, and Robyn said that she saved them for a later release because [...] " [...] knew they would be singles, or could be singles, and [...] wanted them to get that chance." [...] Robyn described the song to The Macomb Daily as [...] "a love song ... about what you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> a club". In an interview with MTV News, she elaborated on the song's theme and message, saying, [...] "I think 'Indestructible' is a song that talks about what happens when you meet new people and fall in love, and how that can be scary and fun at the same time." ...|$|E

Before we knew it we couldn't wait to see Swanson's reactions to the slightest of problems." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN was critical of Ron {{at the start of}} the show, and called him [...] "a bit of the dud (who) offers little to the show, and almost just stand to sour the whole thing." [...] However, by the second season, Fowler said the character had improved and became [...] "an absolute stand-out in the series." [...] Several reviewers have praised the platonic relationship between Ron and Leslie, which has been compared to that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant in The Mary Tyler Moore Show.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Ferguson {{confirmed}} that Pogba would feature with the senior team during the season, stating, [...] "I mean if we hold Pogba back, what's going to happen?

[...] Pogba was promoted to the club's reserve team permanently for the 2011–12 season and made his first appearance of the season on 15 August 2011 in the team's opening Premier Reserve League match against Arsenal. On 25 August, in the team's second league match against Swansea City reserves, Pogba scored the second goal in a 6–0 rout. On 19 September, he was named to the first team to participate in their Football League Cup tie against Leeds United the following day, with Ferguson proclaiming, [...] "I intend to play him [...] against Leeds United." [...] Pogba appeared as a half-time substitute to make his professional debut as Manchester United won the match 3–0. Pogba made his second appearance against Aldershot Town in the Fourth Round of the League Cup on 25 October 2011.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's first {{performance}} of [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was on The MDNA Tour (2012) as the concert's opening track. The performance was choreographed by Jason Young and Alison Faulk, along with dancer Derrell Bullock, who assisted as supervisor. According to Faulk, Madonna asked Bullock {{to experiment with}} the concept of [...] "girl gone wild", {{and come up with a}} routine and style of his own. He wanted to find a story with the dancing and presented his moves to Madonna the next day. The singer also wanted to experiment {{with the concept of}} Catholic church, along with monks and gargoyles. Her message behind it was that of freedom, [...] "people getting to do whatever they wanted to". Four dancers from Brooklyn, adept at bone breaking dance, were enlisted as backup crew for the performance. Young recalled that they could [...] "create these abstract, very animalistic shapes. What they can do with their arms is unbelievable. Anything that most people <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> front of their bodies, they do it behind their bodies." [...] The dancing required the boys to put on heels like Kazaky in the music video. Most of them refused to abide by it, resulting in Madonna giving them a choice to put the heels and dance or leave the show. The dancers complied and learned the choreography.|$|E

The {{performance}} consisted of her breaking two dancers out of glass boxes, an elaborate dance routine and two appearances from Pitbull. Initially he appeared from the crowd, but for his second appearance, {{he arrived at the}} back of the stage via a moving staircase. Lopez was dressed in a [...] "glimmering ensemble" [...] while the set included lasers and pyrotechnics. According to Adam Graham from MTV, the performance was taped prior to the episode of Idol, made apparent by what Graham called [...] "sloppy editing." [...] According to The Hollywood Reporter, Lopez pretaped the performance due to a perceived danger of flying shards of glass from the earlier part of the routine. The performance was praised by Caryn Ganz from Yahoo! Music, who compliment all of the element of the performance. Ganz said [...] " [...] lush production values to her own high energy dancing and live vocals ... This performance maxed out what an artist <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> such a medium – awesome lighting, high-impact video footage, a strong feature from Pitbull, excellent staging, solid choreography, a bit of pyro, and a ton of warmth and personality." [...] An editor from Rap-Up magazine agreed, saying that [...] "Lopez showed the contestants how its done, commanding the stage during her smashing performance." ...|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{wrote that}} the season was [...] "experimental" [...] in that the series' writers and {{storyboard}} artists [...] "continue to experiment with what they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> 10 minutes". He specifically cited the plots from the season openers, [...] "All the Little People", and [...] "Shh!" [...] as examples, and applauded {{the fact that the}} series was willing to explore different styles of animation, such as in the installment [...] "A Glitch is a Glitch". Rich Goldstein of The Daily Beast argued that the emotional depth of the series increased during this season, highlighting [...] "Simon & Marcy" [...] as an example. Emily Guendelsberger of The A.V. Club later awarded the entire season an [...] "A", noting that [...] "Adventure Time has somehow managed to stay on fire for its fifth season's double-wide 52-episode run." [...] Guendelsberger praised the show's aforementioned creativity and experimentation, and also wrote that [...] "the writing staff has also taken the less-obvious X-Files approach: expanding the length of the stories they're able to tell by linking monster-of-the-week episodes into longer arcs." [...] The A.V. Club later named the series the 27th best television series of 2014, noting that, [...] "The end of the super-sized season five saw a string of conceptually ambitious episodes that blew the world of Ooo wide open, deepening the stories of Lemongrab, Lumpy Space Princess' doomed romance, and Ice King's past as Simon Petrikov." [...] The site selected [...] "Lemonhope" [...] as the stand-out from the season's end. Each episode was also graded by The A.V. Club with a different letter grade; the season received four C's, twenty B's, and twenty-six A's.|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E
