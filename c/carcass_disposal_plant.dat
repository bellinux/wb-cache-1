3000|$|Germany is an {{industrial}} country. Building and extending industrial facilities {{as well as}} building and extending infrastructure are given high political priority, {{but they also have}} been bringing numerous opponents into the arena for decades. In Germany, 775 approval procedures for new projects and industrial facilities with formalised public participation with regard to environment protection are carried out every year. 1 There are basically two types of procedures, the authorisation process according to the Federal Immission Control Act for the approval of industrial facilities and the planning permission procedure for infrastructure projects. The authorisation procedure for industrial facilities covers the building or the extension of lignite- or hard-coal-fired power plants, wind power plants, plants for the production of fertilizers, waste incineration <b>plants,</b> <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>plants,</b> pig and poultry farms, biogas plants, etc. 2 In North Rhine–Westphalia alone, the federal state with the largest number of industrial facilities in Germany, every year 900 – 1100 permissions for large or small industrial facilities are granted. 3 [...]...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{practical}} method to establish effluent limitations for priority water pollutants (PWPs) from industrial facilities was developed. As a case study, we collected influent and effluent wastewater samples from a terminal <b>disposal</b> <b>plant</b> for wastewater in Ulsan, Korea. Five water quality parameters and 17 PWPs were analyzed, and their discharge loads {{to the terminal}} <b>disposal</b> <b>plant</b> were calculated. In addition, the treatment efficiencies of PWPs were estimated by measuring concentrations and flow rates using the direct calculation method and the Monte Carlo simulation. If treatment efficiencies of PWPs are higher than 20 %, the effluent limitations for industrial facilities can be maintained or relaxed {{in comparison with the}} Ministry of Environment (MOE) limitations for terminal <b>disposal</b> <b>plants.</b> Furthermore, a range of effluent limitations for the industrial facilities with various operating conditions of the terminal <b>disposal</b> <b>plant</b> (0 - 100 %) were suggested.

40|$|Background and Aim: Environmental impacts from carcass {{management}} {{are a significant}} concern globally. Despite a history of costly, ineffective, and environmentally damaging <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> efforts, large animal <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> methods have advanced little in the past decade. An outbreak today will likely be managed with the same <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> techniques used in the previous decades and will likely result in the same economic, health, and environmental impacts. This article overviews the results of one field test that was completed in Virginia (United States) using the aboveground burial (AGB) technique and the disposal of 111 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) infected sheep in Tunisia using a similar methodology. Materials and Methods: Researchers in the United States conducted a field test to assess the environmental impact and effectiveness of AGB in decomposing livestock carcasses. The system design included a shallow trench excavated into native soil and a carbonaceous base placed {{on the bottom of}} the trenches followed by a single layer of animal carcasses. Excavated soils were subsequently placed on top of the animals, and a vegetative layer was established. A similar methodology was used in Tunisia to manage sheep infected with FMDs, Peste des Petits Ruminants virus, and Bluetongue Virus. Results: The results of the field test in the United States demonstrated a significant carcass degradation during the 1 -year period of the project, and the migration of nutrients below the carcasses appears to be limited thereby minimizing the threat of groundwater contamination. The methodology proved practical for the disposal of infected sheep carcasses in Tunisia. Conclusions: Based on the analysis conducted to date, AGB appears to offer many benefits over traditional burial for catastrophic mortality management. Ongoing research will help to identify limitations of the method and determine where its application during large disease outbreaks or natural disasters is appropriate...|$|R

40|$|Livestock mortalities {{represent}} a major waste stream within agriculture. Many different methods are {{used throughout the}} world to dispose of these mortalities; however within the European Union (EU) disposal options are limited by stringent legislation. The legal disposal options currently available to EU farmers (primarily rendering and incineration) are frequently negatively perceived on both practical and economic grounds. In this review, we assess the potential environment impacts and biosecurity risks associated {{with each of the}} main options used for disposal of livestock mortalities in the world and critically evaluate the justification for current EU regulations. Overall, we conclude that while current legislation intends to minimise the potential for on-farm pollution and the spread of infectious diseases (e. g. Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, bacterial pathogens), alternative technologies (e. g. bioreduction, anaerobic digestion) may provide a more cost-effective, practical and biosecure mechanism for <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> as well as having a lower environmental footprint. Further social, environmental and economic research is therefore warranted to assess the holistic benefits of alternative approaches for <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> in Europe, with an aim to provide policy-makers with robust knowledge to make informed decisions on future legislation...|$|R

Rail was more comfortable and had less rolling resistance than street traffic on granite block or macadam and horse-drawn streetcars were, in most places, a step up from horsebus: faster, more sanitary, and cheaper to run; electric traction was much more so, with the cost, excreta, epizootic risk, and <b>carcass</b> <b>disposal</b> of horses eliminated entirely. Obsolete streetcars were later seen as obstructions to traffic, but for nearly 20 years they had the highest power-to-weight ratio of anything commonly found on the road, and the lowest rolling resistance.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, several episodes of {{atmospheric}} pollution {{have been reported in}} a limited area near Guidonia, Rome. The area contains a <b>disposal</b> <b>plant,</b> Inviolata, for the collection of municipal solid waste (MSW) and a famous thermal water resort, the Acque Albule spring, which is a source of water rich in H 2 S. We conducted a multiparametric study in the areas surrounding the solid waste <b>disposal</b> <b>plant</b> and the Acque Albule spring. The concentration of main gaseous effluent was continuously monitored over a period of 4 months and the data relating to the meteorologic conditions in the area during {{the last few}} decades were examined. Our results suggest that most of the atmospheric pollution is due to the interaction of different gaseous effluents. Specifically, the presence of relatively high levels of hydrogen sulfide in the atmosphere, constantly released in large amounts by the Acque Albule springs, and of biogases (mainly hydrocarbons) from the organic matter present in the solid waste continuously unloaded and stored at the <b>disposal</b> <b>plant,</b> lead to mixing and photochemical interactions between these chemical compounds, which in turn are responsible for most of the polluting effects. Such interactions are promoted by the strong solar irradiation in the area that is enhanced by the peculiar local meteorological features that do not allow the pollutants to disperse...|$|R
