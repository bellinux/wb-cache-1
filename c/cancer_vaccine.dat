40|$|Abstract: Cancer related {{deaths have}} shown a {{progressive}} increase {{over the past decade}} and the newer cases of cancers are estimated to rise in 2030. The current treatment modalities available for cancer are highly toxic, impair quality of life and develop resistance with course of time. Thus, there is a growing necessity for the prevention and cure of cancer related morbidity and mortality. One of the promising approaches for cancer prevention could be immunization with specific vaccines. The latest advances in immunology have {{led to the development of}} effective <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> to enhance immunity against tumour cells. Moreover, the occurrence of cancer with infectious agents like Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Human Papilloma virus (HPV) as well as their prevention with specific <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> has further confirmed the role of immunotherapy in <b>cancer.</b> Though prophylactic <b>vaccines</b> are found to be more successful in cancer prevention, in the present scenario most of the vaccines under development are therapeutic <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines.</b> <b>Cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> stimulate the immune system and attack specific cancer cells without harming the normal cells. The major <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> under development to target tumour cells includes antigen vaccines, whole cell tumour vaccines, dendritic cell vaccine, viral vectors, DNA vaccines and idiotype vaccines. Apart from this, measures to produce patient-specific <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> from patients own tumour cells and a "universal " vaccine to provide immunity against cancer cells of any origin are being investigated. Hence this review gives an overview of various strategies involved in the development of <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> and the currently approved vaccines available for the prevention of cancer...|$|R
40|$|Chemotherapy {{has been}} a {{mainstay}} in cancer treatment for many years. Despite some success, the cure rate with chemotherapy remains unsatisfactory in some types of cancers, and severe side effects from these treatments are a concern. Recently, understanding of the dynamic interplay between the tumor and immune system {{has led to the}} development of novel immunotherapies, including <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines.</b> <b>Cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> have many advantageous features, but their use has been hampered by poor immunogenicity. Many developments have increased their potency in pre-clinical models, but <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> continue to have a poor clinical track record. In part, this could be due to an inability to effectively overcome tumor-induced immune suppression. It had been generally assumed that immune-stimulatory <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> could not be used in combination with immunosuppressive chemotherapies, but recent evidence has challenged this dogma. Chemotherapies could be used to condition the immune system and tumor to create an environment where <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> have a better chance of success. Other types of immunotherapies could also be used to modulate the immune system. This review will discuss how immune modulation by chemotherapy or immunotherapy could be used to bolster the effects of <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these treatments...|$|R

25|$|Many parents {{opposed to}} {{providing}} the HPV vaccine to their pre-teens agree the vaccine {{is safe and}} effective, but find talking to their children about sex uncomfortable. Dr. Elizabeth Lange, of Waterman Pediatrics in Providence, RI, addresses this concern by emphasizing what the vaccine is doing for the child. Dr. Lange suggests parents {{should focus on the}} cancer prevention aspect without being distracted by words like 'sexually transmitted'. Everyone wants cancer prevention, yet here parents are denying their children a form of protection {{due to the nature of}} the cancer—Lagne suggests that this much controversy would not surround a breast cancer or colon <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The HPV vaccine is suggested for 11-year-olds because it should be administered before possible exposure to HPV, yes, but also because the immune system has the highest response for creating antibodies around this age. Dr. Lange also emphasized the studies showing that the HPV vaccine does not cause children to be more promiscuous than they would be without the vaccine.|$|E
40|$|Objectives The sub-acute toxic effects {{following}} repetitive {{intramuscular injection}} of two cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> newly developed against human papillomaviruse (HPV) 16 / 58 / 18 and HPV 16 were investigated in female ICR (CrljOri: CD 1) mice, and the no-observedadverse- effect-level (NOAEL) of the cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> was estimated. Methods Female ICR mice (n= 15 in each group) {{were exposed to}} a 1 : 1 mixture of two cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> by repetitive intramuscular injection (once a week, 5 times) for 5 weeks. Mortality, body weight, organ weight, hematological/biochemical parameters, and histopathological effects were examined at different concentrations (0, 1 × 108, 5 × 108, and 2. 5 × 109 copies/animal) of the cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Results The cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>vaccines</b> did not show toxic responses for body weight, absolute/ relative organ weight, hematological/biochemical parameters, or histopathological parameters. Conclusions Female ICR mice exposed to <b>vaccines</b> for cervical <b>cancer</b> did not show any toxic response.
